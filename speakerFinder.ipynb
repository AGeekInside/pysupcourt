And the Federal government has always\\nhandled that and has never before -- and we believe this\\nis why it's unconstitutional -- separated out a class of\\nmarried gay couples solely because they were gay.\\nJUSTICE ALITO: Just -- if I could follow up\\n\", 'JUSTICE KAGAN': 'Section 3 of DOMA, the problem is an equal protection\\nproblem from the point of view of the United States.\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Yes, but General, surely the\\n', 'JUSTICE KENNEDY': \"concerns come into play in the following way in that Mr.\\nClement has made the argument that, look, whatever\\nStates can do in terms of recognizing marriage or not\\nrecognizing marriage, the Federal government has\\ncommensurate authority to do or not do. We don't think\\nthat's right as a matter of our equal protection\\nanalysis because we don't think the Federal government\\nshould be thought of as the 51st State.

Well, if it is, then all States have to\\nhave something like pacts. And if they have to have\\nsomething like pacts, then you say then they also have\\nto allow marriage.\\nSo then are you not arguing they all have to\\nallow marriage? And then you say no. All right, so\\nwith that point -\\nGENERAL VERRILLI: But our point here,\\n\", 'CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS': 'applying rational basis to DOMA, I think that there are\\nmany rational bases that support it. And the Solicitor\\nGeneral says, well -- you know, the United States is not\\nthe 51st State to be sure, but the Federal government\\nhas interests in uniformity that no other entity has.\\nAnd we heard today that there\\'s a problem\\nwhen somebody moves from New York to North Carolina,\\nthey can lose their benefits. The Federal government\\nuniquely, unlike the 50 States, can say, well, that\\ndoesn\\'t make any sense, we are going to have the same\\nrule. We don\\'t want somebody, if they are going to be\\ntransferred in the military from West Point to Fort Sill\\nin Oklahoma, to resist the transfer because they are\\ngoing to lose some benefits.\\nIt makes sense to have a uniform Federal\\nrule for the Federal government. It is not so anomalous\\nthat the term \"marriage\" is defined in the U.S. Code.\\nThe very next provision of the Dictionary Act defines\\n\"child.\" These terms, although they are the primary\\nprovince of State governments, do appear in multiple\\nFederal statutes and it\\'s a Federal role to define those\\nterms.\\nThe last point I would simply make is in\\nthinking about animus, think about the fact that\\nCongress asked the Justice Department three times about\\nthe constitutionality of the statute. That\\'s not what\\nyou do when you are motivated by animus. The first two\\ntimes they got back the answer it was constitutional.\\nThe third time, they asked again in the wake of Romer,\\nand they got the same answer, it\\'s constitutional.\\nNow the Solicitor General wants to say,\\nwell, it was want of careful reflection? Well, where do\\nwe get careful reflection in our system? Generally,\\ncareful reflection comes in the democratic process. The\\ndemocratic process requires people to persuade people.\\nThe reason there has been a sea change is a\\ncombination of political power, as defined by this\\nCourt\\'s cases as getting the attention of lawmakers,\\ncertainly they have that. But it\\'s also persuasion.\\nThat\\'s what the democratic process requires. You have\\nto persuade somebody you\\'re right. You don\\'t label them\\na bigot. You don\\'t label them as motivated by animus.\\nYou persuade them you are right.\\nThat\\'s going on across the country.\\nColorado, the State that brought you Amendment 2, has\\njust recognized civil unions. Maine, that was pointed\\nto in the record in this case as being evidence of the\\npersistence of discrimination because they voted down a\\nstatewide referendum, the next election cycle it came\\nout the other way.\\nAnd the Federal Congress is not immune.\\nThey repealed \"Don\\'t Ask, Don\\'t Tell.\" Allow the\\ndemocratic process to continue.\\nThank you, Your Honor.\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you, counsel,\\n', 'MS.
