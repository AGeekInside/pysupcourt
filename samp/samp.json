COOPER\nON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS\nMR. COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nNew York's highest court, in a case similar\nto this one, remarked that until quite recently, it was\nan accepted truth for almost everyone who ever lived in\nany society in which marriage existed. Marriage -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Cooper, we have\njurisdictional and merits issues here. Maybe it'd be\nbest if you could begin with the standing issue.\nMR. COOPER: I'd be happy to,\nMr. Chief Justice.\nYour Honor, the official proponents of\nProposition 8, the initiative, have standing to defend\nthat measure before this Court as representatives of the\npeople and the State of California to defend the\nvalidity of a measure that they brought forward.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Have we ever granted\nstanding to proponents of ballot initiatives?\nMR. COOPER: No, Your Honor, the Court has\nnot done that, but the Court has never had before it a\nclear expression from a unanimous State's high court\nthat -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, this is -- this\nis -- the concern is certainly, the proponents are\ninterested in getting it on the ballot and seeing that\nall of the proper procedures are followed, but once it's\npassed, they have no proprietary interest in it. It's\nlaw for them just as it is for everyone else. So how\nare they distinguishable from the California citizenry\nin general?\nMR. COOPER: They're distinguishable, Your\nHonor, because the Constitution of the State of\nCalifornia and its election code provide, according to\nthe unanimous interpretation of the California Supreme\nCourt, that the official proponents, in addition to the\nother official responsibilities and authorities that\nthey have in the initiative process, that those official\nproponents also have the authority and the\nresponsibility to defend the validity of that\ninitiative -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I guess the attorney\ngeneral of this State doesn't have any proprietary\ninterest either, does he?\nMR. COOPER: No, Your Honor, nor did -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But -- but he can defend\nit, can't he -\nMR. COOPER: -- nor did -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- because the law says he\ncan defend it.\nMR. COOPER: That's right, Your Honor. Nor\ndid the legislative leaders in the Karcher case have -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Could the State -\nMR. COOPER: -- any particular enforcement -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: -- could -- could the State\nassign to any citizen the rights to defend a judgment of\nthis kind?\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, the Chief -- the\nChief Justice and Justice Kagan have given a proper\nhypothetical to test your theory. But in this case the\nproponents, number one, must give their official\naddress, they must pay money, and they must all act in\nunison under California law. So these five proponents\nwere required at all times to act in unison, so that\ndistinguishes -- and to register and to pay money for\nthe -- so in that sense it's different from simply\nsaying any citizen.\nMR. COOPER: But of course it is, and I\nthink the key -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But can you tell me -\nthat's a factual background with respect to their right\nto put the ballot initiative on the ballot, but how does\nit create an injury to them separate from that of every\nother taxpayer to have laws enforced?\nMR. COOPER: Your Honor, the -- the question\nbefore the Court, I would submit, is not the injury to\nthe individual proponents, it's the injury to the State.\nThe -- the legislators in the Karcher case had no\nindividual particularized injury, and yet this Court\nrecognized they were proper representatives of the\nState's interests -- the State's injury -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: At least one of the\namici have suggested that it seems counterintuitive to\nthink that the State is going to delegate to people who\ndon't have a fiduciary duty to them. That it's going to\nAnd of course, if that kind of action is the\nvery kind that does not lie, well, then to say, but they\nreally feel it's important that the law be enforced,\nthey really want to vindicate the process, and these are\npeople of special interests. They -- we found the five\ncitizens who most strongly want to vindicate the\ninterest in the law being enforced and the process for\nmaking the law be enforced, well, that won't distinguish\nit from a public action.\nBut then you say, but also they are\nrepresenting the State. At this point, the Dellinger\nbrief which takes the other side of it is making a\nstrong argument, well, they aren't the State. They are\nreally no more than a group of five people who feel\nreally strongly that we should vindicate this public\nMR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor, certainly I\nacknowledge the precedential limitations of a summary\ndismissal. But Baker v. Nelson also came fairly fast on\nthe heels of the Loving decision. And, Your Honor, I\nsimply make the observation that it seems implausible in\nthe extreme, frankly, for nine justices to have -- to\nhave seen no substantial Federal question if it is true,\nas the Respondents maintain, that the traditional\ndefinition of marriage, insofar as -- insofar as it does\nnot include same-sex couples, insofar as it is a gender\ndefinition, is irrational and can only be explained -\ncan only be explained, as a result of anti-gay malice\nand a bare desire to harm.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Do you believe this can be\ntreated as a gender-based classification?\nMR. COOPER: Your Honor, I -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: It's a difficult question\nthat I've been trying to wrestle with it.\nMR. COOPER: Yes, Your Honor. And we do\nnot. We do not think it is properly viewed as a\ngender-based classification. Virtually every appellate\ncourt, State and Federal, with one exception, Hawaii, in\na superseded the opinion, has agreed that it is not a\ngender-based classification, but I guess it is gender\n-based in the sense that marriage itself is a gendered\ninstitution, a gendered term. And so in the same way\nthat fatherhood is gendered or motherhood is gendered,\nit's gendered in that sense.\nBut we -- we agree that to the extent that\nthe classification impacts, as it clearly does, same-sex\ncouples, that -- that classification can be viewed as\nbeing one of sexual orientation rather than -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Outside of the -\noutside of the marriage context, can you think of any\nother rational basis, reason for a State using sexual\norientation as a factor in denying homosexuals benefits\nor imposing burdens on them? Is there any other\nrational decision-making that the government could make?\nDenying them a job, not granting them benefits of some\nsort, any other decision?\nMR. COOPER: Your Honor, I cannot. I do not\nhave any -- anything to offer you in that regard. I\nthink marriage is -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. If that -\nif that is true, then why aren't they a class? If\nthey're a class that makes any other discrimination\nimproper, irrational, then why aren't we treating them\nas a class for this one thing? Are you saying that the\ninterest of marriage is so much more compelling than any\nother interest as they could have?\nMR. COOPER: No, Your Honor, we certainly\nare not. We -- we are saying the interest in marriage\nand the -- and the State's interest and society's\ninterest in what we have framed as responsible pro -\nprocreation is -- is vital, but at bottom, with respect\nto those interests, our submission is that same-sex\ncouples and opposite-sex couples are simply not\nsimilarly situated.\nBut to come back to your precise question, I\nthink, Justice Sotomayor, you're -- you're probing into\nwhether or not sexual orientation ought to be viewed as\na quasi-suspect or suspect class, and our position is\nthat it does not qualify under this Court's standard\nand -- and traditional tests for identifying\nsuspectedness. The -- the class itself is -- is quite\namorphous. It defies consistent definition as -- as the\nPlaintiffs' own experts were -- were quite vivid on.\nIt -- it does not -- it -- it does not qualify as an\naccident of birth, immutability in that -- in that\nsense.\nAgain, the Plaintiffs -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So you -- so what -- I\ndon't quite understand it. If you're not dealing with\nthis as a class question, then why would you say that\nthe government is not free to discriminate against them?\nMR. COOPER: Well, Your Honor, I would think\nthat -- that -- I think it's a -- it's a very different\nquestion whether or not the government can proceed\narbitrarily and irrationally with respect to any group\nof people, regardless of whether or not they qualify\nunder this Court's traditional test for suspectedness.\nAnd -- and the hypothetical I understood you to be\noffering, I would submit would create -- it would -\nunless there's something that -- that is not occurring\nto me immediately, an arbitrary and capricious\ndistinction among similarly situated individuals,\nthat -- that is not what we think is at the -- at the\nroot of the traditional definition of marriage.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Cooper, could I just\nunderstand your argument. As -- in reading the briefs,\nit seems as though your principal argument is that\nsame-sex and opposite -- sex couples are not similarly\nsituated because opposite-sex couples can procreate,\nsame-sex couples cannot, and the State's principal\ninterest in marriage is in regulating procreation. Is\nthat basically correct?\nMR. COOPER: I -- Your Honor, that's the\nessential thrust of our -- our position, yes.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Is -- is there -- so you\nhave sort of a reason for not including same-sex\ncouples. Is there any reason that you have for\nexcluding them? In other words, you're saying, well, if\nwe allow same-sex couples to marry, it doesn't serve the\nState's interest. But do you go further and say that it\nharms any State interest?\nMR. COOPER: Your Honor, we -- we go further\nin -- in the sense that it is reasonable to be very\nconcerned that redefining marriage to -- as a genderless\ninstitution could well lead over time to harms to that\ninstitution and to the interests that society has\nalways -- has -- has always used that institution to\naddress. But, Your Honor, I -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, could you explain that\na little bit to me, just because I did not pick this up\nin your briefs.\nWhat harm you see happening and when and how\nand -- what -- what harm to the institution of marriage\nor to opposite-sex couples, how does this cause and\neffect work?\nMR. COOPER: Once again, I -- I would\nreiterate that we don't believe that's the correct legal\nquestion before the Court, and that the correct question\nis whether or not redefining marriage to include\nsame-sex couples would advance the interests of marriage\nas a -\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, then are -- are you\nconceding the point that there is no harm or denigration\nto traditional opposite-sex marriage couples? So you're\nconceding that.\nMR. COOPER: No, Your Honor, no. I'm not\nconceding that.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, but, then it -- then\nit seems to me that you should have to address Justice\nKagan's question.\nMR. COOPER: Thank you, Justice Kennedy. I\nhave two points to make on them.\nThe first one is this, the Plaintiffs'\nexpert acknowledged that redefining marriage will have\nreal-world consequences, and that it is impossible for\nanyone to foresee the future accurately enough to know\nexactly what those real-world consequences would be.\nAnd among those real-world consequences, Your Honor, we\nwould suggest are adverse consequences.\nBut consider the California voter, in 2008,\nin the ballot booth, with the question before her\nwhether or not this age-old bedrock social institution\nshould be fundamentally redefined, and knowing that\nthere's no way that she or anyone else could possibly\nknow what the long-term implications of a profound\nredefinition of a bedrock social institution would be.\nThat is reason enough, Your Honor, that would hardly be\nirrational for that voter to say, I believe that this\nexperiment, which is now only fairly four years old,\neven in Massachusetts, the oldest State that is\nconducting it, to say, I think it better for California\nto hit the pause button and await additional information\nfrom the jurisdictions where this experiment is still\nmaturing.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Cooper, let me -- let\nme give you one -- one concrete thing. I don't know why\nyou don't mention some concrete things. If you redefine\nmarriage to include same-sex couples, you must -- you\nmust permit adoption by same-sex couples, and there's -\nthere's considerable disagreement among -- among\nsociologists as to what the consequences of raising a\nchild in a -- in a single-sex family, whether that is\nharmful to the child or not. Some States do not -- do\nnot permit adoption by same-sex couples for that reason.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: California -- no,\nCalifornia does.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't think we know the\nanswer to that. Do you know the answer to that, whether\nit -- whether it harms or helps the child?\nMR. COOPER: No, Your Honor. And there's -\nthere's -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: But that's a possible\ndeleterious effect, isn't it?\nMR. COOPER: Your Honor, it -- it is\ncertainly among the -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: It wouldn't be in\nCalifornia, Mr. Cooper, because that's not an issue, is\nit? In California, you can have same-sex couples\nadopting a child.\nMR. COOPER: That's right, Your Honor. That\nis true. And -- but -- but, Your Honor, here's -\nhere's the point -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I -- it's true, but\nirrelevant. They're arguing for a nationwide rule which\napplies to States other than California, that every\nState must allow marriage by same-sex couples. And so\neven though States that believe it is harmful -- and I\ntake no position on whether it's harmful or not, but it\nis certainly true that -- that there's no scientific\nanswer to that question at this point in time.\nMR. COOPER: And -- and that, Your Honor, is\nthe point I am trying to make, and it is the\nRespondents' responsibility to prove, under rational\nbasis review, not only that -- that there clearly will\nbe no harm, but that it's beyond debate that there will\nbe no harm.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Cooper, you are\ndefending -- you are opposing a judgment that applies to\nCalifornia only, not to all of the States.\nMR. COOPER: That's true, Your Honor. And\nif there were a way to -- to cabin the arguments that\nare being presented to you to California, then the\nconcerns about redefining marriage in -- in California\ncould be confined to California, but they cannot, Your\nHonor.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: I -- I think there's -\nthere's substantial -- that there's substance to the\npoint that sociological information is new. We have\nfive years of information to weigh against 2,000 years\nof history or more.\nOn the other hand, there is an immediate\nlegal injury or legal -- what could be a legal injury,\nand that's the voice of these children. There are some\n40,000 children in California, according to the Red\nBrief, that live with same-sex parents, and they want\ntheir parents to have full recognition and full status.\nThe voice of those children is important in this case,\ndon't you think?\nMR. COOPER: Your Honor, I certainly would\nnot dispute the importance of that consideration. That\nconsideration especially in the political process where\nthis issue is being debated and will continue to be\ndebated, certainly, in California. It's being debated\nelsewhere. But on that -- on that specific question,\nYour Honor, there -- there simply is no data.\nIn fact, their expert agreed there is no\ndata, no study, even, that would examine whether or not\nthere is any incremental beneficial effect from marriage\nover and above the domestic partnership laws that were\nenacted by the State of California to recognize,\nsupport, and honor same-sex relationships and their\nfamilies. There is simply no data at all that would -\nthat would permit one to draw -- draw that conclusion.\nI would recall, Justice Kennedy, the point\nmade in Romer, that under a rational basis of review,\nthe provision will be sustained even if it operates to\nthe disadvantage of a group, if it is -- if it otherwise\nadvances rationally a legitimate State interest.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Cooper, we will\nafford you more time. You shouldn't worry about losing\nyour rebuttal time, but please continue on.\nMR. COOPER: Oh -\nJUSTICE BREYER: As long as you are on that,\nthen I would like to ask you this, assume you could\ndistinguish California, suppose we accept your argument\nor accept Justice Scalia's version of your argument and\nthat distinguishes California. Now, let's look at\nCalifornia. What precisely is the way in which allowing\ngay couples to marry would interfere with the vision of\nmarriage, as procreation of children, that allowing\nsterile companies -- couples of different sexes to marry\nwould not?\nI mean, there are lots of people who get\nmarried who can't have children. To take a State that\ndoes allow adoption and say -- there, what is the\njustification for saying no gay marriage? Certainly not\nthe one you said, is it?\nMR. COOPER: You're -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Am I not clear?\nLook, you said that the problem is marriage\nas an institution that furthers procreation.\nMR. COOPER: Yes, Your Honor.\nJUSTICE BREYER: And the reason there was\nadoption, but that doesn't apply to California. So\nimagine I wall off California and I'm looking just\nthere, where you say that doesn't apply. Now, what\nhappens to your argument about the institution of\nmarriage as a tool towards procreation? Given the fact\nthat, in California, too, couples that aren't gay, but\ncan't have children get married all the time.\nMR. COOPER: Yes, Your Honor. The concern\nis that redefining marriage as a genderless institution\nwill sever its abiding connection to its historic\ntraditional procreative purposes and it will refocus,\nrefocus the purpose of marriage and the definition of\nmarriage away from the raising of children and to the\nemotional needs and desires of adults -- of adult\ncouples.\nSuppose, in turn -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, suppose a State\nsaid -- Mr. Cooper, suppose a State said that because we\nthink that the focus of marriage really should be on\nprocreation, we are not going to give marriage licenses\nanymore to any couple where both people are over the age\nof 55. Would that be constitutional?\nMR. COOPER: No, Your Honor, it would not be\nconstitutional.\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Because that's the same\nState interest, I would think, you know. If you are\nover the age of 55, you don't help us serve the\ngovernment's interest in regulating procreation through\nmarriage. So why is that different?\nMR. COOPER: Your Honor, even with respect\nto couples over the age of 55, it is very rare that both\ncouples -- both parties to the couple are infertile, and\nthe traditional -\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE KAGAN: No, really, because if the\ncouple -- I can just assure you, if both the woman and\nthe man are over the age of 55, there are not a lot of\nchildren coming out of that marriage.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. COOPER: Your Honor, society's -\nsociety's interest in responsible procreation isn't just\nwith respect to the procreative capacities of the couple\nitself. The marital norm, which imposes the -- the\nobligations of fidelity and monogamy, Your Honor,\nadvances the interests in responsible procreation by\nmaking it more likely that neither party, including the\nfertile party to that -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Actually, I'm not even -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose we could have a\nquestionnaire at the marriage desk when people come in\nto get the marriage -- you know, are you fertile or are\nyou not fertile?\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suspect this Court would\nhold that to be an unconstitutional invasion of privacy,\ndon't you think?\nJUSTICE KAGAN: Well, I just asked about\nage. I didn't ask about anything else. That's not an\n-- we ask about people's age all the time.\nMR. COOPER: Your Honor, and even asking\nabout age, you would have to ask if both parties are\ninfertile. Again -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Strom Thurmond was -- was\nnot the chairman of the Senate committee when Justice\nKagan was confirmed.\n(Laughter.)\nMR. COOPER: Very few men -- very few men\noutlive their own fertility. So I just -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: A couple where both people\nare over the age of 55 -\nMR. COOPER: I -\nJUSTICE KAGAN: A couple where both people\nare over the age of 55.\nMR. COOPER: And Your Honor, again, the\nmarital norm which imposes upon that couple the\nobligation of fidelity -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry, where is\nthat -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm sorry, maybe you\ncan finish your answer to Justice Kagan.\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry.\nMR. COOPER: It's designed, Your Honor, to\nmake it less likely that either party to that -- to that\nmarriage will engage in irresponsible, procreative\nconduct outside of that marriage. Outside of that\nmarriage. That's the marital -- that's the marital\nnorm. Society has an interest in seeing a 55-year-old\ncouple that is -- just as it has an interest of seeing\nany heterosexual couple that intends to engage in a\nprolonged period of cohabitation to reserve that until\nthey have made a marital commitment, a marital\ncommitment. So that, should that union produce any\noffspring, it would be more likely that that child or\nchildren will be raised by the mother and father who\nbrought them into the world.\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Cooper, we said that\nsomebody who is locked up in prison and who is not going\nto get out has a right to marry -- has a fundamental\nright to marry, no possibility of procreation.\nMR. COOPER: Your Honor is referring, I'm\nsure, to the Turner case, and -\nJUSTICE GINSBURG: Yes.\nMR. COOPER: -- I think that, with due\nrespect, Justice Ginsburg, way over-reads -- way\nover-reads Turner against Safley. That was a case in\nwhich the prison at issue -- and it was decided in the\nspecific context of a particular prison -- where there\nwere both female and male inmates, many of them minimum\nsecurity inmates. It was dealing with a regulation,\nYour Honor, that had previously permitted marriage in\nthe case of pregnancy and childbirth.\nThe Court -- the Court here emphasized that,\namong the incidents of marriage that are not destroyed\nby that -- at least that prison context, was the\nexpectation of eventual consummation of the marriage and\nlegitimation of -- of the children. So that -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\nMr. Cooper.\nMR. COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Olson?\nORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON\nON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,\nand may it please the Court:\nI know that you will want me to spend a\nmoment or two addressing the standing question, but\nbefore I do that, I thought that it would be important\nfor this Court to have Proposition 8 put in context,\nwhat it does.\nIt walls-off gays and lesbians from\nmarriage, the most important relation in life, according\nto this Court, thus stigmatizing a class of Californians\nbased upon their status and labeling their most\ncherished relationships as second-rate, different,\nunequal, and not okay.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Mr. Olson, I cut off\nyour friend before he could get into the merits. So I\nthink it's only fair -\nMR. OLSON: I was trying to avoid that, Your\nHonor.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I know -\n(Laughter.)\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, I think it's\nonly fair to treat you the same. Perhaps you could\naddress your jurisdictional argument?\nMR. OLSON: Yes. I think that our\njurisdictional argument is, as we set forth in the\nbrief, California cannot create Article III standing by\ndesignating whoever it wants to defend the State of\nCalifornia in connection with the ballot.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: But this is not whoever it\nwants. These are five proponents of -- of the measure\nand if we were to accept your argument, it would give\nthe State a one-way ratchet. The State could go in and\nmake a defense, maybe a half-hearted defense of the\nstatute, and -- and then when the statute is held\ninvalid, simply -- simply leave. On the other hand,\nif -- if the State loses, the State can appeal.\nSo this is a one-way ratchet as it favors\nthe State and allows governors and other constitutional\nofficers in different States to thwart the initiative\nprocess.\nMR. OLSON: That's the -- that's the way the\nCalifornia Supreme Court saw it with respect to\nCalifornia law. The governor and the Attorney General\nof California are elected to act in the best interests\nof the State of California. They made a professional\njudgment given their obligations as officers of the\nState of California.\nThe California Supreme Court has said that\nproponents -- and by the way, only four of the five are\nhere. Dr. Tam withdrew from the case because of some -\nmany things he said during the election -- campaign.\nJUSTICE ALITO: Well, Mr. Olson, is it your\nposition that the only people who could defend a\nballot -- a law that's adopted in California through the\nballot initiative are the Attorney General and the\ngovernor, so that if the Attorney General and the\ngovernor don't like the ballot initiative, it will go\nundefended? Is that your position?\nMR. OLSON: I don't -- I don't think it's\nquite that limited. I think one of your colleagues\nsuggested that there could be an officer appointed.\nThere could be an appointee of the State of California\nwho had responsibility, fiduciary responsibility to the\nState of California and the citizens of California, to\nrepresent the State of California along -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Who -- who would appoint\nhim? The same governor that didn't want to defend the\nplebiscite?\nMR. OLSON: Well, that happens all the time.\nAs you recall in the case of -- well, let's not spend\ntoo much time on independent counsel provisions, but -\n(Laughter.)\nMR. OLSON: The governor -- the government\nof the State of California frequently appoints an\nattorney where there's a perceived conflict of\ninterest -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I suppose -\nMR. OLSON: -- and that person would have a\nresponsibility for the State and might have\nresponsibility for the attorneys' fees.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I suppose there\nmight be people out there with their own personal\nstanding, someone who performs marriages and would like\nthat to remain open to everyone but would prefer not to\nperform same-sex marriages, or other people. We seem to\nbe addressing the case as if the only options are the\nproponents here or the State. I'm not sure there aren't\nother people out there with individual personalized\ninjury that would satisfy Article III.\nMR. OLSON: There might well be in -- in a\ndifferent case. I don't know about this case. If there\nwas, for example, this was an initiative measure that\nallocated certain resources of the State of California\nand the people -- maybe it was a binary system of people\ngot resources and other people didn't get resources,\nthere could be standing. Someone would show actual\ninjury.\nThe point, I guess, at the bottom of this is\nthe Supreme Court -- this Court, decided in\nRaines v. Byrd that Congress couldn't specify members of\nCongress in that context even where the measure depleted\nor diminished powers of Congress -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Olson, I think the\nbottom line -\nJUSTICE ALITO: The States are not bound by\nthe same separation of powers doctrine that underlies\nthe Federal Constitution. You couldn't have a Federal\ninitiative, for example. They're free of all that.\nSo start from the proposition that a State\nhas standing to defend the constitutionality of a State\nlaw -- beyond dispute. The question then is, who\nrepresents the State?\nNow, in a State that has initiative, the\nwhole process would be defeated if the only people who\ncould defend the statute are the elected public\nofficials. The whole point -- you know this better than\nI do because you're from California -- the whole point\nof the initiative process was to allow the people to\ncircumvent public officials about whom they were\nsuspicious.\nSo if you reject that proposition, what is\nleft is the proposition that the State -- State law can\nchoose some other person, some other group to defend the\nconstitutionality of a State law. And the California\nSupreme Court has told us that the Plaintiffs in this\ncase are precisely those people.\nSo how do you get around that?\nMR. OLSON: The only -- that's exactly what\nthe California Supreme Court thought. The California\nSupreme Court thought that it could decide that the\nproponents, whoever they were, and this could be\n25 years after the election, it could be one of the\nproponents, it could be four of the proponents. They\ncould have an interest other than the State because they\nhave no fiduciary responsibility to the State. They may\nbe incurring attorneys' fees on behalf of the State or\non behalf of themselves, but they haven't been\nappointed. They have no official responsibility to the\nState.\nAnd my only argument, and I know it's a\nclose one because California thinks that this is the\nsystem. The California Supreme Court thought that this\nwas a system that would be a default system. I'm\nsuggesting from your decisions with respect to Article\nIII that that takes more than that under -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Olson, I think that\nyou're not answering the fundamental fear. And so -\nand -- and the amici brief that sets forth this test of\nfiduciary duty doesn't quite either.\nThe assumption is that there are not\nexecutive officials who want to defend the law. They\ndon't like it. No one's going to do that. So how do\nyou get the law defended in that situation?\nMR. OLSON: I don't have an answer to that\nquestion unless there's an appointment process either\nbuilt into the system where it's an officer of\nCalifornia or -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: So why -- why isn't this\nviewed as an appointment process that the in -- the\nballot initiators have now become that body?\nMR. OLSON: And that's the argument -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: That your argument -\nMR. OLSON: That's our -- that's the\nargument our opponents make. But it -- but it must be\nsaid that it happens all of the time. That Federal\nofficials and State officials decide not to enforce a\nstatute, to enforce a statute in certain ways. We don't\nthen come in and decide that there's someone else ought\nto be in court for every particular -\nJUSTICE BREYER: What the brief says is, of\ncourse, you can appoint people. It's not just that you\nappoint them, it's that the State's interest when it\ndefends a law is the interest in executing the law of\nthe State. So all you have to do is give a person that\ninterest. But when a person has the interest of\ndefending this law, as opposed to defending the law of\nthe State of California, there can be all kinds of\nconflicts, all kinds of situations.\nThat's what I got out of the brief. So give\nthe person that interest. And that, they say, is what's\nmissing here. And you'll say -- I mean, that's -\nthat's here, and you say it's missing here.\nMR. OLSON: Yeah, I don't -\nJUSTICE BREYER: Why is it missing here?\nMR. OLSON: It is -- what is missing here\nbecause you're not an officer of the State of\nCalifornia. You don't have a fiduciary duty to the\nState of California. You're not bound by the ethical\nstandards of an officer of the State of California to\nrepresent the State of California. You could have\nconflicts of interest. And as I said, you'd be -- could\nbe incurring enormous legal fees, on behalf of the\nState, when the State hasn't decided to go that route.\nI think -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: You should feel free\nto move on to the merits.\nMR. OLSON: Thank you, Your Honor. As I\npointed out at the -- at the outset, this is a measure\nthat walls off the institution of marriage, which is not\nsociety's right. It's an individual right that this\nCourt again and again and again has said the right to\nget married, the right to have the relationship of\nmarriage is a personal right. It's a part of the right\nof privacy, association, liberty, and the pursuit of\nhappiness.\nIn the cases in which you've described the\nright to get married under the Constitution, you've\ndescribed it as marriage, procreation, family, other\nthings like that. So the procreation aspect, the\nresponsibility or ability or interest in procreation is\nnot a part of the right to get married. Now, that -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I'm not sure,\ncounsel, that it makes -- I'm not sure that it's right\nto view this as excluding a particular group. When the\ninstitution of marriage developed historically, people\ndidn't get around and say let's have this institution,\nbut let's keep out homosexuals. The institution\ndeveloped to serve purposes that, by their nature,\ndidn't include homosexual couples.\nIt is -- yes, you can say that it serves\nsome of the other interests where it makes sense to\ninclude them, but not all the interests. And it seems\nto me, your friend argues on the other side, if you have\nan institution that pursues additional interests, you\ndon't have to include everybody just because some other\naspects of it can be applied to them.\nMR. OLSON: Well, there's a couple of\nanswers to that, it seems to me, Mr. Chief Justice. In\nthis case, that decision to exclude gays and lesbians\nwas made by the State of California.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Oh, that's only\nbecause Proposition 8 came 140 days after the California\nSupreme Court issued its decision.\nMR. OLSON: That's right.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: And don't you think\nit's more reasonable to view it as a change by the\nCalifornia Supreme Court of this institution that's been\naround since time immemorial?\nMR. OLSON: The California Supreme Court,\nlike this Supreme Court, decides what the law is. The\nCalifornia Supreme Court decided that the Equal\nProtection and Due Process Clauses of that California\nConstitution did not permit excluding gays and lesbians\nfrom the right to get married -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: You -- you've led me right\ninto a question I was going to ask. The California\nSupreme Court decides what the law is. That's what we\ndecide, right? We don't prescribe law for the future.\nWe -- we decide what the law is. I'm curious, when -\nwhen did -- when did it become unconstitutional to\nexclude homosexual couples from marriage? 1791? 1868,\nwhen the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted?\nSometimes -- some time after Baker, where we\nsaid it didn't even raise a substantial Federal\nquestion? When -- when -- when did the law become this?\nMR. OLSON: When -- may I answer this in the\nform of a rhetorical question? When did it become\nunconstitutional to prohibit interracial marriages?\nWhen did it become unconstitutional to assign children\nto separate schools.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It's an easy question, I\nthink, for that one. At -- at the time that the -- the\nEqual Protection Clause was adopted. That's absolutely\ntrue.\nBut don't give me a question to my question.\n(Laughter.)\nJUSTICE SCALIA: When do you think it became\nunconstitutional? Has it always been unconstitutional?\nMR. OLSON: When the -- when the California\nSupreme Court faced the decision, which it had never\nfaced before, is -- does excluding gay and lesbian\ncitizens, who are a class based upon their status as\nhomosexuals -- is it -- is it constitutional -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: That -- that's not when it\nbecame unconstitutional. That's when they acted in an\nunconstitutional matter -- in an unconstitutional\nmanner. When did it become unconstitutional to prohibit\ngays from marrying?\nMR. OLSON: That -- they did not assign a\ndate to it, Justice Scalia, as you know. What the court\ndecided was the case that came before it -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I'm not talking about the\nCalifornia Supreme Court. I'm talking about your\nargument. You say it is now unconstitutional.\nMR. OLSON: Yes.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Was it always\nunconstitutional?\nMR. OLSON: It was constitutional when we -\nas a culture determined that sexual orientation is a\ncharacteristic of individuals that they cannot control,\nand that that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I see. When did that\nhappen? When did that happen?\nMR. OLSON: There's no specific date in\ntime. This is an evolutionary cycle.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Well, how am I supposed to\nknow how to decide a case, then -\nMR. OLSON: Because the case that's before\nyou -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: -- if you can't give me a\ndate when the Constitution changes?\nMR. OLSON: -- in -- the case that's before\nyou today, California decided -- the citizens of\nCalifornia decided, after the California Supreme Court\ndecided that individuals had a right to get married\nirrespective of their sexual orientation in California\nand then the Californians decided in Proposition 8, wait\na minute, we don't want those people to be able to get\nmarried.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So -- so your\ncase -- your case would be different if Proposition 8\nwas enacted into law prior to the California Supreme\nCourt decision?\nMR. OLSON: I would make -- I would make\nthe -- also would make the -- that distinguishes it in\none respect. But what also -- also -- I would also make\nthe argument, Mr. Chief Justice, that we are -- this -\nmarriage is a fundamental right and we are making a\nclassification based upon a status of individuals, which\nthis Court has repeatedly decided that gays and lesbians\nare defined by their status. There is no question about\nthat.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: So it would be\nunconstitutional even in States that did not allow\ncivil unions?\nMR. OLSON: We do, we submit that. You\ncould write a narrower decision.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: Okay. So I want to know\nhow long it has been unconstitutional in those -\nMR. OLSON: I don't -- when -- it seems to\nme, Justice Scalia, that -\nJUSTICE SCALIA: It seems to me you ought to\nbe able to tell me when. Otherwise, I don't know how to\ndecide the case.\nMR. OLSON: I -- I submit you've never\nrequired that before. When you decided that -- that\nindividuals -- after having decided that separate but\nequal schools were permissible, a decision by this\nCourt, when you decided that that was unconstitutional,\nwhen did that become unconstitutional?\nJUSTICE SCALIA: 50 years ago, it was okay?\nMR. OLSON: I -- I can't answer that\nquestion and I don't think this Court has ever phrased\nthe question in that way.\nJUSTICE SCALIA: I can't either. That's the\nproblem. That's exactly the problem.\nMR. OLSON: But what I have before you now,\nthe case that's before you today is whether or not\nCalifornia can take a class of individuals based upon\ntheir characteristics, their distinguishing\ncharacteristics, remove from them the right of privacy,\nliberty, association, spirituality, and identity that -\nthat marriage gives them.\nIt -- it is -- it is not an answer to say\nprocreation or anything of that nature because\nprocreation is not a part of the right to get married.\nJUSTICE KENNEDY: That's really -- that's a\nbroad argument that you -- that's in this case if the\nCourt wants to reach it. The rationale of the Ninth\nCircuit was much more narrow. It basically said that\nCalifornia, which has been more generous, more open to\nprotecting same-sex couples than almost any State in the\nUnion, just didn't go far enough and it's being\npenalized for not going far enough.\nThat's a very odd rationale on which to\nsustain this opinion.\nMR. OLSON: This Court has always looked\ninto the context. In, for example, the New Orleans case\ninvolving the gambling casinos and advertising, you look\nat the context of what was permitted, what was not\npermitted, and does that rationalization for prohibiting\nin that case the advertising, in this case prohibiting\nthe relationship of marriage, does it make any sense in\nthe context of what exists?\nJUSTICE ALITO: Oh seriously, Mr. Olson,\nif California provides all the substantive benefits of\nmarriage to same-sex domestic partnerships, are you\nseriously arguing that if California -- if the State -\nif the case before us now were from a State that doesn't\nprovide any of those benefits to same-sex couples, this\ncase would come out differently?\nMR. OLSON: No, I don't think it would come\nout differently because of the fundamental arguments\nwe're making with respect to class-based distinctions\nwith respect to a fundamental right. However, to the\nextent that my opponent in the context of California,\ntalks about child-rearing or adoptions or -- or of\nrights of people to live together and that sort of\nthing, those arguments can't be made on behalf of\nCalifornia because California's already made a decision\nthat gay and lesbian individuals are perfectly suitable\nas parents, they're perfectly suitable to adopt, they're\nraising 37,000 children in California, and the expert on\nthe other side specifically said and testified that they\nwould be better off when their parents were allowed to\nget married.\nJUSTICE ALITO: I don't think you can have\nit both ways. Either this case is the same, this would\nbe the same if this were Utah or Oklahoma or it's\ndifferent because it's California and California has\nprovided all these -\nMR. OLSON: I -- I think that it's not that\nwe're arguing that those are inconsistent. If the -- if\nthe fundamental thing is that denying gays and lesbians\nthe right of marriage, which is fundamental under your\ndecisions, that is unconstitutional. If it is -- if the\nState comes forth with certain arguments -- Utah might\ncome forth with certain justifications. California\nmight come forth with others. But the fact is that\nCalifornia can't make the arguments about adoption or\nchild-rearing or people living together because they\nhave already made policy decisions. So that doesn't\nmake them inconsistent.\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: So it's just\nabout -- it's just about the label in this case.\nMR. OLSON: The label is like -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Same-sex couples\nhave every other right, it's just about the label.\nMR. OLSON: The label \"marriage\" means\nsomething. Even our opponents -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure. If you\ntell -- if you tell a child that somebody has to be\ntheir friend, I suppose you can force the child to say,\nthis is my friend, but it changes the definition of what\nit means to be a friend.\nAnd that's it seems to me what the -- what\nsupporters of Proposition 8 are saying here. You're -\nall you're interested in is the label and you insist on\nchanging the definition of the label.\nMR. OLSON: It is like you were to say you\ncan vote, you can travel, but you may not be a citizen.\nThere are certain labels in this country that are very,\nvery critical. You could have said in the Loving case,\nwhat -- you can't get married, but you can have an\ninterracial union. Everyone would know that that was\nwrong. That the -- marriage has a status, recognition,\nsupport, and you -- if you read the test -- you know -\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: How do we know -\nhow do we know that that's the reason, or a necessary\npart of the reason, that we've recognized marriage as a\nfundamental right? That's -- you've emphasized that and\nyou've said, well, it's because of the emotional\ncommitment. Maybe it is the procreative aspect that\nmakes it a fundamental right.\nMR. OLSON: But you have said that marriage\nis a fundamental right with respect to procreation and\nat the same level getting married, privacy -- you said\nthat in the Zablocki case, you said that in the Lawrence\ncase, and you said it in other cases, the Skinner case,\nfor example.\nMarriage is put on a pro -- equal footing\nwith procreational aspects. And your -- this Court is\nthe one that has said over and over again that marriage\nmeans something to the individual. The privacy,\nintimacy, and that it is a matter of status and\nrecognition in this -\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Mr. Olson, the bottom\nline that you're being asked -- and -- and it is one\nthat I'm interested in the answer, if you say that\nmarriage is a fundamental right, what State restrictions\ncould ever exist? Meaning, what State restrictions with\nrespect to the number of people, with respect to -- that\ncould get married -- the incest laws, the mother and\nchild, assuming that they are the age -- I can -- I can\naccept that the State has probably an overbearing\ninterest on -- on protecting a child until they're of\nage to marry, but what's left?\nMR. OLSON: Well, you've said -- you've said\nin the cases decided by this Court that the polygamy\nissue, multiple marriages raises questions about\nexploitation, abuse, patriarchy, issues with respect to\n"
