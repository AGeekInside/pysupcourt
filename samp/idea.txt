The idea is to try and train a classifier to predict the outcome
of a given trial, based off the hearing transcript.  

Classes to predict: 
	Outcome of the case
	Actual vote outcome
	Vote for each individual justice

Potential features:
	Number of questions asked (total or per judge)
	Number of words spoken (by lawyers, judges or total)
	Bag of words of questions or responses?


To do:

Created a script to run pdftotext on all the transcripts
	Need to sort out the error pdf files
	
Create a simple script create parsable text files

Create a transcript parser

Parse transcripts and store information

Create conversation flow graphs for each transcript
