 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   We'll hear argument

 4   next in 06-8120, Brendlin versus California.

 5              Ms. Campbell.

 6        ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH M. CAMPBELL, ESQ.

 7                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8              MS. CAMPBELL:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   pleast the Court:

10              When an officer makes a traffic stop,

11   activates his flashing lights, he seizes not only the

12   driver of the car but also the car and every person and

13   everything in that car.         This unremarkable conclusion is

14   what Petitioner asks this Court to rule on, rule today.

15   This simple rule is not only firmly rooted in this

16   Court's precedence, it also protects police officers and

17   the liberty interests of everyone traveling on a public

18   State highway.

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, it wouldn't

20   apply in a taxicab, right?           I mean, the cab is driving

21   erratically, the officer pulls it over.                  If I'm a

22   passenger in the cab, I think I can get out and catch

23   another cab, right?

24              MS. CAMPBELL:            Whether or not you can get

25   out and catch another cab is sort of a separate issue,


                                         3

 1   but at the moment that the car comes to a stop you've

 2   been stopped by a Government means intentionally

 3   applied, and I believe you are seized at that point.

 4   After that it may become a factual question with the

 5   totality of the circumstances and it may be

 6   significantly different from that, from the question we

 7   face in a case like this where it's a passenger in a

 8   private car.

 9              JUSTICE ALITO:          And would that apply if a

10   bus was pulled over?

11              MS. CAMPBELL:          If a bus --

12              JUSTICE ALITO:          Everybody on the bus is

13   seized?

14              MS. CAMPBELL:          Once again, a forward motion

15   stopped by government means intentionally applied is a

16   seizure under this Court's holding in Brower.

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But you would have

18   no reason if you were a passenger on a bus in the normal

19   case to assume that the officer was concerned about you.

20   Your view would not be that they are stopping me, you'd

21   think they're stopping the bus because the driver ran a

22   red light or whatever.

23              MS. CAMPBELL:          With all due respect, I

24   believe at that point what you believe is not

25   necessarily the dispositive issue.                The dispositive


                                       4

 1   issue is that your freedom of movement has been

 2   curtailed by government action.

 3                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, are you saying then

 4   that in a case in which the bus is stopped, the car is

 5   stopped and so on, the role for the test about whether a

 6   reasonable person would regard himself as free to leave

 7   is a test to determine when the, when the seizure ends,

 8   as distinct from when the seizure begins?

 9                 MS. CAMPBELL:          Exactly, Your Honor.

10                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             There's no other role for

11   that test.

12                 MS. CAMPBELL:          Exactly, Your Honor.             And I

13   believe that's the rule we apply with respect to

14   drivers.     We don't normally formulate it that was

15   because usually there's a directive from the officer

16   saying okay, you're free to leave, there's a clear point

17   where the seizure ends.          But --

18                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             Yeah, but you're taking the

19   position that whenever you are in a vehicle that is

20   stopped, you are seized?

21                 MS. CAMPBELL:          Exactly.             Yes, Your Honor.

22                 JUSTICE ALITO:          In this case, is it correct

23   to view this as -- to view it this way:                       As soon as the

24   officer approached the car, as I understand it, he

25   recognized the Defendant as a potential parole violator.


                                          5

 1                MS. CAMPBELL:           Yes.

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:           And there would be

 3   reasonable suspicion then from that moment on,                for at

 4   least a brief detention of the individual to determine

 5   whether in fact there was a warrant for the individual.

 6   So all we're talking about, the only period of potential

 7   seizure that we have to worry about is up to the moment

 8   when the officer sees Mr. Brendlin.

 9                MS. CAMPBELL:           In terms of determining when

10   Mr. Brendlin was seized, yes.               The -- there --

11                JUSTICE ALITO:           In other words, any seizure

12   after that point would be supported by reasonable

13   suspicion?

14                MS. CAMPBELL:           Well, except in this case of

15   course, it would be fruit of the poisonous tree, since

16   the State has continued --

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, that's the question.

18   Do you concede that this arrest was lawful?

19                MS. CAMPBELL:           The arrest itself -- the

20   arrest itself is still a product of the exploitation.

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Do you concede that the

22   arrest was lawful?      The officer was obligated to arrest

23   this person, knowing what he did, was he not?

24                MS. CAMPBELL:           Yes.      We concede that the --

25                MS. CAMPBELL:           Yes.

 1              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Do you have any case in

 2   which we exclude the evidence seized incident to an

 3   arrest when the arrest is lawful?

 4              MS. CAMPBELL:            Well, Your Honor, I don't

 5   have a case that has these specifics in it.              This is a

 6   new --

 7              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I didn't think you did,

 8   and that's my concern.        I assumed that this officer was

 9   required to arrest the person, and we can have

10   hypotheticals, he sees somebody wanted for multiple

11   murders and so forth.       But I'm just not aware of

12   authority which says that when the arrest is lawful and

13   the search is incident to that arrest, that the evidence

14   is excluded.   What's your best -- what's your closest

15   case you can give me on that?

16              MS. CAMPBELL:            Well actually, I would turn

17   to the cases that talk about searches incident to arrest

18   and also, go back to the rationale for the intended --

19              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Can I have one please?

20              MS. CAMPBELL:            Well actually, let's look at

21   Thornton and --

22              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Thornton, I'm not familiar

23   with immediately.    I'll look it up.

24              MS. CAMPBELL:            Thornton and Knowles are two

25   cases that this Court has decided relatively recently


                                         7

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   where you talk about the rationale for searches incident

 2   to arrest.   They're not cases that I would have

 3   considered to be directly on point for the seizure issue

 4   in this case, but in Knowles the Court held that you

 5   can't search a car incident to arrest on a minor traffic

 6   stop because --

 7                JUSTICE KENNEDY:              No, no.        This was the

 8   search of a person incident to an arrest, and I really

 9   jumped a little bit ahead of the questions that Justice

10   Alito was proposing.        There may have been a moment in

11   which the officer did not have the authority to act and

12   he did, but it seems to me that once he has this

13   knowledge, there is now an intervening cause and the

14   arrest is proper, and the search as well.

15                MS. CAMPBELL:           If I can divide this into two

16   issues.   First we have the issue of the arrest itself,

17   and I am aware of no mechanism by which Mr. Brendlin

18   would be entitled to suppress the arrest itself, to not

19   be arrested on the parole warrant, or to get out of jail

20   free, so to speak.      That is a separate issue, however,

21   than discussing whether or not the evidence that comes

22   out of this auto search which is a direct product of the

23   illegal stop should be admissible.                   And --

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, it's a direct product

25   of the arrest, and if the arrest is legal, then it seems


                                          8

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to me the search incident to the arrest is legal.                     And

 2   are you acknowledging that the arrest is legal, that

 3   whatever the exclusionary rule does, it does not require

 4   you -- when you've engaged in an unlawful seizure and

 5   you find an ax murderer sitting there in the car, you

 6   don't have to say sorry, I shouldn't have stopped the

 7   car.    You can arrest the person, right?

 8                MS. CAMPBELL:          And --

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:             So the arrest is legal.            If

10   the arrest is legal, then the search incident to it must

11   be legal.

12                MS. CAMPBELL:          Well, I think we have to

13   look, as I said, at the purpose -- the rationales for

14   allowing a search incident to arrest are the need to

15   disarm the suspect or take him into custody, and the

16   need to preserve evidence for trial.                     In this specific

17   case he's arrested on a parole warrant.                     I can't imagine

18   what evidence in that car would be needed to be

19   preserved in order to proceed on the parole warrant.

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What authority do you have

21   that the operation of the exclusionary rule depends on

22   the offense for which he was arrested?

23                MS. CAMPBELL:          Well, the search incident to

24   an arrest is an exception to -- to the exclusionary

25   rule.

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Do you have any authority

 2   for the proposition you just offered?

 3               MS. CAMPBELL:            The proposition --

 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              The search incident to an

 5   arrest leads to an exclusion in one case and not in

 6   another case, depending on the charge on which he was

 7   arrested?

 8               MS. CAMPBELL:            Well, if what we are talking

 9   about is whether or not the exclusionary rule should

10   apply, we look to the purposes of the exclusionary rule

11   which is to deter unlawful police conduct.                If we allow

12   officers to make a stop on a hunch that someone has a,

13   has a, has a warrant or whatever, we have essentially

14   reduced the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule as

15   it applies to traffic stops, as it has historically

16   applied to traffic stops.

17               This is, this is not a new proposition that

18   if you stop a car and -- if you saw something in plain

19   view after an illegal stop, it wouldn't be -- it would

20   still be excluded.

21               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Well, but why -- why

22   doesn't plain view kick in just as readily, once it is

23   conceded as it has to be, that at the point that he was

24   making the arrest, the officer was acting lawfully?                And

25   if he was acting lawfully when he made the arrest, why


                                         10

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   doesn't he get the benefit of the plain view doctrine to

 2   the extent that he saw any evidence before him at that

 3   point?

 4              And I take it the plain view exception would

 5   at least cover the, I forget what it was, but the

 6   materials that were in the, in the passenger well of the

 7   passenger car, that -- that were known to be used as a

 8   source of, of ingredients for making methamphetamine?

 9              MS. CAMPBELL:            Well, I believe you

10   misunderstood me.    I wouldn't say that the plain view

11   doctrine would allow admission of that evidence.                       If the

12   stop is illegal then anything the officer seized --

13              JUSTICE SOUTER:              No, I realize.         But we've

14   got -- we've got a choice here, I mean, I think Justice

15   Kennedy's questions brought this out.                    We've got a

16   choice here of two ways to look at the State action at

17   the moment of -- of the arrest.               One way to look at it

18   would be to say it was a product of an unlawful stop.

19   Another way to look at it would be to say it was an act

20   of executing a validly issued warrant.                    And you concede

21   that they at least could lawfully have executed the

22   arrest, they didn't have the arrest warrant but there

23   was an arrest warrant issued for them and they could

24   lawfully execute that warrant and arrest him at that

25   point.

 1              Let's assume that those are our two choices.

 2   On choice number one the State, the police officer, is

 3   acting someplace where he shouldn't have been.                   On

 4   choice number two, the parole violator, your client, is

 5   in a place where he shouldn't have been because he

 6   should have been arrested and he should have been back

 7   behind bars at that point.

 8              If we have a choice between those two ways

 9   of looking at the case, why don't we for any purpose,

10   give the casting vote to the lawfulness of the arrest,

11   to the warrant which was issued by a neutral and

12   detached magistrate at some point?                   And if we do that,

13   then why isn't not only a search incident to an arrest,

14   but the seizure of materials which were in plain view at

15   the moment of that arrest, subject to a -- an

16   admissibility rule?

17              MS. CAMPBELL:             Well, first, Your Honor, a

18   slight correction.      I don't believe that there is any

19   evidence that this was an issue issued by an detached

20   magistrate because what we call in California a Powell

21   warrant under California Penal Code Section 3000(v)(a)

22   --

23              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Okay.       But it was, it was a

 1              MS. CAMPBELL:           Yes.      Yes.

 2              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Okay.

 3              MS. CAMPBELL:           Issued by the Board of Prison

 4   Terms.

 5              JUSTICE SOUTER:             All right.

 6              MS. CAMPBELL:           But in terms of why we don't

 7   do this, it's the reason we exclude evidence in general

 8   when it's unlawfull seized, when it is the direct result

 9   of a -- of a stop that is illegal from its inception.

10              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, all right, but you're

11   simply saying we give, we put the greatest emphasis on

12   act A, stopping the car rather than act B, lawfully

13   arresting, regardless of the legality of stopping the

14   car.

15              MS. CAMPBELL:           Well -- well actually we have

16   a test for this.   It's the Brown test; it's the Wong sun

17   test, and the people have the burden.                   The test is if

18   the, even there is attenuation, which I -- which is what

19   the people are arguing, the warrant in this case is,

20   that's not the end of the inquiry.                 We also look at the

21   flagrancy of the officer's misconduct, and we look at

22   the temporal proximity to the initial illegality.                   And

23   in this case that attenuating circumstance is simply not

24   --

25              JUSTICE SOUTER:             But do we, do we have do we

 1   have in any of the cases -- I, frankly I don't recall.

 2   I remember Brown but I don't think there was anything in

 3   Brown comparable to the lawful authority to arrest

 4   independent of the stop.           And -- and that's what makes

 5   this case unusual.      And -- and if we emphasize the

 6   lawfulness of the arrest, quite independent of the

 7   circumstances of the stop, and we also bear in mind that

 8   the point of the exclusionary rule is -- is to deter

 9   police conduct, and you've got another priority here,

10   the driver, who can invoke the exclusionary rule and

11   deter police misconduct.

12               I don't see where the interest would lie in,

13   or where the justification would lie, in our saying

14   we've got to put, as it were all the eggs in the basket

15   of the unlawful stop, as opposed to the basket of the

16   lawful arrest.

17               MS. CAMPBELL:            Well, Your Honor, I think,

18   actually I'm not sure that the driver in this case is

19   going to have a remedy.          If we look at the steps in this

20   case, first we have this officer who makes an illegal

21   stop.   He continues that detention in order to run

22   warrant checks on both parties; he finds probable cause

23   to arrest Mr. Brendlin; he searches the car incident to

24   the arrest, even though the Belton rationale search

25   incident to arrest perhaps is a bit shaky in the case,

 1   because Mr. Brendlin is in the back of the car, and it's

 2   a parole warrant.     But at that point the officer also

 3   searches the driver, and if the evidence is, or if the

 4   taint is attenuated, as to Mr. Brendlin, and this is a

 5   lawful search incident to his arrest, I don't really

 6   understand how the driver is going to have a remedy as

 7   well.     And in fact --

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, do we have an -- an

 9   argument that something was seized from the driver that

10   should not have been seized from his person?

11                 MS. CAMPBELL:          The driver is not a party to

12   the appeal, but she was convicted, and -- and -- and --

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, but I mean, that's

14   not before us.

15                 MS. CAMPBELL:          No, it's not.

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            We're talking about

17   evidence seized from the defendant.

18                 MS. CAMPBELL:          No, Your Honor.      I was

19   responding to the question doesn't the driver have a

20   remedy?    You know, isn't that enough to provide

21   deterrence?    But if we allow a warrant by one person of

22   the car to attenuate the search, search of the car, then

23   as I read this Court's precedents, the search is

24   attenuated, the taint is --

 1   Court as far as I could tell was thinking that it turns,

 2   if you stop somebody, you stop somebody, if you make him

 3   think he isn't free to go.

 4                 So you seem to me to give a lot of cases

 5   where he would feel free to go, and you're saying still

 6   that that's a stop.      Well, I mean, suppose the policeman

 7   comes along and he sees three people in a car and there

 8   is Jack the Ripper driving.             So he says okay, I'm

 9   stopping the car.     Now he says the other three people,

10   I'm not interested in you; my pal and partner here is in

11   a second squad car; he will take you wherever you want

12   to go.   Have they been stopped?

13                 MS. CAMPBELL:         Have they been stopped by the

14   initial seizure?

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           No.

16                 MS. CAMPBELL:         The initial stop of the car,

17   yes.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay.       Well, I don't think

19   you're going to find authority for that in the law.                  At

20   least not in this Court.          I mean, I'd like to know what

21   it is.   Maybe you are.       I think that would be very

22   interesting.

23                 MS. CAMPBELL:         Well, I think the Brower

24   decision --

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Brower --

 1                 MS. CAMPBELL:          The Brower opinion has a very

 2   --

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:            What, what were the facts

 4   there?

 5                 MS. CAMPBELL:          Well, in Brower there was a

 6   roadblock --

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:            There was a roadblock.

 8                 MS. CAMPBELL:          The car crashed into it.            But

 9   the, the crucial question, the crucial issue was was

10   means intentionally applied by the Government.

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            What if the car -- you

12   know, the car doesn't come to a complete stop.                      The same

13   facts that Justice Breyer just gave you.                      It's creeping

14   along at, you know, a foot a minute.                      And then he says

15   to these other people, you can jump out and go wherever

16   you like, or you know, or go back to, to my partner's

17   car.     Then they wouldn't have been stopped; is that

18   right?

19                 MS. CAMPBELL:          I think then we'd have a

20   totality of the circumstances test and whether someone

21   feels free to leave and jump out of a moving car.                      But I

22   -- I --

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            So you're putting all the

24   eggs into the basket that the, the car came to a

25   complete stop and therefore they have been seized.                      And

 1   what is crucial for the seizure is the elimination on

 2   motion on the part of the car.

 3                 MS. CAMPBELL:          That's how --

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Any elimination of motion

 5   in a vehicle in which you are the passenger constitutes,

 6   at the request of the authorities, constitutes a

 7   seizure?

 8                 MS. CAMPBELL:          If it is by means

 9   intentionally implied, yes.              I think that's, that's how

10   Hodari --

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But not if you're still

12   rolling a little bit, a foot a minute.

13    (Laughter.)

14                 MS. CAMPBELL:          Well, then it would be

15   totality of the circumstances test.

16                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            It seems to me that you're,

17   you're blending two tests together, and tell me if I'm

18   wrong.   One test is there is no question that if the

19   police get control over people, those people are not

20   free to go.

21                 MS. CAMPBELL:          Yes.

22                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            And those are the motion

23   cases.   The most extreme example being the -- the

24   roadblock.     Hodari D, did they -- you know, they were

25   trying to catch him but did they actually get to the

 1   point of a seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes?

 2               Then you got another category of cases in

 3   which there is no question that someone is stopped, that

 4   a police officer can exercise control, and that control

 5   if so exercised is certainly going to be seizure for

 6   Fourth Amendment purposes.           But we don't know whether

 7   the officer really is exercising control, so we ask the

 8   question would a reasonable person in the position of

 9   the individual stopped have believed that he was free to

10   go?

11               Aren't those two quite distinct tests?                  The

12   first test assumes the answer to the question in the

13   second test.    The second test assumes the answer to the

14   first test, i.e., they're stopped, subject to control.

15   Aren't they two independent tests?

16               MS. CAMPBELL:           I agree with you that they

17   are two independent tests, and as I went through this

18   Court's precedents I frankly could not find a single

19   case in which a person had been in motion and stopped

20   and came to a stop, the physical stopping of motion, in

21   which this Court did not find that a seizure had

22   occurred.

23               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Okay.       So you were engaging

24   in shorthand?    You, you accept the analytical

25   distinction but you say look, in the real world once you

 1   stop, we -- we know how the person would have felt?

 2                MS. CAMPBELL:          Well --

 3                JUSTICE SOUTER:            A reasonable person would

 4   have felt.

 5                MS. CAMPBELL:          I think that what we have

 6   here, is -- as I said it's really the way we look at it

 7   with drivers as well.       There is a bright line.        The car

 8   comes to a stop as a result of this display of

 9   authority, you are seized.           From that point on when you

10   would, when a reasonable person would feel --

11                JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, but aren't -- you are

12   saying, I thought by agreeing with you what you were

13   saying was once the car is stopped, a reasonable person

14   under those circumstances would not have felt free to

15   leave.

16                MS. CAMPBELL:          I think that's true.

17                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.

18                MS. CAMPBELL:          I think a reasonable person

19   would not feel free to leave.

20                JUSTICE ALITO:          What if the officer went,

21   before even approaching the car got on the loudspeaker

22   and said:    "Driver remain in the car; passenger, you're

23   free to go"?

24                MS. CAMPBELL:          I think under the totality of

25   the circumstances any court would have a hard time


                                        20

 1   saying the passenger is not free to leave then, unless

 2   there is some other intervening, some other factor.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But you would state

 4   he is still seized because the car is stopped.

 5                 MS. CAMPBELL:         He is seized by the stop,

 6   absolutely.

 7                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, then you're -- you're

 8   blending the two tests together again.

 9                 MS. CAMPBELL:         Well, the two different --

10                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           You have either got to

11   accept their analytical distinction or not.

12                 MS. CAMPBELL:         I do accept their analytical

13   distinction, Your Honor.          I think it's just -- it's

14   actually two different fact, two different points in

15   time.   There's the, there's the seizure that occurs when

16   the car stops; and then there is the continuing seizure

17   during the course of the traffic stop which for the

18   driver has a fairly clear ending point; for a passenger

19   it's going to depend on the facts.

20                 JUSTICE ALITO:         What's the difference

21   between that situation where the police officer says on

22   the loudspeaker passenger remain, driver you're free to

23   go, and the example that the State has in their brief,

24   in which a car is stopped and as a result of the way

25   it's stopped on a narrow road, the other cars behind


                                        21
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that car are for some other period of time prevented

 2   from going forward?     What's the difference between those

 3   two situations?

 4               MS. CAMPBELL:          That difference is actually

 5   addressed directly in Brower.             Brower addresses that

 6   exact hypothetical.     It says a passerby who is

 7   inconvenienced by another stop.              There you have

 8   Government, a Government-caused termination of movement

 9   but it's, but there is no intentionally, means

10   intentionally applied.

11               JUSTICE BREYER:            So what it says here,

12   getting out their quote from it, is it says it does not

13   occur whenever there is a governmentally caused

14   termination in individual's freedom of movement, nor

15   even where there is a governmentally caused and

16   governmentally desired termination of an individual's

17   freedom of movement.      That only when there is a

18   termination of freedom of movement through means

19   intentionally applied.

20               Now, the only way I can -- I mean I say the

21   difference between desired is that they didn't want to

22   stop him.   They are not interested in stopping him.

23   That's not our desire to stop him.                 Our desire is to

24   stop the driver.

25               So if you don't have the desire and if there


                                       22

 1   is no real restriction of any significance, is there a

 2   stop?     I mean I would say Brower, they cited on their

 3   side, for that language.

 4                 MS. CAMPBELL:          Your Honor, where you're

 5   looking at -- we have to look at the objectively

 6   observable facts, which in this case are the flashing

 7   lights.     We don't -- I mean the passenger has no

 8   particular way of knowing what the officer's intent is,

 9   which I think is why this Court has consistently held

10   that the officer's object intent in -- in -- is

11   irrelevant to the equation.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, the passenger, you

13   also have to have two things.               One they don't

14   intentionally want to stop him.                Two, he doesn't think

15   his movement is restricted.              Where both of those things

16   are true, then no stop.          That's why the people who, say,

17   are on the railroad car and they stop the whole train,

18   that the railroad says don't worry, not an

19   inconvenience:    We'll have another train for new 10 or

20   15 minutes; just get out, except for car one where there

21   is Jack the Ripper -- you know, those other people are

22   not stopped.

23                 Now that's their argument.                  What's your

24   response?

25                 MS. CAMPBELL:          Well, my response is the same

 1   as it has been.    The passenger is certainly stopped when

 2   the car comes to a halt.          We discuss in our brief that

 3   there are reasons why a passenger could, why the car

 4   could be stopped, as far as the passenger knows, and

 5   particularly in this case where we have --                      whereas it

 6   was an unreasonable stop, there was no traffic

 7   violation, neither the passenger nor the driver has any

 8   reason to know why they are being stopped, and --

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, does that make

10   a difference?   Let's say, you know, the car drives

11   through a red light and the police lights come on.                        The

12   passenger surmises that it's because they ran a red

13   light.   So that's a different case?                     You would say it's

14   not seized if he reasonably, objectively, reasonably

15   assumes it's because of what the driver did.

16               MS. CAMPBELL:           No, Your Honor.             I would

17   still say that the passenger is seized when the car

18   comes to a stop.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So then why are we

20   pointing out that they didn't know?                      It makes no

21   difference under your view of the case.

22               MS. CAMPBELL:           Well, I don't think it makes

23   a difference one way or the other.                  I was responding to

24   the suggestion that the passenger should somehow be

25   aware of the officer's intent and know when he sees

 1   flashing lights that it means the driver -- I don't

 2   think that that's a proper inquiry to determine whether

 3   or not --

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well then, if all

 5   that matters is the physical stop, what do you do about

 6   the cases that were talked about earlier where the other

 7   cars have to stop because of the way -- that's a

 8   physical stop and yet our cases indicate you're not

 9   seized in those situations.

10                 MS. CAMPBELL:         That's a physical stop, but

11   it's not -- it's not the -- the means intentionally

12   applied portion of the test doesn't work or it doesn't

13   satisfy it.

14                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, how do you explain the

15   justification for stopping if there is the seizure, for

16   stopping the innocent passenger because the driver has

17   committed a traffic violation?               If that's a seizure of

18   the passenger, then it's a seizure without reasonable

19   suspicion of probable cause, right?

20                 MS. CAMPBELL:         No.      I would say that that's

21   a reasonable, a reasonable stop.                That's the risk --

22   when you get into the car as a passenger, you take a

23   risk that you may be subject to a reasonable search or

24   reasonable detention.       But the Fourth Amendment doesn't

25   provide any protection for anyone against reasonable

 1   detentions and that would be a reasonable detention.

 2               Was there a question?

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:            What about a shutdown of an

 4   airport?   You know, there is word that somebody has been

 5   seen walking in with a bag of explosives or it looks

 6   like a bag of explosives, so they stop all planes on the

 7   tarmac, shut down all exits to the airport until they

 8   can ascertain what this bag is.              Everybody in the

 9   airport and everybody in those planes has been seized

10   for Fourth Amendment purposes?

11               MS. CAMPBELL:          No, Your Honor.        Some of

12   those people in the airport would be in the same

13   position as the passengers in Bostick and Drayton, where

14   they weren't going anywhere in the first place, and --

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay, just the people who

16   were trying to leave the airport.                They had just arrived

17   and they were going to go out to catch a cab and go

18   home.   They have been seized.

19               MS. CAMPBELL:          I would say some of those

20   people would be in the position of the passer-by, the

21   passers-by identified in Brower.               Possibly some of them

22   would be seized, but it sounds to me like it would be a

23   reasonable seizure and wouldn't necessarily --I mean a

24   reasonable seizure, there's no Fourth Amendment

25   protection against a --

 1              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Well, it turns out that

 2   there wasn't a bag of explosives and that no reasonable

 3   person would have thought.            This was a knitting bag and

 4   some foolish cop thought it was a bag of explosives.

 5   That would have made it unreasonable.                     So everybody in

 6   the airport who is on the way home has been seized and

 7   has a cause of action.

 8              MS. CAMPBELL:             Given the extreme leeway

 9   given in airports, if it's so bad that there wasn't

10   reasonable suspicion to shut it down, I'd say that's

11   probably a reasonable result for shutting down entire

12   airports for no reason whatsoever.                   But under the fact

13   that you posited, it sounds like it would be exigent

14   -sent circumstances or something else that would make

15   that a reasonable suspicion.

16              Going back to our, to the test that

17   Petitioner asks this Court to adopt, the most important

18   thing I can say about this test is not only does it

19   reflect what I think is the real life expectation.                    It

20   also protects officer safety by providing a measure of

21   predictability for both passengers and drivers and as

22   well for officers.

23              And I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

 1                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD E. ZALL

 2                       ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 3                MR. ZALL:      Mr. Chief Justice and may it

 4   please the Court:

 5                I'd like to respond if I could to Justice

 6   Souter's point earlier.         The State sees this as having

 7   two distinct components in a situation where a passenger

 8   is subject to a, in a vehicle that's subjected to a

 9   routine traffic stop.       First, you have the stopping of

10   the vehicle, the physical stopping of the vehicle.               In

11   our view that does not result in a seizure of a

12   passenger.   It's a show of authority much like Hodari D

13   discussed, which is directed at the driver.               The driver

14   is the operator of the vehicle.               When the driver submits

15   to that show of authority, under this Court's precedents

16   the driver is seized.       The passenger is not seized.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Even, even when the reason

18   the driver is stopped is that a police officer whose car

19   was alongside, he looks over there and he sees that it

20   is some notorious felon who is in the back seat, and the

21   only reason he stops the car is so arrest that felon?

22   You would still say that, that the show of authority is

23   only directed at the driver and hence it is only the

24   driver that's seized?

25                MR. ZALL:      Justice Scalia, the way I'd


                                        28

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   answer that question is to say yes at the outset,

 2   because the driver is in control of the vehicle.              By

 3   necessity, the show of authority to stop if it's done in

 4   a routine manner, as was done here, is directed at the

 5   driver.   Therefore --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's the right answer.     I

 7   think you're being consistent.              You have to say that.

 8   You have to say that.

 9               MR. ZALL:      Thank you.

10               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, consistent with that

11   answer, consistent with that answer, what we're

12   concerned with in these cases is not, in cases like

13   this, is not literally the moment of the stop, but the

14   moment of the stop plus one.            And in cases like this

15   the -- I take it you concede the question is would the

16   passenger, would a reasonable passenger in, in that

17   situation feel free to leave.             And in the absence of a

18   hypothetical like Justice Alito's in which the

19   loudspeaker says, all I want is the driver, passenger is

20   free to go, and so on, absent something like that, what

21   is the argument that the, that a reasonable person in

22   the passenger seat would feel free to open the door and

23   traipse off?

24               MR. ZALL:      Justice Souter, I think the, the

25   pervasiveness and the commonplace nature of a routine

 1   traffic stop gives --

 2                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Have you ever been stopped?

 3   Have you ever been subject to a traffic stop?

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Tell the truth now.

 5                 (Laughter.)

 6                 MR. ZALL:      Yes.        Yes, I have.

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay.

 8                 (Laughter.)

 9                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       The heart rate went

10   up.     The blood pressure went up.              But --

11                 MR. ZALL:      But I was the driver, I was the

12   driver.

13                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Don't you think that a

14   reasonable passenger at that point would assume that the

15   officer is in control and that, in the absence of some

16   affirmative indication that the passenger can go, that

17   he's supposed to sit there until this thing gets over

18   with?     Isn't that the reasonable response of a

19   passenger?

20                 MR. ZALL:      No, Justice Souter, I don't think

21   so.     I think again, because the, the traffic stop is

22   such a common occurrence and in the overwhelming

23   majority of cases involving a routine traffic stop, it's

24   an investigatory stop of the driver.                      And I think it's

25   reasonable for the passenger and the driver to see it

 1   that way, I would submit that if I am a passenger in a

 2   car and I'm riding with somebody and they, and one

 3   patrol car signals for the driver to pull over, I think

 4   the natural reaction is the driver says, what did I do,

 5   and the passenger says, what did you do?                 I mean, I

 6   think that's the natural reaction.

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The fact that the action

 8   --

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, but the policeman

10   usually tells the drive and anybody else in the car:

11   Stay in the car.    Policemen don't like people jumping

12   out of the car.    They don't know why they're jumping out

13   of the car.    And I would certainly if I were a passenger

14   not feel free to immediately open the door and start

15   walking away, and if I did I would expect the policeman

16   to tell me:    Get back in the car.               Isn't that, isn't

17   that the normal procedure, to keep the occupants in the

18   car until the policeman investigates?

19                 MR. ZALL:     Well, I think, Justice Scalia, I

20   think if the officer did tell you to stay in the car --

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, even if he didn't

22   tell me.   I would have expected him to tell me.                I

23   wouldn't even open the door because I know he would tell

24   me.   I know that I'm not free to leave the car

25   immediately until he investigates the stop.

 1               MR. ZALL:      Well, I, I'm not sure that I

 2   agree with that.

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What if there's a

 4   suitcase in the back seat?          Just the driver, the

 5   driver's pulled over, and then somebody comes walking

 6   down the sidewalk, the driver's friend, he opens the car

 7   door, takes the suitcase and starts walking away?

 8   Wouldn't the policeman say, put that back, because he

 9   thought he had seized not just the driver but everything

10   in the car, too?

11               MR. ZALL:      Well, again, Mr. Chief Justice, I

12   think that if, if the officer -- our position is that if

13   the officer does something to the passenger to indicate

14   --

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I'm talking about

16   the suitcase.   You wouldn't, you wouldn't reasonably

17   think someone could just take something out of the car

18   that's been stopped by the officer and walk off with it,

19   right?   Everything, all the contents of the car, are

20   seized as well as the driver, right?

21               MR. ZALL:      I'm not sure that a passenger,

22   though, is like a suitcase.            I mean, a suitcase can't go

23   anywhere unless somebody does something.

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You're representing the

25   State of California and you want to establish the

 1   proposition that any time there is a traffic stop in the

 2   State of California or I guess anywhere in the United

 3   States all the passengers are free to immediately leave,

 4   absent some further countermanding officer -- order by

 5   the officer.   I think that's a quite surprising

 6   proposition.   Now, we don't have empirical studies and

 7   so forth, but at some point the Court takes judicial

 8   notice and I think indications from the bench are we

 9   just don't think passengers, A, are or, B, should feel

10   free to leave when there's a traffic stop.                    I just think

11   you have no social or empirical documentation for that

12   position.

13               MR. ZALL:      Well, though it's not cited in

14   our brief, Justice Kennedy, we have talked with the

15   California Highway Patrol who make over a million stops

16   a year in California and they treat passengers as free

17   to leave.

18               JUSTICE BREYER:            But I mean, the question --

19   so I want to know how to decide this case.                    I understand

20   what your position is.       But I think the normal instinct

21   of everybody is not about boats, taxis, airports and all

22   these other examples, but this case.                    And I, I would say

23   if you want to go on instinct I wouldn't think of

24   getting out of a car when I'm the passenger and the

25   policeman has stopped.       But maybe I'm wrong.               So when

 1   you asked a million policemen, how many instances did

 2   they tell you about where they stopped the car and all

 3   the passengers jumped out and walked away?                       Was there

 4   one?   Was there one.

 5                 MR. ZALL:      Well, I mean -- but I think that

 6   prudent behavior -- just because it's prudent to do

 7   something doesn't make it a seizure.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Right.           I never pass a

 9   police car.    I don't care how slow I'm going.                     I never

10   pass a police car.      I don't consider myself arrested

11   just because that's the prudent thing to do, and it may

12   well be a similar situation when you're sitting in a car

13   that's been stopped by a traffic policeman.

14                 MR. ZALL:      I mean, I think, I think again

15   that --

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Zall, let's say we

17   have just an intelligent reasonable person reads the

18   newspaper and says:       Oh, they handed down a decision

19   today that said the police can order me to get out of

20   the car, the police can order me to stay in the car.

21   How could such a person feel free to leave knowing that

22   it is the law that that person can be told, get out, or

23   if he tries to get out, stay in?

24                 MR. ZALL:      Well, Justice Ginsburg, I'd say

25   that, you know, in the Court's seizure jurisprudence

 1   there is this notion of a consensual encounter.                      I think

 2   when an officer approaches a citizen on the street there

 3   is always the apparent authority.                 The apparent

 4   authority of the police is always present.                      The police

 5   always have the factual upper hand, if you were, and at

 6   the traffic stop is no different.                 I mean -- and yet,

 7   this Court has repeatedly said that when the police

 8   approach a citizen, ask for his identification, ask for

 9   his cooperation, even if the police follow him in a

10   squad car, that that's a consensual encounter.

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Does it matter if they're

12   on the Santa Monica Freeway?

13                 MR. ZALL:     I don't think so.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I mean it would be pretty

15   dangerous to get out.

16                 MR. ZALL:     Well, but that would be a reason

17   why you don't get out.        But it doesn't have anything

18   necessarily to do with the police coercion.                      I don't, I

19   don't think -- most of us wouldn't get out.                      But that

20   doesn't make it a seizure, just like most of us would

21   cooperate with the police when the police approach us on

22   the street.    But I don't think -- if anything, I think

23   the traffic stop is less ambiguous.                      It's clearer that

24   the police are not interested in me if I'm a passenger.

25                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask this question?

 1   Suppose after the stop the passenger in the back seat

 2   starts to get out and the officer says:                    Stay in the

 3   car.   Is he then seized?

 4                MR. ZALL:      Yes.        Yes, because now the police

 5   have directed action at him and in that situation a

 6   reasonable person --

 7                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Doesn't it mean that the

 8   authority to cause the person to stay in the car existed

 9   throughout the stop?

10                MR. ZALL:      The authority?               Yes, but I mean,

11   I think the police always have some degree of authority

12   over us in any encounter.

13                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Let me ask you this.            On a

14   casual street in downtown, if they say, I'd like to stop

15   and talk to you, you don't have to stop.                    There's no

16   authority to make them stop.             But there is authority for

17   the passenger in the back seat of the car.

18                MR. ZALL:      Well, it depends, Justice

19   Stevens.    I think, is there legal authority?                  I mean, I

20   think police always have the factual authority and I

21   think that's the way the reasonable person looks at

22   things.    I don't think the reasonable person --

23                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Is there a difference

24   between legal authority and factual authority?

25                MR. ZALL:      I don't think in this context


                                        36
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   there is.   I mean, certainly in --

 2               JUSTICE STEVENS:            If there's no difference

 3   then there's legal authority.

 4               MR. ZALL:      I'm sorry, Justice Stevens?

 5               JUSTICE STEVENS:            If there's no difference

 6   then there's legal authority, which would mean the

 7   person is subject, is in custody of the officer.

 8               MR. ZALL:      No, I don't think so, any more so

 9   than Mr. Drayton was in the Drayton case, where his

10   compatriot was arrested and the police continued to

11   engage him, and this Court found that that was a

12   consensual --

13               JUSTICE BREYER:            How are we supposed to -- I

14   think it's quite interesting.             How do you suggest we

15   decide this/ I don't mean the result, but I'll go, I'll

16   say yes, you've done your survey of the policemen, a

17   million policemen think they're not restricting the

18   movement of the passenger.          Very few passengers jump out

19   of the car, but that may be because they're worried

20   about being run over.      So you say, well, in fact they're

21   restricted, but they don't think they're being

22   restricted by the police, or do they?                   And here we have

23   no idea, at least I have no idea.                I really don't know

24   what the majority think and yet it would seem totally

25   relevant.   How would we find out?

 1              MR. ZALL:      Well, Justice Breyer, I mean, I

 2   think that in this Court's -- to be consistent with this

 3   Court's consensual encounter jurisprudence, with

 4   Rodriguez, with Royer, with Drayton, with Bostick --

 5              JUSTICE STEVENS:            But those are encounters

 6   in an airport where there are pedestrians; there's no

 7   authority to make the person stay, where here I think

 8   you've conceded that there is legal authority to require

 9   the person to stay where he was.

10              MR. ZALL:      Yes, yes, I do, Justice Stevens.

11   But I think the point is that if --

12              JUSTICE STEVENS:            And if it wasn't a seizure

13   what's the source of the legal authority?

14              MR. ZALL:      Well, again, I think, though,

15   that it's a question of seizable versus seized.                I don't

16   think just because the police have some authority that

17   that makes you seized.      I mean, if the police see a

18   citizen jaywalking that person is not arrested because

19   the police have the authority to make, to arrest him.

20              So again I think, I think that the seizure

21   occurs when the police exercise some authority over you.

22   I just think the traffic stop is less ambiguous.                It's

23   clear that the traffic stop is to deal with the driver,

24   whereas in the street encounter --

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 If it's not, if the


                                      38

 1   opposite is true, then it is a seizure even though they

 2   stop the car?

 3              MR. ZALL:       Then, Mr. Chief Justice, I would

 4   say that it's a seizure that at the outset, again per

 5   Justice Scalia's hypothetical, that the, the driver only

 6   is seized at the outset, but then once the police make

 7   it clear that their interest is with the passenger then

 8   the passenger would not feel free to leave, and then the

 9   passenger would be seized.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Even if they make

11   that, even if they make that interest clear prior to the

12   stop?

13              MR. ZALL:       Yes, I think it would sort of

14   happen instantaneously.

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  No.     They pull up

16   next to them and they see that Brendlin is the passenger

17   and they yell over:     Pull over, Brendlin.

18              MR. ZALL:       So they direct their action, they

19   direct their attention at the passenger at the outset.

20   Yes, then I would say the driver is seized by the stop,

21   and then right immediately the passenger, the reasonable

22   passenger, would not feel free to leave and then he

23   would also be seized at that point.                    But again, I harken

24   back to the Court's consensual encounter jurisprudence.

25   It seems to me that again the straight encounter is more

 1   anxiety-forming for the citizen because the police have

 2   directed their attention at you.

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             It may be that you can

 4   walk away, you're not in an enclosed space.             Suppose the

 5   passenger knows when the police approaches:             Oh my

 6   goodness, I didn't buckle up.             Would that passenger be

 7   the object of the police authority from the start?

 8               MR. ZALL:      Well, in your hypothetical,

 9   Justice Ginsburg, the passenger would not be an innocent

10   passenger and the Court's test presupposes an innocent

11   person.   So we can't really ask the question from the

12   perspective of the seatbelt violator.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So it could be, it could

14   be sometimes the attention is directed at the driver,

15   but that's not always the case.

16               MR. ZALL:      Again, I -- as Justice Souter

17   indicated, I think you have to, you have to break it up.

18   At the outset, the show of authority is by nature of

19   the, of the vehicle, is directed at the driver.             After

20   the vehicle comes to a stop, the police could manifest

21   some interest in the passenger and then that changes

22   things.

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But on your earlier answer

24   to Justice Ginsburg, there's no authority in this Court

25   to say that whether you deem yourself stopped or not

 1   depends on whether think you're innocent.                   There's zero

 2   authority for that, right?

 3               MR. ZALL:        That's correct.

 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Correct me if I'm wrong.

 5               MR. ZALL:        No, that's correct.             That's

 6   correct.   The perspective must be -- we must look at it

 7   from the innocent passenger and whether the innocent

 8   passenger would as a result merely of the stop of the

 9   car feel free to leave.

10               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Going back to Justice

11   Stevens' question, the passenger knows the minute the

12   red light goes on that the police can either tell them

13   to get out or tell him to stay in.                   He knows at that

14   very moment.   That seems to me to substantially limit

15   his freedom of action and indicates that --

16               MR. ZALL:        Well, again I think factually

17   citizens when they encounter police always know -- I

18   mean, the policeman in any encounter is armed, is

19   typically armed, and has apparent authority over you.

20   And yet this Court has repeatedly held that that in and

21   of itself, although it may cause some anxiety on the

22   part of citizen --

23               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Yes, but isn't your case

24   he doesn't in fact have the authority, he has apparent

25   authority, but in this case he has actual authority, not

 1   just apparent authority?

 2                 MR. ZALL:      But Justice Stevens, again I

 3   don't think that the reasonable innocent passenger is --

 4   this Court has never said it's the reasonable innocent

 5   passenger that knows the Supreme Court's Fourth

 6   Amendment jurisprudence by heart.                  I mean --

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            You're saying he doesn't

 8   have actual authority.         If I understand you, you're

 9   saying he has no authority to stop an innocent passenger

10   from walking away.      Aren't you saying that?                Unless

11   there's some reason to hold a person in the car, he has

12   no authority to stop him from walking away.

13                 MR. ZALL:      I think that is the current state

14   of the law.    Yes, that is the current state of this

15   Court's jurisprudence.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            What if I feel, even though

17   that's the current state of the law, I wouldn't think of

18   opening the door and walking away without asking the

19   policeman, do you mind if I open the door and walk away?

20   Does that suggest that I think I've been seized?

21                 MR. ZALL:      No, I don't think so, Justice

22   Scalia.   That just suggests that you're prudent when

23   you're dealing with an armed officer.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It's not the police

25   who have authority over the passenger; it's the driver.

 1   The driver's exercising authority.                   Just because the

 2   police say to pull over, the driver can take off and the

 3   passenger isn't seized at that point.

 4              MR. ZALL:         Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice.             I

 5   think again, though, that the stop and then the after

 6   the stop are discrete.

 7              JUSTICE BREYER:               So now perhaps I'm having

 8   so much difficulty, and maybe others are, because you've

 9   actually reached a question of law where facts matter.

10   That is, the law points us to the direction of what

11   would a person reasonably think in general in such

12   circumstances, and we can look at five million cases,

13   but we don't know.      So what do we do if we don't know?

14   I can follow my instinct.            My instinct is he would feel

15   he wasn't free because the red light's flashing.                  That's

16   just one person's instinct.              Or I could say, let's look

17   for some studies.     They could have asked people about

18   this, and there are none.            Or I could say, well, you're

19   the State of California, you're the ones able to get the

20   studies; you could tell some of those professors, you

21   know, to stop thinking about whatever they're thinking

22   about and go ask a few practical questions, but you

23   didn't.

24              What should I do?                Hold that against you?

25   Look for more studies?         Follow my instinct?

 1               MR. ZALL:      I think, Justice Breyer, again I

 2   would keep coming back to the Court's consensual

 3   encounter jurisprudence.         I think you could ask some of

 4   the same questions about in the Drayton case, in the

 5   Bostick case, in the Royer case.               But if you accept

 6   those at consensual, then I'm not sure that this is any

 7   less consensual here.

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Maybe we can just pass

 9   until the studies are done?

10               (Laughter.)

11               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Mr. Zall, assume, and I

12   realize you don't assume, but assume for the sake of

13   argument, that, that there is a seizure here.                   What's

14   the significance of the arrest warrant, or -- yes, I

15   guess there was a warrant as I understand it, although

16   it was not on the person of the officer who stopped the

17   car.   Is that correct?

18               MR. ZALL:      That's correct.

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       What's the

20   significance of that for the outcome of this case?

21               MR. ZALL:      Well, I think that even were this

22   Court to rule that the passenger were subject to a

23   seizure, that the presence of the arrest warrant

24   attenuates any taint and therefore the evidence was --

25   was not suppressible.

 1              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, maybe our questions

 2   took your colleague representing the Petitioner beyond

 3   the question presented.         The question presented is only

 4   whether the passenger felt seized.                  If we agree with the

 5   Petitioner, do we send the case back?

 6              MR. ZALL:        I wouldn't, I wouldn't think

 7   there would be a need to send the case back.                  I mean, I

 8   think --

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, why, if we have

10   serious doubts whether or not the evidence is

11   suppressible?   All we've been asked in the question is,

12   is whether the passenger is detained.

13              MR. ZALL:        I concede that that's true.

14              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              While the questions

15   indicate that even if the passenger is detained, who

16   cares, it's a lawful arrest.

17              MR. ZALL:        Well, I think that because it's

18   fairly clear that the arrest would, would remove the

19   taint from the seizure, that there would be little

20   reason to send the case back to the California Supreme

21   Court.

22              JUSTICE BREYER:              Well, that question hasn't

23   been argued here.

24              MR. ZALL:        Well, I think it's subsumed in

25   the question presented and I think it was raised in our

 1   opposition and the parties have briefed it.

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, but there's --

 3   you know, our Brown case establishes a multifactor test

 4   for determining when the illegal seizure has been

 5   attenuated and the Court hasn't applied that, the

 6   California Supreme Court hasn't gone through that test

 7   in this case.

 8              MR. ZALL:      That is correct, but again I

 9   think because the warrant is such a clear intervening

10   circumstance that has nothing to do, you couldn't in any

11   way say it's an exploitation of the, of the illegal

12   stop.

13              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But don't we have two

14   problems if we go to that stage?              The first one is we

15   would be applying a test that was not applied by the

16   court we're reviewing.      And number two, correct me if

17   I'm wrong, but the, the -- assuming you win, as it were,

18   on the general point about the significance of the, of

19   the arrest warrant, there are still going to be

20   questions about the suppression of the evidence because

21   there are going to be questions about whether the

22   legality of the arrest on that theory suffices to

23   justify the seizure of the evidence.                   You recall the

24   colloquy I had with opposing counsel about the

 1                Aren't those issues that should all be

 2   decided in the first instance in the State courts?

 3                MR. ZALL:      Certainly you could take that

 4   position, Justice Souter.           But it seems to me that

 5   again, that it's relatively straightforward.                     The arrest

 6   was valid.    I mean, unquestionably the arrest was valid.

 7   If the arrest was valid, I'm not sure that there are any

 8   cases --

 9                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But the question that's

10   presented is kind of a standing question.                     It's who can

11   complain when the police stop a car?                     You say the

12   driver.    The question that's been presented in this case

13   is, can the passenger also complain, and that's the only

14   thing that we're dealing with.               So the -- the arrest

15   warrant may pose a disqualification for this particular

16   passenger, but that would be a second question.                        The

17   question that is tendered to us and that was answered by

18   the California Supreme Court is when the car is stopped

19   by the police who can complain.

20                MR. ZALL:      Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg, I

21   agree.    And one further point I'd like to make on that

22   is, would be to draw a parallel between a parked car

23   situation, in which the lower courts have uniformly held

24   that no seizure results when the police turn on their

25   lights and approach a parked car, and even when they rap

 1   on the window to get the attention of the occupants

 2   there is no seizure.

 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  No seizure of a

 4   passenger or a driver?

 5              MR. ZALL:       Of anybody.             Lower courts have

 6   uniformly held that, and yet that seems to be a more

 7   ambiguous situation and a situation in which the

 8   occupants' natural reaction would be to turn to each

 9   other and say:   What's going on here?                  Whereas again in

10   the traffic stop I think it's, it is probably the most

11   likely place that a citizen encounters a policeman, much

12   more so than a, an officer approaching me at an airport

13   and saying, can I see your identification, or

14   approaching me on a street corner, or, as in Chesternut,

15   following me as I'm walking home in his squad car.

16   Those seem to me to be more anxiety-creating and yet the

17   Court has held that those are consensual encounters.

18              And in the parked car, there's ambiguity

19   about what the police want, whereas in the routine

20   traffic stop there isn't that ambiguity, so there's no

21   reason why the passenger shouldn't feel free to leave.

22   Now, it might be prudent, as Justice Scalia indicated,

23   to say, I'm leaving.      But that doesn't make it a

24   seizure, that you should act prudently.                  I think you

25   should always act prudently when you're dealing with the

 1   police.

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:          What is this period of time

 3   that we are talking about when Mr. Brendlin might or

 4   might not have felt that he was free to leave?                  As I

 5   understand the facts, the officer recognized him as one

 6   of the two Brendlin brothers immediately upon

 7   approaching the car.       Isn't that right.

 8                MR. ZALL:      That's -- that right, Your Honor.

 9   But again I think, so I think it's just the mere

10   presence.    It would just be from the time that he got

11   out of his parked, of his car after he parked it, and

12   then with his lights on approached the car and then

13   looks in and sees Mr. Brendlin.               So that's the period of

14   time that Petitioner would have to establish that a

15   reasonable person would not feel free to leave.

16                And the -- and the comparison with the

17   parked car and the other consensual encounter cases of

18   this Court in my view indicate that there is nothing

19   that's been done to the passenger.                  I mean, the arrest

20   of one person as this Court said in Drayton does not

21   mean that everyone around him is detained so it doesn't

22   seem to the State that anything has been done to the

23   passenger.    He just was unlucky enough to be in this car

24   when the driver was stopped for a traffic violation.

25   And that seems to me fairly unambiguous and we don't

 1   feel like a reasonable passenger would not feel free to

 2   leave in that situation.

 3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, it may be that we

 4   would say because of the exclusionary rule dynamic, we

 5   have very little interest in applying the exclusionary

 6   rule to this but I'm not so sure that we should bend the

 7   concept of seizure and say that the passenger hasn't

 8   been seized.

 9                 Perhaps we should be very liberal insofar as

10   applying the exclusionary rule and in this case it seems

11   to me there is lawful arrest which is intervening cause

12   anyway.   But I don't know that we should distort the law

13   of seizure.

14                 MR. ZALL:     Justice Kennedy, I wouldn't think

15   you're distorting the law of seizure by saying the

16   passenger isn't seized.         Nothing is done to the

17   passenger.    He happens to be in this stopped vehicle,

18   but the police have directed no action toward him and so

19   I'm not sure that you would be torturing the definition

20   at all.

21                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Suppose 10 or 20 years ago

22   we had this case and we decided your way and decided

23   passengers are not seized, and then subsequently we had

24   the question of whether an officer could order a

25   passenger out of the car.           What would be held then?


                                        50
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Would we have said we can't because he is not seized?

 2   Or would you say yes, he was seized.                    I meant if we

 3   decided in your case there is no seizure, would we then

 4   have later on, do you think said, notwithstanding the

 5   absence of a seizure the officer could order the person

 6   out of the car?

 7               MR. ZALL:      Yeah.        Because I think -- because

 8   I think the weighty interest in officer safety would

 9   still allow the officer to have some degree of control

10   over the situation.     But again seizable does not mean

11   seized.   The fact that the officer could seize the

12   passenger doesn't mean that the passenger is seized.

13               JUSTICE STEVENS:            But in most situations

14   where an officer meets a person, unless there is a crime

15   scene or something like that, he can't order them to

16   cross the street or go someplace else, can he?                   He can't

17   issue any order to a citizen.

18               MR. ZALL:      But again --

19               JUSTICE STEVENS:            But he can issue orders to

20   passengers even though they are not seized.

21               MR. ZALL:      But Justice Stevens, I think

22   that's because of, the Court recognized in Mimms and in

23   Wilson that there is something inherently dangerous

24   about the traffic stop situation, and there may be

25   weapons in the car that the officer can't see, and so

 1   that's why this Court found in Wilson that you could

 2   order the --

 3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Yes, but in that case

 4   there was a blanket rule.             The officer didn't have to

 5   have a specific reason.           And that it seems to me

 6   indicates that that's because the person as a general

 7   rule knows that he or she is seized.                       If the officer had

 8   to give a specific reason requiring the person to stand

 9   outside as the dissent said, then you might have had a

10   point.   But I don't think that's what the Court held.

11                 MR. ZALL:       I don't think, Justice Kennedy,

12   that the Court ever indicated that the passenger was

13   seized in Wilson prior to the order out.                      I know there

14   was a dissent that indicated that the passenger wasn't

15   seized and the majority never indicated that they

16   disagreed with that point.             I think that what happened

17   in Wilson is that the Court just felt that -- may I --

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Finish your

19   sentence.     Sure.

20                 MR. ZALL:       -- the Court just felt that the

21   weighty interest in officer safety justified the order

22   out, regardless of whether the passenger was seized at

23   the outset.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you Counsel.

 2         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH M. CAMPBELL,

 3                     ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 4                MS. CAMPBELL:           Thank you.           Just to respond

 5   to that last question very briefly, I agree with Justice

 6   Kennedy that Wilson could not have been decided the way

 7   that it was decided had there not been an underlying

 8   assumption that the passenger is seized, because Wilson

 9   does not require any reasonable suspicion that the

10   person is posing a danger to the driver.

11                I'd also like to respond to the State's

12   argument that the passenger in this case simply got

13   unlucky and he was in a car with someone, that he

14   happened to be in a car with someone who was stopped for

15   a traffic offense.      This passenger wasn't merely

16   unlucky; his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by an

17   unreasonable stop that was unreasonable from its

18   inception.   Not only did the officer have no reason to

19   make the stop; he had actually called in and verified

20   and gotten affirmative evidence confirming that there

21   was no reason for the stop.              So it --

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So that -- so that,

23   still then, it's just begging the question of whether or

24   not his Fourth Amendment rights were violated.                    You're

25   making a good case that the driver's Fourth Amendment


                                         53

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   rights were violated, but why isn't the passenger, as

 2   your friend said, just in the unlucky circumstance to

 3   have been in a car whose the driver's Fourth Amendment

 4   rights were violated?

 5              MS. CAMPBELL:             Because Your Honor, this

 6   Court has -- this Court held in Delaware versus Prouse,

 7   the Court recognized the passengers as well as drivers

 8   have a liberty interest in free travel on the highways,

 9   and because if we look at every case this Court has

10   decided in the last 20 or 30 years regarding when a

11   seizure occurs, the case of a passenger in an auto test

12   -- in an auto stop meets the test.                   Under Hodari D we

13   need a show of authority or physical control; in this

14   case we have both.      We have the driver response to the

15   officer's show of authority and as a result the

16   passenger is, is subject to physical control, as a

17   direct line.

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:               What have we done in a

19   case, and maybe we haven't had it, but what have we done

20   in a case where there is a warrantless entry in

21   violation of the Fourth Amendment of somebody's

22   apartment, and there is a suitcase in there that does

23   not belong to the owner of the apartment?                   My impression

24   is that, that the owner of that suitcase has not been

25   subjected to an unreasonable search and seizure; is that


                                         54

 1   correct?

 2                 MS. CAMPBELL:          If the person has no

 3   expectation of privacy in that suitcase that is correct,

 4   Your Honor.    But this Court has recognized in Delaware

 5   vs. Prouse that a passenger does have a privacy liberty

 6   interest in free travel.           So it's a different situation.

 7                 Once again, going back to the Brower case,

 8   the, there was some question about whether or not the,

 9   the seizure of a bystander would be, would be a seizure

10   under the rule proposed by, by Petitioner in this case.

11   Brower talks about an entirely accidental seizure.

12                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, but there was only

13   one, there was just the driver in the Brower case.

14                 MS. CAMPBELL:          Yes, Your Honor.

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            There was no passenger as

16   I recall.

17                 MS. CAMPBELL:          No.      But - but under the rule

18   proposed by the State if there had been a passenger that

19   passenger would not have been seized.                     But if we look at

20   how this Court --

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, but I mean in the

22   case it's just not directly on point.                     That's what we

23   are arguing about.

24                 MS. CAMPBELL:          Yes, Your Honor.           But if we

25   look at the case next in line case, the County of

 1   Sacramento versus Lewis case, there was a passenger in

 2   that case who was struck by the officer in the pursuit,

 3   and although the Court found no seizure it didn't base

 4   that on the fact that the person was a passenger, but on

 5   the fact that it was an accidental application of force.

 6              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So that's just another

 7   case that doesn't help us.

 8              MS. CAMPBELL:          I think it certainly informs

 9   the discussion, Your Honor.

10              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But what of the question

11   that was raised about well, a passenger is locked in for

12   the moment, but so are all the cars that are backed up

13   behind the car that's been stopped?                    What's the

14   difference between the passenger --

15              MS. CAMPBELL:          In that case, Your Honor,

16   there hasn't been an intentional impeding of those

17   people's free, free movement by the officer.                    The

18   officer has intentionally stopped this vehicle.                     And I

19   -- I don't think it's really, it's really far-fetched to

20   argue that it's reasonably foreseeable that automobiles

21   often have passengers in them, and there is certainly a

22   large body of statutory law at least in California that

23   shows that the car can be stopped for reasons related to

24   the passenger.

25              So it's, it's a different situation.                       We are

 1   not looking at an accidental seizure.                     We are looking at

 2   an intentional seizure of the car.

 3                Just to address for a moment whether or not

 4   remand is appropriate in this case, just to clarify the

 5   procedural posture.     The intermediate appellate court in

 6   California did rule this, that the evidence seized in

 7   this case was the fruit of the poisonous tree and should

 8   be suppressed.   The California Supreme Court did not

 9   grant review on that issue and it was not, it's not

10   included in the question presented.                     Just for

11   clarification.   But if the --

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                The California

13   Supreme Court didn't have to reach that issue because it

14   found there was no seizure.

15                MS. CAMPBELL:         No.      The court did not -- did

16   not actually request briefing on the issue either.

17   Thank you.
