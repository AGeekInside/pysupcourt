 6                   ORAL ARGUMENT OF TODD G. SCHER

 7                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                  MR. SCHER:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10                  It is undisputed that Petitioner was not

11   provided notice that the State supreme court had denied

12   his postconviction appeal and had issued its mandate,

13   with the result being that his AEDPA statute of

14   limitations expired.        The very day he learned this,

15   Petitioner immediately prepared a pro se habeas petition

16   and filed it within 24 hours.             Before this, Petitioner

17   had taken --

18                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         How do -- what in the

19   record shows us that the failure to tell him that by the

20   lawyer was anything other than negligence?                What in the

21   record suggests that the lawyer, just as many lawyers

22   do, forgot to call the client, forgot to send him

23   something?     What shows that this is more than

24   negligence?

25                  MR. SCHER:     Well, first of all, we have what

                                       3

 1   the Eleventh Circuit characterized Mr. Collins's conduct

 2   as, which was gross negligence.            And what we have here

 3   is a confluence --

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Well, I'm trying to find

 5   the basis for that finding.

 6               MR. SCHER:      We have a repeated pattern.       For

 7   example, first of all we have to go back in terms of what

 8   happened in State court.       First we have Mr. Collins's

 9   assurances to Mr. Holland that he would in fact file his

10   Federal -- or was aware of this --

11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           But -- but --

12               MR. SCHER:      I'm sorry.

13               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           That's what his intent

14   was.

15               MR. SCHER:      Correct.

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           People say I'm going to

17   do something, and they fail to do it often because

18   something else comes up, because something has happened.

19   That doesn't show intentionality in -- the failure to

20   act doesn't necessarily prove that it was intentional.

21               MR. SCHER:      Well -- well, in terms of that

22   what we have here, for example, is Mr. Collins was given

23   two opportunities -- or the record shows that there were

24   two opportunities for Mr. Collins to provide answers to

25   these very questions.     The most significant of those

                                      4

 1   responses was -- was in the Federal district court where

 2   the Federal district judge in fact issued a show cause

 3   order to Mr. Collins asking him to respond specifically

 4   to Mr. Holland's allegations.           And in that response Mr.

 5   Collins completely ignored all of Mr. Holland's

 6   allegations.   He never denied that -- being instructed

 7   to file the petition.    He never denied that he had in

 8   fact informed Mr. Holland that he wouldn't -- that he

 9   would file the petition.      He never denied any of the

10   allegations with regard to the fact that Mr. Holland

11   wanted that Federal habeas petition filed on time.           He

12   just went on to address --

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, that -- but that's

14   the case in every case where -- where the lawyer is

15   negligent and doesn't do something that -- that should

16   have been done.

17               MR. SCHER:     Well --

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:         He has assured the client,

19   I will take care of your case, and he doesn't do it.

20               MR. SCHER:     Well, here we have --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:         That's all that happened

22   here.

23               MR. SCHER:     This -- this goes beyond the

24   case of mere, garden-variety negligence that some of the

25   courts have -- have addressed, because here we have a

                                     5

 1   combination of not only a failure -- we have the failure

 2   to notify Mr. Holland that the State supreme court has in

 3   fact denied its opinion, despite repeated instructions

 4   from Holland to Mr. Collins that he file his petition.

 5   Mr. Holland wrote --

 6                  JUSTICE ALITO:         The facts here -- the facts

 7   here are quite extreme, but I am troubled by where you

 8   think the line should be drawn.             If it is just mere

 9   negligence, would that be enough for equitable tolling?

10                  MR. SCHER:    No, courts -- and this Court in

11   Lawrence has held, for example, that mere negligence is

12   not sufficient.     What we have here certainly is

13   suggestive --

14                  JUSTICE ALITO:         Well -- the difference

15   between mere negligence and gross negligence -- one of the

16   things I remember most clearly from torts in law school

17   is that that's pretty -- that's an ephemeral

18   distinction.     But that's the one you one you think we

19   should draw, between mere -- if it's gross negligence,

20   then there's equitable tolling; if it's mere negligence,

21   it's not?

22                  MR. SCHER:    Well, we know certainly that the

23   floor from -- from cases from this Court and from other

24   courts is this mere or garden-variety negligence.                But

25   when you get to other factors --

                                       6

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Why should -- why should

 2   that be?     Two cases.    Two criminal defendants.           One

 3   spends a lot of time trying to find the most competent

 4   lawyer he can, and he does.           He finds a highly skilled

 5   lawyer, who makes one little mistake and it's

 6   negligence.

 7                 The other doesn't care.              He gets a lawyer

 8   that's really incompetent, and the lawyer is grossly

 9   negligent.

10                Now, you would be penalizing the client who

11   exercised the most diligence under your rule.                I don't

12   understand the -- the justice of that.                It seems to me

13   that the first client should be better off, not worse.

14                 Now, maybe this is for your friend on the

15   other side to answer as well, but I'm not sure, even

16   following Justice Alito's initial line of questioning,

17   we can distinguish between gross and mere

18   negligence, that -- that it's even fair that we do so.

19                 MR. SCHER:     Well, this Court --

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I didn't mean to interrupt

21   his line of questioning, but it seems to be consistent

22   with it.

23                 MR. SCHER:     This and other courts have --

24   have been able to draw that line, and, of course you have

25   to look at the specifics of each particular case,

                                       7

 1   because not only --

 2                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But what's the -- what's

 3   the point?     What's the justice in doing that?

 4                  MR. SCHER:    Well, the way --

 5                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Other than just limit

 6   the number of cases in which we are going to set aside

 7   convictions?

 8                  MR. SCHER:    Well, in some circumstances,

 9   courts have just said, unfortunately you lose, your

10   attorney didn't commit -- it was just a mere mistake.

11   But what we have here, of course, is not -- we don't

12   have a mere mistake; we have a confluence of these

13   particular factors.     And I think one of the more salient

14   points that distinguishes Mr. Holland's case, for

15   example, from Lawrence and from the situation in

16   Coleman, is that Mr. Holland tried to rid himself of Mr.

17   Collins on numerous occasions while this case was in

18   State court.     In Lawrence and in Coleman, the

19   petitioners were not allowed to be free of their

20   lawyers; they accepted those lawyers' representation --

21   they accepted their representation and the acts and

22   omissions that occurred in Lawrence and in Coleman were

23   attributed to -- to the petitioners in those cases.

24                  Here, however, by contrast, Mr. Holland did

25   everything he could -- he could, to be -- reasonably, to

                                       8

 1   be free of --

 2                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Are you -- are you

 3   suggesting that there should be a different standard for

 4   those habeas petitioners who are -- whose counsel is

 5   appointed for them by the State or by the Federal

 6   government, as opposed to just a lawyer they hire?

 7   That's what I'm hearing you say.

 8                  MR. SCHER:    No, and I didn't mean to suggest

 9   that --

10                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         All right.   So if the

11   standard is going to be the same -- I -- I go back to

12   Justice Alito's question, which is, the Eleventh Circuit

13   is saying negligence/gross negligence, the line is too

14   fine to draw.     But there is a difference in a line

15   between negligence, however one defines it, and an

16   intentional, bad faith, dishonest, conflicted

17   malfeasance.

18                  MR. SCHER:    Correct.

19                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         All right.   Why isn't

20   that a more workable line, given that you can't have

21   equitable tolling without exceptional circumstances?

22                  MR. SCHER:    Correct enough, but I think

23   each -- well, certainly those were some of the

24   individual factors that the Eleventh Circuit discussed

25   when saying gross negligence isn't enough.             I think in

                                       9

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Mr. Holland's case --

 2                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         You haven't argued why

 3   not, is what I'm saying to you.             If exceptional

 4   circumstances has to mean something that really makes

 5   something exceptional, why is negligence of any variant

 6   exceptional?

 7                  MR. SCHER:    Because when you look at, for

 8   example, in this particular case, when we are talking

 9   about an exceptional circumstance, you're talking

10   about a lot of times -- and courts have done this --

11   is the confluence of what the attorney did or didn't do

12   versus what the petitioner did.

13                  So we have, of course -- along the lines of

14   the extraordinary circumstances here, we have

15   Petitioner's diligence.       And in some respects they

16   dovetail.   And I think what the Eleventh Circuit did was

17   say we don't care what the Petitioner did; we don't

18   really care what the lawyer did; anything the lawyer did

19   unless the lawyer was mentally ill or had divided

20   loyalties, then that's -- those are the only factors that

21   were going to be considered in terms of equitable

22   tolling.

23                  But that is -- that is antithetical to

24   the very nature of equity.          Here --

25                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        We've never held that

                                      10

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   equitable tolling for anything is available under this

 2   statute of limitations here.

 3                MR. SCHER:     That's correct.         This Court,

 4   however --

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:         And why should it be?        It

 6   seems to me, this is not like the ordinary statute of

 7   limitations, where it says, you know, the statute is five

 8   years, and courts make all sorts of necessary exceptions

 9   to the five years.   But here you have a statute that --

10   that provides exceptions, for example, "the limitation

11   period shall run from the latest of the date on which

12   the impediment to filing an application created by State

13   action in violation ... is removed." In other words, we're

14   going to toll it for that particular event.

15                "The date on which the constitutional right

16   asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme

17   Court" -- we're going to toll it for that.

18                "The date on which the factual predicate of

19   the claim or claims presented could have been discovered

20   through exercise of due diligence."

21                Many of -- many of the equitable tolling

22   holdings involved precisely that.             We'll toll it since

23   you couldn't have found out about the violation within

24   the statutory period.

25                But all of these things are handled already

                                     11

 1   in 2244(d).     Why should we -- why should we assume the

 2   right to create some additional exceptions from the --

 3   from the 1-year period?

 4                  MR. SCHER:    Well, with all due respect, I

 5   don't concur with the premise that those four particular

 6   subsections of 2244(d) are exceptions or -- or are

 7   tolling provisions.     Indeed, this Court in Jimenez said

 8   that those four, (a), (b), (c) and (d), are --

 9                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          How many circuits have

10   said that there is equitable tolling?

11                  MR. SCHER:    Eleven circuits -- all of the

12   circuits, and the only circuit that hasn't held that is

13   the D.C. Circuit where it remains an open question.                So

14   all of the circuits that have addressed --

15                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Then it's a question of

16   what are exceptional circumstances and whether it has to

17   be something deliberate, which is what the -- as I

18   understand it, the Michigan Court of Appeals said --

19   yes, if it was bad faith -- if it was a lie, a

20   deception --

21                  MR. SCHER:    Correct.        And, in fact --

22                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          So they're drawing the

23   line between intentional and -- and without intending

24   but just being careless.

25                  MR. SCHER:    Correct.        And, certainly here, I

 1   think we have what they deemed to be gross negligence,

 2   which I think certainly has an element of, let's say, for

 3   example, to use the term "recklessness."            I mean, we've

 4   got six or seven circuits which have addressed this

 5   particular issue in terms of this line between mere

 6   negligence and -- and something more than that, and those

 7   circuits have all -- in the 13 or 14 years since AEDPA

 8   has been around, all been able to effectively deal with

 9   these particular cases on their particular facts.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:        We have a case this

11   afternoon involving an opinion of ours named McNally,

12   which held that there's no such thing as a fraud action

13   for a right to honest services.           How many of the courts

14   of appeals had held that there did exist such a right

15   when we held that there didn't in McNally?

16                MR. SCHER:    I'm not familiar.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Every single court of

18   appeals that had faced it had held that there was such a

19   right.   So the mere fact that you have 11 court of

20   appeals that have found that they have extraordinary

21   power -- judges like to find that they have power -- and

22   that doesn't necessarily make it right.

23               MR. SCHER:    Well -- and I --

24                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Of course, that also

25   assumes that McNally was correctly decided --

 1                  (Laughter.)

 2                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           -- and I don't think it was.

 3               May I ask you another             question --

 4                  MR. SCHER:    Yes.

 5                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           -- prompted by Justice

 6   Kennedy's question?     Have any of the circuits taken a

 7   look at the probable merit of the underlying claim in

 8   evaluating the issue?

 9                  MR. SCHER:    In this particular case or in

10   another case?

11                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           No, not in this particular

12   case.   But Justice Kennedy says it's equally unjust to

13   the client whether it's negligence or gross negligence,

14   and I'm just asking whether in any of the reviews of this

15   issue, that you are familiar with, have they sometimes

16   looked at the probable merit of the claim, and if there

17   was merit, why, you were more disturbed about attorney

18   negligence, whereas if it's a frivolous claim, they

19   wouldn't be.     But do you know if any of them take a look

20   at that at all?

21                  MR. SCHER:    There are certainly some cases

22   that address the tolling and then, of course, address the

23   merits of the petition.       I don't know that there are any

24   that link the two.     But, certainly, if you have, for

25   example -- the Respondent has argued that the floodgates

                                      14

 1   are just going open, but certainly one of the -- one of

 2   the ways that a Federal district court can deal with

 3   this and has dealt with this in the past 13 years is to

 4   look at the petition.      And if the petition raises

 5   something that's so palpably meritless, you don't even

 6   need to get to anything about whether it's -- just

 7   dismiss the petition because, of course, the vast

 8   majority of cases that AEDPA addresses in this particular

 9   chapter are noncapital cases and are pro se cases.

10               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I looked in the brief to

11   see if there was reference to the merits, underlying

12   merits of the case.     Can you just tell me very quickly

13   what the key arguments are, if we ever reach the merits?

14               MR. SCHER:       In the Petitioner's case?

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Yes.

16               MR. SCHER:       He had -- well, there were a

17   number of issues that he raised on direct appeal.              There

18   was issues regarding counsel.              For example, I know in

19   the postconviction motion, one of the key issues was he

20   had a what's termed in Florida "a Nixon issue," which is

21   where counsel conceded some of the elements of the

22   crime.

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, I shouldn't probably

24   take your time with that.         I will look at the State

25   record.

 1               MR. SCHER:    But -- but --

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Mr. Scher, one point that

 3   you didn't mention, but you did I thought stress it in

 4   your brief, was that counsel here said:              Oh, the

 5   deadline had run even before I was engaged, even before

 6   I was appointed to represent this man, so there was

 7   nothing that I could do for him, because the time had

 8   already expired.

 9                MR. SCHER:    That's correct,

10   Justice Ginsburg.   What happened is that that particular

11   explanation came up after the fact.              I think what's

12   significant about that, number one, is that his

13   explanations have been a moving target to a large

14   extent.   But what's even more important is that none of

15   that information was ever imparted to Mr. Holland while

16   the case was pending.

17               While Mr. Collins was providing assurances

18   and reassurances to Mr. Holland -- about, don't

19   worry, your State postconviction motion will be filed

20   on time, your Federal rights will be honored, everything

21   will be done, your appeal will be taken, once we are

22   done in the Florida Supreme Court we will go off to the

23   Federal district court -- at no time did Mr. Collins ever

24   say:   We've got a big problem here; the statute may have

25   run, and so we need to start thinking in advance of ways

                                    16

 1   to deal with this.

 2               For example, if Mr. Collins truly

 3   believed that the statute had already run, the day the

 4   Florida Supreme Court issued that decision, he should

 5   have been in Federal court filing something right away.

 6                JUSTICE ALITO:        Could you just tell me in a

 7   sentence or two what test you think we should apply for

 8   equitable tolling?     What is necessary in order for there

 9   to be equitable tolling?

10                MR. SCHER:     Your Honor, I think the -- the

11   test is the test that this Court has applied, which is

12   in Pace and in Lawrence, which is extraordinary

13   circumstances coupled with diligence.             I think under

14   those particular -- coupled with diligence, the

15   Petitioner's diligence.

16                JUSTICE ALITO:        What does "extraordinary

17   circumstances" mean?

18                MR. SCHER:     It's -- it's a case-by-case type of

19   issue.   It's because it's an equitable remedy.            It's not

20   something that's susceptible to rigid rules, which of

21   course is the problem with the Eleventh Circuit's

22   categorical exclusion of a particular large chunk of

23   misconduct on the part of the attorney.             But certainly

24   here, where we have extraordinary circumstances, we have

25   lack of notice to the Petitioner that his State court

                                     17

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   opinion had been issued, that they had affirmed, that

 2   the mandate had come out; and a failure to communicate,

 3   wholesale failure to communicate, bordering on, in fact,

 4   abandonment --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:        All of that has nothing to

 6   do with -- with what caused -- what caused the inability

 7   to -- to bring the habeas action.

 8               MR. SCHER:     Well --

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:        All of that is -- is

10   preliminary to that.     This may have been a very

11   irresponsible lawyer, but that has nothing to do with

12   the event that -- the simple event, failure to file in

13   that what, 30-day period, which --

14               MR. SCHER:     Fourteen days.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Fourteen days.     It seems to

16   me "extraordinary" means unusual.           So you say any unusual

17   event is a possible?

18               MR. SCHER:     Well, I think the one --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Any unusual event is a

20   possible for a court to say, oh, yes, it says a year,

21   but this is unusual so we will give you a year and a

22   half.

23               MR. SCHER:     Well, I think what we have here

24   is what makes this case I think unusual, and it's the

25   first type of case that this Court has seen, is under

                                   18

                                 Official


 1   these circumstances you have this confluence of events.

 2   And I think what makes this case -- what sets this case

 3   apart from the other ones that this Court has seen and

 4   that certainly other courts have seen is, for example,

 5   it's extraordinary -- or it was diligent for Mr. Holland

 6   to have asked the Florida Supreme Court on two occasions

 7   to rid himself of Collins, and he asked to proceed pro se.

 8               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           The client -- this client

 9   was sort of the pesky client, but apparently knew a lot

10   more about AEDPA than most people generally do.           I mean,

11   AEDPA's not exactly an ordinary term.

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:        And had a lot of time to

13   devote to it.

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And -- and suppose you have a

15   client who is just bewildered.          He doesn't know AEDPA;

16   he doesn't know Federal court.          Why should he be in any

17   worse position than this client?

18               MR. SCHER:    Well --

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It seems to me it would be

20   the other way around.     This fellow knew enough that, if

21   he had really just done a little bit more, he would have

22   -- well, he tried to file a petition, but he might have

23   done a little bit more.

24              MR. SCHER:     Well, I think --

25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But the uninformed client,

                                   19

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the ignorant client, could never have approached this.

 2   I don't know why he shouldn't be more protected than

 3   your client, which goes back to Justice Alito's question.

 4   I'm not sure how we draw this line.

 5                 MR. SCHER:     I think the problem we have here

 6   with Mr. Holland is that the more diligent he was, the

 7   more the Respondent and the lower courts have said he

 8   should have done.    And so he did X, Y, and Z; they say

 9   you should have done A, B, and C.

10                 But what I think is -- is significant here

11   is he was stuck with this lawyer.              He tried to get rid of

12   the lawyer.     The State filed motions saying you can't --

13   not only can you not fire him, you can't file a pro se

14   motion because you are represented by the lawyer.              So all

15   Mr. Holland hears from the courts is that:             You can't speak

16   to us and we can't speak to you.             So he's stuck.

17                 And then, of course, he's writing to the

18   Florida Supreme Court clerk begging for information, and

19   in fact in footnote 11 of the brief --

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But he never asked -- he

21   wrote to the clerk, but he never asked to be informed

22   when the judgment came down.

23                 MR. SCHER:     Well, what we have, Your Honor,

24   is if you look on page 11, in footnote 11, Mr. Holland

25   wrote a letter to the Florida Supreme Court clerk,

                                      20

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   toward the end of which he says:             "I'm not trying to get

 2   on your nerves.     I would just like to know exactly what

 3   is happening with my case on appeal to the Supreme Court

 4   of Florida."

 5                  So we certainly have in the clerk's office

 6   -- and, again, that was on page 11, footnote 11.              It's

 7   also at the Joint Appendix at 146 to 147.

 8                  What we have here is Petitioner putting the

 9   Florida Supreme Court on explicit notice that he is

10   having a problem with his lawyer, and further -- earlier

11   in that particular letter, he apologizes to the clerk,

12   saying:    I'm sorry to pester you with these -- with these

13   requests, but if I had a lawyer who was responding to my

14   letters and who was listening to me and who would send

15   me the documentations, I wouldn't have to be bothering

16   you, but this is the situation that I'm in.

17                  And then, of course, he tries to not only have

18   Mr. Collins substituted, but he asks to go pro se.

19   That's an extraordinary circumstance.              And what makes it

20   even further, more extraordinary is the State coming in

21   and saying, no, you can't not only do that, but you are

22   not even allowed to file the paperwork asking to do

23   that.     And, in fact, when Mr. Holland did file his pro se

24   petition in Federal district court, the State moved to

25   strike it because he was represented by -- by counsel.

                                      21

 1   And so --

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Is this case

 3   different if the filing error -- I understand there was

 4   a lot going on, but if the lawyer just miscalculated the

 5   days and was off by one day, this case comes out the

 6   other way in your view, right?

 7                MR. SCHER:    I think not only under my -- I

 8   think, certainly, courts have -- have discussed this, that

 9   that's -- that's just an unfortunate mere mistake.              But I

10   think certainly we don't have that under the facts of

11   this case.   There has never been any suggestion that

12   there was any miscalculation.           We just have

13   complete abandonment by -- by the --

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         I don't -- you say --

15   you say "complete abandonment."           But this lawyer filed a

16   whole lot of things on behalf of this client.               He missed

17   a very critical thing, the Federal habeas filing.               But

18   it's not abandonment of a client in the sense of not

19   doing anything for the client.

20                So it goes back to my beginning question,

21   which is, where is the line drawn between the types of

22   negligence and what the circuit suggested, which is some

23   sort of intentional malfeasance?

24                MR. SCHER:    And I didn't mean to suggest --

25   when I -- when I used the word "abandonment," I'm -- I'm

                                    22

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   referring to, of course, in terms of abandonment with

 2   regard to preserving -- enforcing the assurances that

 3   Collins had made with respect to filing the petition.

 4               And, of course, he also had told -- that --

 5   Mr. Holland that he would inform him of the Florida

 6   Supreme Court's decision, because that, of course, is

 7   the triggering date.

 8               We have Mr. Holland, who had already been --

 9   you know, asked his lawyer, you know, please file

10   certain issues in my case and please keep me informed.

11   When those two promises and assurances were not kept by

12   the lawyer, Mr. Holland at that point has reason to be

13   concerned that the additional promise, which is, I will

14   file on time, was not going to be honored.

15               And so Mr. Holland embarked on a series of

16   diligent steps in order to get some information, but he

17   didn't know where to turn.         And, then, of course, for

18   example, he writes to the clerk's office of the supreme

19   court.   Sometimes they send him information; sometimes

20   they tell him to send a check.

21               He doesn't know.             He is not getting any

22   consistency, and he's certainly not getting any response

23   from his attorney.

24               Then he files these motions in the State

25   supreme court, which are opposed by the State as

                                     23

 1   nullities because he is represented by counsel.           He then

 2   writes to the Florida Supreme Court saying, can you give

 3   me the information about your Web site -- maybe I can have

 4   some friends look up this case.           Because, of course, he

 5   knows at this point that there is a problem, and he

 6   knows that the triggering date for the filing in the

 7   Federal petition is the denial by the Florida Supreme

 8   Court and the issuance of the mandate.

 9                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Then you are -- you

10   seem, from what you just said, to be relying on a

11   distinction between paid counsel, who is just as

12   careless, and court-appointed counsel, because in the

13   one case the client had picked that attorney, and in the

14   other case, the client was given this attorney by the

15   State.   So I think you're suggesting that the State has

16   some responsibility when it provides the counsel.

17                But before you said, no, your answer would

18   be the same if you were not making a distinction between

19   court-appointed and paid counsel.

20                MR. SCHER:    I think the -- the distinction

21   that I was making -- I'm not saying that there's a

22   difference in terms of paid or appointed counsel, but

23   here where you have appointed counsel, I think one of

24   the extraordinary factors is the State coming in and --

25   and moving to strike these pro se pleadings, telling

                                    24

 1   Mr. -- sending a signal to Mr. Holland that you are

 2   stuck with Collins, you can't speak to the supreme

 3   court, and the supreme court can't speak to you.

 4   Everything has to be funneled through your lawyer.

 5                  And, of course, the ironic thing is that, had

 6   Mr. Holland been permitted to proceed pro se, he would

 7   have gotten copied with the decision by the supreme

 8   court of Florida.     He would have gotten copied with the

 9   mandate.     And then he would have known when the mandate

10   issued.

11                  And as we know, when he found out -- I mean,

12   the other extraordinary factor here is that when he

13   found out that this happened, he prepared that petition

14   that day and mailed it the next day.                This is not

15   somebody who sat on his rights.             He didn't start

16   complaining and writing letters and bemoaning his

17   situation.     He took action, which also distinguishes

18   this case from a number of others.

19                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I guess I understand

20   what the cases have said.         I -- I have trouble

21   understanding why that should make a difference, why

22   that should be so pertinent, why he should be in better

23   shape than somebody who says:             Look, I don't know

24   anything about this.     I need a good lawyer.               This is what

25   I get.     I'm trusting you.      Tell me what I should do, and I

 2                 And that person is in somehow worse shape?

 3                  MR. SCHER:    Well, because in Lawrence and in --

 4   in Coleman this Court had -- had said that that made a

 5   difference.     In Lawrence, this Court had said Lawrence

 6   was out of luck because it's not like he asked for

 7   another lawyer or asked to proceed pro se.                And so

 8   Holland -- and so Lawrence was stuck.

20   information question before you -- are the postconviction

21   lawyers in these cases that are appointed, are they

22   compensated by the State?

23                  MR. MAKAR:    Yes, they are.

24                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           They are.

 1   course of your argument, how -- how often do these

 2   deadlines missed (a) in capital cases and (b) in AEDPA

 3   cases?     Do you have any statistics on that, or can you

 4   tell us from your experience?

 5                 MR. MAKAR:     I can tell you anecdotally the

 6   attorneys that handle these cases in Florida, that the

 7   equitable tolling issue comes up with some regularity.

 8   I'm aware of three cases just in Jacksonville where I

 9   live where the district judge there has had evidentiary

10   hearings and has looked at these equitable tolling issues.

11                 In Florida, we have 394 individuals on death

12   row, and those cases are at various stages in the

13   litigation.    So there is a certain amount of that that

14   goes on.

15                 As to the noncapital cases, we know that

16   the system is flooded with habeas petitions.             Obviously,

17   most of those are unrepresented.             But there still is, in

18   those cases -- a study I saw recently, a 2007 study from

19   Vanderbilt University, that about 20 percent of those

20   cases are dismissed on statute of limitations grounds.

21   I'm inferring from that that there is some equitable

22   tolling action going on there, but the specific amount

23   we're not sure of.    But certainly in both the capital

24   and noncapital area, this is an issue.

25                 And if I could get to the standard here,

                                      27

 1   obviously, we're asking this Court to use the analysis

 2   it has done in other cases to find that there is no

 3   equitable tolling whatsoever.             We --

 4                  JUSTICE BREYER:        You mean to imply that

 5   earthquake, fire, flood, mad postman burns mail truck,

 6   et cetera?

 7                  MR. MAKAR:    Precisely, Your Honor.            I

 8   mean --

 9                  JUSTICE BREYER:        So, even if it's a terrible

10   earthquake, all these people are just out of luck?

11                  MR. MAKAR:    Well -- well, there are some,

12   certainly, safety valves if there's a natural disaster,

13   some --

14                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Well, why?     Natural

15   disaster, yes, you said no equitable tolling, they're

16   out of luck?

17                  MR. MAKAR:    Well -- well, for example, the

18   Rules of Federal Procedure were recently amended to

19   allow for late filing when the courthouse is inaccessible.

20                  JUSTICE BREYER:        The statute?

21                  MR. MAKAR:    Precisely, Your Honor.            And we

22   think --

23                  JUSTICE BREYER:        And, so, are you -- you

24   read the statute to say in some cases, you could do it.

25   If you're going to read it in some cases you can do it,

                                      28

 1   then I guess we're at a discussion of is this one of

 2   those cases?

 3               MR. MAKAR:    Well, two responses.        Number

 4   one, we do not believe that equitable tolling was

 5   intended by Congress under this complex statute of

 6   limitations for all the reasons set out in our brief.

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:        So that's earthquake,

 8   fire, flood, et cetera?

 9               MR. MAKAR:    Exactly.        And it relates to the

10   same result, it seems -- to the same result as this Court

11   came to in Beggerly and Brockamp, where the -- if

12   Congress intended that to be the case, that's the case.

13               JUSTICE ALITO:       What if the lawyer lies to

14   the client and the client says my time is running out,

15   have you filed my -- my Federal habeas petition, and the

16   lawyer says, yes, I filed it and here it is, and it has

17   a -- a forged date stamp on it?          No equitable tolling

18   there?

19               MR. MAKAR:    Well, under our position that

20   Congress intended to draw a very clear line, no.           If

21   the -- if the Court assumes or decides there is some

22   sort of equitable tolling, then that's a different case,

23   and -- and in those situations where there's something

24   beyond the incompetence of the lawyer.          And that's our rule.

25   If the Court decides there is equitable tolling or

                                   29

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   assumes it exists, it has to be that the rule that the

 2   incompetence of the postconviction counsel cannot be a

 3   basis for relief.

 4                  That's what this Court has essentially said

 5   in Lawrence and also in Coleman, and also what Congress

 6   inferentially said in -- in 2254(i).

 7                  So, under those circumstances, here our rule

 8   works because you don't get into those gradations of

 9   negligence, you know, is it gross negligence?              Well,

10   how gross? And the bottom line here in this particular case,

11   of course -- and the Court has asked these questions

12   here -- is what really happened in this case?              All you

13   had was a Lawrence error, which was --

14                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Well, why should it matter?

15   It's certainly unusual.       Isn't that what we are after, one,

16   is he diligent?     Answer, yes, he has been diligent.

17                  Two, is it extraordinary?           I would think it

18   was fairly extraordinary that a person writes these letters

19   to counsel and so forth, then the -- the thing isn't

20   filed.     Is that extraordinary or not?

21                  Whether it was his fault, whether he himself

22   was kidnapped.     I mean, maybe it wasn't the counsel's

23   fault.     You can imagine a lot of circumstances.           But the

24   question, I would think, is, is it extraordinary and is

25   it fair?

 1                MR. MAKAR:    Well, the answer -- is it

 2   extraordinary?   The answer is no.           This is common --

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:        You mean counsel in Florida

 4   often when -- miss deadlines and so forth when their

 5   counsel -- when their client specifically says to them,

 6   even a few weeks before and by mail several times,

 7   please file such-and-such, is not extraordinary in

 8   Florida?

 9                MR. MAKAR:    It's not just Florida; it's

10   nationwide there's -- there's problem with this complex

11   statute of limitations --

12                JUSTICE BREYER:        We have a problem with

13   the bar, don't we, if -- if -- if the -- if --

14                (Laughter.)

15                MR. MAKAR:    Well, there -- there has been no

16   bar discipline, to my knowledge, for missing a

17   deadline.   And that -- and this Court has held that is not

18   an extraordinary circumstance, in Lawrence.            The only --

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I -- I -- I didn't hear.

20   You say there has been discipline or there --

21                MR. MAKAR:    To my knowledge, there has not

22   been for missing a deadline.

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           If we or -- this would

24   probably be the Congress -- assuming some rule maker had

 1   authority to do this, would it make sense to say

 2   that the State is going to be subject to equitable

 3   tolling on a rather broad standard -- we're going to

 4   give equitable tolling often -- unless the State has

 5   attorney discipline procedures, so that this happens

 6   only once and then the attorney can no longer practice

 7   in the Federal courts?

 8                MR. MAKAR:     I suppose as a matter of --

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Obviously, what we're

10   looking for is some sort of a rule to keep the deadline,

11   and if we're going to accommodate your friend on the

12   other side, to have -- to have some rule about

13   exceptional -- exceptional cases.

14                MR. MAKAR:     Well, perhaps something along

15   those lines legislatively might be -- be considered, but

16   -- but in the end, what we have here is garden-variety

17   attorney negligence miscalculating and missing a

18   deadline.   The --

19                JUSTICE ALITO:        Isn't there at least one

20   additional thing here?      Holland filed a request -- a pro

21   se request to be relieved of Collins's representation,

22   and that was rejected by the -- that was rejected by the

23   court because he was pro se.             And therefore he couldn't

24   ask -- he couldn't file something himself?

25                MR. MAKAR:     Well, let me clarify that,

                                     32

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   because there's a misconception going on here.              In the

 2   Florida Supreme Court postconviction process, Collins

 3   -- I'm sorry, Holland twice filed motions to remove

 4   Collins.     Importantly, Holland never asked to go pro se.

 5   That is incorrect.     If you look at Joint Appendix 134

 6   and 149 -- those are the two pro se filings that Holland

 7   made here.     In both of those, he said: I'm having a

 8   conflict with my lawyer.        My lawyer won't do what I want

 9   him to do; I want a new lawyer.

10        And that's all he said:              I want a new lawyer.

11   He never --

12                 JUSTICE ALITO:        Was that denied on the

13   ground that he was pro se?

14                 MR. MAKAR:     The first motion was stricken.

15   It was then denied because he was represented by counsel

16   at that point.    Keep in mind, this is in the State

17   postconviction process.       This is not where the Federal

18   AEDPA deadline and so forth is being kicked about.               In

19   fact, there is really no discussion whatsoever about

20   what the actual deadline to file this petition was at

21   all in the record.

22                 The only time Holland asked to go pro se in

23   any court filing is after he filed the pro se petition

24   in Federal court -- the untimely one.              He then shortly

25   thereafter filed an emergency motion to relieve Collins,

                                      33

 1   and --

 2               JUSTICE ALITO:          What I don't understand is,

 3   how can a -- how can a client request to have -- to be

 4   relieved of representation, if the client can't file

 5   that motion pro se?     I understand the other things, but

 6   I don't understand why -- how -- how you can deny the

 7   request to get rid of this lawyer?                 Unless he has to

 8   have the lawyer file the motion for him?

 9               (Laughter.)

10               MR. MAKAR:       No, I think that certainly the

11   filing of the motion, I think perhaps it was -- it shouldn't

12   have been stricken the first time, but the court then on the

13   merits denied it the second time.              And keep in mind -- I

14   forget who alluded to it -- this has been somewhat of an

15   unusual case from the outset, in that if you look at the

16   three Florida Supreme Court opinions that have been

17   issued in this case, it shows that at the first trial

18   Holland absented himself from the -- absented himself

19   from the trial and he had to watch on circuit --

20   closed-circuit TV because he was being very difficult.

21               And then in the second trial, we had two

22   Faretta hearings amounting to hundreds of pages in which

23   the Florida Supreme Court then said, well, he wants to

24   represent himself, but he can't conduct himself properly

25   and so forth.   And also there's the issue of his -- his

                                      34

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   -- there's a mental issue there as well, that he has

 2   raised on appeal as well.

 3                  So the court -- the Florida courts are sort

 4   of put in this difficult posture of saying, we want you

 5   to have counsel, we need you to have counsel because we

 6   want you to have effective representation, but then

 7   throughout the process here it's been a difficult,

 8   difficult number of decades, essentially, in this

 9   situation.     So I think it's an unfair characterization

10   to say that the Florida courts and also the Office of

11   Attorney General who -- who routinely moves to

12   strike these -- it's not because we're trying to deny

13   anyone's day in court.       It's because you have a lawyer

14   and they have to speak to the lawyer, and the hybrid

15   representation is impermissible.             So --

16                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Can we go back to

17   just --

18                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          The State -- the State

19   has no responsibility even though it made this

20   appointment?     So you agree there's no difference,

21   whether it was paid counsel, somebody that the -- that

22   the defendant picked to represent him, and someone that

23   he just had to take because it's what the State gave him?

24                  MR. MAKAR:    Exactly.        And -- and that's the

25   way the Court's decision in Coleman has allocated the

                                      35

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   burdens and the risks.     I mean, what the Court said was

 2   okay, if it's a direct appeal where the State is charged

 3   with that responsibility, that's one thing; but when

 4   it's postconviction, it's shifted.              The whole paradigm

 5   and whole structure is flipped the other way, and you,

 6   the Petitioner, bear the burden, and not the State.

 7   This is important under AEDPA, because AEDPA --

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Under -- on direct appeal,

 9   if counsel conducted himself this way, the State

10   would -- he'd have to get relief because the State

11   would have the burden, but not -- not on collateral?

12   Is that what you're saying?

13               MR. MAKAR:     Sure.       On direct appeal, if the

14   lawyer is deemed to be ineffective, then that would be a

15   constitutional error, and that would be subject to some

16   sort of relief, but it flips in the postconviction

17   stage, as this Court has held in Coleman.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Counsel, I'm

19   concerned about some of the situations Justice Breyer

20   mentions, you know, if there is an earthquake, a plane

21   crash, but the law seems to be focusing on other things

22   when it's talking about extraordinary circumstances.

23   Like here, we're talking about how diligent he was in

24   pursuing his lawyer.     There seems to be a disconnect

25   there.

 1                 I don't know why -- I mean, assuming we're

 2   going to have, for argument, equitable tolling, what

 3   should we be looking at?       The unusual nature of the

 4   situation that comes up, or whether you've got a pesky

 5   client?

 6                 MR. MAKAR:    Well, I think two responses

 7   there:    Obviously, we believe that attorney incompetence

 8   or so forth cannot be a basis for equitable tolling.

 9   These other situations about natural disasters and

10   hypotheticals where some, you know, very unusual, bizarre

11   situation comes in that's external to the

12   attorney-client relationship, perhaps those -- those

13   could be considered.

14                 But we believe that the Congress, through its

15   purpose in enacting this statute of limitations, a

16   complex one that has exceptions, that -- that is

17   designed to alleviate the burdens and delays -- its intent

18   was not to allow equitable tolling, because we --

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, but it

20   legislated against the background of cases like Irwin

21   that stated the general proposition is, unless Congress

22   says otherwise, there is equitable tolling.

23                 MR. MAKAR:    But that can be rebutted.            That

24   can be rebutted, and we believe has been rebutted by the

25   record here, which shows that these are precisely the

                                     37

 1   kind of delays that Congress intended to avoid by having

 2   a strict 1-year statute of limitations, that there's

 3   burdens put on -- not just the States but the courts --

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            I -- what I worry about

 5   is that you're confusing the -- or perceive --

 6   confusing the fact that lawyer negligence may not be the

 7   type of situation that Congress was looking at.            With

 8   the hypotheticals that Justice Breyer listed, which are

 9   a different kind of situation, and you are trying to

10   pigeonhole both and say Congress didn't intend for both

11   to be covered.    And yet you suggested a little later

12   that they may have intended what Justice Breyer was

13   thinking about.    I -- I don't see anything in the

14   structure of the statute that would preclude what

15   Justice Breyer listed.

16               MR. MAKAR:      Well --

17               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            So what can we read to

18   suggest that -- forget about the lawyer malfeasance;

19   let's talk just about equitable tolling

20               MR. MAKAR:    Sure.          Well --

21               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            -- in its traditional

22   sense.   Most of the cases in equitable tolling, by the way,

23   have to do with court errors.

24               MR. MAKAR:      Sure.        What we're suggesting is

25   that under the structure of the Brockamp decision, what

                                     38

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the Court looked at there to determine when there is no

 2   equitable tolling intended by Congress, that here

 3   likewise there is no equitable tolling, and as the Court

 4   held in Brockamp, the fact that there may be unfairness

 5   in individual cases was the price Congress was willing

 6   to pay, the tradeoff it was willing to allow, to have a

 7   habeas system that was functioning.

 8                Now, assuming that position is rejected by

 9   the Court or the Court assumes equitable tolling, the

10   next question is what should be allowed.               And we believe

11   it has to be exceptionally narrow.               And certainly in

12   this case -- and this case is all about attorney

13   negligence or attorney gross negligence -- those --

14   those sort of circumstances are not enough.               And --

15                JUSTICE BREYER:        Why could you not say

16   here -- I mean, the key sentence, I take it, is the

17   Eleventh Circuit and it says:           "No allegation of lawyer

18   negligence or failure to meet the standard of care" --

19   none -- without "proof, bad faith, dishonesty, mental

20   impairment" on the part of the lawyer, could ever

21   qualify.

22                Now, that's -- so we just say, no, no, that

23   isn't so.   Sometimes it could, when combined with other

24   circumstances.   And then go back and let them -- I don't

25   know what this particular individual Petitioner's prior

 1   conduct has been.    I understand the problems that you

 2   have.   But do you -- I guess you're going to say no to

 3   this, but -- but it's a little hard to see why you couldn't

 4   have a narrow standard but just not rule out the

 5   possibility that under certain circumstances, just

 6   negligence or even less -- maybe the lawyer wasn't even

 7   at fault; maybe he got kidnapped.           You know, I mean, there

 8   are odd things that happen in life.            And just say go look for

 9   this; see if it's truly extraordinary, if it's fair, if

10   he was diligent.    What about that?

11                MR. MAKAR:    Well, we agree with the Eleventh

12   Circuit standard to the extent it says, you know, that this

13   sort of attorney negligence, gross negligence, incompetence,

14   is not enough.   Where we differ from the Eleventh Circuit

15   is we're concerned, based upon our pragmatic day-in,

16   day-out handling of these cases, that when you say

17   dishonesty, well -- or a conflict -- that those concepts

18   can be conflated into things that they are not,

19   particularly when these communications between lawyer

20   and client are outside the State's view.            We are not

21   privy to what goes on between lawyer and client.           The

22   lawyer says, I will do this, says it verbally or maybe

23   even in writing.    We don't know about that.         We're not

24   privy to all that.

25                And it creates this potential, when we allow

 1   the standard, as the Eleventh Circuit held -- we allow the

 2   standard to gravitate away from its core purpose and

 3   allows it to be used to sort of game the system in a way

 4   to gain an advantage.      That's why we are concerned about

 5   any degree of attorney misconduct or behavior because it

 6   could easily --

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Do you have any idea,

 8   before the Eleventh Circuit announced its standard, how

 9   many habeas petitions were tolled by district courts in

10   that -- in your -- in Florida, on the basis of equitable

11   tolling, that -- that they permitted petitions to go

12   forward after the statute of limitations?

13                MR. MAKAR:      Unfortunately, I'm not aware of

14   any data on that.     There are not that many.

15                JUSTICE BREYER:          So would there be -- I

16   mean, what I'm actually worried about is not a lawyer

17   being kidnapped.     I'm actually worried what can

18   happen in a person's life.          He gets deathly ill.    His wife

19   gets sick.   Something happens to the children.            Some very

20   unusual thing comes along at the last minute, and all the

21   plans go awry.     And to have a little bit of flexibility

22   in this statute to take care of those very unusual human

23   circumstances seems a reasonable reading of it.            But you

24   say it's not because --

25                MR. MAKAR:      Well, we say it's not because

 1   Congress intended not to have equitable tolling, and

 2   then to the extent it did, it could have drafted

 3   something along the lines of what's in 2263, which is

 4   the next chapter -- it's the companion chapter that says

 5   instead of having 365 days with no equitable tolling,

 6   you can have 180 days and 30 days for good cause if

 7   there's a deadline missed --

 8                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              You're not -- you're

 9   not worried about Justice Breyer's case of the really

10   extraordinary circumstance where everybody would say,

11   well, that's -- you know, we understand.                 You're

12   worried that if you create an exception, that all sorts

13   of other stuff will come in.              And so why isn't the answer

14   to that concern that you've got an unusual case here

15   where you do have the client saying, do this, do this,

16   do this, and the lawyer doesn't?

17                  MR. MAKAR:    Well, under these facts --

18                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              It's very hard to

19   argue against -- against equity, against equitable

20   tolling.    But at the same time, I think you do need a

21   constraining principle that it doesn't do away with the

22   statute of limitations.       So why isn't what we have here

23   good enough?

24                  MR. MAKAR:    Meaning the Eleventh Circuit's

25   standard?

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Meaning the fact

 2   that you have got a client who is constantly telling the

 3   lawyer, do this, you know, get it done; doesn't get the

 4   judgment.   And, you know, it's not just your run-of-the-mill

 5   case where the lawyer happens to miss a deadline.

 6                MR. MAKAR:      Well, that goes to the issue

 7   that -- of not -- of diligence, of course, which is not

 8   the issue we're looking at.           We're looking at the

 9   extraordinary circumstances, not the diligence.

10   Extraordinary circumstance has to be something that --

11   attributable to the lawyer or something along those lines.

12                We're not -- we'll concede diligence for the

13   moment and say here it's what the lawyer did, as

14   Lawrence held.     He missed the deadline.              In fact,

15   this case -- you know, Lawrence, obviously -- it was 364

16   days before they even filed the State postconviction motion,

17   and the lawyer in that case wasn't appointed for 300 days,

18   and the State postconvictions process was sort of in

19   disarray.   And all those things that the Court in

20   Lawrence said are not supportable for equitable tolling

21   apply equally here.

22                The only difference in this case is this

23   allegation about the -- the lawyer didn't communicate

24   with his client.     Well, if that becomes the governing rule,

25   all is lost, because attorney communication with client

                                      43

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   is perhaps even more amorphous a concept.            It could be

 2   based on verbal representations and so forth.            So we are

 3   very concerned that it not slip into that sphere where

 4   it can be easily manipulated for the advantage of

 5   getting some sort of delay.

 6                 And as I say, the analysis here of

 7   purpose of AEDPA, structure of AEDPA, and the

 8   burdens -- as I say, the burdens are important to the

 9   State and to the court system.           I was looking at that

10   recent study, the 2007 study, that seemed to suggest

11   that AEDPA is -- basically, when these cases are being

12   filed in Federal district court, it has taken a year and

13   a half to 2, 3 years for them to be resolved, and in

14   this case keep in mind it took 18 months in the district

15   court, 18 months in the Eleventh Circuit, and then

16   further.

17                 But that's allowing the invocation of this

18   doctrine, not just in this case.            We're worried about the

19   noncapital context as well, that that will somehow put

20   an end to the importance of what Congress enacted.

21                 There is a pre-AEDPA mentality out there,

22   I'm afraid.   And it's natural.          It's understandable.

23   We're all human.    There's a pre-AEDPA mentality that

24   there must be a remedy.      There must be some equity done.

25   And I think that sort of undergirds why perhaps most of

                                     44

 1   the circuits have either assumed -- I think 11 have

 2   either assumed or adopted some sort of equitable

 3   tolling.

 4                 I think they are waiting for this Court,

 5   which has left the question open to provide guidance on

 6   that issue, and we suggest that either there be no

 7   equitable tolling or that, if there is to be equitable

 8   tolling, on the circumstances of this case it has to be

 9   extreme attorney misconduct or incompetence, and that

10   just simply is not established on this record.

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              What -- why isn't it

12   extreme attorney incompetence to miss a deadline?               I

13   mean, you either miss it or you don't.               It's not going

14   to get -- why doesn't that qualify as extreme attorney

15   misconduct?

16                 MR. MAKAR:    Well, I guess the short answer,

17   of course, is the courts have said no, that's not

18   enough, we need something that's truly extreme,

19   something far from just missing a deadline.                We probably

20   all know lawyers who have missed deadlines.                We all know

21   lawyers who haven't communicated with their clients.

22   Those things are ordinary, run-of-the-mill, happen-every-day

23   sort of events.    It has to be something beyond that.

24   It has to be something that is truly extreme for

25   the exception to kick in.

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              That's worse than

 5   missing the deadline.

 6                 MR. MAKAR:    I mean, the example I've tossed

 7   about in our conversations is -- is to say, well, what if

 8   the postconviction lawyer is bribed by the victim's family

 9   to not file something on time?             I mean, oh gosh, that

10   strikes us all as just -- that's --

17   has to be criminal behavior?

19   just attorney incompetence.          What the -- that's a

20   concept that we can get our arms around, and we

21   certainly get into this line-drawing of, well, is a

22   failure to communicate three or four times enough?                  Or a

23   failure to have a letter go to the client in response to

 1   question?   It doesn't go to the merits, but I'm really

 2   curious.    The lawyers selected for postconviction work,

 3   which I understand now are compensated by the State, are

 4   they selected from the same panels as the lawyers that

 5   represent defendants generally and who are appointed by

 6   the State in criminal matters?

 7                MR. MAKAR:     Well, there's a collateral counsel

 8   registry list.

 9               JUSTICE STEVENS:         Is it --

10               MR. MAKAR:    There's actually what they call

11   CCRC. There's actually State lawyers around the State who

12   provide this, and then there's a registry list as well.

13   And they have to meet certain standards.             Chapter 27 of

14   our Florida Statutes set out the standards that these

15   counsel have to meet.

16                JUSTICE STEVENS:            But the collateral counsel

17   registry is a different group of lawyers than are

 5                    REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TODD G. SCHER

 6                          ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 7                 MR. SCHER:    I just have a couple of brief

 8   points.    First, to clarify, the Respondent argued that

 9   Mr. Holland never asked to proceed pro se in the State

10   court, and that's just incorrect, and it's flatly

11   contradicted by their brief on page 43, where they

12   write:    "Holland moved to replace Collins with another

13   attorney (whom Holland presumably thought would raise

14   any issues Holland desired) or to proceed pro se if

15   substitute counsel could not be appointed."

16                 And I think, again, going back to one of

17   the things that Justice Breyer was discussing with

18   Respondent's counsel, was I think that that -- the

19   problem with the Eleventh Circuit's analysis is this

20   categorical exclusion.      Equitable tolling and

21   extraordinary circumstances have to be considered as

22   a -- consider all the circumstances, and so to

23   categorically exclude this one particular area,

24   we submit, is what the problem is here.

25                And we also do have, contrary to what

                                     48

 1   the Respondent contended --

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But you would say --

 3   it is -- you could categorically excuse ordinary

 4   negligence as opposed to gross negligence?

 5               MR. SCHER:     That's where courts, including

 6   this Court, have drawn the line.           That seems to be the

 7   floor, but, you know, obviously, when you get into the

 8   particular circumstances of a case, that's where a

 9   categorical rule excluding a particular type of area

10   beyond just garden-variety neglect -- really, that's

11   the problem here, is that was antithetical to the

12   notion of equity.

13               And I just wanted to point out briefly that

14   this record does avail itself of numerous instances where

15   Mr. Holland had alleged that the attorney lied to him.            JA

16   -- in the Joint Appendix on 170, Mr. Holland writes that

17   Mr. Collins lied to him.      On the Joint Appendix on 194,

18   that Mr. Collins deceived him and misled him --

19              JUSTICE ALITO:       What were the lies?

20              MR. SCHER:    -- about when the petition was

21   going to be --

22               JUSTICE ALITO:        What was -- give me an example

23   of a lie that he told him?

24               MR. SCHER:     These were in the context of Mr.

25   Collins telling Mr. Holland that he would protect his

                                    49

 1   Federal habeas rights.      Those --

 2               JUSTICE ALITO:         Doesn't that go without

 3   saying, that every attorney -- and every attorney presumably

 4   undertakes not to miss the statute of limitations?                Is

 5   there a difference between the attorney who simply says

 6   nothing and the attorney who says, yes, I'm not going to

 7   miss the statute of limitations?

 8               MR. SCHER:      I think it makes it more --

 9               JUSTICE ALITO:         That's a lie?

10               MR. SCHER:      I think it makes it makes

11   it more extraordinary.      And what makes that situation

12   even yet more extraordinary is where the client has

13   tried to rid himself of this lawyer on a number of

14   occasions or to go pro se, precisely because he has been

15   experiencing these -- these -- lack of trust and other

16   problems in terms of these deceptions from his lawyer,

17   so he was really hamstrung by the time that --

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                If I'm worried --

19              MR. SCHER:     -- it was too late.

20              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             If I'm worried about

21   the open-ended nature of what you're asking for, how --

22   how would you state the test you would like in the most

23   restrictive terms?

24               MR. SCHER:      I think in terms -- I think the

25   test would be appropriate, what Justice Breyer

                                     50

 1   articulated, which is --

 2                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Hurricane or

 3   kidnapping?

 4                  MR. SCHER:    No, no.

 5                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Oh, the different

 6   one.

 7                  (Laughter.)

 8                  MR. SCHER:    No, the other test, the other

 9   test.   We need a hurricane exception in Florida.

10                  But in terms of the Eleventh Circuit was

11   incorrect in excluding this particular type of attorney

12   misconduct and negligence because that's antithetical

13   to equity, and so I think --

14                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              What type -- the

15   problem comes up when you say "this type of attorney

16   negligence."

17                  What is your test?         What type of --

18                  MR. SCHER:    I certainly think, given the

19   unique facts here, we have, again, the confluence of

20   circumstances.     We have the --

21                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              No, I know your test

22   will mean your client wins.

23                 MR. SCHER:     Correct.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           But, I mean, can you

25   articulate it more -- because I'm very concerned that if

                                      51

 1   you start saying, well, you can forgive an inequitable case,

 2   every time a case comes up, you're going to -- there's

 3   going to be sympathy for the client.               The lawyer goofed.

 4                  Of course, you don't want to penalize the

 5   client, but Congress obviously had something more in

 6   mind.

 7                  MR. SCHER:    Well, but certainly -- but the other

 8   part of the test for equitable tolling is diligence, and

 9   I think, when -- when one looks at the -- at the body of

10   case law that has developed since 1997 on the issue of

11   equitable tolling and AEDPA, the vast majority of these

12   cases are disposed on the fact that the Petitioner is

13   indiligent.

14                  Here, of course, the Respondent, if I heard

15   correctly, is now conceding that the Petitioner was

16   diligent.     And so there are certainly other ways to avoid

17   even having to get to the question of exceptional

18   circumstances; for example, just looking to the

19   diligence prong.

20                  But here, where you have a failure to

21   notify, you have the failure to heed the instructions from

22   a client, you have the client saying you've lied to

23   me, the client telling the State and the Federal courts

24   this lawyer is not my agent anymore, I don't want him, I

25   don't trust him, he has misled me, he has deceived me --

                                      52

 1   all of those factors certainly go to a consideration of

 2   whether equitable tolling should be warranted, and the

 3   problem here is that the Eleventh Circuit said no,

 4   categorically no.

 5              Thank you very much.

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, counsel.

 7               The case is submitted.
