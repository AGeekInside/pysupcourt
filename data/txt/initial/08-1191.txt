 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  We will hear

 4   argument next this morning in Case 08-1191, Morrison v.

 5   National Australia Bank.

 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS A. DUBBS

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9               MR. DUBBS:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               Given that the issue of subject matter

12   jurisdiction appears not to be in dispute, the issues

13   before the Court today are:

14               First, the scope of section 10(b) of the

15   1934 Exchange Act when applied to alleged fraudulent

16   conduct with respect to financial information that is to

17   be sent to Australia for incorporation into the

18   financial statements of the Respondent, National

19   Australia Bank.

20               And second, the reasonableness of the

21   application of the statute under these circumstances and

22   the norms of enforcement pursuant to the private cause

23   of action or otherwise.

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I guess there's also the

25   issue of whether, if everybody is agreed that it is not


                                         3

 1   a jurisdictional question, that's the end of the case.

 2   I mean, as I recall, the other side says we shouldn't

 3   get to the merits.

 4               MR. DUBBS:         Your Honor, it's our view that

 5   that -- that is a possible outcome, which of course as I

 6   understand it would leave -- leave the decision below

 7   standing.   We have urged in the supplemental brief that

 8   it may want to remand for consideration of the change of

 9   position of the Securities and Exchange Commission with

10   respect to the tests that they have -

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:              But you are not -- you are

12   not pressing that?

13               MR. DUBBS:         No, we still believe that the

14   best way to handle the case is to remand; but we leave

15   that for the Court's discretion.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Why wouldn't that simply

17   be going through the motions?               The Second Circuit put

18   the wrong label on it, but everything it said could have

19   been plugged into:      Our decision is under Rule 12(b)(6)

20   rather than 12(b)(1)?

21               MR. DUBBS:         Well, Your Honor, the question

22   and the issue is inherently somewhat speculative as to

23   what the Second Circuit would do, but we would rely not

24   necessarily only on the subject matter jurisdiction

25   issues being addressed -- and Your Honor is quite right

 1   that they may say, well, the label's changed, but

 2   everything else stays the same.               What we particularly

 3   thought might be instructive for this Court is to hear

 4   what the Second Circuit that sits in our nation's

 5   financial capital thought of a new fact, and that new

 6   fact is that for the first time the Securities and

 7   Exchange Commission has come in and said as a matter of

 8   administrative deference the Court should defer to our

 9   test in cases like that.

10               Sure, they have submitted amicus briefs in

11   the past.   They have done lots of things.              But this is

12   the first time they have said:              We as the agency

13   responsible for the statute have said this is how courts

14   should handle the case.        That's what's new and

15   different, but if Your Honors don't wish to proceed

16   along that line we are prepared to go forward on -- on

17   the merits here today.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, it seems to me that

19   isn't worth anything, right?            I mean, that's -- they

20   haven't conducted a rulemaking or anything.

21               MR. DUBBS:       Well, they haven't conducted -

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:            They just -- just appeared

23   in court.

24               MR. DUBBS:       Well, they haven't conducted a

25   full rulemaking that would be entitled to Chevron


                                        5

 1   deference.

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Right.

 3                 MR. DUBBS:      But they have done something

 4   less than that.    And whether it's entitled to deference,

 5   Skidmore deference, or something lesser than that is an

 6   open point.    But so we leave it to the Court's decision

 7   as to whether it is just -

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Except that they don't come

 9   out on your side anyway, do they?

10                 MR. DUBBS:      Well, Your Honor, they come out

11   on our side except for that last turn they make at the

12   end, where they -- they bring in the intervening clause

13   at the end of the last act.             Other than that -

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            How could they come down

15   on your side if they say there is no private right of

16   action?

17                 MR. DUBBS:      Well, they didn't say there was

18   no private right of action.             What they said was there

19   was no private right of action in this case because of

20   their application of the intervening clause test, which

21   we submit was error and clear error in light of the

22   factors that have to go into the intervening -

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           We are only talking about

24   this case.    I mean -

25                 MR. DUBBS:      Sorry?

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            We are only talking about

 2   this case, right?     If we send it back, we send it back

 3   to have this case decided and they'd come out against

 4   you in this case.

 5                 MR. DUBBS:       They -

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            So what could -- and that

 7   is going to change the Second Circuit's view of things,

 8   the fact that, in addition to their initial opinion, it

 9   has been reconfirmed, although on different grounds,

10   by -- by the government?

11                 MR. DUBBS:       Your Honor -

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            There is no reason to send

13   it back.

14                 MR. DUBBS:       Well, Your Honor, it's -- it's

15   up to the Court.     I mean, it's your -- you're basically

16   educating -- making an educated guess as to whether the

17   Second Circuit would pay attention to the SEC.                      In the

18   past, they have.     They may not now.

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Dubbs, you said

20   something that I thought quite revealing in this -- in

21   your brief.    I mean, this case is Australian plaintiff,

22   Australian defendant, shares purchased in Australia.                         It

23   has "Australia" written all over it.                      And in your reply

24   brief you said:     "If the Plaintiff is a foreign

25   securities purchaser as this one is, Sinochem makes it

 1   clear that forum non conveniens may dictate dismissal of

 2   an action brought in the U.S."

 3                And taking that, why not -- of the

 4   applicable laws to this transaction, to this alleged

 5   fraud, isn't the most appropriate choice the law of

 6   Australia rather than the law of the United States?

 7                MR. DUBBS:      No -

 8                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Not just a question of

 9   proper forum, but the proper law?

10                MR. DUBBS:      No, Your Honor.            We think that,

11   given the scope of section 10(b), American law can and

12   should be applied here.        And we respectfully disagree

13   with the observation that this case has "Australia"

14   written all over it.      Indeed, from our point of view it

15   has "Florida" written all over it because Florida is

16   where the numbers were doctored, Florida is where the

17   fraudulent conduct in putting the phony assumptions into

18   the valuation portfolio were done.                 Everything

19   happened -

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            If all that were done and

21   it were never communicated, there wouldn't be any

22   violation.

23                MR. DUBBS:      That's correct, Your Honor.

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And the communication was

25   done in Australia by the Australian bank.

 1                MR. DUBBS:       The communication was done

 2   between Florida and -- and Australia, and the senior

 3   management of HomeSide in Florida created those numbers

 4   with the expectation and the knowledge that those would

 5   go into the financial statement.                So that means there is

 6   substantial conduct in Florida in terms of the fraud.

 7   They made the misrepresentation pursuant to what "make"

 8   means, pursuant to the 1934 dictionary.

 9                They engaged in hard-core fraudulent conduct

10   by doctoring the books, by putting the phony assumptions

11   into the computer model.          Without that there wouldn't

12   have been a phony number.           In one sense it's a one-issue

13   case, or a one-number case, which is the mortgage

14   servicing rights number that appears on -- on the

15   balance sheet at page 11 -

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Let's -- let's go back to

17   the question that I asked you about the appropriate

18   forum.   You -- you seem to give this very case -- the

19   plaintiff is a foreign securities purchaser.                When the

20   plaintiff's choice is not -- is not its home forum, the

21   presumption in the plaintiff's favor applies with less

22   force, et cetera.    But you have an Australian plaintiff

23   suing in the United States based on shares purchased in

24   Australia and the lead defendant is the Australian bank.

25                So what -- what did you mean when you were

 1   referring to Sinochem and forum non conveniens?

 2                MR. DUBBS:      We meant two things, Your Honor.

 3   The first thing we meant was that, in addition to the

 4   other tests that are proposed, putting Sinochem at the

 5   beginning of the train would sort out some of these

 6   questions in general.      That's in general.

 7                As to our particular case, we believe we

 8   would win a forum non conveniens argument, though one

 9   was never made and that was not explored by any district

10   judge.   And we would win that because the statute

11   specifically provides in section 10(b) that fraud can be

12   caused in any number of ways -- three ways, including

13   through the mails, through foreign or interstate

14   commerce, or over an exchange.              And that fraud was

15   caused in Florida and the mails were used and it was in

16   foreign or interstate commerce.

17                And the people who committed the fraud on a

18   nuts-and-bolts level are the senior management who are

19   defendants from HomeSide bank in Florida, so to that

20   extent it is a Florida case.            And we also think that any

21   district judge in looking at a forum non motion would

22   also look at the various interests of National Australia

23   Bank in HomeSide in the United States to judge the

24   overall fairness of letting the suit proceed against

25   them and to counter the issue that this is really all

 1   about Australia.

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, wouldn't your clients

 3   have an adequate remedy under Australian law in

 4   Australia, in the Australian court system?

 5                MR. DUBBS:       We might or we might not.         But

 6   that is not determinative.

 7                JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, let's assume that -

 8   that they do not.    Let's assume that on the facts of

 9   this case they could not prevail under Australian law in

10   the Australian court system.             Then what United States

11   interest is there -

12               MR. DUBBS:        There -

13               JUSTICE ALITO:            -- that should override

14   that?

15                MR. DUBBS:       There is a strong United States

16   interest.   It's on two levels.              The first strong United

17   States -- United States interest deals with the conduct

18   at issue here, namely the conduct in Florida by

19   HomeSide.   This was the sixth largest mortgage service

20   provider in the United States.

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             If we had only HomeSide's

22   conduct, nothing else, there wouldn't be any violation

23   of 10(b); is that right?

24                MR. DUBBS:       We do not agree with that, Your

25   Honor.   We believe that they made a representation by

 1   creating the false numbers, or otherwise it's within the

 2   scope of the statute.        What they did is create a

 3   deceptive device -

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But nothing has happened.

 5   Suppose it had been caught by the Australian bank, and

 6   they didn't act on it?

 7                MR. DUBBS:        Your -- Your Honor, that goes to

 8   a different element of the cause of action.                   That

 9   doesn't go to the scope of the statute.                   That goes to

10   how the private cause of action is enforced.

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Now, I concede your

12   argument that a big component of this fraud was what

13   went on in Florida, but it needed to be disclosed to the

14   public.   It needed to be put out there.                  And that wasn't

15   done in Florida by the Florida defendants.

16                MR. DUBBS:        It was done in Australia and we

17   can prove that.     And -- the point is we are not -- all

18   we are proving through doing that is the effects of the

19   fraud in Florida.     To use Professor Beale's example,

20   where you have poison candy in one jurisdiction, that

21   poison candy is sent to another jurisdiction, and in the

22   first jurisdiction there is a law that says "thou shalt

23   not make poison candy;" through the exercise of

 1   an interest in that.

 2                  Now, if we are in the poison candy

 3   jurisdiction and we are bringing a case about poison

 4   candy, if the statute in addition says, "you have to

 5   show some harm from the poison candy," indeed you might

 6   as a matter of proof have to show effects from that

 7   other forum.     But that's different than regulating

 8   conduct in the second forum or anything else in the

 9   second forum.     That is simply looking at the statute or

10   the legal prescription against making poison candy.                        And

11   we say section 10(b) is like the poison candy statute.

12                  JUSTICE ALITO:          Which of your standards -

13                JUSTICE BREYER:             Now, that's -- I would like

14   you to follow that up specifically.                       That is, in my mind

15   the difficult issue in this case is not the

16   jurisdictional issue under principles of international

17   law.   It's the question of the scope of the statute.

18   And there the things against you are three.                       One is

19   Professor Sachs's argument, which I would like to know

20   your answer to.    The second is in Judge Friendly's two

21   opinions.

22                  The first opinion -- the second one, rather,

23   Bersch, he says if you had a foreign exchange and

24   foreign plaintiffs as -- and there was no foreign

25   plaintiff, the security issued over a foreign exchange,


                                         13

 1   even if that fraud takes place totally in the United

 2   States, the statute wouldn't cover it.                        That's Friendly,

 3   which started this.

 4                 And the third thing is what he says in

 5   Leasco.    He says:     We cannot see any sound reason for

 6   not taking your position, at least for the plaintiffs

 7   who are Americans.        Okay?

 8                 Now, France, Britain and Australia have

 9   filed briefs in this case giving what they consider very

10   sound reasons, which are reasons that Judge Friendly

11   never considered.       And those three reasons, as we know,

12   is they point to a number of conflicts, that if you win,

13   how that will interfere with their efforts to regulate

14   their own securities markets, right?

15                 That's all one question:                      Professor Sachs,

16   Friendly in Bersch, and Friendly in Leasco.                        But that's

17   what I'd like to hear your answer to.

18                 MR. DUBBS:         I will try to keep the subparts

19   in mind.    Why don't we start from the end and try to

20   work backwards.       Perhaps one of the most important parts

21   of the record is the Solicitor General's view that as a

22   general matter -- and I will get to the specifics; I'm

23   not ducking that.       But as a general matter the

24   enforcement of the securities laws, unlike the antitrust

25   laws, has not historically and today they do not believe


                                           14

 1   runs -- raises a substantial risk of interstate

 2   conflict.

 3                  Now, as to the specific briefs that Your

 4   Honor referenced, if we look at those briefs and we look

 5   at those compared to what happened in Hartford Fire,

 6   those briefs -- and let's focus on Australia's for the

 7   moment because that's the country we are talking about.

 8   Australia's brief essentially says they have a

 9   regulatory system that may -- that we may or may not

10   have been able to litigate this cause of action in

11   Australia, but let's assume that we could.

12                  They are not saying -- they did not say in

13   that brief that there was some fundamental conflict,

14   like the plurality found in Hartford Fire; nor did they

15   say that there was the kind of conflict that comes up in

16   the application of 403(h) of the Restatement, which

17   Justice Scalia looked to in his opinion in Hartford

18   Fire.   So there is not the kind of conflict that leads

19   necessarily -- necessarily -- to not reasonably applying

20   the statute.

21                  The reason there's not is that because, one,

22   there is not a rule in Australia that one has to abide

23   by and a rule in the United States that one has to abide

24   by that are contradictory.             At most, what you have is

25   you have a clear rule in the United States that says


                                         15

 1   thou shalt not commit fraud in Florida through either

 2   the Florida through either -- for or in interstate

 3   commerce, the mails or through an exchange.             And on the

 4   other side of the equation what you have is maybe they

 5   could have brought suit over here and we have a robust

 6   regulatory system and a robust litigation system; more

 7   power to them.

 8                But that doesn't mean -- saying that, that

 9   doesn't mean that the first State where the poison candy

10   was made suddenly has no interest in that.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, but -- but Australia

12   says:   Look, it's up to us to decide whether there has

13   been a misrepresentation, point one; and whether it's

14   been relied upon by the -- by the plaintiffs, point two.

15   And we should be able to decide that and we don't want

16   it decided by a foreign court.

17                You are talking about a misrepresentation,

18   if there was one in this case, made in Australia to

19   Australian purchasers; it ought to be up to us to decide

20   that issue; and here you are dragging the American

21   courts into it.

22                MR. DUBBS:      Well, let me deal with the

23   dragging in part in a minute, because that's

24   subliminally very important to the case.

25                But let me address the direct question.           He

 1   Australians may believe that, but the question is was

 2   there a misrepresentation both in the United States and

 3   possibly in Australia?         If there was in Australia,

 4   that's for the Australians.              That's dealing with the

 5   effects of eating the poison candy.                       But we say a

 6   misrepresentation was made in the United States -

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Not to these plaintiffs.

 8               MR. DUBBS:         Sir -

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:              You -- you have to join the

10   misrepresentation to the plaintiff.

11               MR. DUBBS:         We have joined -

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:              The only misrepresentation

13   to these plaintiffs was made in Australia by an

14   Australian company.

15               MR. DUBBS:         There are two ways to connect

16   the fraud to the plaintiffs.              The one is the "in

17   connection with" requirement that deals with conduct,

18   which we meet, and this Court has construed very broadly

19   in Dabit, in Zandford and any other number of cases.

20   That's number one.

21               Number two, assuming that the scope of the

22   statute is broad enough to cover the conduct in Florida,

23   we then get to the second question, which is the

24   reasonableness of the application of the statute, and

25   without a conflict, we would then look at -- to the


                                         17

 1   interest of the United States and compare them to the

 2   Australians.   And the Australians can say, we can -- you

 3   know, we can go after eating that poison candy.                 And we

 4   say, fine, if you want to, that's great.                 But that

 5   doesn't mean we can't go after the act of poisoning the

 6   candy in Florida.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:            But that -- that isn't the

 8   issue.   The -- the -- the issue for the Australians is:

 9   We want to determine whether there has been a

10   misrepresentation or not.

11                MR. DUBBS:       They -

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:            We don't want the

13   determination of whether there has been a

14   misrepresentation on the Australian exchange and whether

15   Australian purchasers relied upon that misrepresentation

16   to be determined by an American court.

17                MR. DUBBS:       And we say more power to you,

18   you can decide that question.              The question -

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Not if it's decided here,

20   unless you want to say, the Australian court to say, the

21   United States taking this case is so outrageous that we

22   will not respect its judgment.               And that's a factor,

23   too.   It's -- what conflict of laws is all about is you

24   have two jurisdictions, both with an interest in

25   applying their own law, but sometimes one defers to the


                                        18

 1   other.

 2                MR. DUBBS:      That's correct, Your Honor.                 And

 3   the question is should there be deferral in this case.

 4   And we say if you apply the standards of -- of Hartford

 5   Fire or the standards of the Restatement, you don't end

 6   up in deferral.   You end up in prosecution of the

 7   Section 10(b) cause of action in Florida.                   And you do

 8   that for a couple of different reasons.

 9                First, you look at the magnitude of the

10   conduct in Florida, the size of this.                   This is a

11   $1.75 billion writedown in a portfolio.                   You have a

12   portfolio of $187 billion worth of mortgages sitting

13   down in Jacksonville, Florida.              Those are all mortgages

14   on American homes, 2 million American homes.                   So, this

15   is not just Australia, Australia, Australia.                   That's

16   what's in the portfolio and that's what's being

17   misrepresented.   And when they doctor the numbers and

18   send them to Australia, it's a misrepresentation of

19   that.

20                In addition, you have the overarching

21   consideration of is it appropriate to sue National

22   Australia Bank in the United States at -- at a -- at a

23   more abstract level?      And the answer to that, we submit,

24   is yes.   They have invested -- if you care to look, it's

25   on the SA-11 and SA-41 of the supplemental appendix,


                                       19

 1   they have invest -- they have $25 billion worth of

 2   assets here.   They own a bank in Michigan, they have a

 3   huge trading operation on Park Avenue that trades

 4   billions of dollars in derivatives every day.                 This is

 5   not the situation -- this is not the stereotype of a

 6   gotcha where you have -

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Those derivatives

 8   are not at issue here, right?

 9               MR. DUBBS:       Well, they are only -

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I presume -- I'm

11   sorry, go ahead.

12               MR. DUBBS:       They are only at issue in the

13   following sense, which is that the position on the

14   mortgage servicing rights was hedged in New York.                  When

15   the hedge came undone, there were losses in New York on

16   the other side of the hedge.            That goes to the point of

17   were there any affects in the United States, because

18   there seems to be some confusion on that.                 There were

19   some effects here from the hedge.                There were some

20   effects on -- in the ADR market, but we are not -- we

21   are not -

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought Morrison -

23               MR. DUBBS:       -- disputing that most of the

24   effects were over there.

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Dubbs, Morrison, the

 1   first-named plaintiff, was a derivative holder.

 2               MR. DUBBS:         No, Your Honor.               He was the

 3   holder of an ADR.     The derivatives come in because they

 4   are the activity in New York that is the other side of

 5   the transaction.     HomeSide -

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But do you have -- you

 7   have two classes of plaintiffs, one the Australians, who

 8   bought their shares in Australia; then you have

 9   Morrison, who has an ADR, and who is dismissed because

10   he wasn't able to show damages.

11               MR. DUBBS:         That's true.               There -- there are

12   no Americans left.      This is strictly Australians.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               So what U.S. investor was

14   harmed?

15               MR. DUBBS:         The -- the question is, were

16   there effects on the U.S. market?                  There were U.S.

17   investors who were, in all likelihood, harmed but none

18   have stepped forward with respect to ADR holders.                         But

19   if the question in the abstract is were there economic

20   effects from this transaction in the United States, the

21   answer is -- is yes, there were fallout from -- on -- on

22   the derivative side, which is the other side -- which

23   was the other side, in effect, the short side of what

24   the long position was, which was $187 billion worth of

25   mortgages in Florida that what is -- what the portfolio

 3   to finish?

 4                  MR. DUBBS:      No, Your Honor.

 5                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Then -- I mean, I can see.

 6   I will give you all that.            That isn't what is bothering

 7   me.     I think you are right so far as what you have

 8   argued.     But the part that I think is most difficult is

 9   why I -- I shorthand referred to Professor Sachs'

10   article.

11                  MR. DUBBS:      Yes.

12                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Because what Australia is

13   actually saying is what we don't like about -- about the

14   American system, you know, their -- their common

15   criticisms of class actions.              We say, first of all, the

16   American rule means even if our companies here are

17   right, that they are going to have to pay their legal

18   fees.     We don't like punitive damages.                 We don't like

19   that we have the opt-out.            And these are all our

20   citizens, and we don't want to subject our companies on

21   our exchange to that stuff.

22                  Now, fine, they have a reason on their side.

23   Then Professor Sachs says:             Read the statute, because

24   they argue -- it was never intended to cover that kind

25   of stuff.     Now, that's what I would like you to address


                                         22

 1   specifically.

 2                MR. DUBBS:      Well, it was -- there are two

 3   issues.   The statute was intended to cover that kind of

 4   stuff if the antecedent of "stuff" is fraud in Florida.

 5   Now, that's a separate question from how we deal with

 6   the private right of action in these circumstances.

 7                Now, let's back up.              The general criticism

 8   of these cases is that they are gotcha cases.                 You put

 9   in a little bit and all of a sudden the private bar

10   comes and attacks you.       I mean, that's the stereotype.

11   Well, the stereotype is wrong and it's important to

12   understand why the stereotype is wrong.                 Because if all

13   you have is a very modest investment in the ADR market,

14   1 percent like my friends from NAB, those cases get

15   bounced at the beginning on personal jurisdiction as

16   they did in the district of New Jersey in SCORS and the

17   Novagold case.   We are not aware of any case where if

18   all you've got is that little toehold that you stay in.

19   You get bounced by -- on personal jurisdiction.

20                And to pick up on the discussion that I was

21   having with Justice Ginsburg, we thought that in

22   addition to that, if the Court wanted to send signals

23   with respect to these kinds of cases, if you put, as you

24   can, Sinochem at the beginning of the train, even more

25   of these cases if they are fallacious are going to be

 1   screened out of the system.

 2                 So, the point is that we can all tell our

 3   Australian friends that there are very rigid safeguards

 4   in place so that this horror story in reality doesn't

 5   happen and it has not been proven to happen.                    It is an

 6   attractive myth, but it hasn't happened.                    Those cases go

 7   out and they go out early.

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I'm not sure that it

 9   happens in advance of considerable discovery.                    I -- I --

10   I would agree that the judge can confine discovery to

11   forum non conveniens or for personal jurisdiction, but

12   in -- in these cases one of the things we are really

13   talking about is the burden of discovery.                    That's the

14   cost of litigation.       You know that.

15                 MR. DUBBS:       I do know that and let me answer

16   briefly, because I want to reserve my time for rebuttal.

17   I disagree with your fundamental observation, Justice

18   Kennedy.    These cases are paid attention to by the

19   district judges and they go out early.                    They go out

20   early on personal jurisdiction; there is not a lot of

21   discovery on that.      They go out early -- if Sinochem

22   gets applied faithfully, it would go out early on that

23   if there is a close question.               And then you go to the

24   12(b)(6).

25                 And pursuant to the Private Securities

 1   Litigation Reform Act, one of the purposes of that is no

 2   discovery, no discovery until after the motion to

 3   dismiss is decided.

 4                  So it is not true that there is a lot of

 5   discovery, there is a lot of transaction costs, before

 6   we know the answer to one of the threshold questions,

 7   which is:    Should this case be in our system or not?

 8   That can be handled and it is being handled on a daily

 9   basis, notwithstanding, you know, some stereotypes.

10                  Now, my final point with respect to

11   Professor Sachs' articles and some of the other articles

12   is they in effect -- if they advocate a rule, which many

13   of them do, which it should be limited to exchanges,

14   that goes back to my threshold point of the scope of the

15   statute.    And it takes an eraser to the statute and it

16   says:   It's only exchanges; it's not in connection with

17   foreign or interstate commerce or through the mails;

18   it's limited, contrary to the express words of the

19   statute, in a way that the statutory construction we

20   don't believe can stand it.

21                  Now, there are other legitimate ways of

22   cabining the private cause of action.                     But that -- if

23   you are faithful to the statute, we submit that is not

24   one of them.

 1   Mr. Dubbs.

 2                 Mr. Conway.

 3            ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE T. CONWAY, III,

 4                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 5                 MR. CONWAY:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 6   and may it please the Court:

 7                 The judgment of the court of appeals should

 8   be affirmed for two reasons.

 9                 First, Petitioners have identified nothing

10   in the text of section 10(b) that overcomes the

11   presumption against extraterritoriality or the Charming

12   Betsy Rule.    The statutes should thus be construed not

13   to apply to transactions and shares of foreign issuers

14   on foreign exchanges.

15                 Second, unlike the rights of action that

16   this Court has addressed in other extraterritoriality

17   cases, the section 10(b) right is purely implied.

18   Congress didn't intend for this right of action to exist

19   even domestically, let alone extraterritorially.

20                 Given the threat that the section 10(b}

21   implied right presents to the sovereign authority of

22   other nations, as reflected in the amicus briefs of

23   Australia, the United Kingdom, France, and the

24   diplomatic note from the Swiss government, the Court

25   should construe the implied right not to extend to


                                        26

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   claims of purchasers and sellers of securities of

 2   foreign issuers on foreign markets.

 3               The two clear statement rules are,

 4   obviously, the presumption against extraterritoriality

 5   and the Charming Betsy Rule require that the Congress.

 6   Both require an affirmative intention of the Congress

 7   clearly expressed before the statute can be applied to

 8   apply to foreign transactions or to, you know, matters

 9   that it infringes on the sovereign authority on other

10   nations.

11               My friends don't identify anything in the

12   statute that comets even close to a clear statement.

13   They principally rely on the definition of "interstate

14   commerce," but as this court said in Aramco, that kind

15   of boilerplate simply doesn't suffice to overcome the

16   presumption against extraterritoriality.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, what is your test for

18   whether -- whether it's being applied internationally or

19   not?

20               MR. CONWAY:       Well, our test is that, at a

21   minimum, section 10b should be held not to apply to

22   transactions involving shares of foreign issues on

23   foreign exchanges, because that presents the greatest

24   danger of conflict of foreign law, particularly in the

25   context of the modern section 10b implied right, which


                                      27

 1   has the fraud on the market presumption and holds

 2   issuers liable, as here for example, for two and a half

 3   years of trading, all on an Australian exchange.                That

 4   is massive transfer of wealth that the Petitioners here

 5   are seeking an American court to effect, and that is -

 6   basically, it's a direct form of market regulation that

 7   Australia has not seen fit to impose upon itself.

 8                JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask you on that

 9   point:   Supposing the class of plaintiffs included a

10   group of Americans who were shareholders of the

11   Australian bank and who -- but who purchased their stock

12   over the Australian exchange.

13                MR. CONWAY:       We would -- well, we would

14   submit that that rule should be the same.                That they

15   should -- they should not also, they should not be

16   allowed to sue under section 10b.                They -- they -- you

17   know, those people chose to purchase on the Australian

18   exchange.   And in terms of the threat to international

19   comity, I think it would be probably take -- I don't

20   think other countries would take nicely to a -- to a

21   rule of law that would allow Americans, essentially, to

22   bring their rules, their law, their remedies, fraud, on

23   the market, what have you to foreign countries -

24               JUSTICE BREYER:            Give me reasons for it.

 1   you it seems to me, is Judge Friendly's example.

 2   Schmidt, a citizen of Germany, flies to New York and

 3   meets Jones in the hotel.            And Jones says, I have a

 4   bridge I want to sell you.             Look out the window.          Say,

 5   Do you own the Brooklyn Bridge?                 Yes.      And that's a lie.

 6                  Here's what you do.              You invest in buying

 7   shares of my company sold on the German exchange.                    Okay?

 8                  MR. CONWAY:       Yes.

 9                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Conduct took place in the

10   United States, a terrible fraud.                 This is contrary to

11   fraud and, says, I think, Judge Friendly and others, it

12   should apply at least where Schmidt is an American

13   citizen and Professor Sachs says no, not even then.

14                  What do you do with that case?                 The fraud

15   took place totally here.

16                  MR. CONWAY:       Well, I disagree with that,

17   Your Honor, I think the fraud is carried out when the

18   transaction occurs in a foreign country.                    But I do agree

19   that Professor Sachs is absolutely right -

20              JUSTICE BREYER:               Sign the paper here in New

21   York.

22                  MR. CONWAY:       Yes.

24   and give me the money, because I have an urgent

25   appointment.

 1                 MR. CONWAY:        Yes, sir.

 2                 (Laughter.)

 3                 MR. CONWAY:        That's a much different case,

 4   obviously, than the fraud in the market case that we

 5   have here.    But Your Honor, yes, that is a stronger

 6   circumstance.

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes, but your position and

 8   hers is:     That's no more a valid claim than this one or

 9   any other one we dream up.             That's why it's a pure

10   example, and I want to know how you feel about it.

11   And -

12                 MR. CONWAY:        Well, I think that -- I think

13   the problem is, in order to have that conduct swept

14   within the statute, you have to ignore the language and

15   the presumption against extraterritoriality.

16                 If you go to petition appendix 78, that has

17   its text in section 10b, and section 10b refers to the

18   use or employment of any manipulative device or

19   contrivance, and it's in connection with the purchase or

20   sale of any security registered on a national securities

21   exchange.    And that's -

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Or any other.     Or -- read

23   the next word.

24                 MR. CONWAY:        That's correct.          Any security

25   not so registered.      And this Court has held -- it has


                                         30

 1   held in cases like Aramco, American Banana, Moritson,

 2   that the words "any" and "every," words of universal

 3   scope, do not -- do not mean that these -- that

 4   something referred to is anything, anywhere else in the

 5   world.   And for example, the Court is small against the

 6   United States.   In the case where the presumption of

 7   extraterritoriality didn't really apply the court held

 8   that in a statute, you normally assume that things being

 9   referred to are thing in the United States.               Now -

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Is the government going to

11   tell us that its test, which differs from the foreign

12   exchange test, is based on considerations like those

13   suggested in Justice Breyer's Brooklyn Bridge

14   hypothetical?

15                MR. CONWAY:       I think they do.         I think they

16   look to -- I think their view is that the statute is

17   vague and you have to do essentially what Judge Friendly

18   did and the Seventh Circuit did for many years, is you

19   have to make do and decide what the best rule is.               And

20   with respect to the government, that is essentially

21   doing what this Court has said under the presumption

22   against extraterritoriality the Court shouldn't do.

23   That's essentially legislating, trying to figure out

24   what Congress would have done, had "a particular

25   problem" -

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What about the -

 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Would the limitations on

 3   discovery give you substantial protection were we to

 4   adopt the government's test or say the foreign exchange

 5   test with the subset exceptions for the -- that takes

 6   account of the government's test?

 7               MR. CONWAY:       Your Honor, I think the problem

 8   with the government's test and with the Second Circuit's

 9   test, is that it would still allow the application of

10   U.S. law in a manner that would infringe the sovereign

11   authority of other nations.

12               And I can give an example.                 There was a case

13   over the summer that the Petitioners attached to their

14   first supplemental brief on the petition for certiorari.

15   And it's a case called PC shifts.               And it's an

16   interesting case because it involved a Canadian company

17   with headquarters in Britain and most of whose shares

18   traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

19               And what happened there was that the

20   CEO spent time in Florida -- it was a shipping company.

21   We spent time in, Miami running the show from Miami.

22   And the court of appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in a

23   ruling that it held was consistent with the Second

24   Circuit decision in this case held that nonetheless, the

25   application of U.S. law could be applied to transactions

 1   of -- of foreign plaintiffs on the Toronto Stock

 2   Exchange.

 3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Is it a consideration that

 4   this discovery alone would be an offense to foreign -

 5                 MR. CONWAY:       Yes, discovery alone.       Yes,

 6   Your Honor.    Discovery alone.            I think the French brief,

 7   for example, points that out.              I think a number of the

 8   brief -- there have been blocking statutes that have

 9   been enacted by various countries because of the -- what

10   they deem to be the offensive scope of discovery.              In

11   France, you are really only allowed to obtain evidence

12   that is actually admissible in trial.

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I'm not sure how you

14   interpret the language that you -- that you just read,

15   when you say to use or employ in connection with the

16   purchase or sale of any security registered on the

17   National Security Exchange or any security not so

18   registered.

19                 Now, is it your point that in order to avoid

20   an international extension of it, it should apply only

21   to securities?    What?

22                 MR. CONWAY:       It should only be applied -

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Securities purchased and

24   sold in the United States?            Is that it?

 1   Honor.   I think that's a fair reading of the statute.

 2   And this Court is required, under both the presumption

 3   against extraterritoriality under its decision and the

 4   Charming Betsy Rule to interpret a statute, take the

 5   permissible construction of the statute that is least

 6   likely to result in an extraterritorial of the law.

 7                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Purchased -- purchased or

 8   sold?

 9                  MR. CONWAY:       Purposed or sold, Your Honor.

10                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           What if it's not -- what if

11   it -- what if the fraud produces neither a purchase or a

12   sale but induces somebody to hold on to stock that

13   otherwise the person would dispose of?

14                  MR. CONWAY:       Well, I -- I don't know that

15   that would state a claim, a private claim under Blue

16   Chip Stamps.     And any -- and if the share or the

17   securities are held abroad, if it's a foreign security,

18   and I think the liability in that hypothetical -- I'm

19   assuming that if it's a foreign security held by a

20   foreigner -- that really would be something that would

21   be subject to foreign law, whether or not Australia

22   wants to represent -- recognize holder claims of the

23   sort that this Court rejected in Blue Chip Stamps.

 1   facts if you had -- altering according to the

 2   hypothetical, you had U.S. plaintiffs who purchased

 3   National Australia Bank ADRs on the New York exchange,

 4   you don't doubt that they can sue, do you?

 5               MR. CONWAY:       No, and in fact, we told the

 6   district court, we did not move to defense on

 7   extraterritoriality grounds the claims of Mr. Morrison,

 8   who inexplicably is still here.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Right.

10               MR. CONWAY:       We argued that Mr. Morrison's

11   claims should be defeated on the grounds that he had no

12   damages, which was an absolutely ironclad calculation

13   best based on a -- on a provision of the PSLRA, and we

14   also argued that all of the claims should be dismissed

15   for failure to plead fraud with the requisite

16   particularity of the PSLRA.

17               But we certainly do not dispute that when a

18   company like ours registers shares on -- registers

19   shares with the SEC, ADRs with its SEC and lists them on

20   a New York stock exchange, it's subjecting itself to New

21   York -- I mean, U.S. law for purposes of those -

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And presumably that

23   would impose the same discovery on the bank as the

24   Sudanese case.

25               MR. CONWAY:       It could, Your Honor, that's

 1   absolutely true.   But on the other hand, I mean, a lot

 2   of the other aspects of -- of this litigation, which

 3   this Court has, you know, noted that is potentially

 4   highly vexatious, I mean, that is only 1.1 percent of

 5   the flow -- of the total equity securities of the -- the

 6   National Australia Bank.         So the dangers of -- of a

 7   threat of -- of coerced settlements is much, much less.

 8                It's a much, much easier case to deal with

 9   if -- if -- if you are only dealing with the ADRs.                     Now

10   if another company decides to list half its equity on

11   the New York Stock Exchange, well, it can -- it makes

12   the determination for itself, how much of this kind of

13   litigation it wants to subject itself to.

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Suppose there were

15   litigation with substantial allegations of wire fraud

16   violations as predicate for RICO violations, and the

17   case begins to proceed, and then there is a second cause

18   of action under the securities law.                     Would -- would the

19   fact that there is going to be discovery and substantial

20   litigation in the -- in the United States courts be a

21   factor in retaining the -- the securities violation in

22   this suit?   Or would the test be just the same in your

23   view?

24                MR. CONWAY:       I think the -- I think you have

25   to take each statute separately.               You have to look at


                                       36

 1   what the language of the statute says, whether it -- it

 2   admits fault in an extraterritorial reading, and whether

 3   that -- frankly whether that extraterritorial reading is

 4   required or compelled.        If there is any other possible

 5   construction, as the Court said in -- in Charming Betsy,

 6   the court is required to accept that construction,

 7   accept the construction that doesn't result in

 8   extraterritorial application or doesn't result in -

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            On the -- on the

10   extraterritorial presumption against it, your colleague

11   on the other side tells us that in all the cases where

12   the presumption applied, all of the conduct was

13   someplace else, and they give the Aramco case and say

14   that was an employee hired in -- was it Saudi Arabia -

15                 MR. CONWAY:       That -

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- and everything

17   happened outside the country.

18                 MR. CONWAY:       Well, my -

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Here, I mean, you have to

20   concede that a component of the alleged fraud occurred

21   in Florida.

22                 MR. CONWAY:       We do concede that some of the

23   conduct that ultimately, you know, led -- in a but-for

24   causal relationship to what happened in the Australia

25   occurred in the United States, but that's true in a lot

 1   of other cases.     For example, Aramco, Mr. Boureslan was

 2   hired in Houston.     So was the cook in Foley Brothers v.

 3   Filardo.   And in Microsoft v. AT&T, basically all of the

 4   conduct, the relevant conduct was in the United States,

 5   because what the -- what section 271(f) proscribed in

 6   Microsoft was the shipment -- the supply in or from the

 7   United States of a component of a patented invention.

 8               And what this Court held in Microsoft was

 9   that notwithstanding AT&T's argument that, "Hey, the

10   presumption against extraterritoriality doesn't really

11   apply because this is just regulating the supply in and

12   from the United States," this Court held that the

13   presumption against extraterritoriality applied because

14   what would happen is, a single act of supply would

15   result in a springboard for liability each time a -- a

16   disk was put into a computer abroad.

17               And that is exactly analogous to the

18   circumstances in this case, where what we -- what

19   happened was some -- some allegedly false information

20   was transmitted to Australia; it was then republished in

21   annual reports, print, print, print; sent out to the -

22   sent out to the Australian market, and resulted in -

23   allegedly, as they would have it -- resulted in

24   liability every single time somebody purchased -

25   purchased a share of stock of the National Australia


                                         38

 1   Bank on the Australian securities exchange.                  And so that

 2   is exactly analogous to -- to Microsoft v. AT&T.

 3                 Again, another point I think that's relevant

 4   is the, section 30 of the Exchange Act.                  Congress did

 5   not make a clear statement in section 10.                  It did make

 6   clear statements in section 30.                Section 30(a) addresses

 7   transactions on foreign exchanges.                  Section 30 as a

 8   whole is entitled Foreign Exchanges, and section 30(a)

 9   makes it -- makes -- gives the SEC power to promulgate

10   regulations that -- that apply to brokers and dealers

11   who effect transactions of securities on foreign

12   exchanges, if those transactions are transactions of

13   shares of shares of U.S. issuers.

14                 And that's at -- for reference, the text of

15   section 30 is at page 19 of the law professors' brief.

16   And section 30(b) also, it says that the SEC can

17   regulate the -- regulate businesses in securities of -

18   of businesses -- securities that are abroad, but only to

19   the extent the SEC finds it necessary to prevent evasion

20   of the Act domestically.

21                 And so Congress made two clear statements in

22   section 30.    It did not make any clear statement in

23   section 10.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, is that your only

25   point?   Or is your point also that you wouldn't need

 1   section 30 if -- if 10(b) were -

 2                MR. CONWAY:       That's -

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- were read as broadly.

 4                MR. CONWAY:       That's absolutely right.          The

 5   reading -- my friend's reading of section 30 would

 6   render section 10(b) -- I mean the reading of section

 7   10(b) would render section 30 superfluous.                And there

 8   are other provisions of -- that are in the Exchange Act

 9   where Congress has made clear statements to show that it

10   can make clear statements.           Section 30A which

11   immediately follows section 30, is the Foreign Corrupt

12   Practices Act.

13                So Congress -- if Congress -- if there is a

14   loophole, and that's what this Court said in Microsoft

15   v. AT&T; if there is some kind of loophole that presents

16   some kind of a problem, that Congress needs to fix,

17   Congress can do it.     Congress can do it with a clear

18   statement.

19                In sum, Your Honors, countries -- nations of

20   the world do things differently.               They -- they -- they

21   have different rules of liability.                 We see in the amicus

22   briefs different rules of materiality, different rules

23   of disclosure.   And some rely on -- on public

24   enforcement more than others.

25                The French rely on l'action publique, as

 1   they say; and some nations approach ours in their

 2   generosity to plaintiffs.            Australia allows opt-out

 3   class actions; so does Canada.                Canada allows opt-out

 4   class actions; it dispenses with, for example, the proof

 5   of reliance, it dispenses with scienter in some cases.

 6   Yet it -- it does all that, but it restricts liability

 7   to $1 million or 5 percent of a -- of a company's -

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:              How does it hurt the other

 9   countries if what we would say on their reading of this

10   is, Congress has said, "Look, if some terribly bad

11   conduct happens in the United States; they lie through

12   their teeth; and you, whoever you are in the world, who

13   buys some shares and as a result you are hurt, we will

14   give you a remedy.      Come to us" -- now, how does that

15   hurt Australia?

16               MR. CONWAY:          Well, it hurts Australia -

17               JUSTICE BREYER:              Or France or England or any

18   of these others?

19               MR. CONWAY:          Exactly the same way this Court

20   said it hurts in Empagran.             In Empagran this Court noted

21   that -- that a reading of the rule that would allow -- a

22   reading of the FTAIA that would have allowed foreign

23   plaintiffs to come and sue for -- for foreign vitamins

24   transaction in a foreign country would essentially allow

25   plaintiffs to avoid the -- the narrower rules of the


                                         41

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   liability and the narrower remedies that other nations

 2   provide.     And that is exactly true here, where, you

 3   know, for example, Australia does not permit

 4   fraud-on-the-market class actions.                   It doesn't allow -

 5   it doesn't recognize the fraud-on-the-market

 6   presumption.

 7                 And as I said, for example, Canada restricts

 8   these actions, it has generous liability rules and

 9   allows opt-out class actions, but it says -- it caps

10   damages at 5 percent of an issuer's market

11   capitalization or $1 million, whichever is greater.

12                 And so that's the -- that is the problem.

13   It's not just substance but it's remedy.                     Other nations

14   want to do things in different ways; they should be

15   allowed to.    What is going on here is essentially a --

16   Brandeising -- experiment a global scale.                     And that's a

17   good thing.

18                 It's a good thing because it enables

19   countries to judge for themselves what kind of rules

20   they want to have for people who buy shares on their own

21   exchanges.    And to apply section 10(b) it cases like

22   this would cut that experiment short.                     It would amount

23   to exactly the soft of legal imperialism that this Court

24   rejected, rightly, in Empagran.                 The Court should reject

25   it here as well and it should affirm the judgment of the

 1   court of appeals.

 2                 I thank you.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

 4   Mr. Conway.

 5                 Mr. Roberts.

 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS,

 7         ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIE,

 8                   SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 9                 MR. ROBERTS:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                 This case presents two distinct questions:

12   First whether the fraud alleged by Petitioners violated

13   Section 10b; and second, whether Petitioners may bring a

14   private action.

15                 In our view, the alleged fraud violated

16   Section 10b, because significant conduct material to the

17   fraud's success occurred in the United States.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                There are -- there

19   are a lot of moving parts in that test.                  You know,

20   significant conduct, material, you require it to have a

21   direct causal relationship.             Doesn't the complication of

22   that kind of defeat the whole purpose?

23                 MR. ROBERTS:        No, Your Honor, we don't think

24   so.   In terms of the -- of the direct cause part, which

25   it will be -- the significant limit on private actions,


                                        43

 1   as this case illustrates, the district courts even

 2   accepting the allegations in the plaintiff's complaint

 3   will often be able to dismiss the suit on the pleading

 4   for its failure to satisfy that test.                     It's not a

 5   difficult test -

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   That's only for the

 7   private companies?

 8                  MR. ROBERTS:        That's right.            And in terms of

 9   the other test, again, I don't think it's that

10   complicated.     The -- the significance part of it is

11   essentially trying to assess the amount of the conduct

12   of -

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, what if -

14   what if significant elements of the fraud occur in four

15   different countries?

16                  MR. ROBERTS:        If -- if -- the critical

17   question is whether there's significant conduct here

18   that's material to the broad success.                     And the reason

19   for that is if Section 10b didn't cover that kind of

20   conduct, then that would risk allowing the United States

21   to become a base for orchestrating securities frauds for

22   export.   It would allow thing like masterminds in the

23   United States engineering international boiler room

24   schemes in which they direct agents in foreign countries

25   to make fraudulent representations that victimize

 1   investors.

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:              So it's not as easy to

 3   apply this, you think?          Now, on your theory, I guess

 4   Schmidt is in Germany and we have our Brooklyn Bridge.

 5   Okay, now wait.      What happens is he calls Schmidt on the

 6   telephone, Jones, and he says I own the Brooklyn Bridge.

 7   Actual, right, direct?          Under your test, correct?

 8                MR. ROBERTS:           Schmidt is in Germany?

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:              Schmidt is in Germany.     He

10   calls him up.

11                MR. ROBERTS:           The defrauder is in Germany?

12                JUSTICE BREYER:              All -- everything -- you

13   have to assume he's going to buy the thing on the

14   exchange in Germany but the fraud is in Brooklyn.                  He is

15   lying about -- he doesn't really own the Brooklyn

16   Bridge.   So he calls Schmidt.               I am interested in -- he

17   calls Schmidt.      Causation, that's what your last pages

18   of your brief, focus on that.                He calls him and he lies

19   to him.   Actual.     In your theory -

20                MR. ROBERTS:           I'm sorry, Your Honor, can I

21   ask you if everybody is in Germany?

 2                MR. ROBERTS:        Okay.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:           And they communicate the

 4   lie by calling Schmidt in Berlin on the telephone,

 5   directly.

 6                MR. ROBERTS:        Okay.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Schmidt is the German.

 8   He's in Germany.

10                MR. ROBERTS:        I'm sorry.

11                JUSTICE BREYER:           I'm looking -

12                MR. ROBERTS:        The question is, is there

13   significant conduct in the United States -

14                JUSTICE BREYER:           No, I'm focusing on the

15   last pages of your brief.          Where you turn this whole

16   thing on the directness of the causation.

17                MR. ROBERTS:        That's right.          And the SEC

18   would be able to take action if there is significant

19   conduct in the United States -

20                JUSTICE BREYER:           I'm accepting that for the

21   moment.   What's bothering me, taking off from what the

22   Chief Justice said, is the feasibility of your test.

23   Your test, it seems to me on causation, would say that

24   when you phone Schmidt and lie to him, he can sue.                But

25   when you phone your parent company, knowing that they


                                       46

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   will put it in the prospectus and Schmidt will read it,

 2   you can't sue.

 3               And then what occurs to me is suppose you

 4   phoned a reporter, or suppose you phoned your parent

 5   company and you knew they would tell a reporter.               I'm

 6   focusing on the practicality of your causation test.

 7               MR. ROBERTS:         If the conduct is directed or

 8   controlled from the United States -

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:            Correct.

10               MR. ROBERTS:         -- then it would -- then the

11   direct causation test would be -- would be met.               The

12   critical question is, is the conduct in the United

13   States have a close enough -

14               JUSTICE BREYER:            You think that's the

15   question here?   You think the question is whether this

16   really took place in Florida?             I didn't think that was

17   the question.

18               MR. ROBERTS:         In terms of a private

19   plaintiff suing, in our view, the question is whether

20   the United States' conduct has a close enough connection

21   to their -- to -- to their injury -

22               JUSTICE BREYER:            Let's skip -- skip my

23   question because other people may ask.

24               JUSTICE ALITO:           If the plaintiffs in this

25   case had clearly alleged in their complaint that nobody


                                       47

 1   in Australia reviewed the numbers that were sent from

 2   Florida to any degree, they just directly copied them,

 3   some low-level clerk directly copied them, would the

 4   direct cause test be met?

 5               MR. ROBERTS:        Yes, if the action was just

 6   ministerial over overseas, it would -- it would be met.

 7   Again, the critical question, in our view, under the

 8   direct cause test is, was there culpable conduct in the

 9   United States that is directly responsible for the

10   plaintiff's injury?

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Roberts -

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, then you give no

13   weight to the fact that it was on the Australian

14   exchange?

15               MR. ROBERTS:        The -- the fact that the

16   transaction happens on the Australian exchange is not

17   dispositive, because if -- if somebody in the United

18   States is directly -- is -- is executing the fraud -- if

19   it turned on just a transaction on the Australian

20   exchange, then a domestic investor could be injured by a

21   fraud that is hatched entirely here that is executed

22   entirely here, and he is tricked into executing a

23   transaction on an overseas exchange.

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Roberts, because your

25   time is running out, there is a basic question here.

 1   You are asking us to make a distinction between what the

 2   SEC can sue for and what a private party can sue for.

 3   Congress did that with respect to aiders and abettors.

 4               Is there any other instance in which we have

 5   made a distinction, yes, the SEC has a claim but the

 6   private litigant doesn't?

 7               MR. ROBERTS:         Yes, the -- the -- the private

 8   litigants are -- have numerous elements that they have

 9   to show that the SEC doesn't have to show:                     Reliance,

10   loss, loss causation.      All of those go to the causal

11   link between the injury and -- and the fraud.                     And we

12   think that the direct injury requirement is an

13   appropriate application of those more general causation

14   requirements in the context of transnational fraud.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I am frankly less concerned

16   with your -- your test for the private cause of action,

17   the direct cause test -- I -- I guess I could work with

18   that -- than I am with your test for -- for the

19   jurisdiction of the -- of the SEC, which is sort of a

20   totality of the circumstances test.                     It doesn't seem to

21   me that's an appropriate test for a jurisdictional

22   question.   You don't want to spend time litigating the

23   totality of the circumstances.

24               MR. ROBERTS:         We don't think it's a -- a

25   jurisdictional question in the sense of the subject

 1   matter jurisdiction, Your Honor.               It's a -- a test about

 2   the scope of the statutory coverage.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, okay.

 4                MR. ROBERTS:        And it's true that bright line

 5   rules -- it's true that bright line rules are easier to

 6   administer, but the -- there is a danger in bright line

 7   rules for fraud prohibitions because they can provide a

 8   road map for evasion of the statute.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Do you have any

10   indication that our friends around the world are

11   comfortable with your test?

12                MR. ROBERTS:        Well, the briefs that have

13   been filed by Australia and United Kingdom and France

14   are limited to the private right of action.                 They base

15   their -- what they want to do is to limit the private

16   rights.   And I think the United Kingdom brief

17   specifically says that -- it thinks that SEC action

18   could be appropriate here, and that's a reason why, if

19   the Court adopts the -- a limit on the private actions,

20   that it need not -- it need not be concerned about the

21   possibility that -- that fraud would be launched in the

22   United States or directed in the United States and it

23   couldn't be addressed.

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I guess we don't have to

25   say anything about -- about what the government can do,


                                       50

 1   do we?

 2               MR. ROBERTS:         No, Your Honor.              And we would

 3   certainly prefer that you decided the case solely on the

 4   private right of action if the alternative for a holding

 5   substantive prohibitions didn't apply here.

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Mr. Roberts, you

 7   urge deference to the SEC's interpretation in

 8   administrative adjudications?

 9               MR. ROBERTS:         Yes.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Do you have anything

11   other than those two proceedings over the last 35 years?

12               MR. ROBERTS:         Those are the two

13   administrative adjudications.             The SEC's administrative

14   adjudicatory authority is limited to people involved in

15   the securities industry, and a lot of these frauds that

16   happen are -- don't involve people that are registered

17   broker/dealers and the like.            There are numerous Civil

18   Actions that the SEC has brought where it has taken the

19   same approach.   The SEC v. Berger case that we cite in

20   our brief is one of them.

21               I can name some others.                     There is

22   SEC v. Wolfson, which is a case that's in the district

23   court in Utah, and SEC v. Shay in -- in the southern

24   district of New York.      SEC v. Banger in the northern

25   district of Illinois.      Those involve international

 1   boiler-room schemes of the kind I was alluding to

 2   before, where masterminds in the United States basically

 3   direct agents that they have got in countries like

 4   Thailand or Spain to -- to make false statements and

 5   engage in high-pressure selling to target investors in

 6   other countries.     Sometimes they induce them to engage

 7   in transactions in still other countries.                   So -

 8                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

 9   Mr. Roberts.

10                  Mr. Dubbs, you have three minutes remaining.

11             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS A. DUBBS

12                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

13                  MR. DUBBS:      Thank you, Your Honor.             Let me

14   begin with Justice Alito's question, and I promise to

15   get back to Judge Friendly and the Brooklyn Bridge.

16                  As to -- we have alleged that in -- that

17   effectively, ministerial activities did occur here.                      The

18   Second Circuit held, interpreting our complaint, that

19   the numbers were mechanically incorporated.                   That's as

20   close to ministerial as you get.

21                  We used, in the complaint, the were

22   "adopted."     We said that they were asleep at the wheel.

23   The meaning is the same, but the -- there were no

24   checkpoints.     The checkpoints are illusory.                If there

25   was a checkpoint, the guard was asleep at the


                                         52

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   checkpoint, and the MSR number went right through the

 2   checkpoint.    Those are the allegations, and we should be

 3   able to stick with the allegations.

 4                 Now, turning to the statute, my colleague

 5   indicated that the language with respect to foreign and

 6   interstate commerce and so on, based on the Aramco

 7   decision, was boilerplate.            That's wrong.       In this

 8   statute, those specific statutory approaches towards

 9   stopping fraud are in the substance of the statute.

10   They are not in the jurisdictional statute.                 That's

11   important.    That's why that's different.

12                 As to the Leasco example and Bersch example,

13   what Leasco shows is a long chain of causation, because

14   Leasco involved an American, not a foreigner, which was

15   very important under Judge Friendly's typology.                 And in

16   Leasco, you have this extended line of causation

17   beginning with representations in the United States

18   about a friendly, tender offer.                Then there was a phone

19   call, maybe in London, maybe in the United States, and

20   then there was a command by Saul Steinberg to his

21   investment bankers:      Go into the London Stock Exchange

22   and start to buy.

23                 That extended line of causation would not

24   pass muster under the direct cause test.                 The direct

25   cause test as this Court is using it in the RICO area


                                        53

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   under cases like Hemi, that would not pass muster.               What

 2   that shows, and Judge Friendly said that if you have a

 3   foreign Plaintiff, the direct cause is appropriate, that

 4   shows that the direct cause test is narrower, it's a

 5   screening device, and it limits the possibilities when

 6   you have a foreign Plaintiff.

 7                Now, that is a proper way to cabin the

 8   private cause of action.         Taking an eraser to the

 9   statute and saying:     The only words that count are on an

10   exchange, doesn't do it if you are going to keep a

11   linkage between the private cause of action and the

12   expressed words of the statute.               If that can't do it,

13   what are the other tools?          And the other tools are the

14   direct cause test, and this Court has been very ably

15   working through some of these difficult fact patterns in

16   the RICO area.

17                Now, in this case, there is not the problem

18   that there is in Hemi; there is not the intervening

19   cause.   You have a related party, NAB, that may or may

20   not be involved that allegedly is broken -- breaking the

21   chain of causation.     It is -- has to be, under that

22   doctrine, a totally third party, as it was in Hemi,

23   where you have the State of New York, the City of New

24   York and had all these bouncing balls going back and

25   forth.   This is a straight shot between that MSR being


                                       54

 1   fabricated in Florida and going on to the financial

 2   statements.    There is no intervening cause.

 3                 And even if we assume that in some senses,

 4   it was normal to look at those financial statements,

 5   that in and of -- of itself has failed.

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

 7                 The case is submitted.
