3              CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:     We'll hear argument


4    next in No. 01-455, Franconia Associates v. the United


5    States, and the Grass Valley Terrace v. United States. 


6              Mr. Eckland.


7                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFF H. ECKLAND


8                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


9              MR. ECKLAND:    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


10   please the Court:


11             This Court has held that statutes of limitations


12   involve fundamental considerations of fairness. 


13   Petitioners submit that the cases before Your Honors this


14   morning involve precisely that. 


15             In these two civil actions, petitioners seek


16   fair compensation for continuing to be bound to the


17   Section 515 housing program and continuing to house low-


18   income tenants for up to 50 years.     Petitioners can


19   succeed in obtaining that fair compensation only if this


20   Court continues to apply the same ordinary principles of


21   law to the United States Government that it applies to


22   United States citizens. 


23             The ordinary principles of law and their


24   continuing application to the United States Government


25   that are at issue here are, first, that a breach of




                                      Page 3

        1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
1    contract claim does not accrue until the date of breach;


2    that is, until the time for performance by the defendant


3    arrives and the defendant fails to perform.


4              QUESTION:   Mr. Eckland, you -- you began by


5    saying you're seeking fair compensation for something. 


6    Which is it?   Are you seeking fair compensation for the


7    Government's violation of the Constitution by impairing


8    the obligation of contracts, or are you simply seeking


9    your contractual rights?    Are you seeking a contract


10   claim?   Which -- what do we have before us? 


11             MR. ECKLAND:    We are -- Justice Scalia, we are


12   seeking compensation for the breach of contract.


13             QUESTION:   Okay.   So, it's a -- it's a simple


14   contract case.


15             MR. ECKLAND:    Very much so, Your Honor.    I mean,


16   included in the compensation that the petitioners are


17   seeking, it was not merely the lost income because of


18   their lost right to opt out, but given the situation,


19   petitioners are not receiving really sufficient income to


20   even cover the costs of maintaining the housing for their


21   current tenants.


22             QUESTION:   Do you think you have a separate


23   cause of action for the Government's violation of the


24   Constitution, assuming that -- that you're correct that


25   that's what it's done?

1                 MR. ECKLAND:    Under the takings claim, Justice


2    Scalia? 


3                 QUESTION:    Well, no, not the takings.   But --


4    but impairing the obligation of contracts.


5                 MR. ECKLAND:    Oh, quite so, Your Honor, yes.      We


6    believe that although it's for purposes --


7                 QUESTION:    This is a -- this is a Federal


8    contract?


9                 MR. ECKLAND:    It is with the Department of


10   Agriculture, Your Honor, through the Farmers Home


11   Administration. 


12                QUESTION:    So, the impairment clause doesn't


13   apply. 


14                MR. ECKLAND:    Well, it -- it comes -- no.     That


15   only applies to the States.


16                QUESTION:    My difficulty with your argument is


17   that if you have -- your whole property claim here rests


18   upon the contract.       And if you have a contract claim, then


19   your contract will be enforceable.       If you don't have a


20   contract claim, then I'm not sure what the source of your


21   property taking is on the -- on the unconstitutionality


22   claim. 


23                MR. ECKLAND:    Well, petitioners pled, Justice


24   Souter, the takings claim in the alternative to the breach


25   of contract claim.       And in fact, the lower courts have




                                         Page 5

                               Alderson Reporting Company
        1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
1    held that there is no enforceable contract here.


2              QUESTION:   Well, if -- if they are correct, then


3    I don't see how you've got a taking because your -- your


4    whole property interest -- the only property interest


5    you're asserting is an interest under that contract.        And


6    if you haven't got the -- if you have no breach of


7    contract, then I don't see what's being taken from you.


8              MR. ECKLAND:   What's being taken, Justice


9    Souter, is the expected use of the petitioners'


10   properties.   What happened is they volunteered to a


11   certain period of time --


12             QUESTION:   If you don't have a contract for it,


13   you have no right to expect it.


14             MR. ECKLAND:   But there were representations by


15   the Government that created a reasonable investment-backed


16   expectation on the part of --


17             QUESTION:   Why did the lower courts find that


18   there was no contract claim?     Because of the statute.


19             MR. ECKLAND:   Because of the -- one judge, in


20   particular, because of the unmistakability doctrine.


21             QUESTION:   Because of the --


22             MR. ECKLAND:   In other words, the contract was


23   not clear enough to constitute an enforceable contract


24   with the Government. 


25             QUESTION:   I thought the Federal Circuit went on




                                       Page 6

                               Alderson Reporting Company
        1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
1    the statute of limitations.    Isn't that what you're


2    opposing, that the statute of limitations didn't expire?


3              MR. ECKLAND:   Yes, Your Honor.    The lower court


4    opinions were denying our motion for summary judgment, so


5    we've not been able to get to trial on the existence of


6    the contract.   Assuming for the purposes of our case that


7    there is a contract, the Federal Circuit did affirm the


8    dismissal on the basis of the statute of limitations.


9              QUESTION:   Yes.   The question you presented is


10   whether a breach of contract claim accrues for purposes of


11   section -- when Congress enacts a statute alleged to


12   abridge a contractual right to freedom from regulatory


13   covenants upon prepayment of Government mortgage loans. 


14   Basically the -- the court held that your -- the statute


15   of limitations barred your contract claim, didn't it?


16             MR. ECKLAND:   That is true, Your Honor. 


17             QUESTION:   And that's the case we have here.


18             MR. ECKLAND:   Well, in -- yes.    Yes, it is,


19   Judge, a statute of limitations case. 


20             In our case, the petitioners alleged that their


21   claims accrued when they tried to prepay and when the


22   Farmers Home Administration failed to accept their


23   prepayment requests and refused to release them from the


24   regulatory covenants imposed by the Section 515 program. 


25   Petitioners all commenced suit within 6 years of that




                                      Page 7

                               Alderson Reporting Company
        1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
1    date, and therefore they maintain here that their claims


2    are timely.


3              Now, the Government maintains that the


4    petitioners' claims accrued not on the date dictated by


5    the ordinary principles of law, breach of contract and


6    takings, but rather automatically in the enactment of the


7    1988 legislation.     But if you look at -- closely at the


8    1988 legislation, it's clear that it has no immediate


9    impact whatsoever on the owners.     All of its commands,


10   directives, requirements, and authorizations are directed


11   solely at the agency. 


12             QUESTION:     Didn't the Federal Circuit rely on


13   anticipatory breach?


14             MR. ECKLAND:     No, Your Honor.   They maintained


15   that the actual passage of the -- of the statute


16   constituted an automatic breach.     They did not rely on the


17   anticipatory breach.


18             QUESTION:     You were relying on anticipatory


19   breach, as I understand it. 


20             MR. ECKLAND:     We do not either, Your Honor,


21   although the petitioners here have the option of suing --


22   assuming -- suing before the breach, assuming that they


23   had the ability to perform at that time -- and there's


24   nothing in the record --


25             QUESTION:     You rely on the notion that before




                                       Page 8

                               Alderson Reporting Company
        1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
1    they went to pay it off, it was an anticipatory breach.


2              MR. ECKLAND:   No, Judge.     We are relying on the


3    actual breach.   All petitioners --


4              QUESTION:   I'm sorry.    Then I'm confused.    I


5    thought that your argument was that the reason the statute


6    of limitations doesn't arise, doesn't start to run prior


7    to the time that they paid it off, is because prior to


8    that time, there was no actual breach.      There was only an


9    anticipatory breach. 


10             MR. ECKLAND:   Correct, yes.


11             QUESTION:   All right.    That's what I thought


12   Justice Ginsburg was asking.


13             MR. ECKLAND:   Yes.


14             QUESTION:   Now, but you take the position that


15   your clients could have filed suit soon after the passage


16   of ELIHPA.


17             MR. ECKLAND:   Justice O'Connor, not necessarily. 


18   Under the doctrine of anticipatory repudiation, they did


19   have a option to sue before.     But as we pointed out in


20   footnote --


21             QUESTION:   Well, that's what I'm asking you. 


22   You take the position -- let's be clear about your --


23   please -- that after the enactment of the statute, your


24   clients could have filed suit for breach of contract on an


25   anticipatory breach theory?

1                 MR. ECKLAND:   Yes, but only if they had the


2    ability to prepay at that time.      One of the requirements


3    of -- of the contract is that the petitioners had the


4    requisite funds to prepay before submitting a prepayment


5    request. 


6                 QUESTION:   Well, no, no, no, no, no.


7                 MR. ECKLAND:   That is --


8                 QUESTION:   You -- you don't -- you don't -- no. 


9    You have to -- you say for anticipatory breach you have to


10   show that you're ready to --


11                MR. ECKLAND:   Ready, willing, and able, Judge.


12                QUESTION:   -- to perform when -- when the


13   obligation to perform comes.      You -- you don't have to


14   show that you're ready for immediate performance.


15                MR. ECKLAND:   You do have to show that you're --


16   but for the repudiation, you do have to show that you are


17   able to perform.


18                QUESTION:   But performance here -- what you're


19   talking about here in performance means the ability to


20   prepay.   And I take it your argument is we couldn't have


21   prepaid because we didn't have the money, and therefore we


22   couldn't have proved damages.      Is -- is that it?


23                MR. ECKLAND:   Essentially so, Your Honor.    We


24   don't rely on --


25                QUESTION:   I have a contract to deliver 100,000




                                        Page 10

1    widgets 3 years from now.     The party who -- the party who


2    is committed to buy those widgets announces I am not going


3    to buy those widgets, and you say there is no anticipatory


4    breach unless I have on hand the 100,000 widgets, which I


5    have no obligation to deliver until 3 years from now. 


6    That's -- that's how you envision the -- the law of


7    anticipatory breach?     I'm sure that's wrong. 


8              MR. ECKLAND:     Well, no.   Well, footnote 23.    We


9    address this in our reply brief, Your Honor. 


10             QUESTION:     The whole purpose of anticipatory


11   breach -- most people use it not to get damages but to


12   relieve themselves of the obligation of -- of remaining in


13   -- in the status of being able to perform the contract. 


14   The person who would sue in the case that I gave you would


15   be suing so that he wouldn't have to go and acquire the


16   100,000 -- the 100,000 widgets.     It's never the case that


17   he's ready -- or almost never the case that he's ready


18   here and now to perform.


19             MR. ECKLAND:     But, Your Honor, if the person who


20   had the obligation to accept the delivery did not have the


21   funds, for example, even to purchase them, then that would


22   be sort of almost a fraudulent --


23             QUESTION:     He didn't need the funds until 3


24   years from now.     He has no obligation to purchase until 3


25   years from now.

1              QUESTION:    Could we agree to this? 


2    Could we agree to this, that so far as the element of an


3    anticipatory breach claim involves the act of the


4    Government, you had that element, and at least to that


5    extent, you could have brought an anticipatory breach


6    claim when the statute was passed?     Maybe you didn't have


7    other elements.    That's what we're arguing about, but you


8    had the -- you had the -- the Government's fault element. 


9    Is that correct?    Do you agree?


10             MR. ECKLAND:    Well, certainly, Justice Souter,


11   the --


12             QUESTION:    But you're saying, whether I could


13   have sued then or not, I certainly can sue at the point at


14   which I would claim my right to redeem without these


15   various conditions, and they refused to honor it.      You're


16   saying, even if I could have sued when the statute was


17   passed, I can also under contract principles sue when the


18   moment comes that I want to exercise my right to prepay.


19             MR. ECKLAND:    Correct, Your Honor. 


20             QUESTION:    Okay. 


21             MR. ECKLAND:    And -- and the doctrine does not


22   require you to sue until that date.     It's merely an option


23   to sue prior to that date. 


24             QUESTION:    So, you're arguing for total control

1    ready after 5 years, we're not ready after 7 years, we're


2    not ready after 10 years.      So, the statute would -- would


3    never run.   In other words, you're asking for any time


4    from the earliest, which is when the law is passed, until,


5    say, 20 years later. 


6              MR. ECKLAND:   Yes, Your Honor, we are.


7              QUESTION:   So, you could --


8              MR. ECKLAND:   Because the Government negotiated


9    option terms up to 50 years. 


10             QUESTION:   That was the deal. 


11             MR. ECKLAND:   That was the deal.


12             QUESTION:   Yes. 


13             MR. ECKLAND:   And the owners relied on that when


14   they signed up, and they had, you know, a clear


15   expectation that at some point in time they would be able


16   to prepay, opt out, and convert their markets --


17             QUESTION:   May -- may I interrupt you?


18             MR. ECKLAND:   -- to market rate -- yes.


19             QUESTION:   Did they have a right to assume right


20   after the -- the day after the statute was passed, did


21   they continue to have a right to prepay --


22             MR. ECKLAND:   The right --


23             QUESTION:   -- without any objection?


24             MR. ECKLAND:   Well, the right still existed,


25   Your Honor, but it wasn't -- it was repudiated at the time




                                       Page 13

1    of the statute. 


2                QUESTION:   Well, it wasn't just -- it's not like


3    a private citizen saying, I don't intend to perform 3


4    years from now.     You have a law passed that takes away a


5    certain contract right.     Was there a breach when the law


6    was passed? 


7                MR. ECKLAND:   Well, Your Honor, petitioners


8    maintain that the right was not eliminated.      It was, if


9    you will, conditioned --


10               QUESTION:   Do you maintain there was no breach


11   at the time the law was passed? 


12               MR. ECKLAND:   That's correct, Your Honor. 


13   That's merely repudiation.     The breach did not occur


14   unless and until the prepayment request was submitted and


15   denied. 


16               QUESTION:   But you would concede that the


17   statute changed your rights.


18               MR. ECKLAND:   The statute did condition them,


19   and that conditioning, or fettering as the Government


20   says, is a repudiation, but like any other situation in


21   the private sector, when you repudiate a right, the breach


22   doesn't occur until the time for performance comes due.


23               QUESTION:   The repudiation --


24               QUESTION:   Well, that's because a private party


25   has the right to change his mind.

1               MR. ECKLAND:   Correct.   Right, the defendant


2    could change their mind or the petitioner here could, in


3    fact, be able to --


4               QUESTION:   Doesn't the Government have the right


5    to change its mind?    Couldn't the Government pass another


6    statute going back to what the situation was before this


7    one?


8               MR. ECKLAND:   Yes, Justice Scalia.


9               QUESTION:   In fact, it did that at one point,


10   didn't it?


11              MR. ECKLAND:   They could and they did. 


12              QUESTION:   They did at one point, didn't they?


13              MR. ECKLAND:   In 1979 they initially conditioned


14   the right, and in 1980 they repealed it, retracted it. 


15   Now, under the Government's proposed rule, if -- if the


16   statute of limitations began to run immediately upon the


17   enactment of the statute, all of the petitioners here


18   would have been compelled to file their suit within 6


19   years of 1979, i.e., by 1985. 


20              QUESTION:   So, we're arguing about whether a


21   statute itself, without any action from the agency, can be


22   a repudiation.


23              MR. ECKLAND:   We believe it can be a


24   repudiation, yes, Mr. Chief Justice.        But the breach does


25   not ripen, if you will, unless and until the prepayment




                                       Page 15

1    request is denied. 


2              QUESTION:     Does the repudiation give you the


3    right to the same damages that you would receive for a


4    total breach of the contract?


5              MR. ECKLAND:     In our case, no.     The petitioners


6    maintain that since the housing is within a restricted


7    program, it really has no market value unless and until a


8    petitioner actually attempts to prepay.        But even


9    assuming, Your Honor, that there was some type of damage


10   caused by the enactment of the statute, still the


11   limitations period would not commence to run until the


12   time for performance came and was not rendered. 


13             QUESTION:     I think it's usually the case, is it


14   not, that when there's an anticipatory repudiation, it's


15   -- it's very difficult for the -- the other party to


16   determine what his damages are going to be.


17             MR. ECKLAND:     Very difficult. 


18             QUESTION:     Which is why he uses the doctrine to


19   get out of the contract rather than to seek damages.        In


20   the widget case I gave you, who knows?      Who knows what 3


21   years from now the price of widgets will be?        So -- so you


22   use it to get out of the contract.


23             MR. ECKLAND:     Petitioners here, being in the


24   Court of Federal Claims, have as their only remedy the


25   monetary judgment.     And -- and they are seeking damages




                                       Page 16

1    starting only as of the date that their prepayment request


2    was denied by the agency.    So --


3              QUESTION:    So are you -- you're saying that


4    there was a claim, or you're saying that -- that your


5    claim really doesn't accrue until you -- until you have


6    the -- the wherewithal to prepay.       So, you don't really


7    have a ripe claim until then? 


8              MR. ECKLAND:    We're saying the petitioners would


9    at least have to have the money to prepay.          They would


10   have to have the ability to perform.          You couldn't have a


11   situation, for example, where someone was unable to


12   prepay, they experienced repudiation and a breach, a later


13   breach, and then say, well, we would have performed if you


14   hadn't repudiated. 


15             QUESTION:    Well --


16             MR. ECKLAND:    They have to have the honest


17   intent to perform and have the ability to perform.


18             QUESTION:    I have a problem with that. 


19             MR. ECKLAND:    Yes. 


20             QUESTION:    But let's get -- if we can get -- for


21   the same reason Justice Scalia mentioned.          But let's


22   assume you had cash in the bank that would allow you to


23   prepay, and then there's a repudiation.


24             MR. ECKLAND:    Sure. 


25             QUESTION:    At that point, can't you show your




                                         Page 17

                               Alderson Reporting Company
        1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
1    damages?     You don't want to prepay, but can't you say --


2    have an expert in and say, this property has a certain


3    value and part of the value is the right at any time to


4    prepay the -- the loan and use it for another use?       And


5    this can be valued in the real estate market.      It's worth


6    more if I can prepay than if -- if I can't, and you have


7    some expert come in and tell you the difference in the


8    values.     And you do that at the moment the repudiation


9    occurs. 


10               MR. ECKLAND:   But here, Justice Kennedy, a 50-


11   year option exists.     Petitioners don't know, frankly --


12   they didn't know in 1979 and many didn't know in 1988 what


13   the value of their properties would be, given interest


14   rate structures and other market conditions at any given


15   point in time --


16               QUESTION:   Well, you mean 50-year options are


17   not subject to valuation?     Experts do this all the time.


18               MR. ECKLAND:   Well, but even so, even if you


19   could come up with a damage theory to cover this, still


20   it's clear that under the law, the breach would not be


21   deemed to accrue for limitations purposes until the time


22   for performance has arrived and performance failed.


23               I mean, if you take a hypo of the GSA leasing


24   some space in a building --


25               QUESTION:   You're -- you're just getting me

1    confused again.     I thought we established that you thought


2    a suit could have been filed for anticipatory breach of


3    some kind after the statute was enacted. 


4                 MR. ECKLAND:   If they're able to perform, yes,


5    Your Honor. 


6                 QUESTION:   And now you're saying no.     It's just


7    very confusing.     I don't know what in the world you're


8    arguing. 


9                 MR. ECKLAND:   Justice O'Connor, no.     If the


10   petitioners had the ability to pay, they could have


11   brought an anticipatory breach claim --


12                QUESTION:   Only if they had the ability to pay,


13   you say.


14                MR. ECKLAND:   According to Corbin and the case


15   law that we cite at footnote 23 of our brief, yes.         But if


16   we get beyond that, okay --


17                QUESTION:   Footnote 23 just says that ordinary


18   contract law applies to this kind of case.         We still --


19   but we still -- we still have to figure out what ordinary


20   contract law is.     Footnote 23 doesn't shed any light on


21   that that I saw. 


22                MR. ECKLAND:   But in this case --


23                QUESTION:   And -- and I might add that on page


24   27 of the blue brief, you say that the law constituted an


25   anticipatory repudiation and petitioners had the option of




                                        Page 19

                               Alderson Reporting Company
        1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
1    suing immediately.


2                MR. ECKLAND:   In general, yes, that's true, Your


3    Honor.   But here the petitioners sued within 6 years of


4    the actual breach.


5                QUESTION:   And in fact, you did not sue until


6    after the passage of 6 years. 


7                MR. ECKLAND:   From the statute, yes, Your Honor.


8                QUESTION:   From the enactment of the statute.


9                MR. ECKLAND:   But -- but all petitioners


10   commenced suit within 6 years of the date of the actual


11   breach, which is the date that the prepayment requests


12   were denied.


13               QUESTION:   So, what apparently the Government's


14   arguing -- does it matter if we call this anticipatory


15   repudiation or anticipatory breach?      I guess


16   technically --


17               MR. ECKLAND:   Technically --


18               QUESTION:   -- we should say anticipatory


19   repudiation?


20               MR. ECKLAND:   Yes, Your Honor. 


21               QUESTION:   Fine.   And so, what they say, in


22   part, which I'd like to hear your response, is if you're


23   right that where there is anticipatory repudiation of a


24   contract, the other side, if it's a private contract, has


25   a choice.    They can either sue immediately if conditions




                                       Page 20

                               Alderson Reporting Company
        1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
1    X, Y, and Z are fulfilled, or they wait until the contract


2    is actually breached.    But we are the Government and we


3    have to interpret this statute strictly, and therefore we


4    interpret it to mean that even if where you're dealing


5    with a private person, you'd have your choice; here


6    there's no choice. 


7              Now, your response is what? 


8              MR. ECKLAND:    Well, here, Your Honor, although,


9    yes, we need to construe the statute strictly, we cannot


10   do so in such a manner, however, to narrow the waiver of


11   sovereign immunity that has already occurred under the


12   Tucker Act.   As this Court held in Irwin and in Bowen


13   against New York, the tolling -- equitable tolling


14   principles at issue in those cases, which applied to the


15   private sector, were nonetheless deemed to apply to the


16   Government, despite the strict construction of the statute


17   of limitations involved in those cases.     Here there is --


18   although there's a conditioning of the right at the point


19   of the repudiation, no breach occurs until the performance


20   comes due and is not rendered. 


21             If -- again, if you look at the statute, under


22   ELIHPA, page 74 of our appendix 4a, all of its directives


23   are towards the Secretary.    For example, the Secretary


24   shall make reasonable efforts to enter into an agreement


25   with the borrower to extend the term of the -- of the




                                      Page 21

                               Alderson Reporting Company
        1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
1    contract.    It's the Secretary that needs to make those


2    reasonable efforts.     There's no directive directly to the


3    owner that the owner participate in that process.


4                QUESTION:   If -- if that's the -- I mean, I


5    really do think that your takings claim, which is the


6    reason you're going into this thing -- well, it was just a


7    conditioning of the right; it wasn't an elimination of the


8    right; it just reduced it -- you do all of that to -- to


9    support your takings claim.     But -- but it just -- it


10   confuses your -- your primary claim, which is the contract


11   claim.    I don't see why there -- if it's only a


12   conditional reduction and if it's only a direction to the


13   agency, I don't see why there was an anticipatory breach


14   then.    It seems to me that what you need for a taking, you


15   need for an anticipatory breach.     I don't see how you can


16   say it was enough for an anticipatory breach, but it


17   wasn't enough for a taking.


18               MR. ECKLAND:   You are correct, Your Honor.     It


19   does not have to be repudiation.     We maintain that that's


20   the most that it can be.     If it's not a repudiation, the


21   breach here then occurs on the adverse agency action, and


22   all petitioners maintain --


23               QUESTION:   And that's why you were confusing


24   Justice O'Connor, because you're not really ready to say


25   there was an anticipatory breach, because in order to




                                       Page 22

1    sustain your takings claim, you don't really want to say


2    there was an anticipatory breach because they didn't


3    really, absolutely break the contract.     They just gave a


4    direction to the agency and it didn't entirely eliminate


5    the right, it just conditioned it.


6              MR. ECKLAND:   Justice Scalia --


7              QUESTION:   You're carrying water on both


8    shoulders, it seems to me, and you're spilling a lot.


9              MR. ECKLAND:   Well, Your -- Your Honor, no.      At


10   the point of the denial of the prepayment request, there


11   is a definite breach and that's where the damages occur. 


12   But the takings --


13             QUESTION:   And you say in every breach there's


14   also a taking?


15             MR. ECKLAND:   Oh, no, Your Honor. 


16             QUESTION:   I don't understand that.     Why weren't


17   you satisfied with a breach of contract claim?


18             MR. ECKLAND:   Well --


19             QUESTION:   What -- what are you adding with this


20   so-called takings claim? 


21             MR. ECKLAND:   Well, in the event that the lower


22   courts do not rule in the petitioners' favor on the


23   contract claim, they have their wholly independent takings


24   claim, which is based not -- it's not predicated on the


25   existence of a contract.     It's simply the unilateral

4              MR. ECKLAND:     The buildings and their land. 


5    Before they entered into the program voluntarily, they had


6    the full use of their buildings and land.        And they


7    voluntarily --

11   can see, is going to take me into outer space?

13             QUESTION:     But -- and I'd worry about what I'd


14   write on that.     What's your view on that? 


15             MR. ECKLAND:     Well, there are differences


16   between the claims, Your Honor.     There are potential


17   differences --


18             QUESTION:     I know there are differences.        I


19   asked you a specific question.     If you win on the contract


20   claim, do you want us, nonetheless, to go on and answer


21   the second question?     It's either yes or no.


22             MR. ECKLAND:     Petitioners do, Your Honor, yes,


23   because damages are different.     In fact, the dates could


24   be different.     The taking could take place, for example,


25   at the end of the for sale procedure that's involved in --

1    in the prepayment process, which would be 6 months, at


2    least, after the denial of the prepayment request.


3              QUESTION:    May I --


4              QUESTION:    You've gotten the full benefit of


5    your contract, which is what would happen if you win on


6    your contract's claim.    What possible taking could there


7    have been?


8              MR. ECKLAND:    If -- in practical terms, Justice


9    Scalia, if we do prevail on the contract claim at trial, I


10   don't see that we would pursue the takings.


11             QUESTION:    That's fine, except what you're


12   asking us to do then is to write a little essay on a


13   matter that affects millions of other people in a very


14   serious way, in a case which doesn't seem completely to


15   present the issue.    If that's what you want us to do, and


16   I guess you have a right to do it.


17             MR. ECKLAND:    On behalf of the petitioners, I


18   mean, we would not abandon --


19             QUESTION:    Well, we have a right to dismiss it


20   too, I suppose. 


21             (Laughter.) 


22             MR. ECKLAND:    Yes, you do. 


23             QUESTION:    May I ask, because I have to confess,


24   I get -- am getting a little confused, too?      Just tell me


25   precisely -- forget the contract claim for a minute.       All

1    we've got before us is the takings claim.     What is it that


2    was taken and when?


3              MR. ECKLAND:    Prior to the time that the owners


4    entered into this program, they owned their land.      Many


5    owned the buildings. 


6              QUESTION:    I understand, and then they --


7              MR. ECKLAND:    Then they voluntarily agreed to


8    these restrictions on the use, only a certain level of


9    rent, only a certain income of tenants.     The


10   representations by the Government, even though they may


11   not have arisen to a contract, nonetheless stated that --


12   or gave the owners the expectation that at some point in


13   time they could prepay and opt out of the program. 


14             QUESTION:    Well, would you tell me what you


15   think was taken?   Is it the right to prepay that was


16   taken?


17             MR. ECKLAND:    If there is no contract right,


18   then no, that was not taken, Your Honor. 


19             QUESTION:    What -- what --


20             MR. ECKLAND:    What was taken is their -- is --


21   is the permitted use of the property under their


22   reasonable investment-backed expectation.     It's clearly --


23   it's -- it's a regulatory taking where the properties


24   experience a diminution in value because they can no


25   longer be used once the owner decides to -- to leave the

1    program in the manner in which they had been used prior to


2    their voluntary entry into the program. 


3                 QUESTION:   It's a regulatory taking of the right


4    to make use of the property the way you wanted.         Which


5    occurred when? 


6                 MR. ECKLAND:   Which occurred prior to the time


7    that they voluntarily agreed to participate in the


8    program. 


9                 QUESTION:   You mean before -- even before they


10   signed the contract? 


11                MR. ECKLAND:   Well, at or about the same time. 


12   I mean, if it's a contract, yes, but we -- you know, it


13   was pled in the alternative.         So far, the courts have held


14   there are no contracts.      So, what we have is just a


15   written representation --


16                QUESTION:   I've been trying to ask the question


17   that's --


18                MR. ECKLAND:   Yes. 


19                QUESTION:   Assume you never made a contract


20   claim.   What -- I'm trying to find out what your taking


21   claim would be, and I frankly don't understand. 


22                MR. ECKLAND:   It's just their inability to go


23   back to using their property the way they were because of


24   the passage of ELIHPA and the regulations that compelled


25   them to continue charging only a certain level of rent.

1    They could not raise their rent.


2              QUESTION:   Now, can we go back a little?         Did


3    your clients borrow some money from the Federal Government


4    at low interest rates?


5              MR. ECKLAND:    Yes.     Well --


6              QUESTION:   Yes. 


7              MR. ECKLAND:    The construction loan, Your Honor,


8    in many cases was initially from a private mortgage


9    lender.   Then that would be taken out upon the entry into


10   the contract by the Farmers Home Administration.          And that


11   was a low interest rate loan effectively --


12             QUESTION:   To develop the property.


13             MR. ECKLAND:    Yes, Your Honor.       Yes.   And that


14   was a low interest loan, but it devolved to the benefit of


15   the tenants in the form of low rents.         It didn't go into


16   the pockets of the owners.     They were able to charge


17   low --


18             QUESTION:   Well, to get the loan, the borrower,


19   your clients, had to execute a loan agreement and a


20   promissory note --


21             MR. ECKLAND:    Yes, Your Honor. 


22             QUESTION:   -- and enter into a mortgage.


23             MR. ECKLAND:    Yes. 


24             QUESTION:   And was the right of prepayment


25   spelled out in any of those agreements?

1              MR. ECKLAND:    The prepayment right itself was in


2    the promissory note, yes, Your Honor. 


3              Mr. Chief Justice, I see that most of my time is


4    spent.   If I may reserve the rest for rebuttal.


5              QUESTION:    Very well, Mr. Eckland.


6              Mr. Roberts, we'll hear from you. 


7                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS


8                      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


9              MR. ROBERTS:    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


10   please the Court:


11             Petitioners' claims are barred because they


12   weren't filed within 6 years of when they first accrued,


13   on the enactment of ELIHPA.     Petitioners allege that their


14   contracts gave them the option to prepay their mortgages


15   at any time subject to only those legal restrictions in


16   place when the contracts were made.     They're, thus,


17   alleging that the Government promised not to impose


18   additional legal restrictions on their option to prepay


19   and ELIHPA itself breached any such promise because ELIHPA


20   itself imposed additional legal restrictions on


21   prepayment.    Petitioners' contracts claims accrued at the


22   time of that present breach.


23             QUESTION:    Well, was -- do you -- do you concede


24   or should we take this case on the assumption that there


25   was a contract?    Do -- do we --

1              MR. ROBERTS:     We're -- for --


2              QUESTION:     -- do we assume it for purposes of


3    deciding this case? 


4              MR. ROBERTS:     For the purposes of deciding the


5    statute of limitations question, yes.


6              QUESTION:     And that the contract included a


7    right of prepayment.


8              MR. ROBERTS:     Included a right of prepayment and


9    not only a right of prepayment, because if the contract


10   just said you can prepay at any time, it like all


11   contracts would be presumed to be subject to subsequent


12   legislation.   So, the -- that right to prepayment had to


13   also include a promise that the Government wouldn't change


14   the rules and impose additional legal restrictions on --


15             QUESTION:     When I have my contract to pay a


16   million dollars when my ship -- when the ships with grain


17   come in, I say, a year in advance, ha-ha, I'll never pay. 


18   I'll never pay.   And therefore, I then have breached the


19   contract to carry out what I promised.


20             MR. ROBERTS:     No.   In that circumstance, it


21   would be anticipatory repudiation.      But -- but here you


22   have legislation, not a statement by a private party.


23             QUESTION:     So -- so what? 


24             MR. ROBERTS:     Well, two things.   One,


25   legislation itself alters the legal rights, and two --

1              QUESTION:     Well, the Government -- the


2    Government cannot -- cannot break a contract then.


3              MR. ROBERTS:     No.    The Government --


4              QUESTION:     The Government can always act by


5    legislation, can't it?


6              MR. ROBERTS:     Yes.    Yes, Your Honor, and the


7    Government --


8              QUESTION:     So, the Government --


9              MR. ROBERTS:     -- can breach the contract and --


10   and be responsible for damages.       And we're not arguing


11   that -- that they can't. 


12             QUESTION:     So long as it does it by legislation,


13   it's okay.


14             MR. ROBERTS:     No.    No, no, Your Honor.    The


15   Government --


16             QUESTION:     I thought that was your point, that


17   this -- this breach is different because it was done by


18   legislation. 


19             MR. ROBERTS:     That doesn't mean -- that -- that


20   doesn't mean that it's not a breach, but what it means is


21   that the breach is occurring at the time the legislation


22   is passed.


23             QUESTION:     So, fine.    The legislation says, ha-


24   ha, we won't pay.     You know, I just want the legislation


25   to say precisely what the private person said.         Now, you

        1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
1    say we reach a different result because it's in the form


2    of legislation? 


3                MR. ROBERTS:       Yes. 


4                QUESTION:      Okay.     Now, one thing -- I'm just


5    curious to get into that a little bit -- is, I don't


6    understand why the Government is taking the position it


7    does, as well as what the position is.                That is to say,


8    wouldn't you, if you win -- and this will help me


9    understand it -- have millions of people who have entered


10   into contracts with the Government poring over every law


11   that is passed, and probably every regulation, to decide


12   whether or not that law and that regulation will somehow


13   10 or 15 years from now impact on a real estate contract


14   they have with the Government?             A whole industry of


15   anticipatory breach, not really, lawyers will develop in

16   order to bring those claims immediately in the Court of


17   Claims because we might lose them later even though


18   everything would have been worked out. 


19               Now, if you can explain that to me, I suspect


20   I'll have a better time understanding your argument. 


21               MR. ROBERTS:       Okay.     What -- what we're -- what


22   we're asking for is that people who believe that their


23   contractual rights have been injured -- have been


24   infringed by a statute give the Government reasonably


25   prompt notice, in accordance with the statute of



                                    Page 32

                             Alderson Reporting Company
      1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
1    limitations, of their claims.      And the benefit of the


2    ability to have a prompt accounting outweighs, in the


3    Government's view, any additional lawsuits that may


4    result. 


5                And we don't think that there will be a


6    significant number of additional lawsuits because, as the


7    Court was explaining before, there's an ability to sue


8    immediately on the anticipatory repudiation theory.         So,


9    it isn't that the petitioners -- or that the Government is


10   not going to be subject to suit or --


11               QUESTION:    But what would the damages be when I


12   haven't got the wherewithal to pay? 


13               MR. ROBERTS:    The -- the damages are that


14   petitioners had a loan that they allege gave them an


15   unfettered option to prepay at any time.        And after ELIHPA


16   was passed, that loan no longer had that unfettered option


17   to prepay.    And a loan that has an -- has an absolute


18   prepayment option is worth more than a loan with a


19   severely restricted prepayment option.        The difference in


20   the value of the loan is reflected in the difference of


21   the value of the property that's encumbered by the loan,


22   and it's -- it's easy to measure by comparing the --


23               QUESTION:    Easy to measure?    You -- you'd bet


24   your life on that?      I mean, the -- the reason -- the


25   reason contract law has developed the option of suing for




                                        Page 33

        1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
1    anticipatory breach as just an option is precisely because


2    it is often so difficult to anticipate what your damages


3    will be.    And so, it leaves it up to the innocent party


4    who hasn't broken the contract to either sue immediately,


5    if he can calculate his damages and get them, or to wait


6    until the -- the time for performance comes. 


7                And what the Government is doing with this


8    theory is forcing everybody who has a contract with the


9    Government to come in with -- with speculative damages and


10   hoping that some court will find a difference between the


11   value of this contract now and what it would be 50 years


12   from now.    I -- I think it's a -- I don't know why you


13   would want to impose this kind of a regime upon


14   contractors with the Government. 


15               MR. ROBERTS:     The damages, first of all, can be


16   measured, as I said.       Second of all, the -- the


17   Government, as reflected in the statute of limitations,


18   has a -- has a prompt -- has an interest in prompt


19   resolution of the claims. 


20               QUESTION:   Well, I'm not --


21               QUESTION:   I mean, anything can be measured.    I


22   mean, you know, my life expectancy can be measured, but I


23   wouldn't bet a whole lot of money on it. 


24               MR. ROBERTS:     That -- that's right --


25               QUESTION:   You know, you -- you can come up with




                                         Page 34

        1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
1    a guess for -- for anything.      But -- but the reason we


2    give the option to the innocent party is precisely because


3    it's a guess.     It may be, you know, an educated guess, but


4    it's a guess. 


5               MR. ROBERTS:    With -- with due respect, Your


6    Honor, I -- I don't think that's the reason why the law


7    gives the -- the option to the innocent party.       The law


8    gives the option to the innocent party so that the -- the


9    party has the ability -- the opportunity to convince the


10   defendant to retract its wrongful repudiation.


11              QUESTION:    But if -- if it is an option, why


12   should the innocent party be penalized by having the


13   statute of limitations start to run then?


14              MR. ROBERTS:    It's not an option here because


15   the statute is a present breach.      And -- and to understand


16   that --


17              QUESTION:    Well, are you --


18              MR. ROBERTS:    -- it's important to understand


19   the nature of the promise that's -- that's at issue here,


20   I think, and if -- if I could try to go back to -- to do


21   that.


22              QUESTION:    Yes.   I was going to ask -- I -- I


23   think it's consistent with the Chief Justice's inquiry. 


24   Are you saying that there's only one cause of action here,


25   or do you concede that there are two causes of action, one

2    the actual breach?


3               MR. ROBERTS:   Our position is that there is an


4    actual breach at the time that the statute is passed, and


5    it's a breach of -- of the promise that the Government


6    made that it wouldn't impose additional legal restrictions


7    on prepayment.


8               QUESTION:   Even though --


9               MR. ROBERTS:   It's different from --


10              QUESTION:   Even though performance is not yet


11   due.


12              MR. ROBERTS:   Performance on that promise is


13   due, Your Honor.    Performance on that promise is -- is due


14   throughout the life of the loan.


15              QUESTION:   No.   But you can make that argument


16   with respect to any contract that is ever made.       You're


17   saying there is always an implicit term that they won't


18   monkey around with the terms of the contract, and whenever


19   in anticipation they do so, there's an immediate breach. 


20   And if you follow that analysis, then in fact the


21   distinction between repudiation and anticipatory breach on


22   the one hand and actual breach on the other will disappear


23   in every contract, public or private. 


24              MR. ROBERTS:   No, Your Honor, because -- because


25   the -- the difference is between legislation and the --

1    and the role that legislation has under background


2    principles of contract law and other actions. 


3              QUESTION:     The background principle of contract


4    law is that we try to treat the Government and a private 


5    contracting party together. 


6              MR. ROBERTS:     Yes. 


7              QUESTION:     And you're saying the fact that the


8    Government can speak through legislation, whereas a


9    private party cannot, alters that rule.          If so, then that


10   rule is going to have a remarkably short life because the


11   Government can do anything it wants to across the street


12   and displace the rule.


13             MR. ROBERTS:     The -- the distinction, Your


14   Honor, is that -- is -- is twofold.       The legislation


15   changes the legal rights and so there isn't an ability


16   anymore to perform. 


17             QUESTION:     Why does it change the legal rights


18   if the contract exists?     It may -- it may convert one


19   right into a -- a right to damages as opposed to a right


20   to performance, but the theory of contract is that by


21   repudiation you can't just change the legal rights.


22             MR. ROBERTS:     It does -- it does exactly that. 


23   That's what I mean by changing the legal rights, that it


24   changes -- there's no longer a -- a right to performance. 


25   There's only a right to the damages.          If it was a contract

1    --

2                QUESTION:   All right.   If that is so, then


3    exactly the same thing is true in a private contract when


4    there has been an anticipatory breach.


5                MR. ROBERTS:   No.   No, Your Honor, there might


6    be a right to specific performance if it was the kind of


7    contract that you could specific performance, but we would


8    submit that you couldn't get specific performance once the


9    Government --


10               QUESTION:   How does the fact that you cannot --


11               MR. ROBERTS:   -- precluded the performance by


12   law.   You could only get damages. 


13               QUESTION:   Let's assume you're right.     How does


14   the fact that you may not get specific performance against


15   the Government affect the right to damages, which you 


16   perfectly can get against the Government, as -- as against


17   any other private contract?


18               MR. ROBERTS:   The -- what it does is show that


19   there's -- that there's a change and an -- an injury right


20   at the time that the legislation is passed. 


21               QUESTION:   Then that gets back to the original


22   point.   If that's so, then the same argument is going to


23   apply in every contract, public or private.


24               MR. ROBERTS:   It -- it's not going to apply in a


25   private context because there isn't going to be a breach

2    the private party that --


3                QUESTION:   You -- you have invented --


4                MR. ROBERTS:   -- that the laws aren't going to


5    change. 


6                QUESTION:   I understand.     You have invented a


7    promise that I won't change the laws.        You can invent in


8    -- in private contracts an implicit promise that I will


9    not repudiate, and therefore, when you repudiate


10   anticipatorily, you have broken the contract and, bingo,


11   there is a breach of contract and you must sue at once.


12               MR. ROBERTS:   You -- you have --


13               QUESTION:   You no longer have the option.


14               MR. ROBERTS:   You have --


15               QUESTION:   You could do it.     I mean, it's just


16   -- you know. 


17               MR. ROBERTS:   You have no need to invent that. 


18   You have no need to -- to have that additional promise in


19   the private contract because -- because there isn't the


20   presumption.     There -- there isn't the presumption in that


21   circumstance that the contract is subject to legislation


22   even though the Government is -- has the ability to


23   legislate. 


24               QUESTION:   I see your point.

2    anticipatory breach not accepted by the other party starts


3    the statute of limitations running?     I mean, what case?


4              MR. ROBERTS:   My -- my argument is not that this


5    is an anticipatory breach.    The -- our -- our principal


6    submission is that this is a present breach, but -- but


7    it's a present breach of a promise that the Government --


8              QUESTION:   What --


9              MR. ROBERTS:   -- that has to be there in a


10   contract with the Government because of the


11   Government's --


12             QUESTION:   What if we disagree with you that


13   it's a present breach?   Do you still say that an


14   anticipatory breach starts the statute running?


15             MR. ROBERTS:   That -- that's not our principal


16   submission.   We -- but you could read the statute -- you


17   could read the statute that providing first accrues to


18   mean that the first -- that when a plaintiff can first


19   bring suit, that that's when the statute of limitations


20   starts to run --


21             QUESTION:   Even though that's not the law as


22   between private parties. 


23             MR. ROBERTS:   Yes, given the principles of


24   sovereign immunity and the principle that the statute


25   should be narrowly construed.    But -- but --

1              QUESTION:   But that -- that narrow construction


2    notion, or construed strictly notion, applies to deciding


3    whether there's a waiver by the Government of any


4    privilege of sovereign immunity.    And once we've decided


5    yes, the Government did waive it, the Government has said


6    it can be sued, we don't continue to look at every issue


7    and say, oh, it's the Government, we're going to strictly


8    construe it somehow. 


9              MR. ROBERTS:   The Court -- the Court has held


10   several times that statutes of limitations, as conditions


11   on the Government's waiver of its sovereign immunity,


12   should themselves be -- be narrowly construed and has


13   applied it in -- in cases, for instance, involving a


14   situation where a private party claimed that the


15   limitations period didn't run until an administration --


16   administrative determination had been made that there


17   wouldn't be -- that there was a -- was a loss and --


18             QUESTION:   Well, in this sense -- in this sense,


19   the Government actually needs less protection than the


20   private party because the Government at least is in the


21   position where it can always pass a statute of


22   limitations --


23             MR. ROBERTS:   Yes, the Government --


24             QUESTION:   -- which -- and if you're -- you're


25   concerned about your liability 50 years out or something,




                                      Page 41

        1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
1    I suppose you could pass a statute of limitations.


2                MR. ROBERTS:   The Government can do that and has


3    done it here, and the statute of limitations provides that


4    when the action first accrues, there are 6 years to sue.


5    And if -- if --


6                QUESTION:   Well, but again, I'm back to the


7    problem.    It -- it seems to me that on contract law there


8    are two causes of action, anticipatory repudiation,


9    anticipatory breach, and breach.     And you're conflating


10   the two.


11               MR. ROBERTS:   In the -- in the ordinary


12   situation, if a private party -- let's -- if -- if I may,


13   let's -- can I pose a hypothetical?     If -- if a -- if a


14   private party had promised that you could prepay, that the


15   other party could prepay at any time, and Congress passed


16   a statute that imposed restrictions on prepayment, that


17   statute would be neither an anticipatory repudiation or a


18   breach, but would provide a discharge. 


19               And -- but if the private party had promised,


20   subsidiary to the promise that it would be prepaid at any


21   time, that there -- that notwithstanding passage of


22   legislation, that if -- if there was legislation passed


23   that -- that -- excuse me -- that the private party had


24   promised that legislation wouldn't be passed or had


25   promised to indemnify, notwithstanding the passage of




                                       Page 42

                               Alderson Reporting Company
        1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
1    legislation, then there would be a breach at the time the


2    legislation is passed. 


3              And the Government has to make that promise, and


4    petitioners have alleged that the Government made that


5    promise here.    That's what -- that's what they lost on the


6    summary judgment motion in the -- in the lower court about


7    on the merits --


8              QUESTION:    I see that.   I think I understand


9    your argument.    It doesn't work with the private party. 


10   Your analogy isn't so great because it's not the private


11   party who can pass the law. 


12             But I think your argument is that unlike private


13   contracts, many, many, many Government contracts have the


14   following problem in them which was in Mobil.      Are the


15   parties here saying that if Congress passes a law, that


16   that -- all bets are off?    Are they saying the Government


17   promises to do this, Congress's law to the contrary in the


18   future notwithstanding?    What's the promise? 


19             And here you're saying the promise was in their


20   view we will do this irrespective of Congress's new law


21   and their -- your view is, no, it was conditioned on


22   Congress not passing a law.     Is that right?   Or maybe I


23   have it backwards.    But you're -- you're saying that in


24   Government contracts, there is a promise and there is an


25   issue whether the Government means that promise




                                      Page 43

1    irrespective of what Congress does in the future.


2                MR. ROBERTS:       Yes.      That --


3                QUESTION:      That's an issue.


4                MR. ROBERTS:       That's an issue, and then there's


5    a separate --


6                QUESTION:      And therefore, they're saying what


7    the Government meant was irrespective of what Congress


8    does, and you're saying no, it meant only if Congress


9    doesn't do to the contrary. 


10               MR. ROBERTS:       On -- on the merits -- on the


11   merits, yes.     But -- but --


12               QUESTION:      On the merits.        And you're saying


13   that kind of a contract issue is breached when Congress


14   passes the law to the contrary. 


15               MR. ROBERTS:       Yes.


16               QUESTION:      Okay.     And that's special for


17   Government. 


18               And now all I would like on that is:                 A, does


19   that apply to administrative regulations too; and B,


20   what's the authority for that? 


21               MR. ROBERTS:       Okay.      It would apply to


22   administrative regulations if -- if that was the -- the


23   issue whether the promise -- if -- if the issue was there


24   wouldn't be regulations -- different regulations that


25   imposed restrictions on prepayment.              It would apply to



                                    Page 44

      1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
1    that and it would be breached at the time the regulations


2    were promulgated.        They have the effect of law.


3                 The authority for that is the -- is the


4    background principle that's -- that's recognized in the


5    Winstar case, that's recognized in Bowen v. Posse, that's


6    recognized in --


7                 QUESTION:     All right.   But if it's just a


8    background principle, I would worry about the practical


9    consequence being of people, particularly in real estate


10   contracts, having to study every regulation, every statute


11   in order to tell their clients what to do.         Real estate


12   investors are nervous people sometimes.         And -- and they


13   would say, my God, I better bring a lawsuit and the lawyer


14   would say, don't worry about it.         This condition is never


15   going to arise anyway.        Who cares?   And if it does, sue


16   then. 


17        Now, that -- that's the practical thing I brought up


18   at the beginning, and if we're trying to say what's the


19   right legal principle, I think that practical problem is


20   relevant.


21                MR. ROBERTS:     Okay.   And then to return to the


22   -- to practical considerations that -- that we think argue


23   in our favor on that side, that's because the Government


24   has a prompt interest in -- has a -- has a strong interest


25   in a prompt accounting of the costs of legislative action.

1    And it's particularly important that -- it's -- it's


2    important that, one, that -- that a Congress close to the


3    Congress that enacts a statute be able to address the


4    consequences of the enactment.    And it's also important


5    that Congress --


6              QUESTION:   Which it could enact by repealing --


7              MR. ROBERTS:   -- be able to cause a --


8              QUESTION:   It could enact -- the -- the Congress


9    that's close to the first one could say, okay, we'll


10   repeal it.   And that's, Mr. Roberts, one of the major


11   problems I have with your argument.     You seem to say that


12   legislation is magic, and you can't have an anticipatory


13   repudiation because when Congress has spoken, that's it. 


14   But in this very case, Congress goes back and forth a


15   couple of times. 


16             MR. ROBERTS:   Yes.   Congress can repeal the


17   legislation, but it doesn't change the fact that during


18   the -- the period the legislation was in effect that


19   there's an alteration of legal rights, and there's also,


20   if there was a promise that -- that the -- that the rights


21   wouldn't be changed, a breach during that time. 


22             And although Congress did -- although Congress


23   did repeal the statute here, it -- it's far less likely in


24   the ordinary situation that Congress is going to repeal


25   statutes than it is that a private party is going to

1    change its mind about its intention to repudiate a -- a


2    contract, and --


3                QUESTION:   Well, Mr. -- Mr. Roberts, in the case


4    in which the Government, we'll assume, doesn't change its


5    mind, your argument in -- in response to Justice Breyer's


6    question seems to boil down to something like this.       Pity


7    the poor Government as the contract breaker because it may


8    not know just how much damage it's causing.      Therefore,


9    put a burden on the people harmed by the Government's


10   breach of contract to run in in a hurry and let the


11   Government know early on just how much damage it has


12   caused. 


13               Why should the burden of the Government's breach


14   of contract be shifted entirely for limitations purposes


15   to the victims of the breach? 


16               MR. ROBERTS:   When -- when there's a present --


17   when there's a breach, the general principle is the


18   statute of limitations starts to run at the time of the


19   breach.     It doesn't wait to run until --


20               QUESTION:   No, but your -- no, but your


21   argument, as I understand it, is that because of the


22   Government's peculiar power to pass legislation, the


23   Government should not be in the position of the usual


24   contract breaker who may be subject to an anticipatory


25   breach claim or an actual breach claim later.      You're




                                       Page 47

                               Alderson Reporting Company
        1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
1    saying the Government should be subject only to one claim


2    at the first moment that an anticipatory breach claim


3    should be brought.       And your argument for saying that is


4    the Government ought to have a right to make its victims


5    come in and tell it as early as possible how much damage


6    it has caused.     Why does the Government, simply because it


7    has a legislative power, have that kind of a moral claim


8    that the private contract breaker does not have?


9                 MR. ROBERTS:    There's this -- there's a -- a


10   very strong interest in permitting the Government to -- in


11   permitting Congress to decide it wants to wrap up the


12   costs of improvident Federal contracts that they have --


13                QUESTION:    Then why don't we let Congress -- why


14   don't we let Congress survey through the departments of


15   the Government how many contracts it has entered into or


16   guaranteed and tote up the damages in advance?       The


17   Government has access to this information if it wants to


18   get it.


19                MR. ROBERTS:    The -- the Government doesn't know


20   who's going to sue, for one.       And so -- so it -- what this


21   rule does is --


22                QUESTION:    In other words, the Government may


23   get off a little cheaper if it puts the burden on the


24   victims. 


25                MR. ROBERTS:    Well -- well, it -- there's a

1    dispute here as to whether the contract made this promise


2    or not, and the Government doesn't -- doesn't know how


3    that dispute is going to be resolved.      We don't believe


4    that -- that there was a promise that prepayment would not


5    be subject to subsequent legislation. 


6              QUESTION:   Well, certainly general contract law


7    is not -- you know, you could say it from the point of


8    view of general contract law, it's important that people


9    who breach contracts know as soon as possible how much


10   damage they've done, but obviously that doctrine has not


11   commended itself in the area of general contract law.


12             MR. ROBERTS:   Well, when they breach a contract


13   and it's a breach, the statute of limits does start to run


14   and the rule is that even if the damages can't be fully


15   ascertained, that -- that the statute of limitations run. 


16   And that's true with -- if -- if there was a contract


17   between one party to -- to employ another party for the


18   other party's life and that contract was breached, the


19   statute of limitations would run at the date of breach


20   even though it wouldn't be possible with certainty to know


21   the length of the damages.    A -- a contract for a breach


22   of warranty of merchantability --


23             QUESTION:   I think it's so hard to look at this


24   as an actual breach if we take it on the assumption there


25   was a contractual right of prepayment on demand by the

1    borrower.     I would think normally you would wait and see


2    if and when there was a request for repayment -- or early


3    payment, and you wouldn't really know that, of course,


4    with a -- the owner of real estate who goes out and he


5    gets a low interest loan from the Government to develop


6    it.    Now, if interest rates decline below that low rate in


7    the future within the 20-year period, then he might well


8    want to go have early payment so he can get an even better


9    deal.    But if interest rates are going higher, there's no


10   incentive for him to.       I wouldn't think you'd treat it as


11   an immediate breach because the Congress attached new


12   conditions to the circumstances of the prepayment.


13                MR. ROBERTS:    Even under the scenario you posed


14   that -- that there wasn't an incentive to prepay right at


15   the moment, there's still a -- a change in what -- in --


16   in the loan that petitioners have, and it's a loan where


17   they no longer have that option to prepay with unfettered


18   --

19                QUESTION:   No.   As I read the legislation, there


20   still is consideration of the possibility of prepayment,


21   but there are some new conditions imposed whereby the


22   Government tries to assure itself that there will still be


23   a certain number of low-income housing units out there on


24   the market.


25                MR. ROBERTS:    Yes, Your Honor, but petitioners

1    here aren't complaining about the fact that they're


2    ultimately not able to prepay.      They're really complaining


3    about the -- about the restriction in the circumstances


4    under which they prepaid, and -- and that's revealed by


5    their complaint where not all -- even -- petitioners have


6    -- have submitted requests for prepayment.      And some of


7    them have accepted incentives with -- and withdrawn their


8    requests.    So, if they were complaining about not being


9    able to prepay, they would have gone through the whole


10   ELIHPA process to see whether they -- they could prepay.


11               QUESTION:    Well, apparently at some point there


12   was a request to prepay.      Right?


13               MR. ROBERTS:    Some petitioners have made


14   requests to prepay.      Not all petitioners have made


15   requests to prepay.


16               QUESTION:    The -- but -- but petitioners -- some


17   of the petitioners in this case. 


18               MR. ROBERTS:    Some have but not all petitioners.


19               QUESTION:    Have made a request to prepay and


20   it's been refused.      Now, at that point, presumably, we can


21   see a breach.


22               MR. ROBERTS:    At that point, there's an


23   exacerbation in our view of the -- of the previous breach


24   because it's an application of the restrictions that were


25   imposed and that were imposed, according to petitioners'

1    allegations, in violation of the Government's promise not


2    to impose them.   But --


3              QUESTION:   Could you seek declaratory relief to


4    determine your liability?


5              MR. ROBERTS:      At the time of the --


6              QUESTION:   The legislation is passed.        You're


7    concerned that it might cause some monetary liability some


8    years hence.   You seek declaratory relief that this is not


9    a breach of the contract.


10             MR. ROBERTS:      I suppose that the Government


11   could -- could do that.      I'm not -- I -- you know, I don't


12   know for sure, but I don't know any reason why -- why --


13             QUESTION:   Let's see if this is a quick analogy,


14   and you may not know the answer.      I promise you in a


15   contract to give you an option to lease my beach house


16   every year for the next 15 years, and I also promise not


17   to make a contract disabling myself from carrying that


18   out.   I enter into a contract with him that does disable


19   myself from carrying that out.      Is that an immediate


20   breach or is it anticipatory?


21             MR. ROBERTS:      An immediate breach, Your Honor. 


22             QUESTION:   It is immediate?


23             MR. ROBERTS:      It's an immediate breach.     Do I


24   have something that -- that says --


25             QUESTION:   Yes.     I mean, that's pretty

1    analogous.


2               MR. ROBERTS:     No.


3               QUESTION:     That's pretty analogous to the


4    case --


5               MR. ROBERTS:     Yes.   I don't --


6               QUESTION:     -- that you were bringing up.


7               MR. ROBERTS:     I don't think that -- that the


8    case -- I don't have a case one way or the other on that


9    proposition. 


10              QUESTION:     I think you'll find it's an


11   anticipatory breach.


12              MR. ROBERTS:     But -- but ordinarily --


13              QUESTION:     If that is an anticipatory breach --


14              MR. ROBERTS:     If you didn't make any -- any


15   other promise at all, it would be an anticipatory breach. 


16   I agree with you.      But you wouldn't have need to make that


17   other promise because the -- because it would be presumed


18   that you wouldn't take action that would -- you wouldn't


19   be excused by taking action that makes it impossible for


20   you to perform.   But -- but that presumption doesn't apply


21   in the case of the Government and legislation because of


22   the --


23              QUESTION:     And your whole case hinges on that,


24   that the Government --


25              MR. ROBERTS:     Well --

1                 QUESTION:   -- is really different because of


2    this.    Now, if I believed that the Government -- and I'm


3    not -- I'm not saying I do -- that the Government was


4    really different for that reason, then this is a unique


5    kind of case and maybe we should have a different rule as


6    to when you have to sue.      I mean, if it's unique for that


7    purpose, maybe it ought to be unique as to whether these


8    people who don't know what their damages are at this point


9    have to sue right away or it can wait until -- until they


10   -- they submit their request for prepayment. 


11                If it's unique, we'll adopt a unique rule for


12   it.    Would that make you happy? 


13                MR. ROBERTS:   All -- all I can say to that, Your


14   Honor, is that -- that there are many situations in which


15   damages cannot be ascertained fully.          In fact, there are


16   situations in which courts have confronted situations


17   where the damages can't -- no measurable damages could be


18   found at all at the time of breach, and they hold that it


19   -- it runs from the breach. 


20                And the -- the policy arguments on our side are


21   the -- the Government's interest in a prompt accounting,


22   in being able to wrap things up and in not having --


23                QUESTION:   Well, but the Government has --


24                MR. ROBERTS:   -- to wait for 50 years to know --


25                QUESTION:   But the Government should want to

1    have some rules out there that would encourage it to be


2    able to deal with people on a commercial basis in some


3    areas.    You might want to be able to buy certain things


4    from the private sector or to engage in loan agreements. 


5    And to adopt the kind of proposal you're making


6    discourages anyone from dealing with the Government.       It's


7    a very peculiar rule. 


8               MR. ROBERTS:   I -- I don't think it discourages


9    them, Your Honor, because they -- they can sue and their


10   damages are measurable, and they can get the damages.       The


11   likelihood that interest rates are going to go up or that


12   interest rates are going to go down and -- and other


13   possibilities are -- are reflected in the -- in the change


14   in the value of the loans and they're measurable at that


15   time. 


16              And -- and if petitioners think they might be


17   able to prepay later, subject to the restrictions, so they


18   wouldn't be injured in that way, they can sue, get their


19   damages and then they'll be subject to the restrictions in


20   the program. 


21              And if they prepay and -- and the restrictions


22   don't prevent them in any way from prepaying or don't


23   impose any limitations on them, then they've gotten the


24   damages for what they've lost and they also get the


25   ability to prepay.

1              QUESTION:     Thank you, Mr. Roberts. 


2              Mr. Eckland, you have 2 minutes remaining. 


3               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFF H. ECKLAND


4                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


5              MR. ECKLAND:     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.    May


6    it please the Court:


7              The Government has not been able to cite to one


8    case in which a congressional statute has been treated


9    differently, in other words, that it constitutes an


10   immediate breach of a contract. 


11             In the petitioners' briefs, we have a total of


12   six cases that make the distinction between a


13   congressional statute as being merely a repudiation and


14   the breach not occurring until there has been some adverse


15   agency action.    In the Court of Federal Claims, we've got


16   Plaintiffs in Winstar-Related cases, Bank of America, and


17   Conoco.   The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, Far West,


18   Schism, and Stone Forrest.     And two of those cases,


19   Plaintiffs in Winstar-Related cases and Bank of America,


20   dealt with the statute of limitations and have ruled in


21   favor of the petitioners' position advocated here.


22             Congress makes policy.     It directs agencies what


23   to do, and petitioners maintain that in that sense it is


24   no real different than a board of directors of a


25   corporation.   A board of directors can direct the CEO or a




                                       Page 56

                               Alderson Reporting Company
        1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
1    program manager not to perform a contract, but that


2    directive or that change in bylaw by a board of directors


3    does not constitute a breach.    It's merely a repudiatory


4    act.   The -- the breach does not ripen unless and until


5    the program manager or CEO actually fails to perform at


6    the time that performance comes due. 


7              Here it's clear that since the petitioners can


8    reach their central right of opting out of this program


9    upon prepayment -- and the statistics show that -- it


10   can't be that the statute is an immediate breach.      A


11   breach occurs only if and when the agency acts and denies


12   a prepayment request.


13             In closing, Your Honors, petitioners here


14   understand that as U.S. citizens they have an obligation


15   to follow the law and to know the law.     But here the


16   Government enticed the petitioners into this program by


17   holding out a 50-year option term, only to withdraw it


18   upon the time that the petitioners built the properties.


19             If the Government is not willing to give the


20   petitioners the benefit of their bargain, fundamental


21   considerations of fairness at least require that they get


22   the benefit of the doubt and that these ordinary


23   principles of law regarding the accrual of breach of


24   contract and takings claims should be able to be invoked


25   by the petitioners such that they do not need to file suit
