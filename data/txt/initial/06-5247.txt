 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   We'll hear argument

 4   this morning in case 06-5247, Fry versus Pliler.

 5              Mr. Haltom.

 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR S. HALTOM

 7                  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 8              MR. HALTOM:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10              The constitutional error that occurred in

11   Mr. Fry's third trial is the type of error that can

12   result in a conviction of an innocent person.

13   Notwithstanding the nature of the error that occurred in

14   Mr. Fry's trial, no court has reviewed the effect of

15   that error or evaluated the effect of that error under

16   the constitutionally mandated Chapman standard.

17              Mr. Fry's position is simply that he is

18   entitled to one bite at the Chapman apple.                 In the

19   California Court of Appeals, that State appellate court

20   should have, but did not, rectify the constitutional

21   trial error that occurred in this case.                  Had that court

22   complied with this Court's precedent, that court would

23   have first identified the constitutional error that

24   occurred at trial, namely the chambers error, and

25   second, reviewed the effect of that error, assessed the


                                         3

 1   effect of that error under the Chapman test.

 2              The failure of that court to do so, the

 3   unreasonable decision-making of that court, relegated

 4   Mr. Fry to seeking relief in Federal habeas proceedings.

 5              It scarcely seems reasonable --

 6              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I suppose he could have

 7   come here on direct.

 8              MR. HALTOM:        He could have, Your Honor,

 9   however, he didn't have the right to counsel to come

10   following his appeal to the State appellate court, and

11   then after the denial of his petition, it would be a

12   discretionary review in the California Supreme Court, he

13   no longer had the right to counsel.

14              And the fact of the matter is if he had

15   filed a petition for writ of certiorari following that,

16   it would have effectively been asking at that stage for

17   a type of error correction.

18              It scarcely seems logical that the scope of

19   the remedy to which Mr. Fry is entitled for the

20   constitutional violation that he suffered, that that

21   should be curtailed based upon simply the unreasonable

22   decision-making of the State appellate court in the --

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, if we're talking

24   about what -- where is the logic in the result that I

25   believe you're position produces, which is that a

 1   prisoner who loses in the State court on harmlessness

 2   grounds, because the State court finds it's harmless,

 3   obtains no habeas relief in Federal court unless the

 4   error actually prejudiced him.              Whereas if the State

 5   court never reached the harmlessness ground, and erred

 6   on -- or ruled on whether the violation occurred,

 7   whether there was any constitutional violation, then he

 8   would obtain relief if there is merely a reasonable

 9   probability of harm.

10               Now, you know, why would there -- what does

11   he care whether -- whether the error below consisted in

12   an erroneous harmlessness determination or an erroneous

13   determination that there was no violation?                     Why should

14   there be a different standard of review between the two?

15               MR. HALTOM:        Justice Scalia, that's the

16   point raised in the Solicitor General's amicus brief

17   here.   And in Mr. Fry's case, what happened was that

18   there was a harmless error analysis conducted, albeit

19   truncated, by the State appellate court.                     But it was not

20   a Chapman analysis.     And that failure of the State

21   appellate court to engage in a Chapman analysis is

22   contrary to this Court's precedent.                     It ignores Chapman,

23   it also would be an attack on --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Let's assume another

25   violation, the court erroneously determines --


                                        5

 1   erroneously -- that there was no constitutional

 2   violation at all.     Its error is not with regard to the

 3   harmlessness, but with regard to whether there was a

 4   constitutional violation.           Why should there be one

 5   standard of review for one error and a different

 6   standard of review for the other, regardless of whether

 7   the State court conducted Chapman or not?

 8               MR. HALTOM:         I don't know that necessarily

 9   there has to be one standard of review for the other --

10   for one or the other, Your Honor.                 Our position in this

11   case is simply following the logic of this Court's

12   decision in Mitchell versus Esparza, that this Court or

13   any Federal habeas court needs to consider what the

14   State appellate court did.           You cannot divorce -- there

15   is the underlying constitutional violation that occurred

16   in Mr. Fry's trial.      Then that error is compounded when

17   a State appellate court fails to assess the effect of

18   that error under the Chapman standard.

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:              You could say the same

20   thing when the State court has erroneously determined

21   that there was no violation.

22               In that case, you apply the Kotteakos

23   standard.   I just don't understand the rationale of

24   applying a higher standard to the other error.

25               MR. HALTOM:         Well --

 1              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought the State court

 2   didn't find that there was error.               I thought the State

 3   court said, this was cumulative, I'm not going to let it

 4   in.

 5              MR. HALTOM:        That's correct.

 6              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             It wasn't until we got

 7   into the Federal court that there was an error found.

 8   As far as the State was concerned, there was no reason

 9   to engage in any kind of harmless error review, Chapman

10   or not, because there was no error.

11              MR. HALTOM:        That's correct.             That's in

12   pages 94 to 97 of the joint appendix.                  The State

13   appellate court concluded there was no error as a matter

14   of State law in this case.         The court also concluded

15   that there was no constitutional error.

16              Then in a footnote, footnote 17 on page 97

17   of the Joint Appendix, the State appellate court stated

18   in the alternative, effectively, there was no prejudice

19   that Mr. Fry possibly could have suffered in this case.

20   However, in making that alternative holding, the State

21   appellate court, the California court, was applying

22   what's known as the Watson standard, which as this Court

23   has repeatedly recognized, is the functional equivalent

24   of the Kotteakos type standard.

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:             And it is that


                                       7

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   determination that you are objecting to here.                  The

 2   harmlessness determination.

 3                MR. HALTOM:       I am, Your Honor.            Obviously,

 4   we are objecting to the State court's finding of no

 5   underlying substantive constitutional violation, as well

 6   as the State court's determination that there was no --

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:            But for the former, you are

 8   perfectly content with our applying Kotteakos.                  And for

 9   the latter, however, you say we have to apply Chapman.

10   I just don't see the logic of that.

11                MR. HALTOM:       Well, first of all, this case,

12   since it has now been determined in the Federal courts

13   that there was an underlying constitutional violation,

14   does not present that question.              We do -- and I

15   understand the position that you are raising,

16   Justice Scalia, that there is a potential split in the

17   logic there.   I don't think the Court has to resolve

18   that here.

19                Some of the lower Federal courts have

20   determined that now, in light of AEDPA, the Brecht

21   standard has been completely supplanted.                  Some courts

22   have construed this Court's decision in Mitchell versus

23   is Esparza to lead to that conclusion.                  And that may

24   very well be the case.       However, I don't think the Court

25   needs to ultimately address that proposition in this

 1   case.

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  As I read the

 3   Court's opinion in Brecht, the Brecht standard on

 4   harmlessness is based on the structural consideration

 5   that your under collateral review at that point, rather

 6   than under direct review.          You would apply a different

 7   harmlessness standard that doesn't seem to take into

 8   account the fact that it's collateral review rather than

 9   direct.

10              MR. HALTOM:         Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice,

11   collateral review, as this Court pointed out in Brecht,

12   can result in a more deferential standard of harmless

13   error inquiry.   The -- those considerations that led

14   this Court in Brecht to adopt Kotteakos rather than

15   Chapman apply across-the-board in all habeas cases.

16              However, a central theme of the Brecht

17   decision was that there have been Chapman analysis

18   conducted by the State appellate judiciary --

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, I guess that's

20   where maybe we -- is the subject of debate, whether the

21   central theme in Brecht was, this is collateral review,

22   and that calls for a different standard, or whether the

23   central theme was Chapman review had been undertaken,

24   and therefore, that calls for a different standard.

25              I'm not sure I agree with you that the


                                        9

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   latter is the case.

 2                MR. HALTOM:       I agree that it could be -- it

 3   is a debatable point.      But the -- to ignore the

 4   circumstance that this Court stressed, I think

 5   undoubtedly stressed in Brecht that there had been that

 6   State appellate review is to basically divorce the

 7   holding in Brecht from the factual context in which that

 8   case -- or out of which that case arose.

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:           The dissenters certainly

10   thought that that was the consequence, the dissenters in

11   Brecht.   They said that Kotteakos would apply even where

12   the State court has found that "no violation has

13   occurred."

14                MR. HALTOM:       That's true, Justice Scalia.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:           In other words, never

16   approached the harmlessness thing.                 That's what the

17   dissenters thought.

18                MR. HALTOM:       The dissenters thought that the

19   import of Brecht was that it was going to apply

20   across-the-board in Federal habeas --

21                JUSTICE BREYER:           And I don't think the

22   majority said the contrary.            I mean, I wrote it.       I

23   mean, I don't know -- what counts is what I wrote, not

24   what I thought.   But if you read it, I don't think it

25   decides this question.

 1                 What I wonder, though, is why does the --

 2   how does this case present the issue you want to argue?

 3   I'm -- Justice Ginsburg made me wonder about that.                 As I

 4   understand it, the trial court said, I'm not going to

 5   let this witness testify, it is cumulative.                 All right.

 6   And then the appeals court said, well, that wasn't a

 7   mistake.    And one reason it wasn't a mistake is that

 8   this witness added nothing.             There could no possible

 9   prejudice, says the trial court, when he excluded that

10   person.    That means it was cumulative, that means it did

11   nothing, and that was the appeals court.                 So the appeals

12   court finds no error.

13                 Now, we get over to the Federal court.               And

14   they say, oh, no, this witness added a lot.                Well, they

15   couldn't have thought this witness added a lot to the

16   point where the constitution is violated unless they

17   disagreed with that decision of making no possible

18   difference.    Very well.       We disagree, send it back.          End

19   of case.

20                 Now, where does it raise all this stuff

21   about harmless error and -- I mean, when I -- it is hard

22   for me to get my mind around this issue, because it's so

23   complicated.    How does this case raise it?

24                 MR. HALTOM:       Well, I suppose, Your Honor,

25   because of the fact that the State appellate court


                                        11

 1   didn't simply state, we find no error, and leave it at

 2   that, but rather, the State appellate court also raised

 3   the point that, in a footnote, in a truncated manner,

 4   that there is no possible --

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Was that as a reason for

 6   there not being error?        Or was it in the context of

 7   saying, well, even if there was a mistake, there was no

 8   possible prejudice.      What does the footnote mean, in

 9   your opinion?    The second?

10                 MR. HALTOM:       Yes.

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:           What is the footnote

12   number?

13                 MR. HALTOM:       It's footnote 17.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay.       I'll read it.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Page what?

16                 MR. HALTOM:       It's 97 in the Joint Appendix,

17   Your Honor.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Thank you.         Very helpful.

20   The other thing which I brought up, so I might as well

21   get both my questions out, is that years ago I read a

22   decision by Judge Leventhal that made a big impression

23   on me.    And he was a very good judge.                  It's in a

24   different context, it's the same problem.

25                 He said, I originally thought this was the

 1   case dreamed of by law professors, a case where I could

 2   conscientiously say, although I consider the findings

 3   clearly erroneous, so I'd reverse if it were a judge's

 4   decision, nonetheless, there is support and substantial

 5   evidence.   And therefore, I affirm it, because it comes

 6   from an agency.

 7               But when I think about it, I don't think

 8   there's substantial evidence either.                     Okay.   In other

 9   words, has there ever been a case in the history of

10   mankind where you think a judge has actually thought to

11   himself, after reviewing the record, oh, I think that

12   this is harmless, so I'll affirm.                 But I don't think

13   it's harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, so I'll

14   reverse.

15               I mean, I find it very difficult to get

16   myself in that state of mind, where I think such a thing

17   is possible.

18               MR. HALTOM:         I agree with you, Your Honor.

19   It's angels on the pin of a needle, I guess is the

20   phrase here, and this case may be a case where the

21   difference between Chapman and Brecht could be of

22   consequence.    If you'd look at the district court's

23   treatment of this case, at the district court level the

24   court stated:    "Mr. Fry comes close to demonstrating

25   actionable error," and that court is applying the Brecht


                                        13

 1   standard.   The district court states:                  "I cannot rule

 2   out prejudice in this case."            So seemingly had that

 3   court applied Chapman, Mr. Fry would have prevailed in

 4   the district court.

 5               Likewise, in the Ninth Circuit we have the

 6   dissenting justice concluding that there is prejudice

 7   even under the Brecht standard, and then we have the

 8   panel majority in ruling against Mr. Fry on the

 9   prejudice issue stating that had Pamela Maples'

10   testimony been admitted that would have substantially

11   bolstered Mr. Fry's claim of independence.                  That

12   statement seems inconsistent with the finding that it is

13   harmless error under Brecht; and even if it's not

14   inconsistent it seems that had that court been applying

15   the Chapman standard, that court would have ruled in

16   Mr. Fry's --

17               JUSTICE STEVENS:            If I could come back to,

18   may I ask this question:         Is part of your argument that

19   even under the Brecht standard it was not harmless?

20               MR. HALTOM:        Yes, Your Honor.

21               JUSTICE STEVENS:            This is a case, am I

22   correct, where there were two, two hung juries and then

23   a five-week deliberation in this case?                  And there was a

24   harmless -- and the testimony of Maples was she had seen

25   a guy who didn't fit the description do the killing?

 1                 MR. HALTOM:        Correct, Your Honor.

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Where is that in the

 3   question presented?

 4                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It says that if the Brecht

 5   standard applies, does the Petitioner or the State bear

 6   the burden?    I guess that's the narrower question, who

 7   has the burden.

 8                 MR. HALTOM:        Well, the Respondent has

 9   essentially conceded that under O'Neal that they bear

10   the risk of non-persuasion.

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:            But O'Neal, I thought

12   O'Neal just says that this word "burden of proof" is out

13   of place when you talk about an appellate judge reading

14   the record.

15                 MR. HALTOM:        I think that that was what the

16   holding in the majority opinion was, but I think, as

17   Justice Thomas pointed out in his dissenting opinion,

18   the effect of that is to allocate the risk of

19   non-persuasion to the State.              And so I think that

20   that's -- I could be wrong, but it seems to me a

21   semantic point.

22                 And to Justice Stevens' question, as you

23   pointed out in your concurrence in Brecht, the Kotteakos

24   standard which this court adopted in Brecht is an

25   exacting standard.      And in applying that standard, if

 1   you'd look at this case, the Court's decisions,

 2   Sullivan, Kotteakos, say that the focus has to be on the

 3   jury.     Here we have a jury in the third trial that

 4   deliberated for 23 court days after 29 court days --

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You're now arguing

 6   that under Brecht this should not have been harmless; is

 7   that the point you're making?

 8                 MR. HALTOM:        Yes, Your Honor.

 9                 THE COURT:       Okay.        Now, I didn't hear the

10   answer to my question.         I'm not sure that is in the

11   question that you presented and on which we granted

12   cert.     It says which standard applies, who bears the

13   burden.     I don't see anything saying is this -- was it

14   erroneous to conclude that this was harmless under

15   Brecht.

16                 MR. HALTOM:        Well, I believe, number one,

17   does it matter which standard applies as part of the

18   question presented?       Does it matter which harmless error

19   standard is implied?        My answer to that is no, because

20   Mr. Fry prevails under either Brecht or Chapman.

21                 And this Court could in this case simply

22   decide this case on that very narrow question, like many

23   court do where this issue is raised, this intellectually

24   challenging issue of what should a habeas court apply,

25   Brecht or Chapman, when there has been no Chapman

 1   analysis in the State court or when there has been an

 2   objectively unreasonable Chapman analysis in the State

 3   court.   Most courts confronted with that issue say, we

 4   don't need to decide the question here because either

 5   the error was plainly harmless under both of those

 6   standards or plainly not harmless under both of these

 7   standards.    And I simply recounted the history of the

 8   litigation below in the Federal courts to point out that

 9   this could be a case where that make a difference.                     It

10   seems like --

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:            The trouble with reading

12   that second question that way is that, you know, it

13   follows from your first question, which speaks in the

14   generality of cases.       It's not speaking to this case.

15   Your first question presented is, if constitutional

16   error in a State trial is not recognized by the

17   judiciary until the case ends up in Federal court, is

18   the prejudicial impact assessed under the standard set

19   forth in Chapman or in Brecht?               That's the first

20   question.    Very generalized.

21                Second question:            Does it matter which

22   harmless-error standard is employed?                     I didn't take that

23   to mean does it matter in this case which of the two.                       I

24   thought it meant, you know, is there any difference

25   between the two standards?           Don't you think that's fair

 1   reading of it.

 2              MR. HALTOM:        No, Your Honor.

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:            You think it means, does it

 4   matter in this case which harmless -- you think that

 5   second sentence means would, would the defendant be

 6   entitled to reversal of the conviction no matter which

 7   harmless error standard is employed?                    You think that's

 8   what it means?

 9              MR. HALTOM:        I think that that is the import

10   of that portion of the question.

11              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Is that a question on

12   which we would be likely to grant cert?

13              MR. HALTOM:        Perhaps not if that was the

14   only question in and of itself, but perhaps so because,

15   as I indicated before, as Justice Stevens stressed in

16   his concurring opinion in Brecht, the Kotteakos standard

17   is a demanding standard.        And look at this case.              If the

18   error in this case can be deemed harmless under any

19   standard, then what cannot?           What is prejudice when

20   you're looking at the jury and when you have a jury

21   where nine days into the deliberations at least five of

22   them voted that Mr. Fry was not guilty.                    They told the

23   judge that they were at an impasse.                    This jury struggled

24   mightily with this evidence.

25              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Would you help me with one

 1   thing I'm not terribly clear about, though.                   Is it clear

 2   which -- what side the magistrate thought had the burden

 3   of persuasion?

 4                MR. HALTOM:        It is not, and it seems as

 5   though, looking at the language that the magistrate

 6   judge utilized in his findings and recommendations, that

 7   he was looking to me, to Mr. Fry, to meet that burden.

 8   And I quoted his language in my brief and to the Ninth

 9   Circuit and I argued to the Ninth Circuit that the

10   burden of persuasion had been improperly allocated to

11   Mr. Fry.    However, that issue was simply not addressed

12   in the Ninth Circuit's opinion.

13                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Does your opponent now

14   concede that the State has the burden?

15                MR. HALTOM:        Yes, Respondent concedes that

16   their burden -- that it's their burden --

17                JUSTICE BREYER:            How do they say that after

18   I thought I wrote an opinion for the majority of the

19   Court which said this concept is not applicable in --

20   when you're reviewing a record for harmless error.                   It's

21   not a question of presenting evidence.                   What I think it

22   said is that it's not a question of presentation of

23   evidence.    In such a case, we think it's conceptually

24   clear for the judge to ask directly, do I the judge

25   think that the error substantially influenced the

 1   judge's -- the jury's decision?                Now, maybe I was wrong,

 2   but I think there was a majority of the Court that

 3   agreed with it.

 4               MR. HALTOM:         Yes, Your Honor.           And I think

 5   your point, as I understood it, in O'Neal was that it

 6   analytically does not make sense --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:             To talk about burdens of

 8   proof?

 9               MR. HALTOM:         -- when the appellate court is

10   --

11               JUSTICE BREYER:             Yes.      But that's my basic

12   question in this case and it's a serious question.

13   Suppose I think, which I do think, that I as a judge can

14   conscientiously review a record and decide for myself

15   whether I think this error of the judge was harmless,

16   and if I really try I can bring myself to understand

17   this question.    Regardless of what I think, could

18   another judge, say a State judge, reasonably have

19   thought the opposite?       I can do that mentally.

20               You try to get me to make more fine

21   distinctions than that, I cannot do it.                  I can't.   I'm

22   sorry.   I admit it.

23               Now, if that's the state of mind that I can

24   get myself into -- and I believe that's true of many

25   judges -- how do I write words that are realistic in

 1   this area?

 2                MR. HALTOM:       I think that that's a question,

 3   Your Honor, that this court has struggled with.                   As

 4   Justice Scalia pointed out in his concurring opinion in

 5   Dominguez Benitez, that we're talking about with these

 6   harmless error standards ineffable gradations of

 7   probability that are beyond even the judicial mind to

 8   grasp.   But I think if we just tie it to the facts of

 9   this case, I think that in the explanation you just gave

10   that there is no reasonable judge who could look at this

11   case and conclude --

12                JUSTICE ALITO:         There are many situations in

13   which an appellate court has to apply a legal standard

14   to facts in criminal cases and civil cases.                In a

15   criminal case, an issue on appeal could be whether

16   there's sufficient evidence to support the verdict.                    Do

17   you think there's a burden of persuasion on appeal on

18   all of those issues?

19                MR. HALTOM:       With respect to a standard

20   sufficiency analysis, no, Justice Alito.                It's just a

21   question for the appellate judge to discern, was there

22   sufficient evidence in the record reviewing the evidence

23   in the light most favorable to the prosecution.

24                JUSTICE ALITO:         What's the difference

25   between that and applying any harmless error standard?


                                       21
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   It's exactly the same kind of analysis.                    It's a

 2   different legal test, but you're applying, you're

 3   applying the law to facts.

 4              MR. HALTOM:         I agree.          And I don't quarrel

 5   at all with the way that the court described -- said

 6   that looking at the prejudice inquiry or a harmless

 7   error inquiry in the O'Neal case, that it doesn't fit to

 8   look at it in terms of the allocation of burden.                     I

 9   don't think that this case ultimately turns on that,

10   except to the extent that the magistrate judge when he

11   wrote his finding and recommendations that were adopted

12   by the district court judge did state that he was

13   looking to Mr. Fry to make the sufficient showing --

14              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Are you talking about

15   what's on the bottom of page 181 of the joint appendix?

16   That was the only place that I found where the

17   magistrate expressed a view on this.                    It reads:   "The

18   court does not find that there has been" -- "the court

19   does find that there has been an insufficient showing.

20   So that "insufficient showing" means showing by the

21   Petitioner."   Is that what you're relying on?

22              MR. HALTOM:         Yes.       That's exactly what I'm

23   relying on, Your Honor.

24              So, going back to specifically the facts of

25   this case, this Court could, as I indicated earlier,

 1   without regard to the thorny Chapman versus Brecht

 2   question, decide this case solely in terms of, under

 3   Brecht, does Mr. Fry prevail; and we look at the nature

 4   of the constitutional violation that occurred.

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 That wouldn't help

 6   us resolve the conflict in the circuits between which

 7   standard is applicable, though, right?

 8                 MR. HALTOM:        No, it certainly would not,

 9   Your Honor.     And this Court may very well deem that to

10   be necessary.    But I think also that this Court

11   fashioning a decision which is faithful to the

12   requirement that -- or the principle that Kotteakos is

13   an exacting standard, would also be an important

14   constitutional principle.            In a case like this, where

15   there has been no Chapman review and where the Chapman

16   court stated that we need a rigorous harmless error

17   standard in order to safeguard convictions, safeguard

18   against erroneous convictions where there is a close

19   question of guilt or innocence, that hasn't happened in

20   this case and it would be appropriate for this Court to

21   fashion a rule or holding in this case that would ensure

22   that that happens.

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And that would put 2254

24   out of sync with 2255, where I understand if it's a

25   Federal conviction then it's always Brecht on

 1   post-conviction relief?

 2                 MR. HALTOM:       As I understand that question,

 3   the Solicitor General pointed out in the introduction of

 4   its amicus brief that there are some 2255 cases where

 5   there's been an intervening change in the law which

 6   could involve this question of Brecht versus Chapman.

 7   And I've cited in my brief a district court case, United

 8   States versus Monsanto, where the court concluded, in

 9   accordance with the position that I'm advocating, that

10   it makes no sense for a reviewing court in a habeas

11   proceeding to apply the Brecht standard blindly without

12   regard to what was done in prior proceedings, but rather

13   there's no need for deference, where the -- the big

14   issue in Brecht, as I understand it, was this Court was

15   concerned about simply repeating a harmless error

16   analysis that the State court had already done; and

17   we're not asking this Court to do that in this case.

18                 The same concern, Justice Ginsburg, holds

19   over in certain limited 2255 cases.

20                 If I may save the balance of my time.

 3                 Federal habeas is limited in scope and

 4   purpose.     It is not a continuation of the appellate

 5   process.     Rather, it is an extraordinary remedy limited

 6   by fundamental concepts of federalism, comity, and State

 7   sovereignty.     In Brecht, this court held that the

 8   stringent Chapman standard was inappropriate for use on

 9   collateral review.      Instead, in order to strike a proper

10   balance between State and Federal interests, the actual

11   prejudice standard of substantial and injurious effect

12   on the verdict should be used in collateral cases.

13                 Petitioner is asking for an exception to

14   this rule.     He claims that if he did not receive Chapman

15   review in State court, he should receive it on Federal

16   habeas.     That was not the rule in Brecht and it should

17   not be adopted by this Court here.                   The Brecht decision

18   did not state an exception based on the State standard

19   used.     The key in Brecht was that appropriate balance

20   between the Federal Government and the State.                   This

21   Court has never treated cases where there was not a

22   state Chapman finding differently from other cases.                    It

23   applies Brecht throughout.            In the Penry case and in the

24   O'Neal case there was no Chapman finding in state court,

25   yet this Court applied Brecht and made no comment about

 1   that.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            You said in your brief

 3   that the remedy, if the Petitioner wants to assure he's

 4   going to get Chapman review someplace, then he should

 5   have sought cert -- direct review from the State court's

 6   conviction.    Did you say that?

 7                 MR. MOODY:      Yes, Your Honor.

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But realistically, the

 9   likelihood that such a petition would be successful,

10   passing the problem that the Petitioner is not likely to

11   have a lawyer, does the likelihood that this Court would

12   grant cert on such a question is very slim.

13                 MR. MOODY:      I agree, the likelihood of the

14   cert grant in that circumstance is slim but it does not

15   change the fact that once you come to court under 2254,

16   you are asking for collateral review.                    And in collateral

17   review, it's inappropriate to apply the Chapman

18   standard.

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I suppose you could say

20   that of all the questions that go into habeas under

21   2254, that they could have brought up directly but the

22   chances are their being taken here are negligible?

23                 MR. MOODY:      I, I agree with that, Your

24   Honor.

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, if the

 1   State court had conducted a Chapman review, erroneously,

 2   how would that be reviewed under Federal habeas?                     You

 3   would ask under AEDPA whether it was an unreasonable

 4   application of Chapman?

 5               MR. MOODY:       Yes, Your Honor.                First you

 6   would ask if it was an unreasonable application of

 7   Chapman.   If you found that it was not, then the case is

 8   over, there's no need to grant the writ.                     If you found

 9   that it was, you would proceed and do a Brecht analysis.

10   And that's what we learned from --

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 That seems awfully

12   refined, doesn't it, to do two different analyses?                        Is

13   this an -- is this an unreasonable application of

14   Chapman?   And then apply the Brecht standard after

15   determining that it was an unreasonable application of

16   Chapman?

17               MR. MOODY:       I don't disagree.                I'm merely

18   trying to make sense of the various decisions in this,

19   in this arena.   There's some tension between the Esparza

20   decision and other decisions of the Court; and one has

21   to find a place for AEDPA standard.                     So we would not

22   object to simply an application of Brecht which is what

23   this Court has always done.            But as far as it seems to

24   suggest there may be an interim step.

25               JUSTICE BREYER:            Suppose we apply Brecht.

 1   This is what I'm having to little trouble with but I'd

 2   appreciate your commenting or straightening this out.

 3   The Ninth Circuit holds two things according to the SG

 4   in the briefs.     He states them very well.              The first is

 5   let's look at this witness.              The testimony was excluded.

 6   Now the Ninth Circuit says that exclusion was

 7   unreasonable of -- an unreasonable application of

 8   clearly established Federal law, because that testimony

 9   of the witness that was excluded was not only material,

10   it would have substantially bolstered the claim of

11   innocence.    So that's their finding on the merits.

12                 Then they go on to say, but the exclusion

13   was harmless.

14                 How could both those things be true?              How

15   could it be true that the reason that there was error in

16   excluding it was that the evidence is so important that

17   it substantially bolsters the claim of innocence?

18   That's one thing they say.

19                 But the exclusion was harmless.              I just fail

20   to understand how anyone could think both those things.

21   But maybe in the context of the case it was possible,

22   but that's what I'd appreciate your explaining.

23                 MR. MOODY:       I think that the explanation is

24   as follows.     When you're analyzing the denial of a

25   defense type of evidence, a Chambers claim, you first


                                         28

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   look to see how it fit into the defense.                And that is

 2   what they were doing.      You're not looking at the entire

 3   case.   You're looking only at the defense.

 4               And so in the sense that something is better

 5   than nothing, adding a twelfth witness instead of eleven

 6   may improve the defense case.

 7               And yet nonetheless, when you move to the

 8   next question, which is, was there a substantial and

 9   injurious effect on the verdict in the case, and now

10   you're not just looking at the defense, you're looking

11   at everything that was available to the jury -- it may

12   be that there was still so much other evidence that it

13   could overcome whatever increase you received on the

14   defense.

15               JUSTICE ALITO:          Why is it necessary for us

16   to try to reconcile those two statements?               The Ninth

17   Circuit may well have been wrong in finding that there

18   was a violation at all, but we have to assume that, for

19   purposes of the question that's presented to us.               So why

20   shouldn't we just analyze the harmless error question

21   independently of what they said about whether there was

22   a Chambers violation?

23               MR. MOODY:       We would not object to that.

24   I'm trying to -- I'm trying to assist Justice Breyer in

25   that perceived imbalance between a finding of a


                                       29
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   substance above and then a finding of harmless error

 2   before.

 3              JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, every time evidence is

 4   excluded on the grounds that it is cumulative, or is the

 5   equivalent of a 403 balancing in Federal Court, there's

 6   not a constitutional error under Chambers and related

 7   cases, is there?

 8              MR. MOODY:        Yes.       We agree.       That's

 9   certainly the law of this Court.               And in this, in --

10   well, let me move on.      I'd like to make a couple of

11   other points.

12              JUSTICE SOUTER:             May I go just back to

13   Justice Breyer's question for a second?

14              MR. MOODY:        Sure.

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:             And I mean, I think your

16   answer to Justice Breyer was a very good answer as a, as

17   sort of a general statement.            But in -- would you agree

18   that in this case, if we -- if we do proceed, number

19   one, to agree with you that Brecht is the standard, and

20   we then do proceed to apply Brecht here or to determine

21   whether Brecht was properly applied here, that in this

22   particular case, the, the record indicates that the case

23   was so close that there would have to be a finding of

24   harmful error, or at least it would be impossible to

25   find harmless error.      Even applying Brecht clear.

 1                And you know what I'm getting at.                   I mean,

 2   five weeks of deliberation.             The question after,

 3   whatever it was, two weeks, and four ballots, and so on.

 4   Obviously this -- this case was just to tottering on the

 5   edge.   So even if we, if we do get to the point of

 6   applying Brecht, wouldn't it be impossible to say that

 7   he's -- he gets no relief under Brecht?

 8                MR. MOODY:       No, I would disagree with that.

 9   You've the sixth court to hear this case.                    The prior

10   five have all rejected his claim.                 And while --

11                JUSTICE STEVENS:            But two or three of those

12   did it on an improper ground, that you agree with now,

13   don't you?

14                MR. MOODY:       No, I don't agree with that.

15                JUSTICE STEVENS:            For purposes of argument.

16                MR. MOODY:       For purposes of argument I do.

17   The district court and the Ninth Circuit both applied

18   Brecht and found that this was not an error which --

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             It was two to one in the

20   Ninth Circuit.

21                MR. MOODY:       This is true.

22                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Judge Rawlinson I think

23   said that using the Brecht standard, that there was

24   actual prejudice.

25                MR. MOODY:       Yes, she did.              There was a

 1   dissent in the Ninth Circuit.

 2                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Isn't this the -- I may

 3   have it wrong -- but isn't this the case in which the

 4   witness was unique not cumulative because she was the

 5   only one who was completely disinterested.

 6                 MR. MOODY:      No.       I would disagree with that.

 7   She's been characterized that way.                  But, and I want to

 8   point out that, I would like to clarify the record in

 9   response to your question, Justice Stevens.                      You asked

10   whether or not she saw another man commit the murder.

11   And counsel appeared to agree with you.                      That was not

12   her testimony.    Her testimony was that she overheard

13   someone else confessing to murders that may or may not

14   have been these murders.

15                 And the -- and this was a very long case.

16   This case lasted eleven weeks, it involved a hundred

17   witnesses.    You can look at the opinions it produced in

18   state court and in the district court.                     They're each 100

19   pages long.    It's not unreasonable to expect the jury to

20   take a long time to decide that case.

21                 Now there are 25 court days of

22   deliberations --

23                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Five, five weeks?

24                 MR. MOODY:      Five weeks, 25 court days, 24 of

25   which were taken up with read back.                      Several -- several

 1   holidays.    I mean if you want to go through and look at

 2   it, now --

 3                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Do you know of any other

 4   case in which the jury deliberated for five weeks?

 5                MR. MOODY:       I haven't attempted to find one.

 6   It is a long deliberation.

 7                JUSTICE SOUTER:            I'm sure there's an example

 8   somewhere, but I -- I practiced law for over 40 years,

 9   and I never heard of it.

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             At what point, how many

11   weeks had gone by when they said they were hung?

12                MR. MOODY:       I believe that was -- I keep,

13   I've been switching back and forth between calendar days

14   and court days.   So forgive me.              I believe that was on

15   the eighth court day.       And at that point, when they

16   announced they were hung, they selected a new foreperson

17   and then rolled up their sleeves and went back in and

18   deliberated the case.

19                JUSTICE BREYER:            So --

20                MR. MOODY:       And after --

21                JUSTICE BREYER:            Go ahead.

22                MR. MOODY:       After they selected the new

23   foreperson, they asked for 15 read backs, including the

24   crucial evidence in the case.              The ballistics experts.

25   They asked for that.       They asked for the testimony of

 1   the in-custody witness who heard the confession of

 2   Mr. Fry.     They asked for Mr. Fry's testimony.

 3                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Did they ask for a read

 4   back of Mrs. Maples' testimony?

 5                 MR. MOODY:       Well, Mrs. Maples' testimony was

 6   not admitted.     It was excluded.

 7                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Oh, that's right.   Of

 8   course.

 9                 MR. MOODY:       But they did not --

10   significantly they did not ask for read back of the

11   witnesses who testified similarly to, to Ms. Maples.

12   The third party culpability case was basically not

13   credited by the jury.        They did not a read back of those

14   witnesses.

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, maybe, maybe you'd

16   end up --

17                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Well, maybe a critical

18   witness was left out.        That argues the other way, I

19   think.

20                 MR. MOODY:       I would encourage the Court to

21   carefully look at what Ms. Maples was going to say.                If

22   you look in her own words, and I'm quoting:               I was just

23   in and out of the room.          I just listened to bits and

24   pieces of it.    And that's at joint appendix 10.             This,

25   this witness may have been Mr. Hurtz's cousin, and not

 1   his ex-girlfriend, or his ex-girlfriend's mother, but

 2   she did not have very much to say about this.                    She said

 3   she didn't hear the beginning of the statement.                      She

 4   could not tell you whether it was a serious discussion.

 5   She was in and out of the room.               She heard only bits and

 6   pieces.

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:           But what she heard was that

 8   they were going to kill, this other person was going to

 9   kill a man and a woman, and it turned out that that was

10   the crime at issue.

11                 MR. MOODY:      With respect, that's not what

12   she heard.

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:           What did she hear?

14                 MR. MOODY:      What she heard was a statement

15   that he had killed a man and a woman.                    And this was not

16   immediately after the offense.               This is 18 months after

17   the offense, this is not next day.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Do you think -- do you

19   think, do you think I should do this?                    I'm still

20   looking, I'm worried about on the one hand, as you are,

21   having this Court announce too many six-part tests, and

22   having a lot of words and it becomes easy to make a

23   mistake for a judge and then you never finish a

24   proceeding.    I'm worried about that, as are you.

25                 MR. MOODY:      Yes.

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:             At the same time, I think

 2   what counts is what the judge does, the reviewing judge.

 3   Not what -- quite what the test says.

 4                So there has to be a conscientious effort to

 5   decide, was there -- was it harmless?                     Could a

 6   reasonable jurist in California have concluded the

 7   opposite?    Okay.

 8                So maybe we should do it in this case.                 We

 9   simply try ourselves to go through this record, make

10   that determination to show by example, rather than by

11   trying to find a form of words.

12                MR. MOODY:        Well, you don't do it very

13   often.    I understand that that's something you could do

14   if you wanted to.     I think that this is just a classic

15   case where two courts applied the Brecht standard and

16   reached their conclusions and there's nothing really

17   remarkable about it.

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             The third party

19   perpetrator that Maples was going to talk about

20   according to the prosecution's theory, was Hurtz or

21   Hearst?

22                MR. MOODY:        Hurtz.         Yes.

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And there -- there was a

24   link between Hurtz, there was an acquaintanceship

25   between Hurtz and the victim?

 1                 MR. MOODY:       That's right.

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Was that established in

 3   other testimony or would that all have come out just

 4   only through Maples?

 5                 MR. MOODY:       Actually, I'm thinking about my

 6   answer because I was thinking about Borelli.                      There were

 7   three third party culpability, potential targets in this

 8   case.   And I believe that Hurtz, the testimony of

 9   several of the witness who were admitted did testify of

10   a link between Cindy Bell and Hurtz.

11                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Otherwise, I mean, they

12   couldn't have found it was cumulative if -- if that had

13   not been the case.

14                 MR. MOODY:       In order to -- I need to correct

15   the record on that as well.              The trial judge did not

16   find that this was cumulative.                He found a lack of

17   foundation.    What happened was, was Ms. Maples was

18   offered as a witness --

19                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            But -- on appellate review

20   in California, they found it cumulative, didn't they?

21                 MR. MOODY:       The alternative prejudice

22   holding, the footnote 17, they said it would have been

23   cumulative.

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Right.          Okay.

25                 MR. MOODY:       Yes.

 1              JUSTICE SOUTER:              And they -- they couldn't

 2   have found that if there hadn't been some evidence on

 3   Hurtz, apart from Maples?

 4              MR. MOODY:         Oh, that's right.              Yes.   There

 5   was, and that's really my point.                My point is that 11

 6   third party culpability witnesses were allowed to

 7   testify in this trial.        And one was excluded.

 8              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              How did Hurtz's name enter

 9   into the trial?

10              MR. MOODY:         Well --

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Why did anybody mention

12   him?

13              MR. MOODY:         Well, for one thing, he was

14   called to testify    and asked if he killed these people.

15   Mr. Hurtz testified at this trial.                  The jury got to see

16   him, they got to look him in the eye, they got to hear

17   him on direct, they got to hear him on cross.                    And they

18   did not ask for a read back of that testimony.

19              JUSTICE SOUTER:              And if Maples' testimony

20   had come in, I presume they could have cross-examined

21   him on the basis of Maples' testimony?

22              MR. MOODY:         Well, he stated he never said he

23   killed these people.       And he, he stated he'd never said

24   he killed a man and a woman in a car.                    So it -- it went

25   to what Maples would have said, and also --

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Did he say he'd killed

 2   peoples otherwise, or at other times?

 3                 (Laughter.)

 4                 MR. MOODY:       He also denied doing that.

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, but then at that

 6   point in time, Maples, Maples' conviction -- Maples'

 7   testimony becomes, assuming there's a foundation,

 8   becomes more relevant.

 9                 MR. MOODY:       I would disagree, simply because

10   she says she didn't hear the conversation well enough to

11   really give her testimony any true probative value in

12   the case because she was in and out of the room.              She

13   didn't hear the beginning.            She didn't hear the end.

14   And when she's asked, was it a serious discussion, she

15   says, I don't know.       So this could be -- this could be

16   something very different --

17                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            That's classic going to

18   the weight of the evidence.              That goes to the weight,

19   not the admissibility.

20                 MR. MOODY:       Ordinarily I would agree with

21   that.     And if we knew, Your Honor, that he was speaking

22   about these killings, then certainly it would go to the

23   weight.    But since he was speaking about killings that

24   she said she didn't know if they were in California, New

25   Jersey, she didn't know when they occurred, and

 1   therefore -- in California we ask that before you

 2   present third party culpability evidence you tie it to

 3   this crime.

 4                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           So we don't assume that

 5   he's committed a whole lot of killings, I don't suppose?

 6                 MR. MOODY:      Well, it's -- he may have

 7   committed other killings, but if did not confess to

 8   committing these killings then there's no probative

 9   value to her testimony.

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Do you think the

11   question of the application of Brecht is included within

12   the questions presented?

13                 MR. MOODY:      No.       I briefed it because I was

14   concerned that the Court might reach it, but I don't

15   think it is fairly presented.

16                 The only other point that I wanted to make

17   is that if one accepts Petitioner's rule it will

18   basically swallow up the Brecht standard and return to a

19   near wholesale application of Chapman on collateral

20   review.   As Tyson and Trigg pointed out, many, many

21   times Petitioners come to court and they have a case

22   where there was no finding of constitutional error in

23   State court and therefore no Chapman application, but

24   they're going to assert that in Federal court.                  And so

25   if in every one of those cases you apply Chapman, then


                                        40
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   you really have reduced application of Brecht.

 2              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But on the other side,

 3   State courts say, we don't have, we don't have to bother

 4   in any case with Chapman because when it goes over into

 5   the Federal court they're going to apply Brecht.

 6              MR. MOODY:         I don't think we should assume

 7   that the State courts are going to do that.                    I think

 8   that what -- it's sort of like what we said earlier in

 9   the argument, Your Honor, where not every evidentiary

10   ruling is a constitutional violation.                    I would say most

11   of them are not.    And this Court has not drawn a bright

12   line of exactly where that is.               So in many cases, this

13   is just an erroneous exclusion of evidence at best.                      And

14   so, therefore, the State court would not be going to a

15   Chapman standard because it would not be finding error.

16              And with that, I'm prepared to submit.

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

20          ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS

21                CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

22              MS. MILLETT:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

23   please the Court:

24              The distinction between collateral review

25   and direct review is deeply rooted in the law, and what

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Petitioner is asking is to have the standard of review

 2   for harmlessness in collateral review become the same

 3   standard as direct review whenever the courts on direct

 4   review got Chapman wrong or unreasonably applied it.

 5   That is the exact same argument Mr. Brecht made in this

 6   Court.   He got Chapman review.              They cited Chapman.

 7   They didn't cite it here.           That's the only difference.

 8               Mr. Brecht came to this Court and said they

 9   unreasonably applied Chapman review and I should get it

10   again on habeas, and this Court said that there is a

11   deep difference, a deep distinction, between collateral

12   review and direct review and that distinction turns upon

13   the fundamental rule of habeas corpus, and that is not

14   to sit here as the sixth court on direct review of a

15   long record where difficult calls were made.                     It is to

16   correct fundamental miscarriages of justice, grievous

17   wrongs that have caused custody in violation of

18   constitutional --

19               JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I ask two questions

20   and then you can proceed.           One, do you take a position

21   on who has the burden of persuasion?                     That's the first

22   question.   And do you have an opinion on proper

23   application of Brecht in this case?

24               MS. MILLETT:          If I can adopt

25   Justice Breyer's language from O'Neal and say that this


                                        42
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Court eschewed couching this discussion in terms of

 2   burden of persuasion.      We accept O'Neal's holding what

 3   then there is equipoise, which did not what happened in

 4   this case, the tie goes to --

 5              JUSTICE STEVENS:             But you do agree if it

 6   were in equipoise the State would have the burden?

 7              MS. MILLETT:          The tie would go to the

 8   prisoner, yes.   Were it in equipoise, because the State

 9   would have the burden the State would lose.                    I don't

10   think that's what happened in this case.                    I think what

11   Justice Breyer, what this Court said O'Neal said is, the

12   way you articulated it, instead of burden of proof is

13   that it's a level of conviction on the part of the court

14   and what the judge will say in, what the court said in

15   O'Neal, is, do I think the error substantially

16   contributed to the jury's verdict?                 And that is

17   essentially what the court said here on 181 at the very

18   bottom when it said "The court doesn't find that there's

19   an insufficient showing" -- that's the same way of

20   saying I haven't been persuaded -- that the error

21   contributed to the verdict.            So I don't think that this

22   case in any sense could turn upon, whether we call it

23   the burden of persuasion or the proper level of

24   conviction on the part of the court.                    This court was not

25   persuaded and that is all that matters.                    When the court


                                       43
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   is not persuaded and not left in equipoise, the prisoner

 2   loses.

 3                 The second question you asked was whether we

 4   have a position on application of Brecht, and we do.

 5   We've laid it out in our brief.               We think that in no

 6   sense does this record support the notion, support the

 7   argument, that there was a substantial and injurious

 8   effect when the twelfth out of eleven witnesses was

 9   excluded, talking about third party culpability.                 And

10   that requires not just looking at what, in isolation,

11   what evidence was in there about Mr. Hurtz.                 There was I

12   think six or seven witnesses who said they heard him

13   either say he did it or he was there or he was involved.

14                 But it requires looking at the whole record.

15   And there were -- the defense here was not a Hurtz

16   versus Fry.    This was a case where the defense did an

17   excellent job.    It was a well defended case, and threw

18   up a buffet of options for the jury, none of which it

19   bought on.

20                 In the third trial you had what you didn't

21   had in the prior trials.          You had ballistics evidence

22   that linked his gun to the crime.                 You have his own

23   admission, his own testimony, that he left the house

24   that night with the gun, with the bullets, and went out

25   in the truck that was seen at -- a truck of the same


                                        44

 1   type, that was seen at the crime scene.

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:               I have the same problem

 3   Justice Souter does, in all candor.                       The jury takes five

 4   weeks to decide the case and there's a fairly

 5   interesting bit of testimony that doesn't get in.                       And

 6   to say to be totally satisfied it didn't have an

 7   injurious effect on the deliberations is a close

 8   question, I think.

 9              MS. MILLETT:            Well, two answers.              If it's a

10   close question, if AEDPA and if Kotteakos and Brecht

11   mean anything, it's that the close calls go to the State

12   and are not overturned by the sixth court on review.

13              JUSTICE STEVENS:               No, but an equally divided

14   call goes the other way.

15              MS. MILLETT:            I'm sorry?

16              JUSTICE STEVENS:               If it's not just a close

17   call, but if it's equal, it goes the other way.

18              MS. MILLETT:            It is, and no one has thought

19   this was equal.   The two courts -- the three courts, the

20   California Court of Appeals also said in any event

21   there's no possible prejudice.

22              Now, how they could say no possible

23   prejudice under a State standard and still say, ah, but

24   it would have affected the verdict under Chapman, is not

25   something I'm able to understand.                  So I think you have

 1   --

 2                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Neither am I.         But I draw a

 3   different conclusion from it from the one you're

 4   drawing.

 5                 MS. MILLETT:        I guess I misunderstand your

 6   point, because I think when the court said there's no

 7   possible prejudice --

 8                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           I mean, I cannot accept the

 9   State -- the conclusion that there was no possible

10   prejudice, on the premises that Justice Stevens a moment

11   ago and I a moment before sort of put out.                    I just do

12   not find that a reasonable conclusion.

13                 MS. MILLETT:        Well, again, even if the Court

14   thinks there may have been some chance, may have been --

15   you know -- relevant testimony -- this Court can well

16   disagree and can conclude that this was abuse of

17   discretion.    If it were Federal Rule of Evidence 403,

18   you could decide this was a an abuse of discretion.

19   Whether it was unconstitutional, so clearly

20   unconstitutional as to merit under AEDPA and under

21   Brecht reversal of the conviction 12 years after the

22   fact --

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I thought the AEDPA

24   question was out of it because that hasn't been -- there

25   was no cross-appeal on that question.                    I thought it was


                                        46
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   a given, a given in this case, that the California

 2   courts did not apply or unreasonably applied clearly

 3   established Federal law.

 4               I didn't think that was an issue in the

 5   case.   I think we took it on the assumption that it was

 6   such an error.

 7               MS. MILLETT:         Again, the Respondents in this

 8   case have not conceded constitutional error, and in

 9   their brief they repeat that.             And I think there's a

10   question whether a court should --

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             It's not raised here.

12   There was no cross-appeal from that.

13               MS. MILLETT:         Well, a Respondent is entitled

14   to defend on any ground supported by the record.             But

15   even assuming that, we'll assume the error, assumes that

16   there was an error and one assumes that it was -- which

17   is hard for me to get to, but one assumes it was clearly

18   unconstitutional in this close call, the type of call

19   that's made hundreds of times in every trial, balancing

20   this, and the combination of lack of foundation and

21   cumulativeness.   It's hard for me to understand when

22   that rises to the level of unconstitutionality.

23               But if we assume that it did, you have the

24   two courts that applied the Brecht standard here.             And

25   the district court decision here is nearly 100 pages

 1   long.     It's a very careful, methodical analysis.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That's because there were

 3   many, many issues raised.

 4                 MS. MILLETT:         There's many issues, but also

 5   it was being careful and it was being very methodical.

 6   And it went through this and it went through this

 7   record.     That court went through true this record, more

 8   than 5,000 transcript pages, 11 week of trial, more than

 9   100 witnesses.     And it was on that --

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I suppose if we're

11   going to apply the Brecht standard ourselves, we would

12   have to do the same thing.

13                 MS. MILLETT:         I think that's what this Court

14   has said.

15                 The other thing I want to get back to is the

16   question about the length of jury deliberations.                       Sure,

17   this was really wrong.         Now, they changed forepersons in

18   midstream and got a reasonable doubt instruction

19   repeated.    Who knows what happened.                     But what I will not

20   concede -- I will concede it's long, but I will not

21   concede that the mere fact of length of deliberations

22   says anything about if this one particular error in

23   applying a balancing test substantially affected the

24   verdict.    I think the length of deliberations is so

25   incredibly speculative.

 1               JUSTICE STEVENS:              You will concede it was a

 2   close case, won't you?

 3               MS. MILLETT:           I will concede it was, I will

 4   concede it was a difficult case.

 5               JUSTICE STEVENS:              If you take five weeks

 6   it's pretty clearly a close case.

 7               MS. MILLETT:           That's right.              But you know,

 8   the whole the point of federal habeas corpus is that

 9   this is not filling in the gaps in direct review.                          We're

10   not going to give you --

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   There's no evidence

12   or inference that it was close on the alternative

13   murderer theory, which is the only thing that Maples'

14   testimony goes to.

15               MS. MILLETT:           That's exactly right.              In

16   fact, if you look at the closing arguments, Mr. Hurtz

17   has a couple of references in a two-day closing

18   argument.   That was not the centerpiece of his case.

19               JUSTICE STEVENS:              It has to be close on an

20   alternative murderer.        It wasn't suicide.                 Obviously, if

21   he didn't do it, somebody else did.                       So if it's a close

22   case from the first, it's obviously a close case for the

23   second.

24               MS. MILLETT:           No, but as to who did it and

25   whether Hurtz did it or whether -- remember, what the


                                         49

 1   defense is trying to show is not who did it; it's that

 2   this person didn't do it, and whether it was them or

 3   someone else is what we don't know.

 4               Again, this is Federal habeas corpus before

 5   this Court, and I don't think that the misapplication of

 6   a valid rule of evidence, which is not what this Court

 7   has in Chambers, Holmes, or any of the cases that were

 8   involved, was so -- that simply disallowed the twelfth

 9   out of eleven witnesses on third party culpability is so

10   clearly erroneous, it was so clearly impacting the

11   verdict in this case, as to warrant a retrial 15 years

12   after the crime.

13               And yes, the jury -- it was close in the

14   sense that they worked a long hard time.                But at the end

15   of the day, they were unanimous.               There's nothing close

16   about unanimous.   And I think it would be the wrong

17   message to say that a jury that works as hard as this

18   one did, did the readbacks, culled through this

19   record --

20               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Yes, but we don't know

21   what they would have done if they had this evidence that

22   was excluded.   That's the problem.

23               MS. MILLETT:         One never knows that in habeas

24   corpus.   But what you do when you look at what they were

25   focusing on, they were focusing on the two ballistics

 1   experts.     They had them read back right next each other.

 2   They made that call.        It's their job to do it.

 3                  JUSTICE SOUTER:            But the reason they may

 4   have been doing that is that they may very well have

 5   thought that the evidence indicating third party guilt

 6   was close and perhaps persuasive and what they wanted to

 7   know was whether the evidence going specifically to this

 8   defendant was strong enough to overcome it.

 9                 MS. MILLETT:         May I answer?              One would have

10   expected at least one readback on third party

11   culpability instead of three readbacks of Mr. Fry's

12   testimony which put himself that night with the gun in

13   the truck, and which he said -- you know -- and

14   beforehand he agreed he might have said he wanted to

15   blow them away.

16                 Thank you.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

 1   case, I have one question.           Two cases.           A, Hurtz did not

 2   testify at all.    B, he did.           Is the foundation ruling

 3   any different in the two cases insofar as Maples'

 4   testimony or is it the same?             I.e., is there a lesser

 5   showing for foundation if Hurtz did testify?

 6               MR. HALTOM:         I think that possibly the

 7   foundation with Hurtz there could be increased.                    The

 8   jury sought Mr. Hurtz.

 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Oh, you mean, oh, you mean

10   more?   You have to be more strict for foundation after

11   Hurtz testified?   I was suggesting the opposite.

12               MR. HALTOM:         Well, I was just thinking that

13   his presence there would be relevant.                    The jury actually

14   saw him.   They heard a truck driver describing, a

15   neutral truck driver, describing the actual killer, who

16   in no way fit the description of Mr. Fry.

17   Unfortunately, the record doesn't indicate what Mr.

18   Hurtz looked like, but the jury saw it.                    And if the jury

19   saw that that truck driver was describing a man that

20   looked like Mr. Hurtz, then that --

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But there were all kinds

22   of infirmities in that truck driver's testimony,

23   including the time, the timing of the murder.

24               MR. HALTOM:         There were infirmities in his

25   testimony, Your Honor.        However, he came from Missouri,


                                        52

 1   so maybe he was looking at a Missouri clock.                   We don't

 2   know.     But why would that man make up a story?                He has

 3   no axe to grind in this case.               And then his testimony is

 4   corroborated by a gentleman who sees him immediately

 5   after it and says:      He looked like he had just seen a

 6   ghost, and described seeing a double execution-style

 7   murder.     Now --

 8                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            That was all presented to

 9   the jury, right?

10                 MR. HALTOM:        That was all presented to the

11   jury.     However, Ms. Maples' testimony was not, and

12   counsel did not argue that heavily focused on Mr. Hurtz'

13   guilt.     She certainly did argue it, but the reason that

14   she didn't is because, as the Court of Appeals, the

15   California Court of Appeals, said, the other seven

16   witnesses who said Mr. Hurtz said he had killed the

17   Bells were all described as having been flimsy witness

18   who gave contradictory unbelievable testimony.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, how strong is

20   this witness, who didn't even know if it was a serious

21   conversation, didn't hear the beginning of it, and

22   didn't -- couldn't tell whether he was talking about

23   something that happened 10 years before or 2 days

24   before?

25                 MR. HALTOM:        Mr. Chief Justice, she was

 1   extremely strong.    Page JA-78 in the joint appendix,

 2   Respondent concedes she was the only unbiased witness

 3   concerning Mr. Hurtz's -- concerning Mr. Hurtz.                  She

 4   heard this, her cousin, saying he shot a man and a woman

 5   in a parked car, first shooting the woman in the head,

 6   then shooting the man, getting blood all over himself.

 7   That linked up with all the other confessions in this

 8   case.   Interlinking confessions just like in Chambers

 9   were deemed to provide adequate assurance of

10   reliability.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, counsel.

12   The case is submitted.
