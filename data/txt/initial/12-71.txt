 7                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. HORNE

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9                  MR. HORNE:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10   and may it please the Court:

11                  The NVRA should not be construed to preempt

12   Arizona's Proposition 200 for three reasons.                       First,

13   prohibiting a State from effectively enforcing the

14   citizenship requirement is so far-reaching that if

15   Congress had intended that, it would have put the

16   prohibition in the statute expressly, which it did not

17   do.   Congressional silence should not disable States

18   from taking sensible precautions to exclude noncitizens

19   from voting.

20                  Second, when Congress wanted to expressly

21   prohibit something, it knew how to do it.                       It expressly

22   prohibited notarization and other forms of

23   authentication.     This Court has frequently held that

24   statutory language that indicates -- that prohibits one

25   thing indicates there's no other implicit prohibition:

                                         3

 1   The expressio unius rule.

 2               Third, Proposition 200 is consistent with

 3   the purposes and objectives of the NVRA because the

 4   purpose of the NVRA -

 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               If I see the purpose of

 6   the NVRA to simplify registration -

 7               MR. HORNE:        Yes, Your Honor.

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               -- how is Arizona's

 9   provisions consistent with that objective and purpose?

10               MR. HORNE:        Your Honor -

11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Given that some of the

12   amici explain that many people don't have the documents

13   that Arizona requires?

14               MR. HORNE:        Yes, Your Honor.         First of all,

15   the -- simplifying the procedure is one of two important

16   purposes of the NVRA.       The other is the integrity of the

17   system -

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, but why does one

19   take precedence over another?

20               MR. HORNE:        I would say, Your Honor, that

21   neither takes precedence over the other.               They're both

22   equally important.     And so -

23               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So, if something you do

24   conflicts with one of those purposes, why isn't it

25   preempted by the Federal law?

                                      4

 1                  MR. HORNE:       Your Honor, I think the question

 2   is, if you take the two purposes together, does -- does

 3   the Proposition 200 strongly fulfill one and have a

 4   minimal burden on the other?                And, Your Honor, I would

 5   rely on the findings of the -- of the district court in

 6   this case.     In fact, this Court instructed the Ninth

 7   Circuit to defer to the factual findings of the district

 8   court in the Purcell case, which was this case in an

 9   earlier stage.

10                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Why would you think that

11   Congress, in doing the short form registration, didn't

12   consider the issue of fraud, and decide that it had

13   arrived at the balance it wanted?

14                  MR. HORNE:       Because, Your Honor, the -- the

15   Congress did not specify what the States could or could

16   not do.

17                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But it did -- but

18   Congress did specify how citizenship was to be handled.

19   And it was to be an attestation, a signed attestation

20   subject to -- to the penalty of perjury.                  So it's not as

21   though the Federal form didn't relate to citizenship.

22   It did.   And it said this is the way we deal with

23   citizenship.     Then Arizona adds something else.

24                  So I would like, General Horne, for you to

25   respond to a question that's already been raised in -

                                         5

 1   by the -- the panel that decided this case originally,

 2   which was, the statute said -- says each State must

 3   accept and use the Federal form, period.                   That's the end

 4   of it.

 5               And then it says, in addition to that, the

 6   State can do other things.            The judge who asked that

 7   question thought it was perfectly clear, you use the

 8   Federal form, and if you want to do something in

 9   addition -- but you must use and accept the Federal Form

10   and not add something to it.

11               MR. HORNE:       Yes, Your Honor.              I think it's

12   very clear that this statute does not say the signature

13   is the only thing that the States can use to verify the

14   eligibility of the applicant.              Now, in -- in using the

15   term "accept and use," Your Honor, accept and use in

16   ordinary language -- we've given lots of examples in our

17   briefs -- one can accept and use a form for a particular

18   purpose without that form being sufficient to accomplish

19   that purpose.

20               I came here from Arizona on an airplane.                      If

21   the airline said we accept and use an e-mail ticket, you

22   don't need to bring a paper ticket.                   And then I got

23   there and they said, we want to see identification to

24   prove that you are who you say you are, that would not

25   contradict the statement that they are accepting and

                                      6

 1   using the e-ticket.       They are accepting and using the

 2   e-ticket for a specific purpose -

 3               JUSTICE KAGAN:               But, General Horne, wouldn't

 4   it contradict it if instead of saying well, we'd like

 5   you to offer identification, saying, well, we'd like you

 6   also to have a paper ticket.

 7               MR. HORNE:          Yes, Your Honor.           If they -

 8               JUSTICE KAGAN:               That would be inconsistent

 9   with the accept and use language, isn't that right?

10               MR. HORNE:          That's correct, Your Honor.

11   Yes, Your Honor.    And if I take that analogy to our -

12   to our facts, if we had changed the Federal form, I

13   think we would have been in violation.                   But we did not

14   change the Federal form.            We used the Federal form

15   exactly as it's printed by the Federal government.                     And

16   we -

17               JUSTICE KAGAN:               Well, you have done

18   something to the Federal form, and that essentially

19   creates a new set of requirements and a new form.

20               MR. HORNE:          Your Honor, we -- we accept and

21   use the Federal form.         We ask, in addition to that, for

22   evidence that the person is a citizen, that they're

23   eligible to vote.     The form is not exclusive.                The form

24   does not bind us to use only the form and nothing else.

25               JUSTICE KAGAN:               Do you -- do you think that

                                         7

 1   you could have said -- you know, we have our own State

 2   form, which we're allowed to have under the statute.

 3   Anybody who requires the Federal form has to append the

 4   State form as well.

 5                  Could you have done that?

 6                  MR. HORNE:       I think not, Your Honor, because

 7   I think that would have been contrary to the purposes

 8   and objectives of the Act.               I think what we did is

 9   consistent with the purposes and objectives of the Act.

10   But if you -

11                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, how do we draw the

12   line?     Where does the line get drawn between adding just

13   your own form, and adding a new set of requirements,

14   which -- you know, you could just as easily have called

15   a form?

16                  MR. HORNE:       Because the statute contemplates

17   that it -- that it is the burden of the States to

18   determine the eligibility of the voters.                 The -- the EAC

19   was given the duty to develop the form, and we don't

20   argue with the fact that the form belongs to the EAC.

21                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            So that form should have

22   included the eligibility requirements that your State

23   demands.     And it seems to me your complaint is that the

24   Federal form does not require proof of citizenship,

25   unless you consider just the statement that I'm a

                                         8

 1   citizen to be proof of citizenship.

 2               But why didn't you challenge the form?                      I

 3   mean, that's -- that's my problem with this.                   I frankly

 4   think that Federal form doesn't make much sense unless

 5   it's -- unless it's to be exclusive for Federal voting.

 6   And -- and why didn't you challenge the -- the refusal

 7   of the Commission to include on the form, as additional

 8   State requirements, the proof of citizenship?

 9               MR. HORNE:        Your Honor, under Section

10   6(a)(1) of the statute, the burden of determining

11   whether the citizen is eligible rests with the State.

12   That -

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Sure.          Sure.

14               MR. HORNE:        The form belongs to the EAC.

15   The determination of whether the applicant is eligible

16   belongs to us.   So whether or not they put what -- what

17   we're asking for on the form doesn't matter.                   We are

18   fulfilling our duty under Section 6(a)(1) by determining

19   the eligibility of the applicant by asking for

20   additional evidence of citizenship.

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, you're -- you're

22   simply denying then that the Federal government can, so

23   long as it protects the requirements that your State

24   imposes, you're -- you're saying the Federal government

25   cannot prescribe a single form for -- for voter

 1   registration.

 2                MR. HORNE:       Your Honor, the Federal

 3   government can prescribe the form, but the form is not

 4   exclusive.   The responsibility to determine the

 5   eligibility -

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why -- why can't it make it

 7   exclusive?   Let's assume -- I think -- I think that -

 8   that accept and -- and employ, whatever the language

 9   is -

10                MR. HORNE:       Accept and use.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- suppose -- suppose I

12   think that that does mean that it's supposed to be

13   exclusive.   What harm is there so long as the Federal

14   Commission requires, as part of the Federal form, all of

15   the necessary proofs of -- of qualification that the

16   State imposes?

17                MR. HORNE:       Well, Your Honor, the -- the

18   form is -- cannot be exclusive.                 I mean, even the ITCA

19   Respondent and the United States Respondent admit that

20   we can look to external evidence to determine whether

21   the voter is eligible.        The argument is, they say we can

22   look at external evidence, but we can't ask the

23   applicant himself, who has the most information, to pull

24   out his driver's license and write down a number.

25   There's no -

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              General Horne, there -

 2   there are a whole list of State-specific requirements

 3   that get appended to the form.                 And I think Justice

 4   Scalia was raising the question, did you ask to have

 5   Arizona's requirement -- just as the other

 6   State-specific requirements -- did you ask the Federal

 7   Commission to include, as a State-specific requirement,

 8   this proof of citizenship?

 9                 MR. HORNE:       We did, Your Honor, and the

10   Commission itself took no action.                       The executive

11   director rejected our request.                 The executive director

12   has no power to make determinations.                       Congress

13   explicitly stated that the EAC can act only by a vote of

14   three out of four of its members.

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            And you did nothing more

16   about that?

17                 MR. HORNE:       Yes, sir.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            You -- you didn't go to

19   court to say you have to include this as one of the

20   State-specific requirements.

21                 Why didn't you do that?

22                 MR. HORNE:       Your Honor, that -- that was

23   under a predecessor of mine, so I don't know the reason.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Oh.       Okay.

25                 Why didn't he do it?

 2                 MR. HORNE:       I'm -- I'm not sure I would be

 3   competent to answer for him, Your Honor.                 But I think -

 4   but I don't think it makes any difference because the

 5   form is -- is one thing that we accept and use to

 6   determine the eligibility of the voter, but it's not the

 7   only thing.

 8                 My friends on the other side -

 9                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I have a -- I have a

10   hugely great difficulty, which is, the NVRA says that

11   people can mail in this form.

12                 MR. HORNE:       Yes.

13                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I don't know how your

14   rejection of the mail-in, how you're accepting and using

15   it when you're refusing to register someone when they do

16   exactly what the Federal law permits them to do:                 Mail

17   it in.   There -- there's -- I don't -- I have a real big

18   disconnect with how you can be saying you're accepting

19   and using, when you're not registering people, when they

20   use it the way the Federal law permits them to.

21                 MR. HORNE:       Yes, Your Honor.          That is the

22   position that the executive director took, that if the

23   form is fully filled out and on its face it shows the

24   person is qualified we must accept the application.                    We

25   then pointed out in our brief that that would mean that

                                       12

 1   even if we had documentary proof that the person was not

 2   a citizen, we'd still have to accept the application.

 3                In response to that, the Respondent ITCA and

 4   the Federal government said, no, you can look at

 5   external evidence, if it shows that the person is not a

 6   citizen.   So the only question remaining then is there

 7   any basis in the statute for drawing a distinction

 8   between our looking to external evidence that we have

 9   and our asking the applicant to write down a -- a number

10   from his driver's license.

11                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Could you also ask for an

12   address, for proof of the address, or proof of date of

13   birth?

14                MR. HORNE:       If that were consistent with the

15   purposes and objectives of the Act we could, Your Honor.

16   And in determining that, one would have to weigh our

17   interest in the integrity of the system versus what

18   burdens that places on the -

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But then again, it seems

20   to me the Federal form, as some of my colleagues have

21   indicated, is not worth very much.

22                MR. HORNE:       Your Honor, the Federal form

23   sets forth certain minimum requirements that -- that

24   have to be met.   In fact, the -- the Act says

25   specifically in Section 7(b)(2) that they must ask for

                                      13

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the signature under oath of the applicant.                      The Federal

 2   form also provides under 7(a)(1) that additional things

 3   that are necessary to determine the eligibility of the

 4   applicant can also be put on the form.

 5                  The EAC chose not to put anything additional

 6   on the form, which was their right.                      It was permissive.

 7   But they did set -- set up a system of State-specific

 8   requirements.     I think that reflects the fact that the

 9   States have the burden of determining whether or not the

10   eligible -- the applicant is eligible.

11                  That's -- that's our burden.                   We must accept

12   and use the Federal form as a tool in doing that, but it

13   is not the exclusive tool, and my friends on the other

14   side have admitted that it's not the exclusive tool

15   because they've admitted that if we have documentary

16   evidence the person is not a citizen, we can reject the

17   application.

18                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            How could you establish

19   citizenship without having something mailed in, in

20   addition to the form?         What are the other State-specific

21   requirements?     You have to put down your driver's

22   license number or some other numbers?                      I -- I guess you

23   could -- you could make them check off place of birth

24   and if that place of birth is not the United States, you

25   could require them to write down some number of -- of

                                        14

 2   numbers that you could demand?

 3                  MR. HORNE:       Well, some States require the

 4   Social Security number -

 5                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay.

 6                  MR. HORNE:       -- which is not -- which is not

 7   provided for in the statute.

 8                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Right.

 9                  MR. HORNE:       But the -- but it's not

10   prohibited.     And the States were held in -- in the cases

11   that were brought under that, the States were held that

12   they could add it because it's not prohibited.

13                  The State of Louisiana -- inconsistently on

14   the part of the EAC, the State of Louisiana has a

15   requirement that was approved by the EAC and is in the

16   form that says, "If the applicant has neither a

17   Louisiana driver's license, a Louisiana special

18   identification card, or a Social Security number, the

19   applicant shall attach one of the following items to his

20   application:     A copy of a current and valid photo

21   identification, a copy of a current utility bill, bank

22   statement, government check, paycheck or other

23   government document."         So -

25   thing you should have had and that your predecessor

 2   form.

 4   not exclusive.

 5                JUSTICE KAGAN:             But -- but, General, doesn't

 6   the -- the statute make the EAC the decisionmaker with

 7   respect to what can be added to the Federal form?                  The

 8   Federal form -- form, you're exactly right, sets a

 9   floor.   But if you look at Section 7, what Section 7

10   does is to say the EAC gets to decide the minimum

11   necessary, and it consults with the States and the

12   States can come to it and tell it what it needs, and the

13   EAC can take action.       But the EAC is driving the bus,

14   according to Section 7 of this statute.

15                MR. HORNE:        Yes, Your Honor.           The EAC is

16   driving the bus as to the form, but the States are

17   driving the bus as to what is necessary to determine the

18   ultimate -

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, I don't think they're

20   driving the bus as to the form.                  They can't drive it

21   into a ditch.    They're -- they're -- they're subject to

22   arbitrary and capricious limitations, just as any other

23   agency is.   And to allow Louisiana -- to include what -

24   what they've allowed in Louisiana to include and to say

 2   determining, the States being able to determine the

 3   qualifications.

 4                Isn't there a provision which makes it clear

 5   that the Federal form has to make allowance for the

 6   States determining the qualifications?

 7                MR. HORNE:       That's correct, Your Honor.           And

 8   the -- and the -- but the -

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Now -

10                MR. HORNE:       The -- the duty of the States,

11   Your Honor, to determine whether or not a voter is

12   eligible, that is a duty that rests with the State, not

13   with the EAC.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's true.

15                MR. HORNE:       The EAC can only -

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:            But the form has to enable

17   the State to do that.       And it seems to me you were quite

18   able to argue that in -- in refusing to allow you to

19   include in the -- in the Federal form in Arizona some

20   indication of proof of citizenship requiring nothing

21   else except oh, I'm a -- check off, I am a citizen,

22   right?   So it's under oath.            Big deal.      If -- if -- if

23   you're willing to violate the voting laws, I suppose

24   you're willing to violate the perjury laws.

25                MR. HORNE:       That's exactly right, Your

 1   Honor.

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:            So I think you should -

 3   you should have challenged the commission's refusal

 4   to -- to place that evidence in the Federal form.

 5               MR. HORNE:       Your Honor, the Federal form

 6   is -- is a tool that we have to use to determine the

 7   eligibility of the voter, but the ultimate

 8   responsibility under -- under Section 6(a)(1) of -- of

 9   this very Act is with the States to determine the

10   eligibility of the voter.

11               My friends on the other side are admitting

12   that the -- that we're not stuck with the four corners

13   of the form because -- because we've pointed out that

14   would result in a ridiculous conclusion that we could

15   have documentary proof that the person is not eligible.

16   So, if we're not bound by the four corners of the form,

17   as in the ordinary use of the term "accept and use," we

18   accept and use the form for a specific purpose, but it

19   does -- it is not sufficient to satisfy that purpose.

20   All parties agree to that.

21               The only question is, is there a

22   distinction, which we do not find in the statute,

23   between using external evidence that we already have and

24   asking someone to write down the -- the number on his

25   driver's license, which he is the one that has the most

                                     18

 1   information.     It's the logical way to do it.               In fact,

 2   there is no Federal register of American citizens.

 3                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            I'm a little bit confused.

 4                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, I take it -- I take

 5   it that -- that counsel on -- on -- on the other side

 6   will disagree with that and they say, well, this is -

 7   this is the line to be drawn.                 The -- the postcard is

 8   presumptive evidence of registration and -- and of

 9   qualification.     And if you have evidence to the

10   contrary, then it's different.                  But otherwise, the whole

11   utility of the single form is missing -- is gone.

12                  MR. HORNE:       Your Honor, there -- there is

13   nothing in the statute to draw a distinction between our

14   having other extrinsic evidence, which they agree we can

15   use outside of the form and our asking people to say,

16   write down -

17                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Other than the statutory

18   words that authorize the use of the form.

19                  MR. HORNE:       Yes, but -- but they don't make

20   the form exclusive.       Congress could have said the form

21   is exclusive and you can't ask for anything else.                   They

22   didn't do that.     And they had shown when they dealt with

23   authentication that they knew how to prohibit something

24   if they wanted to prohibit it.                  They chose not to

25   prohibit this exclusively and -- and so therefore, it

10               One of the concurring judges below said that

11   he found the statute ambiguous, but that with the -- the

12   legislative history there just could be no conclusion,

13   but that Congress rejected your reading.                  Legislation

14   history is very clear that this issue of what States

15   could add to the form was raised and permission to do so

16   was proposed explicitly and rejected.

17               How do you -- assuming that I believe in

18   legislative history, don't argue to me that I shouldn't,

19   okay?

 1   legislative history here is extremely self-contradictory

 2   and one cannot conclude from any part of that

 3   legislative history what was the intent of the majority

 4   of the Congress.

 5                 The House committee which dealt with the

 6   very act that -- that we have said, "Only the elected

 7   officials designated and authorized under State law are

 8   charged with responsibility to enroll eligible voters on

 9   the list of voters.      The NVRA should not be interpreted

10   in any way to supplant that authority.                  The committee is

11   particularly interested in ensuring that election

12   officials continue to make determinations as to

13   applicants' eligibility, such as citizenship, as they're

14   made under current law and practice."

15                 And the FEC, which is a predecessor to the

16   EAC, relying on that House committee report, said that

17   an application received by a local voter registration

18   official is only an application and be subject to

 4                  (Laughter.)

 5                  MR. HORNE:       Could I just add one quick

 6   point, and that is that the sponsor of the bill was

 7   opposed to that amendment in conference committee,

 8   saying it wasn't necessary, that the States could

 9   already verify applicants under the existing law, as it

10   was written before that amendment.

11                  JUSTICE BREYER:            There's probably a

12   perfectly good answer to this, but I -- I notice that in

13   this Federal law in 7(b), it says what the registration

14   form shall contain.

15                  MR. HORNE:       Yes.

18   thing, and that is, identifying information.                It shall

19   include a statement, including citizenship, saying -

20   that contains an attestation the applicant meets that

 1   at the Arizona law and it says in Arizona, you have to

 2   include like in immigration -- you know, a passport, a

 3   birth certificate, and then you have a couple of other

 4   things that show you're a citizen, correct?

 5                MR. HORNE:         Yes, those are very unusual.

 6   Normally, you just write down the number from your

 6   you are and then my question is how?

 7                  MR. HORNE:       By prosecuting -- there have

 8   been ten prosecutions in one year alone of people who

 9   swore falsely.     Out of the hundreds that were caught

10   swearing falsely, ten, in fact, were prosecuted.

11                  JUSTICE BREYER:            By?

12                  MR. HORNE:       But that -- but that is not a -

13   that is not a sufficient use or that is not a sufficient

14   measure of determining eligibility because literally

15   hundreds have been caught swearing jury -- jury

16   commissioner forms -- swearing they are not citizens

17   after they had already registered to vote.               Other people

18   were caught in their applications to citizenship when

19   they checked and found that they had previously

20   registered to vote and voted.

21                  So -- so we are making use of it, but it is

22   not a -- it is not a functional way to determine

23   eligibility.     And in 7(a)(1), Congress said that -- that

24   both the Federal form and the State form as incorporated

25   under Section 4 may ask for such additional information,

                                        24

 1   only such additional information as is necessary to

 2   determine the eligibility of the voter.                  That shows that

 3   Congress did not intend to prohibit us from getting

 4   additional information as is necessary to determine the

 5   eligibility of the voter.

 6                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            General, could -- could I

 7   take you back to this distinction that you're making.

 8   You said you can't append an additional form, you can't

 9   use an additional form, but you can require additional

10   information.

11                  MR. HORNE:       Yes, Your Honor.

12                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            So how do -- what's the

13   difference between requiring additional information and

14   requiring an additional form?                 Isn't -- when you say you

15   need information A, B, C, D, E, that's just a form,

16   isn't it?

17                  MR. HORNE:       No, Your Honor, it's not a form.

18   It's -- it's an instruction to -- to write down on the

19   Federal form a number.          And there is -- item six on the

20   Federal form has a block where you write down the number

21   and if you don't have either number -- you can write

22   down a -- a driver's license, you can write down a

23   naturalization number, you can write down an Indian

24   tribal identification number.                 If you don't have any of

25   those numbers, then you can send in one of these

                                        25

 1   additional documents.

 2               But that is not an additional form.                      The

 3   reason -- the distinction I draw between the -

 4   incorporating another form or the State form and asking

 5   for additional information is the purposes and

 6   objectives of the Act.          The Act indicates that the State

 7   form is an alternative to the Federal form, but cannot

 8   take its place.     So I'm saying it would not be

 9   consistent with the purpose and objectives of the Act to

10   attach the form, but it is consistent -

11               JUSTICE KAGAN:               Well, what is the -- what

12   would be the purpose of requiring a Federal form if you

13   could just say, and in addition to that, you have to

14   give ten more items of information?                      I mean, then the

15   Federal form just becomes another hoop to jump through.

16               MR. HORNE:          No, Your Honor.              I -- I don't

17   think that's correct.         First of all -- for two reasons.

18   First of all, the Federal form does provide minimums.

19   You must -- you must answer the questions set forth in

20   the Federal form.

21               But secondly, to the extent we add things to

22   the Federal form, those things must be consistent with

23   the purposes and objectives of the Act.                      And I -- and

24   I -- and I justify my assertion that Prop 200 is

25   consistent with the purposes and objectives of the Act

 1   by relying on the findings of the trial court that

 2   relate exactly to that question, finding that it was a

 3   minimal burden, overcome by a major interest that the

 4   State have -- has in protecting the integrity of the

 5   system, where the -- where the trial judge found a lot

 6   of evidence to show that there was voter fraud going on,

 7   although not the fault of the individuals, the fault of

 8   the organizations that often fool people into signing

 9   the form when they don't intend to -- or they don't

10   intend to break the law; but as -- but as against that,

11   that the -- that the burdens are minimal.

12               And the trial court, the district court, had

13   a lot of findings justifying the statement that the

14   burdens are minimal, including the fact, for example,

15   that if all the rejected forms had been accepted, the

16   increase in Hispanic registration would have only have

17   been .1 percent, which is statistically insignificant,

18   including the fact that out of a population of $6

19   million, the plaintiffs, who have all the resources one

20   can imagine, if you look at the list of plaintiffs,

21   could only find one person out of six million people

22   that could not satisfy -- who was entitled to vote, who

23   could not satisfy the requirements of the Act; and a lot

24   of other findings by the trial court.

25               And this Court instructed the Ninth Circuit

 1   to give deference to the factual findings of the trial

 2   court in the Purcell case, and the Ninth Circuit ignored

 3   that.   And what I'm saying is if you look at the factual

 4   findings of the trial court, our position is consistent

 5   with the purpose and objectives of the Act.

 9   rebuttal, Your Honor?

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Yes.

11                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               -- I'm still having a

12   problem.

13                MR. HORNE:       Yes, Your Honor.

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Both the Federal law and

15   the State law require an individual to be a citizen.

16                MR. HORNE:       Yes, Your Honor.

17                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               That's the basic

18   qualification.

19                MR. HORNE:       Yes, Your Honor.

20                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Both agree that that's

21   essential.

24   question of what documents you use to prove that with

25   establishing the qualification?                 Meaning citizenship,

 1   you either have it or you don't.                    That's why the Federal

 2   form says are you or aren't you.

 3                  MR. HORNE:       Yes.

 4                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So there's -- that

 5   qualification has been set by Arizona and the Federal

 6   system.

 7                  MR. HORNE:       The qualification has, but

 8   our -- our objection to the Ninth Circuit decision

 9   preempting Proposition 200 is that it leaves us unable

10   to enforce our qualification requirement, which under

11   the Constitution clearly is a State function.

12                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Counsel, you have proof,

13   there are people that you have rejected, even without

14   these forms?

15                  MR. HORNE:       It's extremely inadequate, Your

16   Honor.    It's essentially an honor system.                  It does not

17   do the job.

18                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, that's what the

19   Federal system decided was enough.

20                  MR. HORNE:       That's what they decided as a

21   minimum in the Federal form, but they did not say that

22   we could not ask for additional information.                    Congress

23   could have said that, just as they said we can't ask for

24   notarization.     They chose not to say that.

25                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, you admit that it

 2   that form.

 3                  MR. HORNE:       We have to accept and use the

 4   form and we can't change the form, but we can ask for

 5   additional evidence to perform our function of

 6   determining that citizens -

 7                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I go back to Justice

 8   Kagan.   If you don't have a driver's license to put a

 9   number down -

10                  MR. HORNE:       Yes.

11                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               -- this list of things

12   says you have to append to the form other items:                        A copy

13   of your birth certificate, a copy of your naturalization

14   certificate.     Why isn't that just creating another form?

15                  MR. HORNE:       Your Honor, incidentally, there

16   have been references to a postcard.                        The EAC itself says

17   put the form in an envelope.                And -- and just as you put

18   the form in an envelope, you can put a copy of your

19   birth certificate in an envelope.                        But I would point out

20   under Crawford v. Marion County, the holding in this

21   case, if there's a minimal burden on the great majority

22   of the people and a somewhat higher burden on a few

23   people, that does not negate the interests of the State

24   and the integrity of the system.

 5                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 6               MS. MILLETT:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 7   please the Court:

 8               Arizona simply disagrees with the balance

 9   that Congress drew.       And when it comes to registration,

10   Justice Kennedy and Justice Kagan, you're both correct,

11   the whole point of the Federal form is that Congress had

12   to draw a different balance.                It confronted a situation

13   in which 40 percent of eligible voters were not

14   registered because State procedures and burdens were

15   standing as an obstacle, a barrier between -- in the

16   direct line of accountability between individual

17   citizens and their Federal government.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:               And enclosing your driver's

19   license number is that immense barrier, right?

20               MS. MILLETT:            First -

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:               That's what's keeping 40

22   percent of eligible voters away?

23               MS. MILLETT:            First of all, with -- with

24   respect to the driver's license, it's only driver's

25   licenses issued after 1996, October 1996, and those that

                                        31

 1   were not -- that someone did not obtain when they became

 2   naturalized.     So you have to be about 33 years of age.

 3   Anyone older than that, their driver's license isn't

 4   going to work.     And, in fact, Mr. Gonzalez in this case

 5   used his driver's license number and got bounced.

 6                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            I still think that's a

 7   relatively few number, and -- and if you don't have the

 8   driver's license, then you can use your naturalization

 9   certificate.

10                  MS. MILLETT:         You can -- Mr. Gonzalez did

11   that as well and the naturalization certificate got

12   bounced because the naturalization certificate, when put

13   into the computer, does not produce records.                   It is a

14   mistake in Arizona's Proposition 200.                    Neither way is -

15                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, you can say that

16   about any certification procedure that, now and then

17   there will be a mistake.            I mean the fact that there is

18   one person where -- where the computer spit out the

19   wrong number or something, that is the basis for

20   rejecting the entire system that Arizona proposes?

21                  MS. MILLETT:         Joint appendix page 263, the

22   district court found that 31,550 people were rejected

23   from voting because of Proposition 200.                   Even on that

24   same page he finds that 11,000 of them subsequently

 1   Congress was trying to eliminate.                      The other 20,000

 2   swore under oath that they were citizens and Mr. Horne,

 3   before the Ninth Circuit, conceded he had no evidence

 4   that they were not citizens -

 5                JUSTICE ALITO:            The statute -

 6                MS. MILLETT:         -- of the United States.

 7                JUSTICE ALITO:            The statute says that

 8   Arizona must accept and use the Federal form.                      What does

 9   that mean?   Let me give you two possible definitions:

10   One, the person must be registered if the Federal form

11   is properly completed and submitted; two, the State may

12   not make any further inquiry of the person who submits

13   the form.

14                Maybe you have other definitions, but what

15   is the -- what do you interpret "accept and use" to

16   mean?

17                MS. MILLETT:         We interpret "accept and use,"

18   it's mainly the latter, your second one, and that is

19   that it is a limitation on what can be asked of the

20   individual and that's not just from the Section 4

21   language where accept and use comes from.                      But what's

22   critical here is Section gg-7 which is on 26H of the

23   petition appendix here.         And that's where they say on

24   this form.

25                The form may require only, may require

                                      33

 2   identifying information essentially as the Commission

 3   determines is necessary to allow the State to make its

 4   decision.

 5                 Now this is not just a ticket into the

 6   State's own registration process so they can go thank

 7   you very much for throwing it in the garbage can, now do

 8   what we would like you to do.                It is a registration

 9   form, and when filled out completely and submitted under

10   oath, it has the same legal -

11                 JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, let me give you this

12   example -

13                 MS. MILLETT:         -- as the registration form.

14                 JUSTICE ALITO:            A person rides up to a place

15   to register on a bicycle and gets out and hands in the

16   Federal form.    This -- this boy looks like he is 13

17   years old and he is carrying school books, he is wearing

18   a middle school t-shirt, but he has filled out the form

19   properly.

20                 Are they required to register him or can

21   they ask him, could you show me some proof of age, like

22   he would have to if he tried to buy alcohol or

23   cigarettes?

24                 MS. MILLETT:         They may not require anything

25   else from the applicant, but they can certainly apply

                                       34

 1   their own evidence that they obtain, whether it's from

 2   their own eyeballs or whether it is through records or

 3   databases that they run these through, which is the more

 4   common one, and make a decision.

 6   would like more from you.                That's not an appropriate

 7   decision.

 8                  JUSTICE BREYER:               His point is, he keeps

 9   making the point, your colleague, and he says, no, that

10   isn't what it says.          What the statute says is it may

11   require only such identifying information as is

12   necessary to assess eligibility.                       In other words, it's

13   telling the people who write the form what they can put

14   on it.   And they can't put other things on it.                          But it

15   nowhere says that the State can't do other things.

16                  Now that's his point.                        And when I asked him,

17   well, how are you -- how are you using -- you have to be

18   able to use, oh, he says, we use it.                           We use the citizen

19   part and these things on the form to prosecute people

20   for perjury.     So we're doing what it says, we're using

21   it and it doesn't say we can't add a few other things.

22                  Okay.     Now, that's his argument.                     Now, your

23   answer, which would be very helpful to me, is?

24                  MS. MILLETT:            My answer is when you look at

25   26H it's talking about the form.                       And first, we know

                                           35

 1   that the commission is the one that decides what is

 2   necessary on this form, a decision that wasn't

 3   challenged -

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is that conclusive or can

 5   that be challenged?

 6                 MS. MILLETT:         It can certainly be challenged

 7   under the Administrative Procedure Act.                 It was not in

 8   this case.

 9                 But it says what is necessary on the form.

10   Now, when you give a -- now when you say what's

11   necessary on a form you're talking about from the

12   applicant.    So this defines what is necessary from the

13   applicant, what can be requested or demanded from the

14   applicant -

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:            On the form.

16                 MS. MILLETT:         -- on the form, exactly.           On

17   the form.    And that is the necessary information to let

18   them apply their own tools and make the decisions that

19   the States make -

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:            But his problem is how do

21   you get to that conclusion?              He says you can't get there

22   from the language because the language doesn't say that.

23   It says what the Commission can put on the form.                 It

24   doesn't say anything about whether some other agency,

25   such as a State or -- you know, sovereign, can add

                                       36

 1   something.

 2                  Now, that's his problem.                  And I would like

 3   to hear very succinctly, the reason he is wrong about

 4   that is?

 5                  MS. MILLETT:         The Commission, let me just -

 6   if we turn to 26H at the very top line -

 7                  JUSTICE BREYER:            26H.

 8                  MS. MILLETT:         26H, where it has a number 1,

 9   let's insert the Commission before I get to the word

10   "may."     And that's all you need to do.                  We know from the

11   prior page the Commission is the one doing this.                     The

12   Commission may require only from the applicant.

13                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.

14                  MS. MILLETT:         That's all the Commission is

15   allowed to require from the applicant.

16                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Correct.

17                  MS. MILLETT:         And then the burden shifts to

18   the State to do it.       If, Justice Breyer, if the question

19   is they may require that, and then the State can require

20   anything else it wants, it is an utterly pointless form.

21   And what we know from six -

22                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Excuse me, they may require

23   it.   It doesn't say they must require it.                    So it leaves

24   it open to the Commission, does it not, to decline to

25   require some materials that is necessary to enable the

                                        37

 1   appropriate State election official to assess

 2   eligibility?     Isn't that -- isn't that what the language

 3   means?

 4                  MS. MILLETT:         I don't think that's a fair

 5   reading of what Congress would have assigned to them.

 6   But even if it were, Justice Scalia -

 7                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            May means may.

 8                  MS. MILLETT:         -- that's something to be

 9   challenged through the Administrative Procedure Act -

10                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            No, no, no, we're talking

11   about -- right now we are talking about the consequences

12   of that language, not -- and the consequence of the may

13   is may.     It does not even require the Commission to

14   include within the form everything that's necessary for

15   the State to determine eligibility.

16                  Now, why would Congress ever create such a

17   system where the Commission need not require what's

18   necessary for eligibility, and nonetheless, the State

19   cannot, cannot require anything further than what the

20   Commission says?

21                  MS. MILLETT:         The relevant phraseology is

22   may require only, and that is not your normal permissive

23   language.     It's actually Congress -- it is language of

24   limitation when used that way.                  "You may require only"

25   does not mean that you may -- that you may do what you

                                        38

 1   want, and they have further down -

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            It says what you only may

 3   require.   It doesn't say what you only shall require.

 4                 MS. MILLETT:         But you may require what is

 5   necessary to enable.       So the language here, I think any

 6   fair reading -- and we don't strain the language in this

 7   context -- the natural reading is that they may require

 8   only the information from the applicant that's necessary

 9   essentially to shift the burden.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Where you're going is this,

11   as I heard you before:         It is true that there is no

12   specific language saying the State can't do this, can't

13   add things.    But it does make a huge point approving

14   citizenship in a particular way on the form.               What would

15   the point of that be if the State could add things?

16                 So we must look back to the purpose, not

17   necessarily exclusively the language, of deciding what

18   that particular provision be, in particularly one as you

19   quote adding to, what could it have been?               And there the

20   legislative history in my view is helpful because it

21   makes clear, for example, in at least one place that

22   Congress did think they shouldn't add a provision that

23   allows the State to do just what it's doing here because

24   that wouldn't be consistent with the purpose of the Act.

25                 So I'm putting words in your mouth, but

                                       39

 1   don't accept them because I put them there.

 2               (Laughter.)

 3               MS. MILLETT:         I would just like to add to

 4   that, Justice Breyer, two points, and that is with

 5   respect to citizenship in particular, not only does the

 6   statute, the NVRA flag it, but the Help America Vote Act

 7   in 2002.

 8               So even if you don't want to go just with

 9   the legislative history, Justice Scalia, in 2002

10   Congress revisited the citizenship requirement for the

11   Federal form and it added a box that you have to check

12   that you are a citizen -- that you are a citizen.                       So

13   Congress revisited this issue after the statute had been

14   in effect for nine years.

15               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Ms. Millett, I want to

16   give up -

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Ms. Millett, is

18   there -- I take it under your theory what the EAC

19   allowed Louisiana to do was wrong.

20               MS. MILLETT:         It's unclear.             It's a little

21   different in that context, in two ways.                    First of all,

22   the Commission made the decision so they have that.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Yes, I know.   I'm

24   assuming that, and I'm saying they were wrong.

25               MS. MILLETT:         Oh, I'm sorry.             And then the

 1   second thing is the information that's required there is

 2   information, for the most part, that is -- that the Help

 3   America Vote Act allows States to require of

 4   individuals.     Now, in the Help America to Vote Act, it's

 5   an either do it at the polls or do it in the

 6   registration.

 7                  Maybe the Commission thought it could

 8   forward it, but at least there you have two profound

 9   differences and that is it's at least information that a

10   separate statute has said States can require from

11   individuals.

12                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And those are -

13                  MS. MILLETT:         But I think it's -

14                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              What are they?

15                  MS. MILLETT:         That is the -

16                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              What are the

17   additional -- the question here is, is proof of

18   citizenship an additional thing the State can ask.                 Now

19   you're telling us that there are some additional things.

20                  MS. MILLETT:         No, it's not proof of

21   citizenship.     What it is, is an identification

22   requirement that can be applied at the polls or the Help

23   America Vote Act says at the time of registration.

24                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Can you -- can you

25   explain -- it's puzzling.             You have all these

 1   State-specific and pages of State-specific requirements.

 2   What State-specific requirements are permitted and what

 3   State-specific requirements are not permitted?                   You're

 4   putting the citizenship on the not permitted side of the

 5   line.    What is permitted and what is not permitted and

 6   what's the difference in the two categories?

 7                 MS. MILLETT:          Okay.         First of all, the State

 8   requirement of citizenship, it's permitted in the sense

 9   that Congress requires in three different ways that

10   citizenship be affirmed.            It's simply disagreeing about

11   proof.    So it's not as though citizenship is left off

12   this form, it's simply a question of how it's proved.

13   But the Help America -- just to get right to your

14   question -- there's two aspects to the Help America Vote

15   Act that change this form a little bit.

16                 When you go through those instructions, what

17   you will see -- here's what those State-specific

18   instructions are:     They are the requirement that you put

19   in an ID number that is required by the Help America

20   Vote Act required.      Required.             So clearly, that is to be

21   on the form because another statute requires it.                   And

22   then you put on -- it says to put on party

23   identification for the States that have it.                   Some States

24   have race identified, and then the instructions tell you

25   about the different filing deadlines -

10   things that are in the State -- when you look at those

11   State-specific instructions, they are not add-ons.                       They

12   are not adding attachments.

13                JUSTICE KAGAN:              Ms. Millett, I mean, suppose

14   it were true that the EAC has been inconsistent in this

15   respect.   That would be a different kind of lawsuit.

16                MS. MILLETT:           That would be a very different

17   lawsuit that was never brought in this case.                       And this

18   just -- the Louisiana thing just happened in -

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      You've got a great

20   deal of reliance on what the EAC has done, and I'm

21   saying if it's not doing a very good job, I'd be -- I'd

22   question whether or not the fact that the EAC is going

23   to implement it is sufficient assurance that the Act

24   reads the way you say it does.

25                MS. MILLETT:           But the Act, I think, by -- by

 1   its own plain language and by its normal -- it can't

 2   have no -- there is only two ways to look at this

 3   statute.    It either created a form that is simply to be

 4   the servant of every State and they can pile on to it

 5   anything else they want, and that is utterly

 6   irreconcilable to Congress's findings and the entire

 7   purpose of this statute, or this is Congress's

 8   registration mechanism that it shows exercising its

 9   power.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Not anything else that they

11   want.    Not anything else that they want.              But what is,

12   in the words of the statute, necessary to enable the

13   appropriate State election official to assess the

14   eligibility of the applicant?                It's clear that the

15   statute intends the States to be able to do that.                   And

16   you say, well, the -- you know, the Commission has -

17   has required its -- its own proof and the State wants a

18   different kind of proof.           The proof the Commission

19   requires is simply the statement, I'm a citizen.                   This

20   is proof?

21                 MS. MILLETT:         This is -- statements -

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            This is not proof at all.

23                 MS. MILLETT:         Statements under oath,

24   statements under oath in a criminal case -

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Under oath is not proof at

 1   all.   It's just a statement.

 2                MS. MILLETT:           Statements under oath in a

 3   criminal case are proof beyond a reasonable doubt by

 4   which we execute them.

 5                JUSTICE ALITO:              What do you make of the fact

 6   that -

 7                MS. MILLETT:           It's a very serious oath -

 8   I'm sorry.

 9                JUSTICE ALITO:              I didn't mean to interrupt

10   your sentence.     What -- what do you make of the fact

11   that States can create their own forms?                      Arizona has its

12   own form, right?     And I don't believe you argue that its

13   form is illegal.     Maybe you think it is and you'll

14   explain that.

15                But what -- how -- and Arizona could put on

16   its own form a demand for the information that it -- it

17   wants to apply to people who submit the Federal form.

18   It seems like a very strange system.                      So, if somebody

19   happens to fill out the Arizona form, their application

20   may be rejected; whereas if they had filled out the

21   Federal form, it would be accepted.                      How can that be?

22                MS. MILLETT:           Well, there is two responses.

23   One, it's an open question whether what -- whether the

24   State form, for purposes of Federal elections, can add

25   new requirements, but we haven't challenged it, we

 4   provision under the statute, the numbers are complicated

 5   and I don't have it on the tip of my tongue, it says

 6   what the State form must do and I didn't see anything in

 7   that that would -- that would preclude their requiring

 8   this additional proof.

 9               MS. MILLETT:            I think -- I think it's

10   actually a very complicated question.                    And so to be

11   clear, there is statutory language, I think, going both

12   ways on this question.          There is in 4(a)(2), which says

13   the State form has to meet the criteria of 7(b), but

14   then -- and then there is in 5(a)(6), which says, if

15   you're going to be handing it out as your public office,

16   it's the public agencies that have to provide the form,

17   it has to be equivalent.

18               But then in Section 2 -- I'm sorry to throw

19   all these numbers, but I'm just trying to show you how

20   it's complicated.     In Section 2, the very background for

21   the Federal form is that it's in -- it's in addition to

22   whatever the States are already doing -

23               JUSTICE ALITO:               Well, I've read all those

24   provisions and -- all right.                Let's assume for the sake

25   of argument that Arizona could do this on its own form.

 1   You haven't argued that their form is illegal.

 2                MS. MILLETT:          Correct.

 3                JUSTICE ALITO:             This seems to me like a

 4   crazy system.    This is like the -- you know, the IRS

 5   creating two different tax returns with different -

 6   with different tax rates and different tax tables and

 7   how much you pay would depend on which particular form

 8   you happened to pick up and submit.

 9                MS. MILLETT:          No, not -- not in this sense.

10   First of all, it would be very respectful of the States

11   and Congress to arrive at a balance here, if it did

12   that.   But Congress has made clear that there is this

13   essentially safe harbor role for the Federal form and

14   that -- and they can't hide it away.                      It has to be

15   available for the -- the driver's license and motor

16   voter process.

17                It has to be handed out at the relevant

18   public agencies, and the mail form is available to be

19   handed out or online for people to find.                      And so yes,

20   could it be different -- it's an open question whether

21   that's what Congress wanted for Federal elections or not

22   or whether -

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     It's not just

24   different forms.    You'd have different voter rolls then,

25   right, depending on which form?

 1               MS. MILLETT:         No.

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    No?

 3               MS. MILLETT:         Oh, I'm sorry.

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I would have thought

 5   since you allow -- contemplate a State form that has

 6   different requirements than the Federal form, you would

 7   then end up with two different voter rolls.

 8               MS. MILLETT:         No -

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Some people that

10   registered under the State form, some people that

11   registered under the Federal form.

12               MS. MILLETT:         As -- as of now, Arizona is

13   doing it as a unitary system.              Because anyone who fills

14   out the State form necessarily satisfies the requirement

15   of the Federal form.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Yes, but it doesn't

17   work the other way.

18               MS. MILLETT:         It doesn't work the other way.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    You can satisfy the

20   Federal form, so you're on the Federal list, but not

21   satisfy the State form, so you're not on the State list.

22               MS. MILLETT:         It doesn't work the other way

23   at least for State elections.              For Federal -- for

24   Federal elections, it has to be the same.                      And so for

25   Federal elections, it's a single roll.                      It's up to

                                     48

 1   States to decide how they want to deal with the State

 2   form.   At the time the Congress enacted this statute,

 3   about half of the States in 1993, including Arizona, had

 4   a postcard form where you just attested to citizenship

 5   under oath.

 6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:              The Court of Appeals said

 7   that there's a different preemption test under -- for

 8   this law under this Constitutional provision than there

 9   is under the Supremacy Clause.                  It seems to me that that

10   ignores the proposition that the State has a very strong

11   and vital interest in the integrity of its elections,

12   even when those, and perhaps especially when those are

13   elections of Federal officials.                   And it seems to me the

14   Ninth Circuit's new test did not give sufficient weight

15   to that interest.

16                 MS. MILLETT:          Well, first of all, the Ninth

17   Circuit's test came out of this Court's language in

18   Siebold.   It had both conflict language and

19   harmonization, both of which appear in this Court's

20   decision in Siebold.        But to get directly to your

21   question of whether there should be a different test, I

22   don't think it matters on the outcome in this case

23   because the preemption is in those 31,550 people who

24   couldn't register.

25                 But, I think the Election Clause is going to

                                        49

 1   be very different in this sense -- in two critical

 2   senses.    And that is that the Elections Clause involves

 3   an authority in the States that is conferred by the

 4   Constitution itself.

 5                 May I finish?

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Please.

 7                 MS. MILLETT:         It -- it has no reserve power

 8   that's being protected there, and by the very nature of

 9   the Election Clause is that Congress only acts when it

10   means to displace or change what the States are doing.

11   And so the necessity of having a presumption makes no

12   sense in this context, particularly when you're talking

13   again about a Federal form for Federal elections of

14   Federal officials by Federal voters who need a direct

15   line of accountability.

 1   and the provisions that provide for the establishment of

 2   a Federal form embody that objective.

 3                  And I'd like to point to three features of

 4   the relevant statutory language that I think support our

 5   reading.     And the particular critical provision is at

 6   page 22A of the appendix to the government's brief.                  And

 7   I'm sorry, I know that the provisions are located in a

 8   number of areas, but the gray brief at page 22A has the

 9   critical provision in our view, which is one that

10   Ms. Millett was pointing to.                And that's gg-7(b)(1).

11                  Now, what this provision embodies is this

12   understanding:     That the EAC is the one who determines

13   what the content of the Federal form is.                 Not the

14   States, but the EAC.        The States do have a role in this

15   scheme, and I think it's important to understand what

16   that role is.

17                  The States have a consultative role at the

18   front end.     And this is back at page 21A -- I'm sorry

19   for skipping back.      But at page 21A at the bottom of the

20   page, the EAC is to develop a form in consultation with

21   the chief election officers of the States.

22                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Srinivasan, the problem

23   that I have with that is that the provision you're

24   alluding to says that -- not that the State shall -- not

25   that the commission "shall" require the information

                                        51

 1   necessary to enable the appropriate State election

 2   official to assess eligibility, but it simply says that

 3   it "may" require only that information.                   Now, is it

 4   conceivable that Congress intended that the Commission

 5   may not require some information that is necessary to

 6   enable the appropriate State election official to assess

 7   eligibility, but that the State may not require it

 8   either?

 9                  Is that a conceivable disposition of

10   Congress?

11                  MR. SRINIVASAN:            I don't think it is,

12   Justice Scalia, but I think the problem with that is in

13   the premise.     I grant you that the statute says "may

14   require," but it says "may require only," and I think

15   the only fair way to read this provision is that the

16   commission is to require the information that's

17   necessary, but -

18                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            You think "may require

19   only" means shall require only?                   Is that -- is that your

20   submission?     "May require only" means shall require

21   only?

22                  MR. SRINIVASAN:            It "may require only," in

23   effect, means shall require information that's

24   necessary, but may only require that information.                      I

25   think the statute would make very little sense if the

                                        52

 1   EAC discharged its statutory responsibility by having a

 2   Federal form that required nothing other than the name.

 3   That wouldn't be within anybody's conceivable conception

 4   of a rational objective of Congress that would enable

 5   the EAC to satisfy -

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:            It would not be a problem

 7   if the State could require it.                It would not be a

 8   problem.   When -- when the commission fails to do

 9   what -- what enables the State to assess qualifications,

10   the State will do it.       No problem.

11                MR. SRINIVASAN:            But I think the whole point

12   of this, Justice Scalia -- and this is where I started,

13   with all due respect -- is to come forward with a

14   Federal form that streamlines the process of

15   registration for applicants.              And if the regime that

16   resulted were one in which the Federal form served very

17   little purpose other than to set a floor, but then each

18   of the 50 States could superimpose whatever additional

19   requirements they wanted to, I think that would largely

20   defeat the entire purpose of the Federal form.

21                JUSTICE BREYER:            And that's the grand

22   purpose -- to go back to your -- I see that as your

23   grand purpose.   That's the grand purpose argument.                And

24   then there is the subsidiary purpose argument, which you

25   started to make, which I wanted to hear, which has to do

                                      53

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   with (b).   It says may require only such identifying

 2   information.     So I thought, well, they could require

 3   less, less than what's necessary.                        They could.     It says

 4   you can't require more.           They could require less.

 5                  But suppose they put a statement in and they

 6   say, in respect to this qualification, nothing to do

 7   with citizenship:     This is what is necessary.                        No more.

 8   But we've done everything that is necessary.                           Then could

 9   a State come along and say, we think more is necessary?

10                  MR. SRINIVASAN:            I don't think so, Justice

11   Breyer.

12                  JUSTICE BREYER:            And it's the word

13   "necessary" that you thought -- that that would be

14   dependent upon?

15                  MR. SRINIVASAN:            Coupled with the statutory

16   objective because what this provision says is that the

17   EAC, in consultation with the States, is supposed to

18   create a form that imposes the following burden on

19   individuals, on individuals.                That's the key.

20                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, I know I'm not -- I'm

21   just not quite -- the last step of what I wanted you to

22   think up was this -

23                  MR. SRINIVASAN:            Sure.

24                  JUSTICE BREYER:            It does say "may require

25   only" -

 1                 MR. SRINIVASAN:               Correct.

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:               -- "that which is

 3   necessary."    So if they said -- and this what is

 4   necessary.    Fine.     Pretty tough for the State to say I'm

 5   going to add some things.               But the very next subsection

 6   does use the words "shall include."                        So I wonder -- and

 7   that has to do with citizenship.                      So I wonder if that is

 8   a statement by Congress that in respect to citizenship,

 9   that is what is necessary.

10                 MR. SRINIVASAN:               I do think that that's what

11   Congress contemplated was necessary, but it's not to the

12   exclusion of this, which is that if a State comes

13   forward to the EAC, which is a body that's charged with

14   responsibility for defining the contents of the Federal

15   form, and says we think something more is necessary.

16   Take a look at what we want to submit to you, and you

17   should amend the Federal form, or you should at least

18   amend our State-specific portion of the Federal form to

19   include this requirement in it, the EAC could make that

20   determination.

21                 Congress made that responsibility -

22                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:                 Mr. Srinivasan, I think

23   General Horne told us that -- that the State did ask the

24   Commission, but the Commission had only two members; the

25   Commission didn't act on it.                  Only the legal director.

                                          55

 1   So how could they get court review of an agency decision

 2   that was never made?

 3                MR. SRINIVASAN:            No, Justice -- Justice

 4   Ginsburg, to be clear, I don't -- I don't think General

 5   Horne would disagree with this, the executive director

 6   initially responded to the request by rejecting it, but

 7   it did go to the full Commission, and at that point,

 8   there was a fully-constituted Commission.                      The

 9   Commission divided by a vote of 2-2.

10                And so in that instance, the Commission took

11   no action.   But a 2-2 vote is a -- qualifies as a

12   rejection.   And that is something that could -

13   potentially could have been the subject of judicial

14   review.   Now, I'm obviously not going to give away any

15   Federal defenses, but -

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yes.           And since you believe

17   that "may require only" means "shall require only," in

18   judicial review, a determination before the -- the Court

19   would be whether indeed this information is necessary to

20   enable the State to assess the qualifications, right?

21                MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, that -

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:            And the district court here

23   certainly thought that was necessary.                      So you're going

24   to be in -- in bad shape -- the government is going to

25   be -- the next time somebody does challenge the

 1   Commission determination in court under the

 2   Administrative Procedure Act.

 3               MR. SRINIVASAN:            I mean, obviously, I'd

 4   respectfully disagree with that.                 I think we'll be in

 5   perfectly good shape.      And I think part of the reason is

 6   that this -- requiring a statement under penalty of

 7   perjury is the traditional way in which States enforce

 8   their qualifications.

 9               The legislative history shows that Congress

10   understood that that was the traditional way.                       What the

11   State seeks to do here is do something over and above

12   the traditional way to enforce qualifications.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    As -- as Louisiana

14   has done.

15               MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, Louisiana is not -

16   is not citizenship-specific here, Your Honor, as

17   Ms. Millett was pointing out -

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But it's certainly

19   things that were not required in the Federal form.

20               MR. SRINIVASAN:            That's correct.          And that

21   was submitted to the EAC, and the EAC approved of it.

22   And I think that's the critical distinction here.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    How is that

24   consistent with the statutory purpose to streamline

25   registration?

 1                MR. SRINIVASAN:            Because the statute -- the

 2   statute seeks to streamline registration, but it's not

 3   directed to the exclusion of all other objectives.                       And

 4   the EAC is charged with balancing the various competing

 5   statutory objectives.       And it concluded in -- with

 6   respect to the Louisiana submission -- that that one was

 7   okay.   I do think that's different.                   A, because the EAC

 8   approved of it; and B, because the specific forms of

 9   identification that are outlined in Louisiana addition

10   were exactly those forms of identification that Congress

11   already said was okay at either the registration stage

12   or the voting stage.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:            You got to stop saying the

14   Commission approved of it.             2-2 is not approving.            You

15   could say the Commission was unable to disapprove of it.

16                MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, I think we are

17   talking about two different things, Justice Scalia.                       I'm

18   talking about Louisiana.

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I'm sorry.         I'm sorry.

20                MR. SRINIVASAN:            I was trying to answer the

21   Chief Justice's question.

22                In Arizona, it was 2-2.

23                Now, I want to point out one other critical

24   feature of the statute, and General Horne alluded to

25   this and said that there's no way to look in the statute

                                      58

 1   and see a distinction between on one hand what the

 2   individuals can be required to provide, and on the other

 3   hand what the State can then do with the individual

 4   information to crosscheck it.

 5               And the statute presupposes that the State

 6   can conduct its own investigation to crosscheck the

 7   information that the individual supplies.                    And maybe the

 8   critical provision to see that is at page 19A of the

 9   appendix to the government's brief.                    And that's a

10   provision that deals with a different qualification,

11   felony history.   But it operates on this assumption that

12   States can conduct their own investigation, which makes

13   all the sense in the world.

14               This one -- this provision that's in

15   subsection (g) at the top of the page, which is 1973

16   gg-6(g), what this does is it tells the United States

17   Attorney's Offices that when there is a Federal

18   conviction of a felony, the U.S. Attorney's Office is

19   supposed to give written notice of that conviction to

20   the chief State election official.

21               And what's the State -- chief State election

22   official going to do with that?                 Well of course, what

23   they're going to do is they're going to take a look at

24   the Federal form, they're going to see what the

25   individual said about their felony history, and they're

                                      59

 1   going to crosscheck it -- this information that they got

 2   from the United States Attorney -- to make sure that the

 3   information on the form is accurate.

 4                JUSTICE ALITO:            May I ask you a question

 5   that I asked Ms. Millett?           Does the United States think

 6   that the Arizona form is illegal?                      And if it is not,

 7   what sense does it make to have a system in which

 8   whether or not someone will successfully register

 9   depends on the happenstance of the particular form that

10   the person fills out.

11                MR. SRINIVASAN:            Here is the sense it would

12   make -- even if -- if Arizona had the authority to add

13   to the Federal requirements on its own State form, the

14   sense it would make is this:              That the Federal form

15   always operates as a floor.

16                It's always there for somebody to use to

17   register, regardless of what the State form might do in

18   addition.   And that has -- I take Your Honor's

19   assumption -- if I can just briefly finish -- I

20   understand Your Honor's point that there is a practical

21   question about whether that would ever be practicable or

22   useful, given that an individual would want to use the

23   State form for State, local and Federal elections, but

24   there is also the -- the well-understood practice of

25   organizations that go out to register individuals to

                                      60

 2                And they can use the Federal form, and the

 3   Federal form would suffice.

 6              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. HORNE

 7                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 8                MR. HORNE:         Thank you, Your Honor, and I'll

 9   apologize in advance for talking really quickly.                        The -

10   my friend says in discussing Section 7(b)(1) that it

11   would not be rational to require only the signature.

12   But that's exactly what they did.                        All they required was

13   the signature, and 7(b)(1) has nothing to do with that;

14   7(b)(2) requires a signature.                 So what the EAC chose to

15   do under 7(b)(1) was exactly nothing, zero, which -

16   which emphasizes the point that this is the

17   responsibility of the States, and that's how they

18   understood it.

19                With respect to the license having -- we

20   cited ARA Section 28-3173, an Arizona statute in our

21   reply brief that provides that you -- you must renew

22   every 12 years.     So by 2004, the problem that my friend

23   spoke about was completely erased.                        Everybody had a new

24   license which would be sufficient for this purpose, 100

25   percent.

 1               They admit that we can reject applications

 2   by reference to other -- by reference to other

 3   documentation, but they try to draw a distinction

 4   between that and asking the person to write down the

 5   driver's license number.         But there is nothing in the

 6   statute that justifies that distinction.              A reference to

 7   criminal history has nothing to do with -- with whether

 8   or not there is a distinction with respect to

 9   citizenship between looking at other documents and

10   asking the person for their driver's license numbers.

11   In both cases, it's something outside of the form and

12   they have admitted we can go outside the form.

13               With respect to legislative history, Your

14   Honor, I think the key thing -- Mr. Justice Breyer, in

15   your question was, it's only in one place.              There are a

16   lot of other places that go the other way.              So we cannot

17   conclude from that one place what the majority of

18   Congress expected.

19               With respect to HAVA, in HAVA, the Congress

20   had another opportunity to expressly state that the

21   State could not look to external evidence and ask for

22   additional evidence, and they chose not to do that.              And

23   so I would say that HAVA is further evidence that

24   Congress was not choosing to prohibit us from asking for

25   additional information to fulfill our function, if it's

                                     62

 1   necessary, of being sure that the applicant is eligible

 2   to vote.

 3               With respect to the Siebold case, the court

 4   in Siebold specifically said there will be no preemption

 5   unless there is a direct conflict and only to the extent

 6   of that conflict, and in that connection -- one last

 7   sentence, Your Honor -- if there are two plausible

 8   interpretations, ordinary principles of Federalism say

 9   one should not choose the interpretation that results in

10   preemption, and the same thing applies with respect to

11   the canon of constitutional accordance.

12               Thank you, Your Honor.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

14               The case is submitted.
