 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   We'll hear argument

 4   first today in 05-1120, Massachusetts versus

 5   Environmental Protection Agency.                Mr. Milkey.

 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. MILKEY

 7                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 8              MR. MILKEY:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10              If I may, I'd like to frame the merits very

11   quickly and then turn immediately to standing.                     Although

12   the case before you arises in an important policy area,

13   it turns on ordinary principles of statutory

14   interpretation and administrative law.                   EPA made a

15   decision based on two grounds, both of which constitute

16   plain errors of law reviewable under any standard.

17   EPA's principle grounds was that it lacked authority

18   over the emissions of the four substances at issue, even

19   if they, in fact, endanger public health and welfare.

20   That legal conclusion fails as a matter of law.

21              As a fallback position, EPA declined to

22   consider if these substances are endangering public

23   health and welfare, claiming its policy approach made

24   more sense than the regulatory scheme encompassed in

25   section 1202 of the Clean Air Act.                  Although EPA


                                         3

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   possesses a good deal of discretion in applying the

 2   statutory endangerment test, it cannot rest its ruling

 3   on impermissible grounds as it did here.

 4               We are not asking the Court to pass judgment

 5   on the science of climate change or to order EPA to set

 6   emission standards.      We simply want EPA to visit the

 7   rulemaking petition based upon permissible

 8   considerations.

 9               And now, Your Honor, I'd like to turn to

10   standing.   Petitioner showed a wide variety of injury in

11   fact, all of which are the kinds of harms the statute

12   was aimed at preventing.          For example, our uncontested

13   affidavits establish that as a matter of physics, the

14   more greenhouse gases accumulate in the air, the more

15   temperatures are going to rise, ocean waters expand, and

16   the seas rise.    And of course as the seas expand, they

17   rise everywhere around the world.                 Some areas such as

18   Massachusetts will be hit particularly hard because

19   we're also subject to a land subsidence, but that --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:              I thought that the standing

21   requires imminent harm.         If you haven't been harmed

22   already, you have to show the harm is imminent.                 Is this

23   harm imminent?

24               MR. MILKEY:         It is, Your Honor.          We have

25   shown that the sea levels are already occurring from the


                                         4

 1   current amounts of greenhouse gases in the air, and that

 2   means it is only going to get worse as the --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            When?      I mean, when is the

 4   predicted cataclysm?

 5                 MR. MILKEY:       Your Honor, it's not so much a

 6   cataclysm as ongoing harm.           The harm does not suddenly

 7   spring up in the year 2100, it plays out continuously

 8   over time.    And even to the extent you focus on harms

 9   that occur in the future, there's nothing conjectural

10   about that.    Once these gases are emitted into the area,

11   and they stay a long time, the laws of physics take

12   over.

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, there's a lot of

14   conjecture about whether -- I gather that there's

15   something of a consensus on warming, but not a consensus

16   on how much of that is attributable to human activity.

17   And I gather that -- what is it?                Something like seven

18   percent of the total carbon dioxide emissions are

19   attributable to automobiles in the United States?

20                 MR. MILKEY:       It's actually about 6 percent,

21   Your Honor.

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            6 percent?      Thank you.

23                 MR. MILKEY:       But it's important to point out

24   as well, though, that in the ruling we challenge, EPA

25   has disavowed authority over all U.S. sources of


                                         5

 1   emissions, which constitute about 20 percent of

 2   global --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Yes, but that doesn't go to

 4   the harm that you're claiming.               I mean, we're talking

 5   about the, you know, the standing issue right now.                     And

 6   if you've been harmed, you've claimed harm because of

 7   carbon dioxide emissions, right?

 8               MR. MILKEY:         Agreed, Your Honor.           But my

 9   point was that they disclaimed authority over all

10   sources of carbon --

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:              I understand, but that has

12   nothing to do with whether you have standing.                  That has

13   to do with the merits of the case.                  But on the standing

14   point, only new cars would be affected, right?                  So even

15   the reduction of the 6 percent would take a few years,

16   wouldn't it?

17               MR. MILKEY:         It would take a few years, Your

18   Honor, but it is a basic premise of the Clean Air Act

19   that vehicle fleets regularly turn over --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:              I understand.      But it goes

21   to how imminent the harm is and how remediable the

22   imminent harm is.    If, in fact, the 6 percent will only

23   be reduced to maybe five and a half in the next few

24   years, your --

25               MR. MILKEY:         Your Honor, we have shown in

 1   the record that a 40 percent reduction in carbon dioxide

 2   from cars is currently feasible.               And since those

 3   emissions account for --

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Not in the first year.

 5               MR. MILKEY:        No, no.         We agree, Your Honor.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I mean ultimately, when all

 7   the cars currently on the roads are off and the new cars

 8   with, you know, whatever measures you think will reduce

 9   the carbon dioxide are on the road, then 40 percent

10   would be the figure.

11               MR. MILKEY:        Yes, Your Honor.

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But whatever position

13   holds for motor vehicles would similarly hold for power

14   plants, and has there been any application to EPA with

15   respect to carbon dioxide in power plants?

16               MR. MILKEY:        There has, Your Honor.           In

17   fact, EPA has turned down a rulemaking petition to

18   regulate them under the new source performance standard

19   section of the Clean Air Act, and that is currently on

20   appeal in the D.C. Circuit, but it is currently stayed

21   pending the outcome of this case, and it just --

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Do you get the

23   benefit of that broader allegation in establishing your

24   standard?   In other words, if you've challenged EPA's

25   refusal to apply a particular level of greenhouse

 1   regulation to a particular model of car, can you say,

 2   well, they're following the same approach to a coal

 3   powered -- coal fueled power plant, and so we get to

 4   establish a broader injury?             Or, aren't you limited to

 5   the specific legal challenge you're raising here?

 6               MR. MILKEY:        Your Honor, I think it's

 7   actually more direct in the sense that in the decision

 8   we challenge here, they said greenhouse gases are not

 9   air pollutants under any regulatory provision of the

10   act.   So at least on --

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Don't you have to

12   show injury from their decision here?                   The fact that

13   other people, or you presumably as well might be injured

14   by their decisions that you are not challenging here,

15   that doesn't help your standing here, does it?

16               MR. MILKEY:        I believe it does, Your Honor,

17   because we cannot win that other case unless we win this

18   case here in terms of the authority question.                   And in

19   any event, it is important to point out that because of

20   the scale of the problem, relatively small percentage

21   deductions in global emissions can lead to real world

22   results.

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But at the outset, you

24   made this, some of this perhaps reassuring statement

25   that we need not decide about global warming in this


                                        8

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   case.   But don't we have to do that in order to decide

 2   the standing argument, because there's no injury if

 3   there's not global warming?             Or, can you show standing

 4   simply because there is a likelihood that the perceived

 5   would show that there's an injury?

 6                MR. MILKEY:       Your Honor, especially in this

 7   case where none of our affidavits were challenged, I

 8   don't think the Court needs to go there ultimately on

 9   the merits because we showed through our uncontested

10   affidavits that these harms will occur.                   There was no

11   evidence put in to the contrary, and I would add that

12   the reports on which EPA itself relies conclude that

13   climate change is occurring in --

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Those affidavits

15   talked about the fact that if the government starts to

16   regulate, the technology is going to change, if the

17   technology changes, other governments will adopt it, and

18   all that, and that strikes me as sort of spitting out

19   conjecture on conjecture, the sort that we disapproved

20   of.

21                MR. MILKEY:       Your Honor, although we believe

22   we have shown other governments will follow suit, we are

23   not in any sense relying on that.                We can easily show

24   our standing without relying on that.                   And that's

25   because --


                                        9

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Same argument if the

 2   automobile emissions were 1 percent contributors?

 3               MR. MILKEY:        It would be the same argument.

 4   And I would add that EPA in other contexts has

 5   determined on several occasions that a 1 percent

 6   contribution is significant under the Clean Air Act.

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 How is that

 8   consistent with our taxpayer standing cases where the

 9   argument is that a taxpayer doesn't have standing to

10   challenge an illegal expenditure as a general matter

11   simply because his contribution, the benefit that he's

12   claiming is so small and so widely dispersed?

13               MR. MILKEY:        Your Honor, it is different

14   because here there is particularized injury that we have

15   shown.   The injury doesn't get any more particular than

16   states losing 200 miles of coastline, both sovereign

17   territory and property we actually own, to rising seas.

18               JUSTICE ALITO:          If you look ahead, I don't

19   know how far imminence allows you to look ahead, but

20   let's say we're looking at 5 years or 10 years, what

21   particularized harm does the record show that

22   Massachusetts will, or faces an imminent threat of

23   suffering, that can be traceable to the reductions that

24   you want to produce through these regulations?

25               MR. MILKEY:        Well, Your Honor, if I can deal


                                       10
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   with the traceability part of that question first,

 2   traceability is easy to show here because the extent of

 3   our harm is caused by the overall amount of the gases in

 4   the air.    And being focused on the 20 percent of all

 5   U.S. sources, or the 6 percent of the cars, that's still

 6   a sizeable portion of the problem, so we know that 6 or

 7   20 percent is there.

 8                In terms of the particular harms, similarly

 9   we have shown --

10                JUSTICE ALITO:          6 percent is the total

11   emissions, the total contribution from motor vehicles in

12   the United States, right?

13                MR. MILKEY:        To the global carbon dioxide

14   emission.

15                JUSTICE ALITO:          To the global.      And so, the

16   reduction that you could achieve under the best of

17   circumstances with these regulations would be a small

18   portion of that, would it not?

19                MR. MILKEY:        It would be, we have shown in

20   the record it would be about a two-and-a-half percent

21   over the time it takes to turn the fleet over.               But it's

22   important that given the nature of the harms, even small

23   reductions can be significant.               For example, if we're

24   able to save only a small fraction of the hundreds of

25   millions of dollars that Massachusetts parks agencies


                                        11

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   are projected to lose, that reduction is itself

 2   significant.

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 That assumes

 4   everything else is going to remain constant, though,

 5   right?   It assumes there isn't going to be a greater

 6   contribution of greenhouse gases from economic

 7   development in China and other places that's going to

 8   displace whatever marginal benefit you get here.

 9               MR. MILKEY:        Yes, Your Honor.           But reducing

10   domestic emissions will reduce our harm, the harm we

11   would otherwise face regardless of what --

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Not if your harm is

13   the alleged loss of coastline.              Not necessarily.      It

14   depends upon what happens across the globe with respect

15   to greenhouse emissions.

16               MR. MILKEY:        Your Honor, we would still lose

17   coastline but we would not lose as much because these

18   harms are cumulative, and while reducing U.S. emissions

19   will not eliminate all the harm we face, it can reduce

20   the harm that these emissions are causing.

21               So it will necessarily reduce our harm and

22   satisfy redressibility.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I mean, do we know that

24   that's a straight line ratio, that a reduction of

25   two-and-a-half percent of carbon dioxide -- well, two

 1   and a half overall would save two-and-a-half percent of

 2   your coastline?    Is that how it works?                 I'm not a

 3   scientist, but I'd be surprised if it was so rigid.

 4                 MR. MILKEY:       Your Honor, I don't believe

 5   it's established it's necessarily a straight line.                        But

 6   I want to emphasize that small vertical rises cause a

 7   large loss of horizontal land.               For example, where the

 8   slope is less than 2 percent, which is true of much of

 9   the Massachusetts coastline, every foot rise will create

10   a loss of more than 50 feet of horizontal land.                     And for

11   example, in the State of New York, the Oppenheimer

12   affidavit projects that New York could well lose

13   thousands of acres of its sovereign territory by the

14   year 2020.    So the harm is already occurring.                   It is

15   ongoing and it will happen well into the future.

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What's your

17   strongest case from this Court to support your standing

18   allegation?

19                 MR. MILKEY:       Your Honor, what I would say to

20   that is our standing here is so much more direct and

21   particularized than, for example, the harm this Court

22   found sufficient in Laidlaw, which was --

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Laidlaw was a

24   specific citizen suit provision, wasn't it?

25                 MR. MILKEY:       It was, Your Honor.

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So doesn't that make

 2   it somewhat analytically distinct from this case?

 3                 MR. MILKEY:        I don't believe so, Your Honor.

 4   Here I think the fact that the States are showing harm

 5   not only to them in a property sense, but in their

 6   sovereign capacity --

 7                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What's your authority for

 8   that?     I have the same question as the Chief Justice.                I

 9   was looking at your brief for the strongest case.

10   Suppose there were a big landowner that owned lots of

11   coastline.    Would he have the same standing that you do

12   or do you have some special standing as a State, and if

13   so what is the case which would demonstrate that?

14                 MR. MILKEY:        Well, Your Honor, first of all,

15   we agree that a large landowner would himself or herself

16   have --

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            What of a small landowner?

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            No, no.         I'm asking

19   whether you have some special standing --

20                 MR. MILKEY:        Yes --

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- as a State and, if so,

22   what's the authority for that?

23                 MR. MILKEY:        Your Honor, first of all, I do

24   think we have special standing.                For example, here it's

25   uncontested that greenhouse gases are going to make

 1   ozone problems worse, which makes it harder for us to

 2   comply with our existing Clean Air Act responsibilities.

 3                And the -- in the West Virginia case, which

 4   is a D.C. Circuit case, the Court found that that itself

 5   provided an independent source of standing.               In terms of

 6   Supreme Court cases, the -- it's been -- for 200 years,

 7   this Court has recognized loss of state sovereign

 8   property as a traditional --

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, I don't know.       1907

10   was Georgia versus Tennessee Copper, and that was

11   pre-Massachusetts versus Mellon.               That seems to me your

12   best case.

13                What about a small landowner?              I asked the

14   question about a big landowner.              Suppose you have a

15   small landowner and he owned a lot?

16                MR. MILKEY:       Your Honor, I think if someone

17   is losing property because of this problem, then that

18   person would have standing, but we're nowhere near a de

19   minimis threshold here.        We have shown we own property,

20   200 miles of coastline which we're losing, and we think

21   the standing is straightforward.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:           No, I'm not sure -- I think

23   our opinions have even said it, but certainly

24   commentators have often said it, that really the far

25   margin of our standing cases has been, you know, the

 1   famous scrap case, in which the allegation was that the

 2   added pollution from municipal incineration of municipal

 3   waste which would -- which couldn't be transported by

 4   rail for burial because the ICC rates were too high,

 5   that added pollution interfered with the students' --

 6   they were Georgetown Law students -- their hiking in the

 7   George Washington Forest along the Blue Ridge.

 8               That seems to me a much more immediate kind

 9   of damage; yet that's been referred to as really the far

10   margin of our standing cases.             You're talking not about

11   their being affected by ambient air but being affected

12   by a stratospheric effect which then has another

13   consequence that you allege.

15   emitted the laws of physics take over, so our harm is

16   imminent in the sense that lighting a fuse on a bomb is

17   imminent harm.   It may take --

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Milkey, does it make

19   a difference that you're not representing a group of law

20   students, but a number of States who are claiming that

21   they are disarmed from regulating and that the

22   regulatory responsibility has been given to the Federal

23   Government and the Federal Government isn't exercising

24   it?   I thought you had a discrete claim based on the

25   sovereignty of States and their inability to regulate

 1   dependent on the law Congress passed that gives that

 2   authority to the EPA.       I thought that was --

 3               MR. MILKEY:         Your Honor, you are correct

 4   that we are saying that provides us also an independent

 5   source of our standing.

 6                   JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't understand

 7   that.   You have standing whenever a Federal law preempts

 8   State action?    You can complain about the implementation

 9   of that law because it has preempted your State action?

10   Is that the basis of standing you're alleging?

11               MR. MILKEY:         In short, Your Honor --

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Do you know any case that

13   has ever held that?

14               MR. MILKEY:         Your Honor, I would cite you to

15   the amicus brief of the State of Arizona et al., which

16   cites several cases, albeit not in this Court, that

17   stand for that principle.

18               Your Honor, if I may turn to the merits

19   quickly, section 202(a)(1) provides EPA jurisdiction

20   over any air pollutant that motor vehicles emit.                It's

21   not restricted to certain types of air pollutants or to

22   air pollutants that cause certain kinds of harm.                And

23   not only does the act define air pollutant with

24   comprehensive breadth, but we know these four substances

25   are air pollutants from other evidence.

 1                For example, Congress itself expressly

 2   referred to carbon dioxide as an air pollutant in

 3   section 103(g).    And since by definition all air

 4   pollutants are air pollution agents, we know that

 5   Congress understood carbon dioxide to be an agent of air

 6   pollution.    And if air pollution --

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Moving from your

 8   authority argument to the exercise of authority, the

 9   clause 202(a)(1) requires EPA to prescribe standards

10   which in their judgment cause or contribute to air

11   pollution reasonably anticipated to endanger public

12   health.    And they say they haven't made that judgment

13   yet, so they're not in violation of that statutory

14   command.

15                MR. MILKEY:        That is correct, Your Honor;

16   but they have said that they have put off making a

17   judgment based on impermissible grounds.                  While EPA's

18   explanation is difficult even to follow, one overarching

19   point shines through and that is the agency does not

20   agree with taking a regulatory approach regardless of

21   how it might otherwise come out.

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Let's say the first

23   day this law is passed, there are a lot of air

24   pollutants that come out of motor vehicles.                  I mean, is

25   EPA immediately in violation of this statute if they

 1   don't issue emissions regulations for every one those

 2   air pollutants on day one?

 3                MR. MILKEY:         No, Your Honor.               EPA has a lot

 4   of room to move based both on the endangerment standard

 5   itself and on background principles of administrative

 6   law.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  And presumably the

 8   principle that they want to deal with what they regard

 9   as the more serious threats sooner.                       They want to deal

10   with lead first and then they want to deal with other

11   stuff.   I mean, what is the -- when did they -- I

12   guess -- move into an abuse of discretion in not

13   exercising a judgment with respect to a particular

14   pollutant?

15                MR. MILKEY:         The answer to that, Your Honor,

16   is that when they do not rely on any of those grounds,

17   they do not rely on lack of information, they did not

18   rely on background principles of administrative law.

19   What though said here is -- and -- that they did not, in

20   fact, contest the seriousness of the problem.                      But note,

21   in two back to back sentences on page A-82 of the third

22   petition they say:      We must address the, issue but we

23   disagree with the regulatory approach.

24                The very section in which they explained why

25   they weren't going to regulate is entitled "Different

 1   Policy Approach."    Rejecting mandatory motor vehicle

 2   regulation as a bad idea is simply not a policy choice

 3   that Congress left to EPA.

 4              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But if you are right and

 5   then it went back and the EPA then said, well, an

 6   obvious reason also is constraint on our own resources,

 7   we have the authority to say what comes first, Congress

 8   -- we couldn't possibly do everything that Congress has

 9   authorized us to do; so it's our decision, even though

10   we have the authority to do this, we think that we

11   should spend our resources on other things.

12              Suppose they said that?                       You said they

13   didn't say it this time around, but how far will you get

14   if all that's going to happen is it goes back and then

15   EPA says our resources are constrained and we're not

16   going to spend the money?

17              MR. MILKEY:          Your Honor, while background

18   administrative law principles provide EPA at least some

19   room to move, we think it's important that EPA say that.

20   If they -- it's a very different opinion if they say, we

21   are not going to regular here because we just don't want

22   to spend the resources on this problem and we want to

23   look elsewhere.

24              If they want to say that, they can say that

25   and then, if at all, there'd be a narrow arbitrary and

 1   capricious challenge on that.              But the point is here

 2   they relied on the impermissible consideration that they

 3   simply disagreed with the policy behind the statute.

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 That's not all they

 5   said.    I'm looking at A-85 and they said establishing

 6   emissions now would require EPA to make scientific and

 7   technical judgments without the benefit of studies that

 8   are being developed to reduce the uncertainty in the

 9   area.    That's different than saying they disagree with

10   the regulatory approach.

11                MR. MILKEY:        It is and it isn't, Your Honor,

12   because that statement will alleges be true.                  There will

13   always be scientific uncertainty.                 Agencies will always

14   have an understandable interest in seeing more

15   information.   They never --

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 There's a difference

17   between the scientific status of the harm from lead

18   emissions from vehicles that -- when you have lead in

19   the gasoline, to the status, the status of scientific

20   knowledge with respect to the impact on global warming

21   today?   Those are two very different levels of

22   uncertainty.

23                MR. MILKEY:        Your Honor, when EPA regulated

24   lead back in the ethyl days, as the Court court itself

25   took note, there were huge amounts of uncertainty at


                                        21
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that time.   And EPA has a lot of discretion in

 2   evaluating that, that uncertainty.

 3                And if the EPA determined that the level of

 4   uncertainty was such that it was not reasonable to

 5   anticipate endangerment, that is perfectly appropriate.

 6   It would also be appropriate if the agency determined

 7   that there was so much uncertainty that they couldn't

 8   even form a judgment on that.             That would be applying

 9   the endangerment statute at the same time it put off.

10   But the point is they did not say any of that.              They

11   instead relied on impermissible grounds.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Mr. Milkey, I had -- my

13   problem is precisely on the impermissible grounds.                 To

14   be sure, carbon dioxide is a pollutant, and it can be an

15   air pollutant.   If we fill this room with carbon

16   dioxide, it could be an air pollutant that endangers

17   health.   But I always thought an air pollutant was

18   something different from a stratospheric pollutant, and

19   your claim here is not that the pollution of what we

20   normally call "air" is endangering health.              That isn't,

21   that isn't -- your assertion is that after the pollutant

22   leaves the air and goes up into the stratosphere it is

23   contributing to global warming.

24                MR. MILKEY:       Respectfully, Your Honor, it is

25   not the stratosphere.      It's the troposphere.

 1              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Troposphere, whatever.          I

 2   told you before I'm not a scientist.

 3              (Laughter.)

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's why I don't want to

 5   have to deal with global warming, to tell you the truth.

 6              MR. MILKEY:        Under the express words of the

 7   statute -- and this is 302(g) -- for something to be an

 8   air pollutant it has to be emitted into the ambient air

 9   or otherwise entered there.

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yes, and I agree with that.

11   It is when it comes out an air pollutant.                   But is it an

12   air pollutant that endangers health?                   I think it has to

13   endanger health by reason of polluting the air, and this

14   does not endanger health by reason of polluting the air

15   at all.

16              MR. MILKEY:        Your Honor, respectfully, I

17   disagree, and there is nothing in the act that actually

18   requires the harm to occur in the ambient air.                   In fact,

19   some of the harm here does occur there.

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, it talks about air

21   pollution all the time.       That's what the, that's what

22   the thing is about, air pollution.                It's not about

23   global warming and it's not about the troposphere.

24              MR. MILKEY:        Your Honor, we are not saying,

25   first of all that global warming is air pollution, any

 1   more than we're saying that asthma is air pollution.

 2   They're both effects.     I would point you to the example

 3   of acid rain, where the pollutant there, sulfur dioxide,

 4   the problem is it causes its harm after it leaves the

 5   air, after it gets washed out.             Air pollutants do not

 6   need to cause harm in the ambient air.

 7              Your Honor, I would add that our

 8   interpretation satisfies common sense because, while EPA

 9   has plenary authority over substances that motor

10   vehicles emit, those substances are regulated only if

11   EPA determines that they cause endangerment.              By

12   defining the term "air pollutant" comprehensively,

13   Congress has not prejudged what may cause endangerment,

14   but it has allowed other pollutants to be regulated as

15   their harms become appreciated.             It is EPA's

16   interpretation that fails the common sense test.               They

17   have suggested that the term "air pollutant agent"

18   creates an independent test so important that it may

19   prevent some harmful compounds from being regulated

20   without providing any hint of what the term means or how

21   it applies in this case.        And they cannot explain any

22   number of anomalies such as the fact that methane is

23   already a regulated air pollutant, yet they claim they

24   can't look at its climate effects.

 1   I'd like to reserve my time.

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

 3   Mr. Milkey.

 4                 Mr. Garre.

 5               ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE,

 6                     ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

 7                 MR. GARRE:      Thank you.            Mr. Chief Justice,

 8   and may it please the Court.

 9                 After carefully considering the issue the

10   nation's expert agency in environmental matters

11   concluded that Congress has not authorized it to embark

12   on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to address

13   global climate change.        And that even if it has, now is

14   not the time to exercise such authority, in light of the

15   substantial scientific uncertainty surrounding global

16   climate change and the ongoing studies designed to

17   address those uncertainties.             Plaintiffs have provide no

18   reason to override that quintessential administrative

19   judgment.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Garre, doesn't the

21   EPA's decision on the first, "we don't have any

22   authority," doesn't that infect its subsequent decision,

23   "well, even if we did, we wouldn't exercise it."                 But

24   they've already decided they don't have authority.

25                 MR. GARRE:      Your Honor, I don't think that


                                        25

 1   it does.   In the sense, I think EPA made clear in its

 2   decisional document that it considered as an alternative

 3   matter, that if it, even assuming it did have the

 4   authority, that it wouldn't be appropriate to exercise

 5   it at this time.

 6               And importantly, too, I mean, just to be

 7   clear on this, EPA has never made an endangerment

 8   finding with respect to global climate change.                   That was

 9   true in 1998 and 1999 when the agency had a different

10   position on authority to regulate.                   Even then the

11   agency's position was clear.              Even assuming we have the

12   authority, now is not the time to exercise it.                   So I

13   don't think --

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               -- I take it that on that

15   question, is there authority, the EPA has come out one

16   way, but at least it is debatable because as you just

17   said, the predecessors of the current people said we do

18   have the authority.

19               MR. GARRE:         Well, to that degree, Your

20   Honor, this Court has made clear, for example, in the

21   Brand X case that even where agencies change positions,

22   where they've provided reasonable grounds for a new

23   interpretation, that interpretation is entitled to

24   Chevron deference.      We think that that is true in this

25   case.

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:             On this particular issue,

 2   the opinion as I read it, of the EPA, consists of 32

 3   pages.   Twenty of those pages, 22 in fact, deal with

 4   whether they have statutory authority.                    And of the 10

 5   that deal with the issue we're talking about now, five

 6   of them give as their reason that they think that the

 7   President has a different policy.                  Of the remaining

 8   five, two more consider international aspects of the

 9   problem and how you have to get other countries to

10   cooperate; and then the conclusion of that part says in

11   light of these considerations, we decide not to exercise

12   our power.

13                Now their claim with respect to that, is

14   that at least three of the four considerations are not

15   proper things for the agency to take into account:

16   namely whether the President wants to do something

17   different, whether we're running foreign policy

18   properly, whether cooperation with other countries are

19   relevant to this particular issue.

20                So what they've asked us to do is send it

21   back so they can get the right reasons.                   Now -- if they

22   want not to do it.      What's your response to that?

23                MR. GARRE:        Justice Breyer, I don't think

24   that it depends on how many pages that the agency

25   devoted to the --


                                         27
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               JUSTICE BREYER:            The reason it depended on

 2   that is whether or not these other, improper

 3   considerations might have influenced the ultimate

 4   decision not to go ahead.

 5               MR. GARRE:       I think it depends on the

 6   reasons that the agency gave.             And one of the reasons

 7   that the agency gave was the substantial scientific

 8   uncertainty surrounding the issue of global climate

 9   change.   Petitioners acknowledge that that was an

10   appropriate consideration for the agency.                  So even if

11   you think the other considerations were inappropriate,

12   and we certainly do not, but even if you think they are,

13   the agency gave an appropriate reason.                  And that reasons

14   --

15               JUSTICE BREYER:            When I write an opinion --

16   when I write an opinion, sometimes I write the words:

17   "We decide this matter in light of the following three

18   factors taken together."         And I guess a lawyer who said,

19   "one of those factors alone the Court has held justified

20   the result all by itself" -- in saying the Court has

21   held that, I guess that wouldn't be so.                  That would be a

22   bad lawyer, wouldn't it?

23               MR. GARRE:       But Your Honor --

24               JUSTICE BREYER:            If they write that all of

25   these considerations justify our result, again, one of


                                       28

 1   them by themselves, it sounds, they think would not have

 2   been sufficient.

 3                MR. GARRE:      I -- I don't think that that is

 4   a fair reading of the EPA decisional document, Your

 5   Honor.   Certainly, the agency didn't go out of its way

 6   to say, "and reading these considerations together and

 7   not any of them individually."              And with respect to the

 8   scientific uncertainty, Your Honor, you also have to

 9   take into account that the EPA had before it and pointed

10   to the report of the National Research Council on global

11   climate change.

12                JUSTICE STEVENS:           I find it interesting that

13   the scientists whose worked on that report said there

14   were a good many omissions that would have indicated

15   that there wasn't nearly the uncertainty that the agency

16   described.

17                MR. GARRE:      Your Honor, if you are referring

18   to the amicus brief, Your Honor, there are -- assuming

19   there are amicus briefs on the other side.                The Ballunas

20   amicus brief -- I think it is fair for the Court to look

21   at, to look at the document that the agency had before

22   it.   That -- that document produced by the National

23   Research -- Research Council, that's the research arm of

24   the National Academy of Sciences.                And it's one of the

25   gold standards of research.

 1              JUSTICE STEVENS:            But in their selective

 2   quotations, they left out parts that indicated there was

 3   far less uncertainty than the agency purported to find.

 4              MR. GARRE:       Well, Your Honor, I think one

 5   thing that we ought to be able to agree on is there is

 6   that there is uncertainty surrounding the phenomenon of

 7   global climate change.      I think the debate is on which

 8   areas are more uncertain than the others.                But certainly

 9   I think the agency was entitled to conclude,

10   particularly if you take into account the deference this

11   Court should give to that kind of determination, that

12   the scientific uncertainty surrounding the issue of

13   global climate change, surrounding issues of the extent

14   of natural variability in climate, surrounding the

15   issues of impact of climate feedbacks like ocean

16   circulation, and low cloud cover, are permissible

17   considerations for the agency to take into -- -

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Is there uncertainty on

19   the basic proposition that these greenhouse gases

20   contribute to global warming.

21              MR. GARRE:       Your Honor, the report says that

22   it is likely that there is a -- a connection, but that

23   it cannot unequivocally be established.                I think that --

24   if I could use that to go back to the standing question,

25   Your Honor, which is the fundamental question of whether


                                      30
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   they've showed not just a connection between greenhouse

 2   gas emissions in toto and the phenomenon of global

 3   climate change, but the particular class of greenhouse

 4   gas emissions at issue in this case.                      Six percent of

 5   global greenhouse gas emissions, at most.                      That assumes

 6   you put all U.S. vehicles off the road or that they are

 7   all zero emission cars.          So you're talking about

 8   emissions --

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 -- it is not a

10   mathematical question, right?               I mean, you would -- it's

11   that you would -- what is the number?                     What's enough?

12   10 percent?     15 percent?        Presumably, there's more to it

13   than the percentage of emissions attributable to be this

14   particular --

15                 MR. GARRE:       I think that's true, Your Honor.

16   But what petitioners here to show, they bear the burden

17   in order to establish standing under this case, is that

18   regulation of the class of greenhouse gases at issue in

19   this case will make a difference to them.

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Suppose it is not

21   greenhouse gas.     Suppose it was Agent Orange.                  Suppose

22   there a car is coming down the street and it sprays out

23   Agent Orange.     And I come into the Court and I say, you

24   know, I think that Agent Orange is going to kill me with

25   cancer.   And the reply is, well, we have some scientists


                                         31
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   here who say your chance of dying of cancer from Agent

 2   Orange is only 1 in 30.          Maybe 1 in 50.           Maybe 1 in a

 3   thousand.     Maybe 1 in 10,000.            And therefore, you have

 4   no standing to require the EPA to regulate this

 5   pollutant, Agent Orange, which is in a green cloud all

 6   over the city.

 7                 Now, would you say that the person who's

 8   made that claim has no standing?

 9                 MR. GARRE:       Your Honor, I think that that is

10   a fundamentally different case, for the simple reason

11   that global climate change is a global phenomenon.                  I

12   mean one --

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:            I was only addressing,

14   using that to -- to address your problem that the

15   chances are too small that, in fact, any one individual

16   will be affected by the 7 percent or 6 percent of the

17   material that comes out of the truck -- the CO2.

18                 MR. GARRE:       The -- the individual in that

19   case, Your Honor, like the plaintiffs here, would have

20   to show specific facts demonstrating injury,

21   redressibility and traceability.                 Now in this case --

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Your problem, I think, you

23   take the position, the proposition that the greater the

24   harm the greater the risk, the smaller the probability

25   has to be before it is reasonable to act, and necessary

 1   to act.

 2                MR. GARRE:       Your Honor, this Court's

 3   standing cases make clear that you have to show that

 4   granting the relief requested is likely to redress the

 5   alleged harms.    And again, looking at the --

 6                JUSTICE SOUTER:            They are saying it is

 7   likely to do so, even though we cannot give you a point

 8   for point percentage correlation between reduction of

 9   gas and coastline loss.         You're saying, it seems to me,

10   that they have somehow got to pinpoint this

11   mathematically --

12                MR. GARRE:       I don't -- we're not saying

13   that.

14                JUSTICE SOUTER:            -- before, before there is

15   redressibility.

16                MR. GARRE:       We're not saying that, Your

17   Honor.    We're saying that they have, they certainly have

18   to do more than they have done here.                     And they're

19   granted their standing --

20                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Tell me what it is that

21   they need, be more specific about what they need to do.

22                MR. GARRE:       Well, I will be more specific.

23   And if I could also just point to what they grounded

24   their case on here.      They grounded their case on here,

25   in the declarations, on the notion if the United States


                                        33
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   regulates greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles, then

 2   other countries will follow suit with respect to the

 3   emissions of vehicles and other greenhouse gas

 4   emissions.   That's clear from the McCracken declaration

 5   on page 239, paragraph 32 of the JA, as well as the

 6   Walsh declaration.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:             I think it can be argued

 8   that the Assistant Attorney General hasn't argued that

 9   here.

10                MR. GARRE:        Well --

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:             He has said that 6 percent

12   is enough.

13                MR. GARRE:        That, that's true, Your Honor,

14   but I still think you have to look at the basis that

15   they've relied upon on standing.                 And they haven't shown

16   specific facts which should provide any comfort to this

17   Court that regulation of less than 6 percent or fewer

18   greenhouse emissions worldwide will have any effect on

19   their alleged injuries.

20                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Why is there -- why is

21   there reason to assume that it will have no effect?

22                MR. GARRE:        Well --

23                JUSTICE SOUTER:             That seems to be the

24   assumption you're making.            You are saying unless they

25   can pinpoint the correlation between reduction of gas


                                         34

 1   and effect, let's say in coastline loss, they have not

 2   shown either causation or a sufficient likelihood of

 3   redressibility.

 4              MR. GARRE:       Your Honor --

 5              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But why do they have to

 6   show a precise correlation as opposed simply to

 7   establishing what I think is not really contested, that

 8   there is a correlation between greenhouse gases and the

 9   kind of loss that they're talking about; and it is

10   reasonable to suppose that some reduction in the gases

11   will result in some reduction in future loss.

12              Why is that insufficient?

13              MR. GARRE:       Justice Souter, one fundamental

14   reason is that we don't know what the rest of the world

15   is going to do, whether or not --

16              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Let's assume the rest --

17   let's assume that the rest of the world does nothing.             I

18   don't think that's a very reasonable assumption, but

19   let's make that assumption.           So that the only thing

20   we're talking is the 6 percent.             If the 6 percent can be

21   reduced -- I think the suggestion was over a reasonable

22   period of time, by two and a half percent of the 6,

23   there is, I suppose, reason to expect that there will

24   be, maybe not two and a half percent less coastline

25   lost, but some degree of less coastline lost because


                                      35
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   there is a correlation between the gas and the loss of

 2   the coastline.     Why is that an unreasonable assumption

 3   to make in order to show causation and redressibility,

 4   bearing in mind that redressibility is a question of

 5   more or less, not a question of either/or.

 6              They don't have to show that it will stop

 7   global warming.     Their point is that will reduce the

 8   degree of global warming and likely reduce the degree of

 9   loss, if it is only by two and a half percent.                What's

10   wrong with that?

11              MR. GARRE:          Justice Souter, their burden is

12   to show that if the Court grants their requested relief

13   it will redress their injuries.                I'm not aware --

14              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Not redress their injury in

15   the sense that it will prevent any global warming or

16   stop global warming and stop coastal erosion; their

17   argument is a different one.              It will reduce the degree

18   of global warming and reduce the degree of coastal loss.

19              MR. GARRE:          I think --

20              JUSTICE SOUTER:               That's their argument.   Not

21   all or nothing.     But a part.           That's what they're trying

22   to show.

23              MR. GARRE:          And that's fine, Justice Souter,

 1   reduction in that tiny fraction of United States

 2   emissions, putting aside the 99 percent or the 95

 3   percent in the rest of the world and what they do, and

 4   the evidence that shows that greenhouse gas emissions in

 5   those countries are increasing, they have to show the

 6   regulation of that tiny fraction would have an affect on

 7   their alleged injuries, not to completely redress them,

 8   Your Honor.     We don't say that --

 9                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Don't they have to show

10   that it is reasonable to suppose it will have an effect?

11                 MR. GARRE:       They have to show that it is

12   likely, Your Honor.       And they haven't even tried to make

13   that showing.    The one thing that they've --

14                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Why is that showing -- and

15   I agree with, by the way, with the Chief's suggestion a

16   moment ago, life is not, or physics are not so simple as

17   to assume that there's going to be a be a direct two and

18   a half percent reduction of coastline for a two and a

19   half percent reduction from the 6 percent.

20                 But isn't it intuitively reasonable to

21   suppose that with some reduction of the greenhouse

22   gases, there will be some reduction of the ensuing

23   damage or the ensuing climate change which causes the

24   damage?   Isn't that fair?

25                 MR. GARRE:       I don't think that it is fair,

 1   Your Honor.    I don't want to pretend to be an expert on

 2   global climate change.        But the one thing I can say is

 3   from the materials I looked at is that this an

 4   extraordinarily complex area of science.                 I'm not aware

 5   of any studies available that would suggest that the

 6   regulation of that minuscule fraction of greenhouse gas

 7   emissions would have any effect whatsoever on the

 8   global -- -

 9                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           But do you have any --

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Suppose others cooperate?

11   Suppose, for example, they regulate this and before you

12   know it, they start to sequester carbon with the power

13   plants, and before you know it, they decide ethanol

14   might be a good idea, and before you know it, they

15   decide any one of 15 things, each of which has an

16   impact, and lo and behold, Cape Cod is saved.                 Now why

17   is it unreasonable?      Why is it unreasonable to go to an

18   agency and say now you do your part, which is 6 percent,

19   and now we're going to go to a different agency like

20   NHTSA and we're going to ask them too, and we're going

21   to go to your electricity regulation program, and coal.

22   And there are like not a million things that have to be

23   done, maybe there are only seven.                 But by the time we

24   get those seven things done, we'll make a big

25   difference.    Now what is it in the law that says that

 1   somehow a person cannot go to an agency and say we want

 2   you to do your part?        Would you be up here saying the

 3   same thing if we're trying to regulate child

 4   pornography, and it turns out that anyone with a

 5   computer can get pornography elsewhere?                      I don't think

 6   so.

 7               MR. GARRE:         Your Honor, what I would point

 8   you to is your decision in Lujan versus Defenders of

 9   Wildlife, Justice Kennedy's opinion in ASARCO versus

10   Kadish, where the Court made clear that you cannot

11   establish standing based on predictions of the actions

12   of independent actors not before it.                      That's true about

13   other agencies that aren't here today.                     That's true

14   about other countries whom this Court does not have

15   jurisdiction over.

16               JUSTICE BREYER:              So they couldn't have gone

17   in and asked for ozone regulations, because that

18   requires other countries?            Or what about dumping heavy

19   metals in the sea, and as the sea gets polluted because

20   of what other countries do, but EPA tried to regulate

21   that.   Acid rain they tried to regulate.                     You're

22   saying there is no standing to ask for any of that.

23               MR. GARRE:         Well, first of all, Congress has

24   specifically addressed two of the areas that you

25   mentioned, Your Honor, and we're not saying that

 1   categorically --

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Just because there's

 3   no standing to challenge an agency's decision doesn't

 4   mean the agency can't regulate that particular area,

 5   right?

 6                 MR. GARRE:       That's exactly right, Your

 7   Honor.   That's exactly right.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:            But you are saying if

 9   Congress passes a statute and they put the words CO2

10   right in this statute under ambient air, and they say

11   anybody can go and sue if the EPA doesn't do it, you're

12   saying Congress lacks the constitutional authority to do

13   that, because it's Article III we're talking about?

14                 MR. GARRE:       Well, Your Honor, we're saying

15   two things.     First, every plaintiff has the obligation

16   to establish that he has Article III standing under this

17   Constitution.     And secondly, there are members of this

18   Court, for example, Justice Kennedy in his concurring

19   opinion in Defenders of Wildlife, who did suggest that

20   perhaps if Congress specifically addresses an issue,

21   that could inform the standing analysis.                   For example --

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 They can't

23   compromise the requirements of Article III.

24                 MR. GARRE:       It cannot, Your Honor.             Congress

25   could make findings with respect to causation or other

 1   issues that this Court would have to give deference to

 2   and seriously consider, but you're right.               It would not

 3   override the requirements of Article III.               And there may

 4   be some global phenomenon that create more difficult

 5   challenges to establish standing but --

 6               JUSTICE STEVENS:            As I understand the

 7   government's position, you're not merely questioning

 8   standing but you also take the position you do not have

 9   the authority to do what the plaintiff asks you to do;

10   is that correct?

11               MR. GARRE:       That's true, Your Honor, moving

12   to the merits, that's true.            And with respect to that,

13   the agency engaged in the same type of analysis that

14   this Court laid out in the Brown and Williamson case.

15               JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask you on that

16   question, if we turn to the statute, to Section 201,

17   there's reference to "shall regulate" if in the judgment

18   of the administrator there is a for real danger and so

19   forth.   In your view, is there a duty to make a

20   judgment?

21               MR. GARRE:       Your Honor, our view is that

22   agencies have inherent discretion to determine when to

23   make that judgment.

24               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Could they have a

25   discretion never to make the judgment?

 1                MR. GARRE:        I think that gets to the

 2   question of whether there is, what judicial review is

 3   available.     We have assumed in this case that there's

 4   some measure of judicial review.                 So I think at some

 5   point you got to the point where the agency either has

 6   provided no reasons whatsoever, or there is no sound

 7   basis for the agency not to take that step.                 Then

 8   assuming that there is a role for the courts here, a

 9   court could come in and say that that was inappropriate.

10                JUSTICE STEVENS:             But as I read your brief,

11   you didn't really confront the question, s I understand

12   it, of whether or not there was a duty to make a

13   judgment at all.    And I'm interested in what your

14   position on that is.

15                MR. GARRE:        Well, again, I think it goes to

16   the question -- we think the statute does not put a

17   deadline on when the agency has to have, and that

18   therefore --

19                JUSTICE STEVENS:             To me, just reading the

20   text of the statute is a little ambiguous.                I'm not

21   entirely clear, but it seems to me that just reading

22   that statute, I got the impression that Congress thought

23   that the administrator had a duty to make a judgment

24   when there was enough evidence out there that people

25   were concerned about it and so forth, that there would


                                         42
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   be a duty there, but you think not?

 2              MR. GARRE:        That's not the agency's

 3   interpretation.   In fact in its decisional document

 4   under the section no mandatory duty, the agency explains

 5   why that's not its interpretation and we think that

 6   that's a reasonable interpretation.                     Congress knows how

 7   to constrain the exercise of discretion.                     We point in

 8   footnotes 18 and 19 of our brief of many examples where

 9   Congress has laid out deadlines or other constraints on

10   the exercise of discretion, and those aren't present in

11   Section 203.

12              JUSTICE STEVENS:             But you would agree that

13   if they did make a judgment, then you would have

14   authority to regulate?

15              MR. GARRE:        That's right.               And then I think

16   it's a point the D.C. Circuit made in the Ethyl

17   Corporation case at footnote 37, that precisely because

18   the statute imposes a duty to act once that endangerment

19   finding is made, the agency has discretion to determine

20   when to make the endangerment finding.

21              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             In Norton versus Utah

22   Wilderness Alliance, having to do with the regulation of

23   off-road vehicles, we indicated that one measure was

24   whether or not the agency has unreasonably delayed its

25   action.

 1              MR. GARRE:        That's a separate sort of

 2   action, Your Honor.     There are cases where people have

 3   said that this is unreasonable delay.                    That's not the

 4   claim that the petitioners in this case brought.

 5              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Let me understand

 6   your answer to Justice Stevens' question.                    If EPA made

 7   the judgment under the statute, you think they would

 8   have had the authority?

 9              MR. GARRE:        Under the statute --

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I thought you had a

11   Brown and Williamson argument that EPA was precluded.

12              MR. GARRE:        No, I was assuming -- in

13   answering Justice Stevens' questions, that we were down

14   in the exercise of discretion part.                    But you're right,

15   Your Honor, the threshold position of the agency on this

16   is that it lacks the authority to --

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Can I ask about that?           I

18   found persuasive Solicitor General Garre's point that in

19   the acid rain context, it isn't air pollution that harms

20   health, but rather it is the effect of the pollutant

21   after it leaves the air and produces the acid rain.                       Is

22   there anything wrong with that response?                    It seems to

23   me --

24              MR. GARRE:        I think there is, Your Honor.

25   The way that the agency looked at this is to look at the

 1   question of whether Congress intended it to regulate

 2   greenhouse gas emissions to address global climate

 3   change, and it looked to the factors that this Court

 4   laid out in Brown and Williamson.                The statute as a

 5   whole is specific legislation addressing global climate

 6   change, and it concluded that the agency had not

 7   authorized it to embark on that regulatory --

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:           You concede that it's an

 9   air pollutant that affects health?

10                MR. GARRE:      No.       The agency -- what the

11   agency found, Your Honor, was that because global

12   climate change is not air pollution within the meaning

13   of the statute -- which is to say that Congress did not

14   authorize it to regulate it as air pollution.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Then why isn't it air

16   pollution within the meaning of the statute, although

17   whatever it is that causes acid rain is?

18                MR. GARRE:      I think, Your Honor, that the

19   key to the agency was that Congress did not give it

20   regulatory authority over this.              And I think on the

21   question of whether or not greenhouse gas emissions

22   qualify --

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:           But you can't give me any

24   text in this statute itself.            It isn't the phrase "air

25   pollution" or any other phrase?


                                       45
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                MR. GARRE:      The agency pointed to the term

 2   "air pollution agent" in the statute, and concluded that

 3   because global climate change was not air pollution that

 4   Congress intended to address --

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:           And that gets us back to

 6   acid rain.

 7                MR. GARRE:      And with respect to acid rain,

 8   it's a good example insofar as Congress has enacted a

 9   whole separate title of the Clean Air Act to address

10   acid rain.

11                The other thing I want to mention on the

12   interpretive question is, in the Brown and Williamson

13   case, this Court assumed at the outset of its analysis

14   that nicotine would be within the general terms of the

15   definition of drug in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act,

16   and that cigarettes would fall within the general term

17   of drug --

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:           So that's the position

19   you're taking, that it is within the general term?

20                MR. GARRE:      I think it's largely the

21   position that the agency took, Your Honor, insofar as it

22   reasoned that, look, we've looked at everything.                 We

23   conclude that Congress doesn't intend us to regulate

24   global climate change as air pollution.                 And so

25   therefore, we're not going to say that greenhouse gases


                                       46

 1   are air pollution agents.

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Which is why there's a

 3   significant difference between the agency saying that

 4   for 60 years, and I think this Court stressed that in

 5   its opinion, and Congress reacting to that, what the

 6   agency's position was.       And here where it's a newly

 7   minted position, because the agency's position not too

 8   long ago was that they did have the authority.

 9               MR. GARRE:       Well, Justice Ginsburg, it was

10   30 years before the agency reached the conclusion in

11   1998 that carbon dioxide was an air pollutant.                    And

12   again, even when it reached that conclusion, it made

13   clear that it didn't think that the agency would

14   exercise its authority to regulate it.

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That's a different

16   question.   I'm just focusing on, did it have authority

17   to deal with this issue?

18               MR. GARRE:       And I think -- I mean, I grant

19   you that there are differences between Brown and

20   Williamson and this case, but the fundamental conclusion

21   that the agency reached is the same.                    Which was, to

22   borrow the phrase from the Whitman case, Congress did

23   not intend to hide elephants in mouse holes.                    Here we

24   are talking about an issue of the magnitude of

25   regulating global climate change and greenhouse gas

 1   emissions, which are fundamentally an important part of

 2   the nation's economy.       Nearly 85 percent of the economy

 3   is a direct or indirect source of greenhouse gas

 4   emissions.

 5                 And when we look at when Congress did

 6   mention carbon dioxide in the statute, which is in the

 7   1990 amendments, Section 103(g), that was the first time

 8   that Congress mentioned CO2.             And when it did that, it

 9   went out of its way to say that it was giving

10   non-regulatory authority to the agency, and moreover,

11   that nothing in this section shall provide any basis for

12   any air pollution control requirements.                  That's a

13   strange thing for Congress to say if it believed that

14   the agency already had this far-reaching authority to

15   regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

16                 There are other aspects of the statute that

17   we think lead to the same conclusion in Brown &

18   Williamson.    There's a fundamental inconsistency, the

19   agency concluded, between attempting to regulate

20   greenhouse gas emissions under the national air ambient

21   quality system, and that inconsistency is similar to the

22   inconsistency that the Court pointed out in the Brown

23   and Williamson case.

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I'd like you to address

25   that.   You said there was a lot of legislation in

 1   Congress that would have been pretty inconsistent with

 2   serious regulation by the FDA.                And in this case, I

 3   don't think Congress is opposing the notion.                I don't

 4   know anybody there who's in favor of global warming.

 5   And it seems to me they haven't passed laws that is

 6   actually, that would be significantly interfered with by

 7   the EPA trying to do its best to deal with this problem.

 8   Or am I wrong?

 9                 MR. GARRE:       I think you're wrong in the

10   following respect, Your Honor.

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:            What articles would be --

12                 MR. GARRE:       Congress has passed at least six

13   separate statutes to specifically address the issue of

14   global warming, and all of them share two common

15   features.     One, we want you to research this issue and

16   learn more about it.        And two, we want you to work on an

17   international framework for addressing global climate

18   change.     The agency reasonably concluded that unilateral

19   U.S. regulation of greenhouse gases --

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Is there anything in the

21   statute that prevents them from consulting with other

22   nations or prevents the government from doing that when

23   they determine how best to work out whatever standards

24   or other forms of regulation they want?

25                 MR. GARRE:       There's nothing in the Clean Air

 1   Act, if that's the stature you're referring to, but I --

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I presume the problem that

 3   they have in mind is that we have nothing to give in

 4   international negotiations.            If we have done everything

 5   we can to reduce CO2, you know, what deal do we make

 6   with foreign nations?      What incentive do they have to go

 7   along with us?

 8               MR. GARRE:       That's right, Your Honor.       We've

 9   got a unique collective action problem, and yet, the

10   reaction experience of the agency in dealing with the

11   issue of stratospheric ozone depletion rate had

12   precisely that situation, where the U.S. initially took

13   steps.   The stratospheric ozone depletion worsened, and

14   it was only after international agreement was reached in

15   the Montreal Protocol that a global solution to the

16   problem was reached.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:            Do you think they have a

18   good reason, yes or no?        Because I'm not an expert in

19   foreign affairs.   The EPA probably is more than I am.

20   But do you think that if they do rest their decision on

21   their analysis of foreign affairs, that that is a proper

22   basis for an agency like the EPA to refuse to regulate?

23               MR. GARRE:       I think it's a proper basis

24   within its inherent discretion, Your Honor, for at least

25   two reasons.   One, the agency is a part of the executive


                                       50

 1   branch and it had unique experience with the issue of

 2   stratospheric ozone depletion.              And two, Congress has

 3   made clear, for example in the Global Climate Protection

 4   Act of 1987, that the EPA has a role in at least

 5   reporting to Congress on international cooperation and

 6   efforts in that realm.

 7              JUSTICE SOUTER:             But Congress has not

 8   directed, don't regulate domestically for purposes of

 9   global warming.

10              MR. GARRE:        That's true, Your Honor, but --

11              JUSTICE SOUTER:             The problem that I have

12   with your reference to this very -- these various pieces

13   of legislation that suggest that Congress has a

14   different modus operandi in mind is that Congress

15   certainly is aware that EPA has authority over

16   pollutants, and it has never interfered with it.

17              MR. GARRE:        Well, Your Honor, again, I think

18   in looking at all the sources the agency looked to, the

19   conclusion is, that the agency responsibly and prudently

20   reached, is that Congress has not authorized it to

21   embark on this regulatory endeavor.                     And I think the

22   closest statute that comes to --

23              JUSTICE SOUTER:             But isn't that a

24   misstatement?   Isn't the conclusion that they're trying

25   to draw that Congress doesn't want them to exercise the


                                       51

 1   authority they have for this purpose?                    And isn't that

 2   something quite different?           And doesn't that raise the

 3   question whether that is a legitimate concern for them

 4   under the statute that does give them the authority?

 5                 MR. GARRE:      May I answer the question?              No,

 6   Your Honor.    I think the agency's conclusion was

 7   Congress had not authorized it to undertake the

 8   regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to address global

 9   climate change and that, even if it had, that authority

10   should not be exercised.

11                 Thank you very much.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

15            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. MILKEY

16                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Mr. Milkey, do you want us

18   to send this case back to the EPA to ask them whether if

19   only the last two pages of their opinion were given as a

20   reason that would suffice?           Would that make you happy?

21                 MR. MILKEY:       It would not make us happy,

22   Your Honor.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I didn't think so.

24                 (Laughter.)

25                 MR. MILKEY:       Your Honor, if I can address

 1   the global aspect of the problem, the fact that the

 2   solution to the whole problem --

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:           What is your answer to

 4   Justice Scalia?   Because I thought you said before that

 5   you thought it was appropriate for us to send this case

 6   back so that they could redetermine in light of proper

 7   considerations whether they wanted to exercise their

 8   authority.

 9                MR. MILKEY:       That is exactly --

10                JUSTICE BREYER:           Am I wrong about that?

11                MR. MILKEY:       Your Honor, that is exactly

12   what we want.   I understood Justice Scalia to be saying

13   --

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:           That's what I was asking,

15   yes.   And you think it will go back to them and they

16   will say, oh my goodness, the scientific uncertainty is

17   not enough by itself?      You really expect that to happen?

18                MR. MILKEY:       Respectfully, Your Honor, I

19   think EPA will have a hard time saying that there is

20   insufficient -- I mean, too much scientific uncertainty.

21   The very sentence --

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:           They said it already.

23                MR. MILKEY:       No, Your Honor.

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:           The only question is

25   whether that alone is enough.

 1              MR. MILKEY:          Respectfully, Your Honor, they

 2   did not say that.    They did not anywhere say why the

 3   existing uncertainty mattered.               To the contrary, they

 4   emphasized the need to act in the face of current

 5   uncertainty, but never explained why that principle

 6   applies to a nonregulatory approach but not to a

 7   regulatory one.

 8              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   What they said was

 9   until more is understood about causes, extent and

10   significance of climate change and the potential options

11   for addressing it, we believe it's inappropriate to

12   regulate these emissions.

13              MR. MILKEY:          Your Honor.

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   That strikes me as

15   saying they think there is too much uncertainty for them

16   to act.

17              MR. MILKEY:          Your Honor, they did not say

18   there is too much uncertainty for them to form a

19   judgment, which is the key issue.                 They said they

20   preferred more certainty, but because of the nature of

21   the endangerment standard, which emphasizes the

22   important of regulating in the face of uncertainty, they

23   have to at least explain why the uncertainty matters.

24   And that is -- what they did here is particularly

25   troubling in the fact that they ignored all of the


                                        54

 1   indications pointing toward endangerment.               They looked

 2   at what we don't know without ever looking at what we do

 3   know.

 4              JUSTICE ALITO:          If the EPA concludes that

 5   regulating an air pollutant would endanger public health

 6   and welfare, can it decline to regulate?

 7              MR. MILKEY:        Not under section 202, Your

 8   Honor.

 9              JUSTICE ALITO:          It has to regulate even if

10   it concludes that regulation would make things worse?

11              MR. MILKEY:        Would make things worse?

12              JUSTICE ALITO:          Yes.

13              MR. MILKEY:        I'm sorry, I didn't understand

14   that.

15              No.

16              MR. MILKEY:        No, Your Honor.          If they

17   thought there would be more endangerment that way they

18   would not have to regulate.

19              JUSTICE ALITO:          Then why can't they -- what

20   is wrong with their view that for the United States to

21   proceed unilaterally would make things worse and

22   therefore they're going to decline to regular for that

23   reason?

24              MR. MILKEY:        Your Honor, first of all, I

25   don't believe they actually said that, and there is

 1   nothing in the statute that even hints that they can

 2   take foreign policy considerations into account.                To the

 3   contrary, the statute is very specific in other sections

 4   about when they're supposed to look at foreign emissions

 5   --

 6              JUSTICE ALITO:          Isn't the definition of

 7   public welfare extremely broad?

 8              MR. MILKEY:        Your Honor, it is certainly

 9   extremely broad, and it does include climate.

10              Thank you, Your Honor.
