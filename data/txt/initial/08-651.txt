 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              We will hear

 7                ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. KINNAIRD

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                  MR. KINNAIRD:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                  The Kentucky Supreme Court announced a

12   categorical rule so restrictive of the Sixth Amendment

13   that the United States Government disavows it.                    The

14   court held that the Sixth Amendment never provides a

15   remedy to a defendant who pleads guilty to a crime on

16   the false advice of his attorney that he would not be

17   deported as a result.

18                  The narrowest ground on which this Court may

19   reverse the Kentucky Supreme Court is to hold that

20   misadvice claims are cognizable under the Sixth

21   Amendment.

22                  Any advice that a lawyer actually gives to a

23   defendant on whether to plead guilty is advice affecting

24   criminal liability.     Such advice must meet Sixth

25   Amendment competency standards.

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, other advice

 2   -- for example, advice about whether to take the stand

 3   --that can have significant collateral consequences ­

 4   you know, he might lose his job or lose government

 5   contracts based on what he says, is that the sort of

 6   advice that would be covered in -- under your position?

 7               MR. KINNAIRD:      I think, for misadvice, the

 8   test would be whether it's a material misrepresentation

 9   that would be material to a reasonable defendant in

10   deciding whether to plead guilty, so it would --

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Only plead guilty?

12   Not, for example, whether it would be material to the

13   defendant in deciding whether or not to take the stand?

14               MR. KINNAIRD:      I think to plead guilty is

15   the key strategic decision that is in the -- in the

16   client's sole duty and prerogative, to make that

17   decision.

18               JUSTICE ALITO:         Why would it be limited to a

19   decision to plead guilty?      What if a decision to plead

20   guilty would have lesser immigration consequences than a

21   guilty verdict after -- after going to trial?              Wouldn't

22   you have the same situation there?

23               MR. KINNAIRD:      I'm not aware of any

24   consequences that would depend on whether the conviction

25   was based on a guilty plea or trial.

 1                JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, what if -- what if an

 2   offer is made for a plea to an offense that would have

 3   lesser immigration consequences than the offense for

 4   which the person might be convicted if the person goes

 5   to trial?

 6                MR. KINNAIRD:      Well, that would be

 7   subject --

 8                JUSTICE ALITO:         And the -- and the attorney

 9   doesn't fully apprise the client of the situation?

10                MR. KINNAIRD:      And he goes to trial?

11                JUSTICE ALITO:         Right.

12                MR. KINNAIRD:      I think that -- that would

13   only be a Strickland claim if this Court were prepared

14   to rule that going to trial is ever prejudice under

15   Strickland, and there is a circuit split on that.

16                But the concern of the Sixth Amendment --

17                JUSTICE ALITO:         But do you see a difference

18   in principle between the two situations with respect to

19   the issue that is before us here?

20                MR. KINNAIRD:      I'm not sure that there would

21   be.   Provided the Court would recognize that as

22   prejudice, I think they would all be under Strickland

23   claims.

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          How do you decide which

25   of the many consequences your rule would cover?           I mean,

 1   you are now talking about a narrow ground, misadvice.

 2   But you are also urging that when the lawyer is

 3   silent on a matter that he should inform the defendant,

 4   that, too, is covered.

 5               But whichever way you do it, how do you --

 6   you say certainly deportation is a consequence that the

 7   defendant should be told about.

 8               What about -- how do you distinguish that

 9   from, say, you'll lose your driver's license, you'll

10   lose your right to vote?     How do we distinguish the

11   consequences that count and those that don't?

12               MR. KINNAIRD:      Your Honor, the issue here is

13   simply the legal standard that applies to any -- any

14   of these claims, and it would be the same two-part

15   standard under Strickland v. Washington.        So there --

16   there is no need to draw lines.

17               If this Court is troubled by a broad rule

18   and is inclined not to issue a general rule, it may

19   simply recognize deportation as among the few collateral

20   consequences that is so severe and so material in a high

21   number of cases in which it applies that the Strickland

22   claim should be allowed to go forward.

23               And it can leave for another day whether

24   there are other consequences that are too burdensome for

25   the system to recognize.

 1                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, we can't leave that

 2   for another day.     I mean, we -- we have to decide

 3   whether we are opening a Pandora's box here, whether

 4   there is any sensible way to restrict it to -- to

 5   deportation.

 6                  What about advice on whether pleading guilty

 7   would -- would cause him to lose custody of his

 8   children?     That's -- that's pretty serious.

 9                  What if pleading guilty will -- will affect

10   whether he can keep his truck, which is his main means

11   of livelihood, or whether -- whether it would be seized

12   by the government as the instrument of his crime?

13                  There are so many pieces of advice which

14   involve legal issues that -- that counsel can provide

15   advice on.

16                  MR. KINNAIRD:      Your Honor, I think that is

17   precisely why we have the contextual inquiry of

18   Strickland.     And, certainly, parental termination may in

19   a given case be so severe a consequence --

20                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Sure.

21                  MR. KINNAIRD:      -- that it would be

22   material.

23                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Sure.

24                  MR. KINNAIRD:      But that -- most of these

25   failure to advise claims will be very difficult to plead

 1   and to prove --

 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            If we were in -- if we

 3   were in the contract, civil contract situation, and

 4   there's a mistake, the usual rule -- Restatement of

 5   Contracts -- is that the -- the question is whether or

 6   not it's reasonable to have the party who made the

 7   mistake bear the risk.

 8               Suppose we just had an instruction, Rule 11

 9   -- I recognize this is a State case -- but we had a Rule

10   11 instruction, which said the only thing the court is

11   going to inquire about and the only thing that was of

12   relevance to your plea are criminal consequences.

13               You take the risk of any misadvice, any

14   misunderstanding, with respect to collateral conduct.

15   That's your risk, and it's part of the guilty plea.              If

16   we said that, would that foreclose this kind of argument

17   in your case?

18               MR. KINNAIRD:       No, Your Honor, because the

19   Sixth Amendment is a source of independent rights, and

20   the question is:   What is the -- the lawyer's duty as

21   distinct from the court?      And the lawyer has the

22   distinct duty to assess the advantages and disadvantages

23   of the plea --

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, then there's no way

25   the government or the court can protect itself against


                                     8

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   the -- these consequences, and there are any number of

 2   them.   Suppose he doesn't advise that there's going to

 3   be civil liability in tort once he pleads guilty,

 4   because then that's a fact that's concluded and it's

 5   just a question of damages.          And as Justice Scalia

 6   indicated, there are many, many instances.

 7               I just see no way for the courts to protect

 8   themselves against -- against this.               And -- and if the

 9   client, or the accused, is told that he accepts these

10   risks, he can say, well, you know, there may be some

11   risks I don't know about, I'll go to trial.               He just

12   accepts the risks.

13               MR. KINNAIRD:        That may be true for a due

14   process claim, Your Honor, but the lawyer still has an

15   obligation to competently represent him, competently

16   assess the legal risks, and advise the client.               Those

17   are fundamental to lawyering.            And Strickland --

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But even -- even if we

19   accept that, wouldn't a competent counsel, after telling

20   him the deportation consequences, then say:               But this is

21   a case where the evidence is so strong against you, I

22   advise you to take the plea rather than go to trial.                  If

23   you go to trial, you are likely to lose and you will get

24   a longer sentence.    So does it matter in the end if

25   competent counsel would have said, this is a good plea,

 1   take it?

 2               MR. KINNAIRD:      Yes, it certainly matters,

 3   because that goes to the question of prejudice at an

 4   evidentiary hearing.   The prejudice standard is

 5   subjective in the sense that it must account for the

 6   subjective risk preferences of the defendant as between

 7   incarceration and deportation.         But at an evidentiary

 8   hearing the defendant must be able to prove that he has

 9   a triable case, that a rational jury could find beyond a

10   reasonable doubt -- or could find reasonable doubt,

11   rather, as to at least one element of -- of the offense.

12               JUSTICE ALITO:       Your argument has -- has an

13   appeal because removal is such a harsh consequence,

14   particularly for someone like your client who had been

15   in the United States for a long time.           But what troubles

16   me about it is the situation in which the defendant

17   claims -- you know, let's say 5 years after entering a

18   guilty plea or after the passage of some time ­ that

19   misadvice was given, and the -- the attorney on the

20   other side is a busy public defender who by that time

21   has handled 500 cases and is unable to remember what, if

22   anything, was said about the immigration consequences of

23   the case; there is nothing in the file.           I mean, how are

24   those cases going to be handled?

25               MR. KINNAIRD:      Well, I think that, Your

 1   Honor, that's no different than any Strickland claim

 2   that would be brought in the same time frame.           And there

 3   are -- remember that ineffective assistance claims are

 4   almost always brought as collateral attacks, and there

 5   are many Federal and State strictures on bringing those

 6   claims, including time limits.           So I don't think there's

 7   anything categorically different from the ordinary

 8   Strickland claim in your case.

 9                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, isn't there -- isn't

10   it different in that the ordinary Strickland claim

11   concerns things that happen at trial and relate to

12   strategy in a criminal case, as to which the public

13   defender or other defense attorney is presumably ­- has

14   expertise?    But what's -- what's the answer to this

15   question:    The defendant takes the stand and says:        My

16   attorney said that, don't worry about it, you are not

17   going to get removed.      And the lawyer says: Well, here's

18   my file; I have nothing in this whatsoever about having

19   said anything about removal, and I can't remember the

20   particulars of every single conversation I had with this

21   attorney 5 -- with this client, 5 years ago.

22                 MR. KINNAIRD:      Your Honor, I think witness

23   recollection arises in any number of Strickland claims.

24   And certainly I think that the courts can resolve that

25   as to whether they found -- find that he proved by a

 1   preponderance of the evidence that -- that that

 2   statement was made.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, I suppose

 4   -- before a guilty plea is accepted, the district court

 5   judge is obligated to go through a colloquy to make sure

 6   the defendant knows the consequences of accepting the

 7   plea.   I would suppose if you prevail that that colloquy

 8   would have to be expanded to include something like:                    Do

 9   you understand the deportation consequences, if any, of

10   pleading guilty?

11                MR. KINNAIRD:        No, Your Honor, it would not.

12   The -- that's a due process inquiry that is implemented

13   by Rule 11 in the Federal courts.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:          But that's -- that's --

15   with due respect, that's ridiculous.                 If it's important

16   enough to be required to be told to the defendant by his

17   counsel, surely it's important enough to be advised to

18   the defendant by the court before the guilty plea is

19   accepted as -- as voluntary, which includes knowing ­-

20   knowing the consequences.         It's a very strange line you

21   draw between what we are going to hold counsel to and

22   what we are going to require the defendant to be advised

23   of by the court.

24                MR. KINNAIRD:        I don't think that's true,

25   Your Honor, and the reason is that there are all manner

 1   of strategic types of advice that counsel give that are

 2   no province of the district court.

 3                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, do you think it

 4   would be wrong for a district court to say, now, I want

 5   to be very careful, and I'm going to add -- let's take

 6   Rule 11 as the standard.        It's a Federal case.        I'm

 7   going to add to Rule 11.        I'm going to say, in addition

 8   to the Rule 11 questions that you've all answered, I

 9   want to make sure:     Have you been advised about

10   immigration?     Have you been advised about other

11   collateral consequences?

12                  Do you think that would be error for the ­-

13   or inappropriate for a district judge to do?

14                  MR. KINNAIRD:      It would not.       It would be --

15   it would probably be a salutary practice, and in about

16   half the States, there is --

17                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           The -- the judge would not

18   be exceeding his -- his commission, his authority, to

19   determine just whether this is knowing and voluntary in

20   the sense of knowing -- knowing the criminal

21   consequences of -- I mean, in the criminal system

22   itself?

23                  MR. KINNAIRD:      No, Your Honor.       My only

24   point is it would not be required under Rule 11 or

25   required under the Due Process Clause.

 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But it seems to me a

 2   careful district judge would have to do this if you

 3   prevail.

 4                MR. KINNAIRD:        It -- it would be a

 5   beneficial practice, but if the attorneys live up to

 6   their obligations to properly apprise the clients, then

 7   that is unnecessary, because the Brady voluntariness

 8   standard is predicated on an assumption that the

 9   defendant has been competently advised by his counsel.

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You were about to say

11   that in many States the trial judge does inform a

12   defendant who is an alien of immigration consequences.

13                MR. KINNAIRD:        It's -- it's a much more

14   limited advisement.     What they tend to advise is that

15   you may be subject to immigration consequences.                 But

16   they don't actually make any determination.                 And, again,

17   that goes to the difference between the function of the

18   counsel and a court.      The court is not aware of the

19   defendant's circumstances.          It does no investigation of

20   the case.   Counsel does, and counsel is the only one

21   that actually advises you whether to accept the plea or

22   not.   And that's the key distinction between a court --

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, but that's -- I

24   don't see why that doesn't apply to the more fundamental

25   question about whether the district court has to inquire


                                      14

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   into the plea circumstances in any event.                I thought --

 2   your answer to Justice Scalia that, oh, well, all sorts

 3   of things can come up at trial and the district judge

 4   doesn't have to inquire into those, I think proves too

 5   much.    It goes to -- and it departs from your focus on

 6   the guilty plea.    That's all the judge is inquiring

 7   about.   And I don't know why that obligation doesn't

 8   extend to a fundamental piece of information that

 9   would -- that would, under your theory, make acceptance

10   of the plea involuntary.

11                MR. KINNAIRD:       Your Honor, I am not

12   departing from the focus on the guilty plea.                The

13   distinction is that the counsel has a duty to recommend

14   whether the defendant accepts the plea or not.                And he

15   cannot do that by simply focusing on -- in isolation, on

16   the criminal consequences.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, but what

18   you're saying is he has got to tell him all the stuff

19   that's necessary to make the decision to accept the plea

20   knowing and intelligent, voluntary.               And I thought that

21   was pretty much what the district court was doing when

22   they have the colloquy.       That district judge wants to

23   make sure the defendant knows what he is agreeing to.

24                MR. KINNAIRD:       No, Your Honor.          I think that

25   the -- the touchstone for the attorney's advice is


                                     15

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   whether it's in the interests of the client.             And his

 2   duty is to inform the client -- and this is true of all

 3   lawyering -- to inform the client of the legal risks of

 4   the recommended course of action.             And if the law

 5   happens to attach the most dramatic and severe

 6   consequences under a civil law, but to attach them to a

 7   conviction, then -- and that consequence can only be

 8   averted in the criminal prosecution, I believe it is the

 9   duty of the criminal lawyer to advise.             But at a --

10                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        I would think that the duty

11   of the criminal lawyer is to make sure that the

12   defendant's guilty plea is informed, it is an informed

13   guilty plea.     That is the same obligation of the court

14   in the colloquy, to be sure that it's an informed plea.

15   And if you say it's uninformed for counsel not to go

16   into the myriad collateral consequences, then I assume

17   it's -- it's improper for the court not to go into those

18   consequences.     They both pertain to whether the guilty

19   plea is informed.     That's counsel's responsibility.

20                  MR. KINNAIRD:      Your Honor, I believe that

21   counsel's responsibility is to ensure that he makes an

22   informed strategic decision whether to plead guilty.

23   That is no business of the court's, and I think that is

24   the distinction.

25                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well --

 1                JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask this question:

 2   What do you think -- if there is deficient advice by

 3   counsel under Strickland, what do you think you have to

 4   prove in order to get relief under Strickland?

 5                MR. KINNAIRD:      For a misadvice claim?

 6                JUSTICE STEVENS:           No, assume that advice is

 7   inadequate -- to prove prejudice.

 8                MR. KINNAIRD:      First of all, what you would

 9   have to prove on the competency prong is that the

10   misadvice was about an issue that was material to the

11   strategic decision to plead guilty.

12                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Right.

13                MR. KINNAIRD:      At the prejudice prong, you

14   would you have to prove that this defendant -- and this

15   is at the evidentiary hearing -- would have gone to

16   trial.   And in order to prove that, you have to show

17   that a rational jury could have found beyond a -- could

18   have found reasonable doubt as to at least one element

19   of the offense.

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           And that would be what in

21   this case?

22                MR. KINNAIRD:      In this case, it would be

23   knowledge.   And Kentucky has a special rule that does

24   not permit willful blindness.            You have to show actual

25   knowledge that it was marijuana in his truck.            And here

 1   you have a commercial truck driver who was found with

 2   Styrofoam boxes and wrapped brown cardboard boxes.

 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Oh, and also drug

 4   paraphernalia in the cab.           And I -- was there some

 5   marijuana in the cab, too?

 6                  MR. KINNAIRD:        There was, yes, Your Honor.

 7                  The --

 8                  JUSTICE SCALIA:          I thought -- I thought he

 9   was asked what was in the -- what was in the containers

10   and he said marijuana.

11                  MR. KINNAIRD:        No, Your Honor.          What the

12   officer testified -- and a key caveat here is that all

13   we have is the prosecution's charging facts and the

14   officer's testimony from a suppression hearing.                   We

15   don't have the full record.             We don't have the defense

16   case.     We don't have the defense version of events.                   But

17   what he testified was he was at -- the officer said,

18   when Mr. Padilla was asked what was in the boxes, he

19   shrugged his shoulders and he said, "Maybe drugs." And

20   that --

21                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So you -- but your

22   point is an important one.            We don't have the defense

23   case.

24                  MR. KINNAIRD:        Exactly.

 1   the prosecution case either.            You don't know exactly

 2   what witnesses they are going to call, what the strength

 3   of it is.   So you don't know whether there is going to

 4   be prejudice or not.     When you see -- it seems to me you

 5   have to make quite a prediction about what the case is

 6   going to look like to decide if there's prejudice, to

 7   decide if the fellow is going to take the plea or not.

 8   And I'm just wondering how you do that.

 9               MR. KINNAIRD:       Well, Your Honor, I think in

10   these kinds of claims prejudice is generally going to

11   require an evidentiary hearing.           And that's why the

12   Kentucky Court of Appeals sent this back for an

13   evidentiary hearing.     But this --

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               It's -- it's going

15   to require, I guess, kind of a mini-trial to decide if

16   the person would have taken the plea.              You've got to

17   know what the case -- his case looked like, what the

18   prosecutor's case looked like, to see if it's something

19   he would have made -- it would have made sense for him

20   to go to trial or not.

21               MR. KINNAIRD:       I don't think it would

22   necessarily require a mini-trial, but that would be in

23   the trial court's discretion.

24               I would like to point out, though, that this

25   was not an issue raised to the State supreme court.                And

16   and may it please the Court:

17                  There is a fundamental difference between

18   Petitioner's claim that defense counsel has a duty to

19   advise his client about all of the myriad collateral

20   consequences that may stem from a criminal conviction,

21   which the government does not think that a defense

22   counsel has under the Sixth Amendment, and the claim

23   that is focused more precisely on misadvice given by

24   defense counsel on a material collateral consequence to

25   a defendant.

 1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Mr. Dreeben, we

 2   learn in the first year of law school that the line

 3   between an affirmative act and failure to act is a

 4   difficult one to draw.        What if the lawyer says, you're

 5   going to face 5 years, and the defendant says, is that

 6   all that's going to happen to me?              And the lawyer says

 7   yes.   Is that a failure to advise or is that an

 8   affirmative misrepresentation?

 9                  MR. DREEBEN:     Well, I think it's certainly

10   not an affirmative misrepresentation.                In context, what

11   the defense lawyer's purpose is, is to counter the

12   government's criminal case.           That's what the Sixth

13   Amendment provides a lawyer to do.                 The government

14   appears through its expert adversary.                The Sixth

15   Amendment provides a counterweight to that in the form

16   of a lawyer to deal with the criminal aspects of

17   the case.

18                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, then you are saying

19   that the more the defense counsel strays from his only

20   professional responsibility, the more at risk the

21   government is.     That seems odd.

22                  MR. DREEBEN:     What we think, Justice

23   Kennedy, is that the defense lawyer has two relevant

24   duties here:     One is to counter the government's case,

25   which means to provide advice to the defendant about his


                                      21

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   rights, the nature of the charges, the evidence, and the

 2   affirmative defenses that may exist.                And that is a task

 3   that is somewhat broader than the court has in

 4   conducting a Rule 11 colloquy.           The court does not go

 5   into strategic matters in a criminal case with the

 6   defendant.    Defense counsel must.

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I think when we --

 8   when we decide there's no right to counsel, like on

 9   collateral review, we don't even look at what happened,

10   right?    We don't look and see whether the advice was

11   ineffective, how bad the lawyer was.                The idea is if you

12   don't have the right at all, you don't have the right to

13   an effective lawyer.

14                 MR. DREEBEN:      That's right.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Is that right?

16   Okay.    Well, these -- when you are talking about

17   collateral consequences, you don't have a right to

18   counsel on -- with respect to those collateral

19   consequences.    I assume there's -- maybe there is -- is

20   there a right to counsel when you are facing a

21   deportation proceeding?

22                 MR. DREEBEN:      Certainly not by virtue --

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Okay.

24                 MR. DREEBEN:      -- of the Sixth Amendment,

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, then, if there

 2   is no right to counsel, why do we get into whether there

 3   is an affirmative misrepresentation or not?

 4               MR. DREEBEN:        Because --

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Just like in a

 6   collateral -- habeas context, we don't care whether

 7   there's an affirmative misreputation ­-

 8   misrepresentation, because there's no right to counsel

 9   in the first place.

10               MR. DREEBEN:        I think it's because the

11   lawyer has an additional duty in the context of advising

12   his client whether to take a guilty plea, and that is

13   the duty to respect that the decision whether to plead

14   guilty belongs to the defendant personally.                 It's not a

15   decision that can be exercised by proxy by the lawyer.

16   And the lawyer's duty to respect that, whatever advice

17   he gives, the defendant must be able to make his own

18   personal decision, imposes a concomitant duty not to

19   interfere with or undermine the defendant's ability to

20   make an intelligent decision with the information he

21   has.

22               So if a lawyer chooses, when asked about

23   collateral consequences, as many aliens will do ­- will

24   I get deported? -- the lawyer is perfectly free to say:

25   I am not your immigration counsel.                 You need a lawyer to


                                      23

 1   advise you about immigration.            I am your criminal

 2   lawyer.

 3               And that's perfectly fine.                But if a lawyer

 4   goes beyond that and says, don't worry about it; you've

 5   been in the country so long; you are not going to get

 6   deported -- with the understanding and the backdrop

 7   that this is an important factor in whether this

 8   defendant is going to decide to take a guilty plea or to

 9   go to trial -- then the lawyer has used his professional

10   skills to undermine a personal decision that belongs to

11   the defendant alone.

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:          What -- what about

13   misadvice as to whether he will lose custody of his

14   children, or misadvice as to whether his -- his truck

15   which he owns will be confiscated by the government?

16               MR. DREEBEN:       I would put them, Justice

17   Scalia, all in the same general basket, which is to say,

18   misadvice on a legal matter of importance to the

19   defendant that could skew his decision to plead guilty

20   may be deficient representation under Strickland.                I

21   think what was --

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Not the defendant,

23   but a defendant?    In other words, I assume it's an

24   objective inquiry you would make rather than a

25   subjective one?

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              We assume, for

 4   example, that someone who is going to lose the custody

 5   of their children would regard that as important.                You

 6   don't want testimony about this guy doesn't care about

 7   the children, so it's not a big deal to him.

 8               MR. DREEBEN:     I actually think that would be

 9   quite relevant, because if any misadvice did not cause

10   the defendant to plead guilty because it was irrelevant

11   to him, then the defendant should not be able to get in

12   the door with an ineffective assistance claim.

13               And I also think if the defendant hasn't

14   manifested in some way that the particular collateral

15   consequence is important to that defendant, then the

16   lawyer certainly has no obligation even under

17   professional standards --

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Won't -- won't your

19   test result in a net loss to defendants?              I assume, if

20   this is adopted as a rule, the affirmative

21   misrepresentation rule, then every lawyer is going to

22   say what you said they should say:              I'm here for the

23   criminal case; I'm not telling you anything about

24   anything else --

25               MR. DREEBEN:     No, I don't --

 1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              -- as opposed to

 2   saying -- sitting down and saying:                 Here's what you need

 3   to know.     And in most cases we expect the lawyer to do a

 4   professional job.     If you have got an alien, he is going

 5   to tell him:     Well, what -- you know, this will cause

 6   you to be deported. Instead, every lawyer now is going

 7   to say:     I'm not giving you any advice about anything

 8   else.

 9                  MR. DREEBEN:     No, I don't think that it will

10   lead to sort of defensive malpractice type of counseling

11   where lawyers do not do the job that they feel that they

12   should do, and experience tends to support that.

13                  The rule right now in 10 Federal circuits

14   is there's no duty to advise about collateral

15   consequences.     Seven Federal circuits have a rule that

16   affirmative misadvice about collateral consequences can

17   support a claim.

18                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Why -- why do you have a

19   rule?     I mean, I thought -- I've looked up six cases,

20   and they all say, Strickland cases in this Court, that

21   you look at all the circumstances.                 Now, what I think is

22   radical on your part -- but tell me it isn't -- is not

23   what the rule is, but that you want one.

24                  I thought the government's view normally was

25   the same as we -- what's the exact words -- did the


                                      26

 1   conduct of the lawyer meet professional -- prevailing

 2   professional norms?     And then we look to see, if it did

 3   not, whether that led to a situation where he would not

 4   have pleaded guilty but for the failure.               Okay?

 5                Now, the world is filled with 42 billion

 6   circumstances.   If we agree with you, we will have set

 7   in motion the great legal rule machine.               And there's

 8   nothing better than lawyers spinning off rules.                And we

 9   will be here from now until -- good, we won't have any

10   docket problem, because what we'll be doing is reviewing

11   rule after rule after rule after rule.

12                So why has the government -- I think for the

13   first time, maybe not -- told us to abandon Strickland's

14   approach and start spinning off rules?

15                MR. DREEBEN:       Justice Breyer, we have not

16   abandoned Strickland's approach.             What we have focused

17   on is, what is the Sixth Amendment right in the first

18   place?   The Sixth Amendment right is not a right to have

19   a State-provided lawyer who will advise you about child

20   custody or about deportation or about --

21                JUSTICE BREYER:          No, no.      But it's easy -- I

22   mean, you know one thing we are very good at here is

23   making up hypotheticals.        So I imagine it wouldn't be

24   that tough for me to think of a hypothetical where

25   everyone knows this 90-year-old individual who has


                                      27

 1   actually never set foot in the country that he came

 2   from, and everyone knows that if he pleads guilty to

 3   this chewing gum offense where they have virtually no

 4   evidence, he will be sent back, at age 90, to that

 5   country.

 6               I would say any lawyer would say, be

 7   careful, because if we plead guilty, back you go, on the

 8   stretcher since you can no longer walk.          See, all I did

 9   was spin out a hypothetical.

10               And the reason I can spin those out and why

11   we have the Strickland rule is pretty clearly that you

12   shouldn't have sub-rules here because life is more

13   complicated than rules tell us.         Just look to see

14   prevailing norm and did it cause the harm.         And that's

15   why I am back to my question:          Isn't this the first time

16   the government has asked us to adopt rules under

17   Strickland rather than what it says --

18               MR. DREEBEN:     I think, Justice Breyer --

19               JUSTICE BREYER:        -- which is "case by case,"

20   underlined, italics, repeated in the cases?

21               MR. DREEBEN:     Justice Breyer, I think that

22   the fundamental point is that this is the first time

23   that the Court has been asked to adopt a rule under

24   Strickland that would require a lawyer, pursuant to

25   Sixth Amendment norms, to give advice that pertains --

 1                  JUSTICE BREYER:        No, no, they are not asking

 2   us to have a rule.     What he is saying is, look to the

 3   individual case and ask in this case, did the -- at

 4   least that's what I heard him; he's in charge of his own

 5   case.   But I heard him say, look to this case, and in

 6   this case, it falls below prevailing norms for a lot of

 7   reasons.

 8                  MR. DREEBEN:     Well, Justice Breyer, the --

 9   the lower courts that have looked at this I think have

10   correctly recognized that there's a distinction between

11   saying that Strickland is a case-by-case inquiry into

12   lawyer competence and saying that Strickland requires

13   the lawyer to provide advice about collateral

14   consequences that are not the criminal case --

15                  JUSTICE ALITO:       But what are you going to do

16   in the situation where the defendant is concerned about

17   removal -- the removal consequences?               And this is --

18   let's say this is a case out in some rural jurisdiction,

19   you have got a public defender or a retained attorney,

20   and the -- the attorney is -- you know, provides

21   advice based on the criminal law consequences and the

22   client says:     Well, I'm also concerned about the

23   immigration consequences.         And the lawyer says:        Well,

24   immigration law is very complicated, and I'm not an

25   expert on this and I'm not going to tell you.               And so


                                      29

 1   the client says -- and the lawyer says:              If you want to

 2   know about that you've got to get a deportation ­-

 3   you've got to get an immigration lawyer.              And the alien

 4   defendant says:    Well, I have no money; that's why you

 5   were appointed to represent me.            How am I going to get

 6   advice on the immigration law issue?              And the lawyer

 7   says:   Well, that's just too bad for you.

 8                 And that's the line you want us to draw?

 9                 MR. DREEBEN:     Well, Justice Alito, I don't

10   think that he has a right under the Sixth Amendment to a

11   lawyer who will counsel him about the potential

12   immigration consequences of a guilty plea.             That's not

13   what the Sixth Amendment was designed for.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        What are the consequences

15   to the lawyer?    I mean, let's assume you are a public

16   defender, and you are confronted with this situation.

17   Is it -- how -- how much skin is it off your teeth if

18   you provide the advice, even though you are uncertain,

19   and the advice turns out to be wrong?             What happens to

20   the lawyer?

21                 MR. DREEBEN:     I don't know that anything

22   happens to the lawyer, Justice Scalia.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        So, what incentive is there

24   to withhold uncertain advice?            Is there any incentive at

25   all?

 1                MR. DREEBEN:      Well, I think that --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:         I mean, the worst that can

 3   happen is your client will get off.

 4                MR. DREEBEN:      There's the professional --

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:         He'll make a guilty plea,

 6   and afterwards it will be set aside.

 7                MR. DREEBEN:      There is a professional

 8   incentive to provide advice where you are competent to

 9   provide advice and not to provide it where you are not

10   competent.   And I think that the focus on immigration

11   consequences illustrates two things:

12                One is this is an extraordinarily

13   complicated area of the law, where it is very difficult

14   to give advice.    And for a lawyer to be expected to

15   master not only the criminal aspects of the case but

16   also the immigration aspects of the case will only tend

17   to divert attention from what the lawyer is really there

18   to do, advise --

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, why shouldn't we

20   just adopt an amendment to Rule 11 in which the judge

21   says, any collateral consequences with respect to your

22   plea are not the concern of this court and will not be

23   grounds for setting aside this -- this plea?

24                MR. DREEBEN:      Well, the former part is

25   certainly something that the Court could in its


                                     31

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   rulemaking capacity do.        The latter part is a Sixth

 2   Amendment question.     And I think it's highly notable

 3   that the rules committee for the criminal rules has

 4   twice considered whether to amend Rule 11, and is going

 5   to consider it again contemporaneously with this case,

 6   to require the judge to say to an alien defendant, you

 7   may want to take into account removal consequences of a

 8   criminal conviction.

 9               In other words, there are rule-based ways to

10   address some of the concerns that Justice Alito raised

11   without constitutionalizing a new area of collateral

12   consequences that would impose new duties that actually

13   would divert the lawyer from his criminal law function,

14   whereas the misadvice line has not created those

15   problems.

16               And as I started to say earlier, the fact

17   that 10 Federal circuits have said no duty to advise on

18   collateral consequences, while 7 have recognized that

19   misadvice on collateral consequences can provide

20   relief, has not led to a series of difficult Strickland

21   hearings that are unmanageable.            Justice Alito --

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 How do we know that?

23               JUSTICE ALITO:          What about the situation

24   where the attorney says nothing about -- I mean, removal

25   is -- is out there as -- as a real possibility, but it


                                      32

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   just doesn't occur to the -- the defendant, and the

 2   attorney doesn't even mention, you know, you might --

 3   you might want to think about the removal consequences

 4   of this?

 5                MR. DREEBEN:     Then the client does not get

 6   relief for two reasons:      One is because we believe

 7   there's no duty to give that advice.             But even if the

 8   Court disagreed with me on that, such a defendant could

 9   hardly show prejudice because he knew that he went into

10   his guilty plea with uncertainty, at best, about

11   removal.

12                And I think it would be very difficult to

13   show what he should have to show to establish prejudice:

14   First, that subjectively he would not have pleaded

15   guilty had he been given correct immigration advice;

16   and, second, that a reasonable defendant would have had

17   a basis not to plead guilty, because if the defendant is

18   going to be convicted after a trial in any event, the

19   same collateral consequence is going to ensue.             The

20   defendant will not evade the collateral consequences of

21   removal if the defendant was going to be convicted at a

22   trial anyway.   And perhaps --

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          How do you -- how do you

24   know that?   In this case, Mr. Kinnaird told us the

25   defendant might have preferred to go to trial because he


                                    33

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   had this defense that he didn't know what was in the

 2   packages.

 3                  MR. DREEBEN:     Well, I think courts will

 4   evaluate that kind of a claim just the way they evaluate

 5   any other Strickland claim and decide whether there was

 6   any reasonable probability that such a defense could have

 7   prevailed.

 8                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        After -- after a

 9   mini-trial, which deprives the government of -- of its

10   whole benefit from the guilty plea.                Governments accept

11   guilty pleas in order to avoid the time and expense of

12   going to -- to a trial.        And here you have to go back

13   and find out what the evidence would have been, so that

14   the court can make the decision you say is so easy.

15                  MR. DREEBEN:     This is the typical regime

16   that the Court has dictated under Strickland, and it has

17   not proved unmanageable in the courts that have adopted

18   the limited misadvice rule that the government

19   supports.

20                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you,

 1   the Court:

 2                In Hill v. Lockhart, this Court again

 3   focused on voluntariness and said that voluntariness of

 4   the plea depends on counsel's advice and whether that

 5   counsel advice is in the range of competence of the

 6   attorneys in a criminal proceeding.

 7                Again, the focus was on voluntary.            And in

 8   Brady, this Court described a voluntary plea as "a plea

 9   entered by one possessing full knowledge of direct

10   consequences."   Thus, reading the cases together, it

11   would appear that the defendant need to have only

12   knowledge -- full knowledge of direct consequences, and

13   advice of counsel is just a tool to ensure that.

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Counsel, a plea is

15   something more than "I'm guilty."             It is a strategic

16   decision not to put the government to its burden of

17   proof.   Your definition of voluntariness suggests that

18   there is only one component to it, do I know what my

19   rights are, as opposed to, do I know what they are and

20   am making an informed decision to waive those rights.

21                Your articulation of the rule leaves out the

22   second component:     Am I making an informed decision to

23   waive those rights?

24                MR. LONG:      Well, I think under this Court's

25   precedent, the informed right is to know what those


                                      35

 1   rights are, what is the weight of the evidence against

 2   you, and to make those strategic decisions.              But that --

 3                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          But how do you do that?

 4   I mean, your adversary's argument is, in their

 5   particular case -- and I know that you dispute this ­-

 6   there is a defense that could win at trial.              And the

 7   defendant comes in and says:              Okay, what are my choices?

 8   I go to trial and I may serve a longer sentence, but I

 9   don't go to trial, I may serve that -- I do go to trial

10   and I serve that longer sentence, but it's here in the

11   U.S. and not in my home country, where I might starve to

12   death.   I think I'll stay here and take that risk.

13                  You're -- you're sort of ignoring that

14   component of information in terms of informing the

15   strategic choice of whether to take the risk and go to

16   trial.

17                  MR. LONG:    Well, we are not particularly

18   ignoring it.     We are saying ultimately under the Sixth

19   Amendment what is prudent or appropriate may not

20   necessarily be what the inquiry is, but what is

21   constitutional mandated.        And what is constitutionally

22   mandated here is to provide the adversary to waive

23   the -- put the Commonwealth's or the State's proof -- to

24   weigh it, to advise about it.

 1   goes to the Solicitor General's position, which is:                    You

 2   may be right, an attorney doesn't have to give more

 3   information than what's necessary.               But doesn't the

 4   calculus change when the defendant says, this is

 5   important to me; give me accurate advice, if you are

 6   going to give me advice?

 7                MR. LONG:    Well, the calculus may change

 8   ever so slightly, but the -- I think the difference is,

 9   is that misadvice is still -- is not materially

10   different than the failure to advise.              Ultimately, the

11   -- the defendant still is left to -- to operate under a

12   misapprehension.

13                And the States are more than able to police

14   this kind of conduct, and in fact the States have.                 I

15   think it's approximately 27 States that do add to their,

16   quote, unquote, "Rule 11" and -- and require some sort

17   of inquiry by the -- the courts.           And ultimately, it's

18   the States or the individual courts through their

19   rulemaking process or through legislative prerogative

20   whereby this could better -- best be addressed, rather

21   than constitutionalizing misadvice and trying to draw

22   this really hard distinction between no duty and the

23   duty to advise.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:        Suppose a -- a client comes

25   in.   You are a criminal lawyer and you learn the facts

 1   of the case, and it turns out that, after listening to

 2   the facts, you think he is being charged with a fairly

 3   minor offense, a year maybe max, and he tells you:                   You

 4   know, I have a family here, I've -- I've -- you know, he

 5   tells you this story where it is quite apparent to you

 6   that if he pleads guilty, back he goes, where he might

 7   be killed and so might his family.               Just sit there and

 8   say nothing?   What would you do?

 9               MR. LONG:     Your Honor, my -- my personal --

10               JUSTICE BREYER:         Yes.

11               MR. LONG:     -- personal obligation at that

12   point would be to try to answer the question.                But,

13   again, the question --

14               JUSTICE BREYER:         What would you do?         I'm

15   asking you, would you tell him?            He doesn't know about

16   the immigration law.     He thinks it's just a year.             You

17   yourself have learned that he probably will be killed,

18   as will his family, if he pleads guilty.              Would you tell

19   him that?

20               MR. LONG:     If I possessed that knowledge,

21   yes, Your Honor.

22               JUSTICE BREYER:         Of course you would.         And

23   do you think of any -- can you think of any decent

24   lawyer who wouldn't?

25               MR. LONG:     No, Your Honor.           But --

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:         No.    Okay.   Then why have

 2   you -- in this case, if they didn't tell him, why has

 3   not such a lawyer failed to meet prevailing professional

 4   norms in my hypothetical?

 5                MR. LONG:     Well, Your Honor, the -- first of

 6   all, the prevailing professional norm or ethical

 7   obligations that have been enacted in Kentucky and in

 8   most States provide very general obligations and they do

 9   not actually speak to this kind of situation.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:         Oh, I'm not saying whether

11   -- you have just told me that any lawyer worth his salt,

12   in my example, of course would tell the client, and ­- in

13   my case.   And so I just asked, then has a lawyer who has

14   failed to do so not met the prevailing professional

15   norm?   That has nothing to do with ethics or not ethics;

16   it's how lawyers behave.       I don't see how you avoid

17   answering that question "yes".

18                MR. LONG:     Well, I don't know that it's

19   necessarily a prevailing norm.           It's -- it's a question

20   of ­-

21                JUSTICE BREYER:         You just told me everyone

22   would do it, everybody'd do it.            I don't know what a

23   norm is otherwise.

24                MR. LONG:     Pardon me, but it's a question of

25   morals here to decide whether or not to offer that

 1   advice.    Now --

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, but assuming it's a

 3   norm and that all lawyers do it, including those that

 4   know diddly about immigration law, the norm is to give

 5   bad advice.    And -- and here the norm was met, right?

 6                 (Laughter.)

 7                 MR. LONG:     Potentially yes, Your Honor.      And

 8   in fact it's really unclear what advice was given

 9   because, as my opponent has mentioned, there was not an

10   evidentiary hearing, so what was actually said is

11   unclear.   But I fear like -- that the misadvice

12   distinction made by the Solicitor General's Office does

13   --

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Before we get to the

15   misadvice, to put every -- dot every "i," every lawyer

16   would do it in my case; that's a professional norm.           If

17   a lawyer fails to do it, he hasn't met the professional

18   norm.   And a rule that's absolute would overturn

19   Strickland in that respect, because Strickland says if

20   you fail to meet professional norms, you are guilty of

21   inadequate assistance of counsel, okay?           So Q.E.D.

22                 Now, what's wrong with what I just said?

23                 MR. LONG:     Well, Your Honor, I would have to

24   disagree a little bit.       I believe Strickland is not

25   quite that expansive.       Strickland talks with regard to

 1   professional norms and ethical standards as guides in

 2   determining competent counsel, and does not set them as

 3   hard, fast rules.   And in --

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:        I thought the point is

 5   that -- I thought your point was that ­- that Strickland

 6   does require professional norms to be observed, but it

 7   is professional norms regarding advising a defendant as

 8   to the trial consequences of his plea, as to those

 9   matters that are involved in the prosecution, and not as

10   to collateral matters.     Isn't that your point?

11                MR. LONG:    Yes, Your Honor.         The --

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Those are the only norms

13   that are relevant, what norms oblige counsel to advise a

14   defendant regarding trial matters.

15                MR. LONG:    Correct.         And under Strickland --

16   under the Sixth Amendment, criminal defense attorneys

17   must focus on issues of guilt and innocence and penalty.

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, everyone at the

19   counsel table I assume agrees that the plea has to be

20   voluntary.   But "voluntary" has various meanings:

21   Number one, it is not coerced or forced.            Would -- isn't

22   your argument that "voluntary" does not include being

23   fully informed?

24                MR. LONG:    Our point -- would be not be

25   fully informed about every possible consequence which


                                    41

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   would be in -- in -- completely --

 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well then, about important

 3   collateral consequences.     Is there -- are there any

 4   cases that address this point one way or the other?

 5   That is to say, the extent to which "voluntary" includes

 6   the component of being informed about major

 7   consequences, significant consequences of the plea?              Can

 8   I go anywhere to -- to read a discussion of this?

 9               MR. LONG:    Well, Your Honor, that's kind of

10   a problem, I believe.    The cases that -- that do

11   address this issue seem to focus on voluntariness and

12   they focus upon the definition this Court espoused in

13   Brady, and they uniformly come up with the -- with the

14   conclusion that no affirmative duty is required.           They

15   then jump from that position to the -- to a position

16   where misadvice somehow changes the inquiry.           They fail

17   to focus again on "voluntary," where -- meaning full

18   knowledge of direct consequences, and instead reached

19   out to these kind of results-driven opinions that are

20   kind of fueled by this feeling of -- of unfairness.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Mr. Long, you said that

22   this is a collateral consequence; therefore, the lawyer

23   has no obligation to advise the client.           But what was

24   remarkable about the case that you rely on, Hill v.

25   Lockwood, is the Eighth Circuit used the distinction


                                   42

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   between "direct" and "collateral."                 In this Court, the

 2   opinion said nothing about "direct" or "collateral"; it

 3   just asked the question under Strickland, and it held

 4   that Strickland does apply to challenges to guilty pleas

 5   based on ineffective assistance of counsel.                 But it --

 6   staring the Court in the face was this direct versus

 7   collateral, and the Court was totally silent on that.

 8   It didn't consider it relevant to its determination.

 9                  MR. LONG:    You're -- you are correct, Your

10   Honor.     The -- and, again, that silence has then led the

11   circuits to develop a rule.           And the predominant rule is

12   that a voluntary plea following this Court's other

13   decisions which it has -- where it has spoken, that the

14   plea need only be entered by one possessing full

15   knowledge of direct consequences.             The --

16                  JUSTICE ALITO:       What about the situation

17   where the -- the defendant would have made sacrifices

18   and obtained competent immigration advice, were it not

19   for affirmative misrepresentations by criminal

20   defense -- by criminal defense attorneys?                The criminal

21   defense attorney says:       Don't worry about it, you are

22   not going to be removed.        And the defendant says:          You

23   really sure about that?        Because, you know, if you're

24   not,     my relatives are going to get a second mortgage on

25   the house and we are going to go hire an immigration

 1   lawyer so we can be absolutely sure about that -- this.

 2   And the criminal attorney says:           I'm an expert on this.

 3   I've just had, you know, six hours of CLE --

 4               (Laughter.)

 5                -- on immigration law.             And in reliance on

 6   that faulty advice, the defendant pleads guilty and finds

 7   himself facing removal.

 8               MR. LONG:     Well, following the logic of this

 9   -- of the circuits and of this Court's guidance in

10   Brady, again, the inquiry for voluntariness is on direct

11   consequences, so it would not rise to a Sixth Amendment

12   claim.

13               Counsel may, nonetheless, be -- I'm not a

14   very -- I'm not a very good counsel in that situation.

15   However, as it was pointed out earlier, sometimes,

16   criminal defendants risk ordinary error with their

17   representation, and in fact, this Court has recognized

18   that in numerous cases.

19               In U.S. v. Ruiz, this Court kind of compiled

20   a group of cases, including Brady, McMann, and Tollett,

21   in which the defendant did, in fact, operate under

22   misapprehensions with regard to things that we most

23   often consider strategic, more direct obligations of the

24   trial.

25               They -- I think it was in Brady -- they


                                   44

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   misapprehended the quality of the evidence and the

 2   penalties and such, and this Court ultimately found

 3   that, in all those cases, there is a certain amount of

 4   ordinary error that is risked when pleading guilty, that

 5   you risk a certain amount -- that your counsel may not

 6   have made the best strategic decision.

 7                JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask this

 8   question:   Supposing this wasn't a drug crime -- a

 9   sexual abuse of a minor, which would lead to all sorts

10   of restrictions on where the defendant could live and

11   report to as a resident, and the like, would there be ­-

12   would that be a collateral consequence or a direct

13   consequence, in the advice on that?

14                MR. LONG:    I believe, Your Honor, that it

15   would be a -- a fine line, that it would technically be

16   a collateral consequence under the classic definition of

17   collateral consequence, that being whether or not it

18   falls under the control or discretion of the sentencing

19   court.   The --

20                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Even though the

21   consequence is a -- is something required by the law of

22   the jurisdiction imposing the criminal penalty, it would

23   still be collateral?

24                MR. LONG:    The popular definition -- or the

25   most common definition focuses on whether it falls under


                                    45

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   the discretion or power of the sentencing court.

 2               In those jurisdictions that have sexual

 3   offender registries, it is not a -- something that is

 4   discretionary with the court.             It is through the

 5   executive agency that that is enforced, just like

 6   parole, also just like your right -- to lose your right

 7   to vote -- losing your right to bear arms.

 8               All of those things happen automatically by

 9   action of law, yet they remain collateral because they

10   do not fall under -- with -- under the discretion and

11   power of the sentencing court.

12               If I could remind you all -- I apologize for

13   putting "you all" -- but -- my being from Kentucky is

14   showing a little.

15               (Laughter.)

16               MR. LONG:       The modern rules of professional

17   conduct are very, very broad, and there's -- I don't

18   believe that it can be demonstrated that they were

19   actually violated here, even under the alleged conduct.

20   The prevailing norms that the ABA puts forth in its

21   brief or the criminal justice standards are

22   aspirational.   They -- they focus more on what --

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I thought you told

24   Justice Breyer that any good lawyer would give this

25   advice to a client?


                                      46

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1               MR. LONG:      I said -- in response to Justice

 2   Breyer, in the extreme circumstances, again, it would be

 3   my opinion -- not necessarily the opinion of this Court

 4   or necessarily it would fall under the Sixth Amendment,

 5   but that, if you absolutely knew and that a -- a severe

 6   collateral consequence is of great importance, you

 7   should explore it.

 8               The misadvice rule that the U.S. government

 9   kind of puts forth as the hybrid position does -- I

10   do believe creates these collateral consequences as land

11   mines to be avoided.

12               I think it does, in fact, encourage criminal

13   defendants to be -- or criminal defense attorneys to be

14   silent in situations where they would otherwise be

15   more free in offering that advice.

16               And, again, offering the advice does not

17   necessarily raise it to Sixth Amendment purview because,

18   again, there are any number of things that are going to

19   come up in that attorney-client relationship.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            We are talking on a

21   highly general level, but what's facing us -- this case,

22   is there are certain crimes -- an increased number of

23   crimes that are classified as aggravated felonies, where

24   the rule is, if you are convicted of an aggravated

25   felony, you are out of the country after you serve your


                                     47

 1   time.

 2                  There's nothing mysterious about that.

 3   There's nothing intricate about making that

 4   determination.     So why wouldn't a lawyer whose client is

 5   an alien have an obligation, when there is an aggravated

 6   felony as the charge, to say this will be the

 7   consequence?

 8                  MR. LONG:    Well, I think, in this case, we

 9   are focusing on the obligation created by the Sixth

10   Amendment, and the Sixth Amendment obligation refers to

11   the criminal proceeding and the criminal prosecution and

12   then to aid in the defense.

13                  Like the -- and we would agree with the

14   Solicitor General there, that the purpose for the

15   criminal attorney in that situation is to counteract the

16   expert of the Commonwealth or the State, is to ensure

17   the fair and just determination of guilt, not to advise

18   on collateral matters such as deportation, child

19   custody, and the like.

20                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          You keep insisting on the

21   collateral, although you recognized that in Hill v.

22   Lockhart, the Court did not draw that line.

23                  MR. LONG:    Well, ultimately -- and this

24   Court did not -- didn't draw any line.             It was silent on

25   that point.    And given the -- the way the lower courts


                                      48

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   have reacted in drawing the direct and collateral line,

 2   I think that's kind of where we have to go.

 3                  That's what the rule is of the lower courts

 4   and it's the rule that has -- has been applied

 5   throughout the nation, and we are testing whether or not

 6   that rule makes sense, essentially.

 7                  And I think, ultimately, there is a

 8   potential problem in treating deportation differently

 9   than other collateral consequences.                To do so ­- I

10   believe, at one point in Mr. Kinnaird's argument, he

11   does make the point that deportation, because it is of

12   such importance or that -- that it should be treated

13   differently.

14                  But that is to suggest that it's so

15   important in all situations and it is more important

16   than collateral consequence that may affect citizens.

17   Citizens will lose the right to vote.                They will lose

18   their right to jury service, perhaps lose custody of

20                  And there's no principled reason to really

21   treat deportation differently.            If the reason to treat

22   it differently because it is viewed as so severe, it's

23   truly then a subjective inquiry as what collateral

24   consequence is severe to this client.

25                  And it ultimately prefers a class of

 1   citizens -- those who are non-citizens -- over citizens

 2   who may have just as much importance placed on

 3   collateral consequences they face.

 4                Moving real quickly, if I could just touch

 5   briefly on the prejudice prong of Strickland.                 First,

 6   I'm not -- well, I hesitate to say this a little bit,

 7   but it's not completely apparent on the record that

 8   counsel's performance was, in fact, deficient.

 9                He did not misadvise with regard to any

10   direct consequence.      Padilla does not allege that he

11   misunderstood any of the rights he was waiving, and at

12   least -- and up until his reply brief, he made no bones

13   about the fact that he was guilty.

14                And, in fact, that solemn and sworn

15   admission of guilt should not be lightly undone.

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, the defendant might

17   say:   I have been in the United States for 40 years.                  I

18   have a family.   I'd rather take my chances with a

19   jury and get put away for a longer time because at least

20   I'll be in prison where my children can visit me.

21                MR. LONG:      Well, Your Honor, again, that is

22   a risk that is taken when asking questions to your

23   counsel.   It would not necessarily fall under the Sixth

24   Amendment requirements.

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

 3                  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. KINNAIRD

 4                      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 5                  MR. KINNAIRD:      Thank you, Your Honor.

 6                  Three quick points.         In Hill, the Court did

 7   expressly hold that Strickland applies to the collateral

 8   consequence of parole eligibility, so it is not just

 9   for -- for trial consequences.

10                  And, secondly, Brady is predicated on an

11   assumption that there is competent advice on the

12   strategic decisions --

13                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Excue me, I'm not sure that

14   parole eligibility could qualify as a collateral

15   consequence.

16                  MR. KINNAIRD:      It certainly would under the

17   -- Kentucky's test, Your Honor, because it depends on

18   such factors as the actual sentence, the prior

19   convictions of the defendant.             Those are not things that

20   are known at the plea colloquy --

21                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        It goes to the sentence.

22   It goes to what the sentence will be, which is certainly

23   part of the trial.

24                  MR. KINNAIRD:      Well, under Rule 11, at least

25   prior to the abolition of parole, there was no


                                      51

 1   advisement in the district courts -- the Federal

 2   district courts on that.

 3                  The second point is that it is predicated on

 4   competency, and so the standard is not voluntariness.

 5   When you are in the Sixth Amendment, you go to the

 6   Strickland standard of incompetency, and then prejudice

 7   within the criminal prosecution.             And I emphasize that

 8   is what we have here, the forfeiture of a jury trial

 9   right.     We are not talking about prejudice outside the

10   criminal prosecution.

11                  And, finally, while we agree with the

12   government that the misadvice rule has proven perfectly

13   manageable in the 30 or so jurisdictions in which it has

14   been endorsed, there also have been a handful of

15   jurisdictions --

16                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Why do you say that?    Why

17   do you say that?     Or there has not been a revolution

18   or what?    What -- how do you know?

19                  MR. KINNAIRD:      Well, Your Honor, I mean,

20   there's -- I think that there are something like 700

21   claims in over a decade or something like that.

22                  So we don't know, but it's -- there has been

23   no evidence, that we are aware of, that the courts are

24   overly burdened by these, and there -- and even in the

25   jurisdictions that apply the broader rule, we, again,


                                      52

 1   are not aware of any flood of mini-trials.                 Many use the

 2   Strickland --

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               What -- what is your

 4   answer to the situation that I think has been

 5   hypothesized, of the lawyer -- the defendant asks him,

 6   what are the deportation consequences?                 And the lawyer

 7   says:    I don't know.    I'm not a deportation lawyer.                I'm

 8   a criminal lawyer, but my best guess is that you are all

 9   right.

10                 What happens there?

11                 MR. KINNAIRD:       Well, Your Honor, I think

12   those would be adjudicated under Strickland, and,

13   remember, Strickland --

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So you can make a

15   claim when the lawyer disavows knowledge on the

16   question?    In other words, he is trying to be helpful,

17   but he also warns the defendant.

18                 MR. KINNAIRD:       Yes.     Under the broader rule,

19   you would have a Strickland claim.                 It would be very

20   hard to prevail on that because you would have to show

21   that it was unreasonable for him not to investigate

22   the consequences --

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               "To investigate"?

24   So even if he doesn't know deportation and the client

25   asks him, he has to investigate that?

 1               MR. KINNAIRD:      He has to do whatever is

 2   required by competent representation.

 3               JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, just to be --

 4               MR. KINNAIRD:      That's the limited standard.

 5               JUSTICE ALITO:       Just to be clear about the

 6   scope of your argument -- maybe you could just clarify.

 7   Which, if any, of the following would you not put in the

 8   same category as advice about immigration consequences:

 9   advice about consequences for a conviction for a sex

10   offense, the loss of professional licensing or future

11   employment opportunities, civil liability, tax

12   liability, right to vote, right to bear arms.

13               Are they all in the same category?         Or do

14   you -- do you draw a line some place?

15               MR. KINNAIRD:      Your Honor, our principal

16   position is that the Court should not draw lines, that

17   that's the whole purpose of Strickland.

18               I would say, in the vast majority of cases,

19   for example, with the right to vote, the chances that

20   that's going to be material to a plea decision by a

21   defendant, especially one facing significant

22   incarceration, are probably almost nil, but this should

23   be left to the -- to the traditional Strickland inquiry

24   on a case-by-case basis.

25               Thank you.
