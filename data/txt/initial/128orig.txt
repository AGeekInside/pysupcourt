 3                       JUSTICE STEVENS:         We'll now hear argument in

 4      Alaska against the United States.

 6                        ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN

 7                                ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

 8                       MR. FRANKLIN:        Justice Stevens, and may it

 9      please the Court:

10                       Because title to lands underlying navigable

11      waters is an inseparable attribute of State sovereignty,

12      this Court has long held that there is a strong

13      presumption that each State receives title to such lands

14      at statehood.             Under the Court's precedents, the United

15      States cannot defeat the State's title unless Congress has

16      definitely declared an intention to do so or has otherwise

17      made that intention very plain.

18                       Turning to the Glacier Bay claim in this case,

19      the United States asserts that it received title to the

20      submerged lands underlying the bay at statehood, but there

21      is no express statement, an unambiguous statement by

22      Congress evidencing an intent to defeat Alaska's title.

23                       To the contrary, the proviso to section 6(e) of

24      the Alaska Statehood Act, which is the only statute the

25      United States identifies as ratifying the purported

                                                  3
                                      Alderson Reporting Company

 1      reservation of the bay, in fact shows that title remains

 2      with Alaska.              Under the plain language of the statute, the

 3      proviso applies only to a subset of the lands that would

 4      otherwise have been transferred to the State under the

 5      main clause.              And this is important.            In this case it is

 6      undisputed by both of the parties and by the Special

 7      Master that the Glacier Bay Monument was not included

 8      within the main clause.                The submerged lands, therefore,

 9      did not --

10                       JUSTICE O'CONNOR:             Well, counsel, you --

11      apparently you agree that the U.S. retained title to the

12      uplands in Glacier Bay National Monument under section

13      5 --

14                       MR. FRANKLIN:         Yes, Your Honor.

15                       JUSTICE O'CONNOR:             -- of the statehood act.

16                       MR. FRANKLIN:         Absolutely.

17                       JUSTICE O'CONNOR:             And why was Federal title to

18      the monument not sufficient to retain title to the

19      submerged lands as well without reference to section 6(e)

20      at all?

21                       MR. FRANKLIN:         Because of section 6(m), Your

22      Honor.        Section 5 of the Alaska Statehood Act provides

23      that the Federal Government retained all of the property

24      it previously possessed with one important exception,

25      except as provided in section 6.                    Section 6 has two

                                                   4
                                       Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400             1-800-FOR-DEPO                    Washington, DC 20005
 1      exceptions within it that are potentially relevant here.

 2      Section 6(m) incorporates the Submerged Lands Act and

 3      thereby provides that Alaska was to receive title to all

 4      the submerged lands underlying its navigable waters, plus

 5      those 3 miles seaward from the coastline, in order to put

 6      Alaska on the same equal footing with the rest of the

 7      States.

 8                       Section 6(e) dealt with an entirely different

 9      set of properties.         What section 6(e) did was to transfer

10      to the State a very specific and narrowly defined class of

11      property, property that was used for the purposes or

12      solely -- for the sole purpose of -- of fish and wildlife

13      conservation under three designated statutes.               Those are

14      the State -- local-State fish and wildlife conservation

15      statutes.

16                       Again, here it was -- it is undisputed that

17      Glacier Bay is not included within the main clause.

18      Therefore, the --

19                       JUSTICE GINSBURG:        -- problem, as -- you just

20      said that -- that the main clause is very, very narrow,

21      and we're told by the Government that no wildlife

22      reservation would come within that main clause, so that

23      there would be nothing to retain under the second clause.

24                       MR. FRANKLIN:    The Government is incorrect, Your

25      Honor.        We have identified two wildlife refuges, the Kenai

                                              5

 1      moose range and the Kodiak bear refuge, that were

 2      otherwise encompassed by the main clause but saved by the

 3      proviso.

 4                       And here's why the United States is correct on

 5      that.       They argue in their brief that those properties

 6      were not included in the main clause because they were

 7      created under the Alaska Game Law of 1925 rather than the

 8      Alaska Game Law of 1943.           In fact, Your Honors, those are

 9      the exact same statute.           The '43 Alaska Game Law simply

10      restated the 1925 law with certain amendments.              What that

11      means is that at statehood the Kenai moose range and the

12      Kodiak bear refuge were, in fact, being used for the

13      purposes under the Alaska Game Law of '43, which was the

14      then-existing version.          These refuges were created in 1941

15      prior to the restatement and amendment of the statute.                  So

16      those are two properties.

17                       And -- and actually the legislative history --

18      we don't think the Court needs to go to the legislative

19      history because the statute is plain and also because

20      there's a clear statement rule.               But the legislative

21      history does indicate that Congress was specifically

22      concerned about those two very large refuges.               The Kenai

23      and the Kodiak together comprise an area that is

24      approximately the same size as the State of Connecticut.

25      And Congress' concern or, more specifically, the concern

                                              6

 1      of the Fish and Wildlife Service was that Alaska might not

 2      be able adequately to manage those properties.                      But there

 3      was no such concern expressed with the monument that's at

 4      issue here because it was never going to be transferred to

 5      the State under the main clause.

 6                       JUSTICE O'CONNOR:             Why -- why shouldn't we look

 7      to the tests set out in the Idaho case here?

 8                       MR. FRANKLIN:         We are advocating the tests set

 9      out in the Idaho case, Your Honor.                      That test is a two-

10      pronged test.

11                       JUSTICE O'CONNOR:             Right.

12                       MR. FRANKLIN:         First, you have to look and see

13      if there is a --

14                       JUSTICE O'CONNOR:             Whether Congress has notice

15      of the inclusion of the lands and a Federal reservation,

16      which it certainly did for Glacier, did it not?

17                       MR. FRANKLIN:         That's -- that's relevant to the

18      first prong, Your Honor.

19                       The second prong --

20                       JUSTICE O'CONNOR:             And second, whether the

21      transfer to the State would undermine the purpose of that

22      reservation.              Should we look to that?

23                       MR. FRANKLIN:         If the Court were examining the

24      -- the first prong, Your Honor, I think those factors

25      might be relevant.             Here, though, the test is set out in

                                                   7

 1      not only the Idaho case but also the Alaska case, and that

 2      is that there has to be an explicit action by Congress.

 3      And Idaho applies that.                Idaho looked very carefully for

 4      some action by Congress ratifying the reservation in that

 5      case.

 6                       Here, we need an action by Congress.            The United

 7      States has identified what they contend is the action of

 8      Congress, that is, the proviso to section 6(e) of the

 9      Alaska Statehood Act.               That proviso, though, just does not

10      cover these lands.

11                       JUSTICE BREYER:          Why do you say explicit?      I --

12      I thought it said you have to make it plain, which really

13      might matter.

14                       MR. FRANKLIN:         In --

15                       JUSTICE BREYER:          What it says -- the language I

16      think is -- or definitely declared or otherwise made very

17      plain.

18                       MR. FRANKLIN:         Yes.     In the --

19                       JUSTICE BREYER:          Is that right?    There's nothing

20      that says explicit.              Right?

21                       MR. FRANKLIN:         Well, Your Honor, in the Alaska

22      case -- and here I refer the Court to page 44 of the 1997

23      Alaska case.              There the Court said that Congress must,

24      quote, explicitly recognize or that Congress had

25      explicitly recognized the resignation in that case.                     So

                                                   8

 1      the -- the Court --

 2                       JUSTICE SOUTER:        But doesn't that simply mean

 3      that if it explicitly recognizes, it has made it plain.

 4                       MR. FRANKLIN:       Yes.

 5                       JUSTICE SOUTER:        But it doesn't mean that it

 6      must be explicit in every case.                  Isn't that correct?

 7                       MR. FRANKLIN:       Well, I -- I think explicit --

 8                       JUSTICE SOUTER:        You don't have to be explicit

 9      to make it plain.            It's a great way to do it, but that's

10      -- it's not the only way.

11                       MR. FRANKLIN:       It has to be definitely --

12      Justice Breyer, you're correct.                  It has to be --

13                       JUSTICE BREYER:        All right.

14                       MR. FRANKLIN:       -- definitely clear or otherwise

15      made plain.           Yes.

16                       JUSTICE BREYER:        If I'm correct, then -- if I'm

17      correct, then I guess the main argument I thought is here

18      we have a national park and we want to keep the national

19      parks as the United States, which you'd expect.                     It's a

20      national park.            And of course, they want to keep the whole

21      thing.        I mean, it's obvious.           You don't have to write

22      everything that's obvious.               They no more want to give all

23      the water in the park to Alaska than they'd want to give

24      the gamekeeper's part to Alaska.                  A house, or maybe

25      there's a swimming pool somewhere they don't mention

                                                 9

 1      either, but it's just obvious that unless there's

 2      something very special about the water, that the water in

 3      the park is part of the park.

 4                       MR. FRANKLIN:         Well, there is something special

 5      about the water, Your Honor, and that's what the Court has

 6      recognized.           The water is a State -- an essential

 7      attribute of State sovereignty, and just to --

 8                       JUSTICE BREYER:          I understand that.    But I mean,

 9      it's like saying we're keeping Yellowstone, but we're

10      giving you the geysers.                I mean, that's water too.         It's

11      even underground water.                But I mean, what the argument I

12      think is -- would be is this like that, and the argument

13      that it is like that is that, well, of course, you need

14      this water in order to study the glaciers because there

15      are forests that go down to the edge, because the flora

16      and fauna can't be protected without it.                    And so though it

17      isn't as strong a case as the geysers in Yellowstone, it's

18      good enough.              Now, what's your reply?

19                       MR. FRANKLIN:         First of all, the geysers are not

20      included because we're talking about navigable --

21                       JUSTICE BREYER:          I understand that.    I'm using a

22      funny example to --

23                       MR. FRANKLIN:         Yes.     Navigable waters.

24                       (Laughter.)

25                       MR. FRANKLIN:         But let me -- let me just assure

 1      the Court.          There is nothing at all unusual about State-

 2      owned submerged lands within national monuments.                  The

 3      reason is simple.             The Antiquities Act, which allows the

 4      President to designate national monuments, was enacted in

 5      1906.       At that time there were 45 States already in the

 6      Union.        Therefore, any national monument created in those

 7      45 States would necessarily have included State-owned

 8      submerged lands unless there had been some conveyance.

 9                       And let -- let me give Your Honors a -- a

10      concrete example.             In the 1978 California decision decided

11      by this Court, the Court recognized that the Channel

12      Islands National Monument, which is an offshore national

13      monument off the coast of California, included State-

14      owned submerged lands because even though the reservation

15      order was asserted to have included those lands, there was

16      no congressional statement of an intent to defeat the

17      State's title.

18                       Another --

19                       JUSTICE BREYER:         Like in Yellowstone.    There is

20      a river I think.          Who owns that?

21                       MR. FRANKLIN:        Well, Yellowstone was created

22      before the State of Wyoming and --

23                       JUSTICE BREYER:         No.    But I mean, does the State

24      or the Feds own the -- the river that goes through it?

25                       MR. FRANKLIN:        One would need to examine the

                                                 11

 1      particular reservations and statutes there.

 2                       JUSTICE BREYER:     What about in Yosemite?         I

 3      think there's a river down there too.                  Is the river in

 4      Yosemite owned by California or by the -- the Feds?

 5                       MR. FRANKLIN:     I'm not familiar with that, but I

 6      will give you an example that I am familiar with.

 7                       JUSTICE SCALIA:     Before you do that, Mr.

 8      Franklin, is -- is the rule that -- that we're operating

 9      under that Congress had to have made it clear --

10                       MR. FRANKLIN:     Yes.

11                       JUSTICE SCALIA:     -- that it reserved, or is the

12      rule that it is clear that Congress ought to have reserved

13      it?

14                       MR. FRANKLIN:     No.    It's the former rule, Your

15      Honor.

16                       JUSTICE SCALIA:     It's the former.

17                       MR. FRANKLIN:     Yes.

18                       JUSTICE SCALIA:     So the mere fact that it

19      doesn't make any sense not to have reserved it does not

20      make it clear that Congress reserved it, does it?

21                       MR. FRANKLIN:     Absolutely, Your Honor.

22                       JUSTICE BREYER:     Right, but normally you assume,

23      I guess, that Congress does what is -- tries to avoid

24      things that are ridiculous.               So if they say keep the park,

25      I guess the question would be is that included.                  I mean --

 2                       JUSTICE BREYER:      -- can you read it this way?            I

 3      -- I think it would be relevant, wouldn't it?

 4                       MR. FRANKLIN:     Well, first of all, this is not

 5      the ordinary -- in this case we presumed the -- the

 6      opposite.          In fact, there's a strong presumption.

 7                       But let me give you the other example that I was

 8      going to refer to you.

 9                       JUSTICE BREYER:      Yes.

10                       MR. FRANKLIN:     There's something called the

11      California Coastal National Monument.                   That extends the

12      entire length of California and goes out 12 miles to sea.

13      In that monument, the -- the lands, the submerged lands,

14      are both State-owned and Federal-owned, and they are

15      managed cooperatively.

16                       And that's what we are seeking to do here.              And

17      importantly, the fact --

18                       JUSTICE SCALIA:      Mr. Franklin, are -- are these

19      submerged lands covered by navigable waters?

20                       MR. FRANKLIN:     Yes.

21                       JUSTICE SCALIA:      What is it that the Government

22      could do, if they owned the submerged lands, by way of

23      protecting wildlife and doing all the good stuff they want

24      to do, that they cannot do simply by -- by reason of -- of

25      having jurisdiction over the navigable waters?

 1                       MR. FRANKLIN:     There are a few things,

 2      presumably very localized activities that the State would

 3      have the exclusive authority in.                Importantly though, the

 4      Federal Government, even though the State owns title here,

 5      will retain all of its constitutional authority under the

 6      Interstate Commerce Clause to regulate activities that

 7      affect interstate commerce that --

 8                       JUSTICE O'CONNOR:       Yes, but just as a practical

 9      matter, tell us what you're arguing about.                    What does

10      Alaska think it can do if it prevails in the Glacier

11      Monument area by virtue of prevailing, as a practical

12      matter?

13                       MR. FRANKLIN:     As -- as a practical matter,

14      there are issues relating to local subsistence fishing

15      that are important to the State.                There are issues

16      relating to local uses of the bay.                 But more

17      importantly --

18                       JUSTICE SOUTER:      Well, could -- could you be

19      concrete?          I mean, there -- I don't know what you mean.

20      What are the issues?          Can you give me an explicit example?

21                       MR. FRANKLIN:     Well, one explicit example is I

22      think the State would prefer to have more local

23      subsistence fishing in the bay.                And the Court -- to -- to

24      move out a bit, the --

25                       JUSTICE O'CONNOR:       So the State would permit

 1      more fishing than the U.S. would allow --

 2                       MR. FRANKLIN:     I think --

 3                       JUSTICE O'CONNOR:      -- as a practical matter.

 4                       MR. FRANKLIN:     As a practical matter.         And --

 5      and there -- there --

 6                       JUSTICE SCALIA:     But couldn't Congress forbid

 7      that under -- by reason of its control of the navigable

 8      waters --

 9                       MR. FRANKLIN:     Well, if --

10                       JUSTICE SCALIA:     -- if it really wanted to?

11                       MR. FRANKLIN:     If Congress really wanted to,

12      Congress could -- could affect activities relating to

13      interstate commerce.

14                       But importantly, what Alaska seeks here really

15      is a seat at the table.            Right now Alaska has no say over

16      anything that happens in its navigable waters which are

17      its sovereign State lands.            What it seeks really is to

18      have its views being considered.

19                       Right now -- and I'll give you a concrete

20      example that goes to the enclaves that are issue in the --

21      in the next count that I'll discuss.                   For some time cruise

22      ships were going out into the middle of these enclaves and

23      dumping their untreated sewage because that was outside --

24      or asserted by the Government to be outside the scope of

25      Alaska's pollution laws and not within the scope of

                                             15

 1      Federal laws.             That was fixed, but it took an act of

 2      Congress to do that.             There had to be an act of Congress

 3      to prohibit those cruise ships from dumping their sludge

 4      out in these, what they used to call, donut holes.                     Alaska

 5      finds it unacceptable to have to go petition Congress

 6      every time something comes up on its navigable waters that

 7      it believes ought to be regulated or dealt with.

 8                       Now, if Congress decides to preempt the State

 9      under its interstate commerce power, it has the right to

10      do that.

11                       I think we also need to keep in mind what waters

12      we're talking about.             This is southeast Alaska.         The

13      waters of southeast Alaska quite literally define the

14      region.        They are central to the economy, the history, the

15      society, and the culture of all the Alaskans who live

16      there and who travel there.

17                       Just to take an example, there are still today

18      very few roads anywhere in southeast Alaska, and the --

19      the towns and the cities like the -- the State capital of

20      Juneau historically were accessible only by the water.

21      This is an area -- the water in particular is an area that

22      is of great importance to Alaska.                    And they are seeking to

23      confirm that that area does belong to Alaska.                    And I think

24      we have set forth in quite detail why --

25                       JUSTICE O'CONNOR:          Well, there -- there are big

 1      differences between the -- the analysis concerning the

 2      bays that you assert and Glacier Monument.              I think

 3      they're quite different.

 4                       MR. FRANKLIN:     Well, the -- the tests are

 5      different.          The Glacier Bay test involves -- needs to have

 6      an explicit reservation -- explicit ratification by

 7      Congress of a reservation and --

 8                       JUSTICE O'CONNOR:       You're lumping them all

 9      together, but I think the tests are quite different.

10                       MR. FRANKLIN:     The tests are different.

11                       What I was trying to explain is, in answer to

12      Your Honor's question, why this matters to Alaska.                 It

13      matters quite a deal.

14                       JUSTICE BREYER:      But in -- in respect to Glacier

15      Bay --

16                       MR. FRANKLIN:     Yes.

17                       JUSTICE BREYER:      -- I -- I mean, is the only --

18      you said, for example -- is the only dispute about the use

19      of the water that's in the middle of the Glacier Bay park

20      whether there should be more or less fishing, or are there

21      other things that Alaska wants to do with that water in

22      the park that they can't do if the United States owns it?

23                       MR. FRANKLIN:     There are two issues.   I think

24      it's fishing and also to allow more local people to visit

25      the area that would otherwise be prohibited by the Park

 2                       JUSTICE BREYER:          How could they do that?         You

 3      mean they would go into a boat in the middle of the water

 4      there, but they couldn't get off the boat?

 5                       MR. FRANKLIN:         Well, that's normally what --

 6      what people do is they just visit the --

 7                       JUSTICE BREYER:          I see.

 8                       MR. FRANKLIN:         -- by boats.

 9                       But to assure Your Honor, there -- for example,

10      there are no mineral interests here anywhere in the

11      picture.

12                       JUSTICE BREYER:          All right.        So if -- if

13      the normal way of visiting the park is to go into a boat

14      and to go up along the waterway and to look at the

15      glaciers on the shore, then it surely is odd that the

16      United States intended to give that waterway to Alaska,

17      for under those circumstances, there would be nothing left

18      of the park.              I mean, it would be like -- you see, if it's

19      essential to it.

20                       MR. FRANKLIN:         Well, that's not true, Your

21      Honor.        80 percent of the park, even if one assumes it

22      included the submerged lands, is uplands.                       But it's no

23      more unusual --

24                       JUSTICE BREYER:          No.    I understand that, but I

25      mean, it's the way of visiting the park.

 1                      MR. FRANKLIN:    Yes, but I just mentioned, for

 2      example, the two monuments in California.                  The Channel

 3      Islands National Monument this Court held included the --

 4      the submerged lands were State-owned.                  There's no other

 5      way to get to the Channel Islands Monument but to traverse

 6      State-owned submerged lands.              In fact, I think there are

 7      few national parks in this country you can't get to

 8      without going across State lands.

 9                      I think there's another important point here and

10      that is the Property Clause of the Constitution would also

11      allow the Federal Government to regulate activities on

12      lands that abut national parks to the extent that they

13      might affect park activities.

14                      But here what we need is an expressed statement

15      by Congress ratifying the purported reservation of the bay.

16      Without that, Your Honors -- and the -- the precedents are

17      clear.       Without that, the presumption is -- in fact, the

18      strong presumption is -- that these are State-owned lands.

19      And again, there is absolutely nothing unusual.                  That is

20      part of our Federal system.            It's the way that these

21      monument properties have been managed since 1906 when the

22      President first got the authority.               It's the way that

23      Glacier Bay will continue to be managed.                  We expect, we

24      intend to work cooperatively with the Federal Government

25      to resolve any issues that might remain.

 1                       What we're seeking here, again, is a seat at the

 2      table.        We just are seeking to have Alaska's views dealt

 3      with because they are the owner.

 4                       JUSTICE GINSBURG:      In the -- in the '97 case,

 5      was the area at issue within the first part of 6(e)?

 6      Because this --

 7                       MR. FRANKLIN:    Yes.     The -- the Court expressly

 8      stated that it was at pages 60 to 61, and that was in the

 9      absence of any contrary argument.

10                       JUSTICE GINSBURG:      It -- it made an assumption.

11                       MR. FRANKLIN:    The Court made an assumption, but

12      in fact --

13                       JUSTICE GINSBURG:      But was it in fact?

14                       MR. FRANKLIN:    I think there would have been a

15      substantial -- had that -- had that issue been litigated,

16      there would have been a substantial argument that it was

17      not within the main clause.              But again, there was no

18      argument on that point before the Court.               The Court at

19      pages 60 to 61 expressly stated -- again, it was an

20      assumption, but the Court expressly stated that the lands

21      were within the main clause.              Apparently the Court was

22      considering the fact that the application for ANWR did, in

23      fact, reference the purposes that were set forth in the

24      main clause, the Alaska Game Law.

25                       The important point of that case for this case,

 1      though, Your Honors, is that the Court embraced the

 2      construction of section 6(e) that we are advocating here,

 3      namely that the proviso exempts and saves for the Federal

 4      Government a subset of the properties that would otherwise

 5      have been transferred to the State under the main clause.

 6      There simply was no need for Congress to have expressed an

 7      intent --

 8                       JUSTICE SCALIA:      I thought we had left that

 9      open.       I thought we --

10                       MR. FRANKLIN:     I think what I said is that the

11      Court embraced that position, and it was actually an

12      essential attribute of the -- essential premise for the

13      Court's holding.          At 60 to 61 and again at page 48 of the

14      -- the decision, what the Court made clear is it was

15      concerned that unless the lands were saved by the proviso,

16      all of them, the submerged lands and the uplands, would

17      have passed to Alaska under the main clause, and that was

18      one of the reasons the Court, I think, held that it was

19      covered by the proviso.            No such concern is present here.

20                       I'd like at this point briefly to turn, if I

21      might, to the count I, which is the historic waters count.

22      There the United States asserts that at statehood the

23      waters of southeast Alaska were riddled with isolated

24      enclaves of international high seas that were wholly

25      surrounded by U.S. territorial waters.                  The historical

                                              21

 1      record, though, belies that contention.

 2                       At least from 1903 until 1971, the United States

 3      took what this Court has described in the Mississippi

 4      Sound case, the Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case, as

 5      the publicly stated policy that the waters of the

 6      archipelago were inland and that the political boundary

 7      ran along the outside edge.              Thereafter, the United States

 8      took -- consistently based a discriminatory enforcement

 9      regime, fisheries enforcement, on that position.              What I

10      mean by discriminatory is that the United States allowed

11      U.S. fishing but prohibited foreign fishing in that area.

12                       JUSTICE SOUTER:      Well, the argument on the other

13      side, as I understand it, is that the -- the assertion of

14      authority to regulate fishing really is -- is relevant.

15      It has no necessary implication for the historic waters

16      doctrine.          What -- what is your answer to that?

17                       MR. FRANKLIN:     That's the assertion.   My answer

18      is that the Court announced to the contrary in the 1975

19      decision, the Cook Inlet case, there at page 201 and 202,

20      and this is quoted at page 28 of the blue brief.              What the

21      Court said there is it examined an incident in which a

22      Japanese fishing vessel had been caught in the general

23      area, and the Court said -- and I quote -- that incident

24      deserves scrutiny because the seizure of a foreign vessel

25      more than 3 miles from shore manifests an assertion of

                                              22

 1      sovereignty to exclude foreign vessels altogether and,

 2      quote, must be viewed as an exercise of authority over the

 3      waters in question.

 4                       JUSTICE SOUTER:     What -- what page was that?

 5                       MR. FRANKLIN:     I'm sorry.          That's 201 to 202 --

 6      201 and 202 of the Cook Inlet case, and that's at 28 of

 7      the blue brief.

 8                       What the law was at statehood is that the United

 9      States had no authority, after 3 miles out, to enforce

10      discriminatory fishing regulations against foreign

11      vessels.

12                       Now, importantly there's a caveat here, and that

13      is that the law has changed.              The law has changed since

14      1971.       Beginning in 1976, the United States asserted a

15      200-mile -- what's known as an exclusive economic zone

16      that allows the United States to enforce discriminatory

17      fishing, and in 1982 international law embraced that.

18                       But -- and we have quoted a UN study.             In fact,

19      the UN study that we have quoted -- and that is noted at

20      page 29 of the blue brief.            That is the study that's

21      called the Juridical Regime Study.                It's the study that

22      this Court itself, in all of its historic waters cases,

23      has used as the authoritative statement of the law.                      That

24      study quite clearly states that if a -- if a country

25      enforced discriminatory fishing rules against foreign

                                             23

 1      vessels outside -- that that manifests an assertion of an

 2      historic inland waters claim.                And what we have here --

 3                       JUSTICE SCALIA:       On -- on this point, it seems

 4      to me there -- unlike the first point you were discussing

 5      where I think the Federal Government can work its will

 6      anyway, on this point there is really a significant

 7      Federal interest involved.                That is to say, if the United

 8      States takes the position that these are, indeed, inland

 9      waters, it's going to have to acknowledge similar rights

10      in foreign countries with similar archipelagos.

11                       MR. FRANKLIN:      No.     Your Honor, they assert

12      that, but they don't provide any specific examples.                   And

13      the reason they can't provide a specific example of any

14      instance abroad where it would affect their position is

15      that each historic waters inquiry is decided on its own

16      facts.        The fact that something is an archipelago does not

17      render it historic waters.

18                       JUSTICE SCALIA:       But -- but you say a

19      determinative fact, a conclusive fact is simply -- is

20      simply enforcing discriminatory fishing regulations.

21                       MR. FRANKLIN:      It is a claim to the -- to the

22      waters, which was made in 1903, accompanied with

23      discriminatory fishing enforcement, accompanied with other

24      statements in this case, including the California brief to

25      this Court.           There has to be an -- excuse me --

 1      an examination of all of the facts and circumstances before

 2      one can conclude that waters are historic waters.                    These

 3      ones are.         Other waters would not be.             The United States

 4      has not identified any waters abroad that have precisely

 5      these constellation of facts.               So its -- its position is

 6      basically:          we say it, therefore it must be so.           I --

 7                      JUSTICE GINSBURG:        But it's not the United

 8      States that will be making the judgment about what areas

 9      are controlled.           It would be the country abroad.           And I --

10      I think the argument was, what the United States does

11      other nations will copy.

12                      MR. FRANKLIN:      Right.

13                      JUSTICE GINSBURG:        And they will decide what

14      looks like the Alaska --

15                      MR. FRANKLIN:      Right.

16                      What the United States does, Your Honor, is

17      follow the well-settled international law on historic bays

18      -- historic waters.           Those are set forth in the

19      convention.          Each state will have the same authority where

20      its facts and circumstances dictate it.                    If there has been

21      a continuous claim asserted by a nation with the

22      acquiescence of foreign nations, then it will qualify as

23      historic waters.           But it has to be done based on a -- an

24      examination of the particular facts of the case.

25                      And one thing else -- one thing other that is

                                               25

 1      worth noting, if you have an archipelago like this, a

 2      nation can always close it off using article 4 straight

 3      baselines.          That is permitted under the convention.          The

 4      U.S. has decided not to do that, but other states are

 5      fully able to do that.

 6                       I think that if the United States is going to be

 7      arguing that there is some international precedent here

 8      that's going to hurt it adversely, it needs to identify a

 9      particular body water abroad that it believes this case is

10      going to affect.

11                       JUSTICE GINSBURG:        Why should it make that

12      suggestion?           It would certainly not be in the interest of

13      the United States.

14                       MR. FRANKLIN:      Well, it -- it needs to explain

15      more specifically then, other than just stating we think

16      it might affect our position.                The -- the facts and

17      circumstances -- the Court, for example, applied the

18      historic bay question in Mississippi Sound, in the

19      Mississippi Sound case.             I am aware of no instance in

20      which that precedent was ever used adversely and the

21      United States has not identified any -- any instance.

22                       But more importantly, what this Court did in the

23      Mississippi Sound case is it looked at the evidence and it

24      said is this a historic bay or is it not.                The Court

25      concluded that it was and that was the inquiry that the

                                               26

 2                       At this point, I'd like to reserve the remaining

 3      time for rebuttal.

 7                                ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT

 8                       MR. MINEAR:      Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may

 9      it please the Court:

10                       I would like to begin with the focal point of

11      Alaska's argument, namely Glacier Bay National Park.

12      Alaska's core contention is that section 6(e) of the

13      statehood act does not provide an adequate showing that

14      the United States intended to retain the submerged lands

15      in Glacier Bay.            For this --

16                       JUSTICE SCALIA:         Could -- before you go into

17      that, could you tell me how 6(e) begins?

18                       MR. MINEAR:      Yes.     In fact, I think it's very

19      helpful.         It's listed at page 7a --

20                       JUSTICE SCALIA:         I mean, (e) --

21                       MR. MINEAR:      -- of our -- of the gray brief.

22                       JUSTICE SCALIA:         Yes, but the -- well -- well,

23      the -- the introduction to it is -- is not listed, is it?

24      I mean --

25                       MR. MINEAR:      That may -- that may be so.

 1                       JUSTICE SCALIA:       I mean, it's incomplete.        It --

 2      it just says all real and -- what about all real and

 3      personal property?          Is there an intro that says there is

 4      hereby -- there is hereby granted to the United -- to

 5      Alaska?

 6                       MR. MINEAR:     Well, 6(e) I think begins stating

 7      that this -- these are exceptions to section 5 which is

 8      the retention -- the general retention provision of the

 9      United -- for United States lands.

10                       But if we look at 6(e) itself, it's --

11                       JUSTICE SCALIA:       Well, you say they're

12      exceptions.           How -- how are the exceptions introduced?            I

13      mean, it's incomplete to just read (e) that says all --

14      what about all real and personal property of the United

15      States?        There has to be some introductory language.               What

16      is it?

17                       MR. MINEAR:     No.    Actually there doesn't, Your

18      Honor, because if you go on, it says all real and personal

19      property -- then you skip down, about halfway down --

20      shall be transferred and conveyed to the State of Alaska

21      by the appropriate Federal agency.                  So it is -- so this is

22      complete in terms of --

23                       JUSTICE SCALIA:       Okay.     Okay.   You're right.

24                       MR. MINEAR:     But if I could walk you through

25      those provisions because I think they're quite important.

 6                       MR. MINEAR:   It's followed by another provision

 7      here.

 8                       JUSTICE SCALIA:     To -- to Alaska.

 9                       MR. MINEAR:   To -- to Alaska.            Excuse me.

10                       And it's followed by another proviso which says

11      that the United States will continue to control fish and

12      game matters in Alaska until the Secretary of Interior has

13      certified that Alaska is ready to do so.                    Clearly that

14      proviso is not a subset --

15                       JUSTICE STEVENS:     Mr. Minear, before you get too

16      far, I also would like to ask a preliminary question that

17      was raised by Justice O'Connor before.                    Do you agree that

18      section 5 itself, the second part of it that says the

19      United States retains title to its own property, that the

20      response to that is adequately provided in the Submerged

21      Lands Act referred to in subparagraph (m)?

22                       MR. MINEAR:   No, I don't.            I don't believe --

23      let me frame the -- your -- your question, if I may, for

24      you.      Section 5 indicates the United States would retain

25      all of the lands that it presently holds.                    Section 6(m)

                                             29

 1      then makes the Submerged Lands Act applicable to the -- to

 2      the -- to Alaska.          In doing so, it recognizes that there

 3      are some lands the United States would continue to retain,

 4      provided it meets the requirements of the Submerged Lands

 5      Act.

 6                       The particular exception we're concerned about

 7      here is the expressly retained exception, in other words,

 8      if lands are retained by the United States.                 This Court

 9      said in the Arctic Coast case that that provision adopts

10      the general law that applied before the Submerged Lands

11      Act, that it had to be made plain that the United States

12      would be holding onto these lands.                 It doesn't require an

13      express statement.          It simply requires that it be made

14      plain.

15                       Now, our view is that these lands would be

16      retained by the United States, quite apart from 6 -- the

17      6(e) exception we're arguing about here on summary

18      judgment.          And if you denied our motion for summary

19      judgment, we'd go back and talk about the other exceptions

20      that are applicable.

21                       But in this case we're simply focusing on 6(e)

22      and we're focusing on that because the Court's Arctic

23      Coast decision made clear that 6(e) -- and I quote --

24      reflects the very clear intent to retain title, unquote,

25      to submerged lands, quote, so long as those submerged

 1      lands were among those set apart as refuges or wildlife --

 2      or reservations for the protection of wildlife.

 3                       JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, we didn't have this issue

 4      before us.          Let -- let me --

 5                       MR. MINEAR:     Yes, we did.

 6                       JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- let me -- why don't you go

 7      back to your argument?            You said that the first proviso on

 8      its face is simply not a subset of the first part of (e).

 9                       MR. MINEAR:     Yes.     It's an example how provisos

10      do not need to be --

11                       JUSTICE SCALIA:        But that's not the proviso at

12      issue here.

13                       MR. MINEAR:     Yes.

14                       JUSTICE SCALIA:        The proviso at issue here is

15      the second proviso which begins provided that such

16      transfer shall not include lands.                  Such transfer.   Now,

17      this is -- the word such refers you back to something.

18      What -- what possible transfer could it mean except the

19      end of the introduction, which says shall be transferred

20      and conveyed to the State of Alaska?

21                       MR. MINEAR:     Your Honor --

22                       JUSTICE SCALIA:        I mean, anybody reading that

23      would -- would think that proviso refers to that transfer

24      or at least it is not clear that it provides to -- that it

25      applies to every transfer in -- in the whole act.

 1                       MR. MINEAR:   I disagree with you, Justice

 2      Scalia, for these reasons.

 3                       First of all, the such transfer simply tells you

 4      what's not included.           That language tells you -- this is

 5      outside.         It doesn't mean that whatever follows

 6      necessarily was within the main clause.                   What Congress was

 7      doing here, by making clear that these lands were not

 8      transferred --

 9                       JUSTICE SCALIA:     What does the such refer to?

10                       MR. MINEAR:   It does refer to the transfer

11      before.        But what follows here, refuges and reservations

12      for the protection of wildlife, they do not fit within

13      that -- that main clause.            It's obvious they don't because

14      the only things that fit within the main clause are those

15      lands and real property specifically used for the sole

16      purpose of conservation and protection of wildlife.

17                       What we're talking about here -- wildlife

18      reservations are multiple purpose lands.                   They're not used

19      solely for -- for the purpose of conservation.                   The

20      purpose of the first provision here was to transfer

21      vehicles, fish hatcheries, other equipment that the State

22      would need to enforce Alaska game laws.                   That was the

23      point of -- of that first provision.                   But Secretary

24      Chapman who drafted this made clear in the legislative

25      history that what he was doing was drawing a line between

                                             32

 1      those -- those facilities and equipment that are used by a

 2      State in its traditional game management and drawing a

 3      contrast with the matters that would be retained by the

 4      United States.

 5                       JUSTICE BREYER:        Where is the language that says

 6      that the submerged land that fits the proviso is retained

 7      by the United States?

 8                       MR. MINEAR:      We do not need --

 9                       JUSTICE BREYER:        What the proviso says is just

10      what Justice Scalia said.

11                       MR. MINEAR:      We do not need express language

12      that expresses --

13                       JUSTICE BREYER:        No, no, but where is the

14      implication in that?

15                       MR. MINEAR:      The implication is that we are

16      retaining all of the reservation.                   And this is what the

17      Court said in the Arctic Coast decision.                   It saw that this

18      was --

19                       JUSTICE BREYER:        That's -- that's -- it -- I

20      mean, in -- in -- I take it in the Alaska case we were

21      considering a transfer that did fall within the main

22      sentence of (e).

23                       MR. MINEAR:      Justice Breyer, neither party made

24      that argument.            This issue came up in a letter that was

25      written after.            The -- the language --

 1                       JUSTICE BREYER:         Were we or weren't we?

 2                       MR. MINEAR:       You were not considering that.

 3                       JUSTICE BREYER:         We weren't.

 4                       MR. MINEAR:       That -- that was -- simply neither

 5      party suggested that ANWR fell within the first provision.

 6      And it doesn't.            It's clear that it doesn't.                It was not

 7      land that was specifically used solely for conservation of

 8      wildlife under these three listed statutes.                          The ANWR

 9      reservation at that time was set apart.                      It was BLM land.

10      It was also used for mining and other activities.

11                       Likewise, the other matters --

12                       JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But the Court did assume --

13      the Court did assume that.

14                       JUSTICE BREYER:         Yes.

15                       MR. MINEAR:       It made that assumption with no

16      briefing, but it did that with regard to the second issue

17      that was presented there.                The issue that people were

18      fighting about in the Arctic Coast decision was was this

19      land properly set apart or not for purposes of the

20      proviso.         And that's where this discussion takes place.

21                       JUSTICE BREYER:         All right.        Then --

22                       MR. MINEAR:       It's an afterthought that simply

23      reinforces.

24                       JUSTICE BREYER:         All right.        Then at best Alaska

25      is a neutral.             Because we didn't think it, we're operating

                                                 34

 1      as a mistake.             It's a neutral.       Okay.

 2                       Now, what's bothering me about the case is just

 3      what Justice Scalia said, that -- that why I -- if I sell

 4      you all my clothing and then I put, but not my camping

 5      gear, I mean, I can absolutely see you don't get my

 6      camping clothing, but you want to say that's a reservation

 7      of mess kits from some other transfer?                     I mean, it has

 8      nothing to do with mess kits.

 9                       MR. MINEAR:       Your Honor, but that's -- it's

10      clear that what this is -- this is more along the lines if

11      someone said that I will sell you my house, provided that

12      transfer shall not include the detached garage.

13                       JUSTICE BREYER:         Fine, and then it doesn't go in

14      that.

15                       MR. MINEAR:       In that case --

16                       JUSTICE BREYER:         But it doesn't mean that the

17      next --

18                       MR. MINEAR:       Yes, but it was not a part of the

19      house.

20                       JUSTICE BREYER:         Yes.

21                       MR. MINEAR:       You know, that's -- it's just

22      providing clarification, just that one of the purposes of

23      the proviso is to provide clarification.

24                       JUSTICE KENNEDY:         This is an abundance of

25      caution?

                                                 35

 1                       MR. MINEAR:     In other -- that is exactly right.

 2      And we can tell that from --

 3                       JUSTICE BREYER:       All right.        If it's an

 4      abundance of caution, where's the other language that

 5      almost reserves it so we need the caution?

 6                       MR. MINEAR:     That would be section 5.          It

 7      indicates the general retention for lands of this sort.

 8                       JUSTICE BREYER:       But 5 is subject to the

 9      Submerged Lands Act and the Submerged Lands Act brings you

10      back to the reservation has to be explicit.                    And then --

11      see, that's --

12                       MR. MINEAR:     Well, Justice Breyer, again, if I

13      can just complete the point --

14                       JUSTICE BREYER:       That's why I was talking about

15      Yellowstone.

16                       MR. MINEAR:     Yes.

17                       JUSTICE BREYER:       I was looking for something

18      that would be obvious that they wouldn't have meant to

19      transfer.          He comes back and says, well, very often States

20      do control the water.

21                       MR. MINEAR:     Your Honor, I just need to make a

22      point.        I think it's very important for you to understand

23      this point.           First of all, that at page 57 of the Arctic

24      Coast decision, this Court was clearly reading this

25      language, the 6(e) proviso, as sufficient to provide a

                                                36
                                    Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400          1-800-FOR-DEPO                   Washington, DC 20005
 1      clear indication of transfer of title, and in doing so, it

 2      was recognizing what is clear in the proviso itself, that

 3      these particular items that are discussed there are not a

 4      part of the main clause and cannot be.                  And a good example

 5      of that is the third thing that's being transferred,

 6      facilities that are utilized in connection with general

 7      research activities related to fisheries and wildlife.

 8                       Now, that is not going to be something that's

 9      specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and

10      protection of wildlife.            It's the antithesis of that.           It

11      makes quite clear that our construction is correct.                    The

12      subset theory just doesn't work because the items that are

13      here are not things that fit within the main clause.                    What

14      Congress was doing here was drawing a very clear line --

15                       JUSTICE KENNEDY:      But why -- why doesn't (m)

16      supersede that argument anyway?                Let's -- can't we say

17      that, well, you may be right so far as the second clause

18      of (e) is concerned, but you still have to deal with (m)?

19                       MR. MINEAR:    Then you have to explain what

20      happened in the Arctic Coast case, why we were able to

21      retain the ANWR lands which did not fall within the main

22      provision.          And that is because Congress was making --

23      because this Court concluded that Congress was making

24      clear that wildlife lands are very important and they

25      wanted to make absolutely clear that those lands would not

                                              37

 1      be transferred.           And even a provision that could be

 2      misconstrued, as I'm afraid this Court did in -- in Arctic

 3      Coast -- could be misconstrued to contain some of these

 4      lands, we need to make adequate assurance that -- that the

 5      courts that read this realize a clear division is being

 6      made.       We are retaining these wildlife lands.         That's --

 7                       JUSTICE SCALIA:       Mr. Minear, I'm -- I'm not sure

 8      I agree with you that -- that that language, facilities

 9      used in connection with general research activities

10      relating to fisheries or wildlife, is not a subpart of the

11      earlier -- of the earlier grant, namely property used for

12      the sole purpose of conservation and protection of

13      fisheries and wildlife.             Surely one -- one can readily

14      regard general research activities relating to fisheries

15      or wildlife to be part of the activity of conserving and

16      protecting fisheries and wildlife.

17                       MR. MINEAR:     But we're talking about a facility

18      here.       So a facility that might conduct some -- some

19      research tangentially related to wildlife is not a

20      facility that's used for the sole -- specifically used for

21      the sole purpose of conservation and wildlife.              There's a

22      clear difference here.            These two -- these two sets do not

23      overlap, and it's even more so with regard to wildlife

24      refuges.         Wildlife refuges and wildlife reservations are

25      used for multiple purposes.

 1                       At the time of statehood, the -- the regulations

 2      in place, the fisheries regulations and wildlife

 3      regulations, made clear that permits could be issued for

 4      purposes apart from wildlife conservation.                    And this

 5      Court's own decision in Udall v. Tallman recognized that

 6      one of the -- the refuges that Alaska cites as being

 7      included in the main clause was being used for oil and gas

 8      purposes.          It was not being used solely for the purposes

 9      -- specifically used solely for the purposes of

10      conservation.

11                       JUSTICE SCALIA:      Mr. Minear, you know, I -- I am

12      just overwhelmed by the reality that this is a terrible

13      mess of a statute.          I can't figure out what it means.

14                       MR. MINEAR:    Well, Your Honor --

15                       JUSTICE SCALIA:      And -- and it seems to me

16      that's exactly why we have a clear statement rule.

17                       MR. MINEAR:    Your Honor --

18                       JUSTICE SCALIA:      There are arguments here, there

19      are arguments there, but it -- it does not dawn upon me

20      that -- that anything is clear about this at all.

21                       MR. MINEAR:    Well, this -- we believe the

22      statute has been clear for 50 years.                    That's why these

23      issues have only arisen recently with regard to Glacier

24      Bay National Park.

25                       JUSTICE O'CONNOR:       Mr. Minear, what do you say

 1      are the practical consequences from the Federal

 2      Government's perspective of going -- of disagreeing with

 3      the U.S. position?          What harm is done?           Can the U.S.

 4      protect itself in any event under other clauses?

 5                       MR. MINEAR:    We agree that the United States has

 6      the regulatory authority to protect -- to limit vessel

 7      entries and protect commercial fishing, but that's not

 8      what our concern is.

 9                       Our concern is with the actual use of the

10      submerged lands.          This is a laboratory.           This is a

11      laboratory for scientific research, and we occupy and use

12      the submerged lands for that purpose.                   That includes such

13      things as withdrawing cores of materials so we can analyze

14      its historic features.           We've installed a 5-mile cable

15      with a hydrophone on the -- on the submerged lands so we

16      can listen to vehicle traffic and determine if the -- the

17      volume is sufficient to interfere with the whales that

18      migrate through there.

19                       JUSTICE SCALIA:      Don't you do that on -- on dry

20      land in some States?

21                       MR. MINEAR:    Your Honor, in order to hear

22      vehicle traffic --

23                       JUSTICE SCALIA:      Doesn't your authority under

24      the Commerce Clause or under -- under -- over navigable

25      waters allow you to do that kind of stuff?

 1                       MR. MINEAR:     Your Honor, we think that -- that

 2      Alaska would have a realistic argument that we cannot

 3      withdraw materials from the submerged land which we use

 4      and study.          And in fact, I would point out that the park

 5      superintendent's affidavit --

 6                       JUSTICE SCALIA:       Are they likely to do that?

 7                       MR. MINEAR:     What?

 8                       JUSTICE SCALIA:       Are they likely to do that?           Is

 9      this a real problem?

10                       MR. MINEAR:     There are 900 papers, scientific

11      papers, that are cited in the affidavit of the park

12      superintendent.           This is exhibit number 8 on count IV.

13      And of those describing the type of research we do in

14      Glacier Bay National Park --

15                       JUSTICE BREYER:       Well, I thought --

16                       MR. MINEAR:     -- scores and perhaps hundreds of

17      those involve submerged lands.

18                       JUSTICE BREYER:       All right.        Given what you're

19      saying -- and I -- you're not accepting this I think, and

20      I -- well, there is language in this act which maintains

21      in the United States title to the park.

22                       MR. MINEAR:     That is correct.

23                       JUSTICE BREYER:       All right.        Now, I would have

24      thought when you get title to the park, you mean the park,

25      and by the park, you mean those essential parts of the

                                               41

 1      park.

 2                       MR. MINEAR:    We --

 3                       JUSTICE BREYER:      And therefore, if you have a

 4      part of the park which is the only part of the park where

 5      people look at the park, and it's the only part of the

 6      park that brings them into the park, and it's the only

 7      part of the park where you do the research, et cetera,

 8      that's the park.          Just as if I were to sell my house and I

 9      list the rooms and forget the kitchen, well, the kitchen

10      is an essential part of the house.

11                       MR. MINEAR:    That's --

12                       JUSTICE BREYER:      Now -- now, once I made that

13      argument, he said that's a very clever argument, but

14      really, there are all kinds of instances where States have

15      reserved submerged land inside national parks and it's

16      worked fine.

17                       MR. MINEAR:    But those are instances --

18                       JUSTICE BREYER:      What's your response to all

19      this?

20                       MR. MINEAR:    The instances -- the examples

21      they're giving are cases in which we've created those

22      national monuments or parks after statehood.             And in those

23      cases, we cannot acquire those lands because they have

24      already been transferred to the State at statehood.

25                       JUSTICE SCALIA:      It hasn't resulted in a -- in a

 1      disaster.          That's the point that Justice Breyer is making.

 2                       MR. MINEAR:    But in this case --

 3                       JUSTICE SCALIA:      It has not resulted in a

 4      disaster.

 5                       MR. MINEAR:    But in this case, it is going to

 6      impede the -- the activities we have there.

 7                       And a good example of this is in the amicus

 8      brief at page 25 where Alaska does not even assent to our

 9      authority to control fish and wildlife.                     The Alaska

10      legislature has passed a statute in which it refuses to

11      assent to our authority to control fish and wildlife

12      within the park.          This gives you some sense of the type of

13      difficulties that we're going to encounter.

14                       JUSTICE SOUTER:      Mr. --

15                       MR. MINEAR:    And our chief concern --

16                       JUSTICE SOUTER:      Mr. Minear, may I ask you?             At

17      the time the statute was passed, was the national

18      Government conducting these activities?

19                       MR. MINEAR:    Yes, it was.            It was created as a

20      national monument.         Now, in terms of what degree of

21      activities, the record is not clear, but we're --

22                       JUSTICE SOUTER:      Maybe you were monitoring

23      passages through to see whether the whales were going to

24      be interfered with and doing that sort of thing.                     Were you

25      taking core samples?

 1                       MR. MINEAR:   We were definitely studying the bed

 2      of the lake, and our -- our briefs below explain.                     We have

 3      an affidavit from our glaciologist which describes the

 4      type of research that was being done.

 5                       JUSTICE SOUTER:      So in -- in other words, you --

 6      you're saying it is fair to say that at the time of the

 7      passage, this would have been on the congressional mind,

 8      going back to Justice Breyer's --

 9                       MR. MINEAR:   It -- it definitely would have.

10                       And also I want to point out that when we

11      created the national monument, we also preserved such

12      things as the interglacial forests.                    These are forests

13      that are left behind as the glaciers retreat and go

14      forward over these submerged lands.                    The glacial forests

15      are in the submerged lands, and so they become a part of

16      it.      As these glaciers continue to retreat, it's likely

17      that other glacial forests will be revealed, and those

18      should remain a part of the park.                That was part of the

19      purpose, was to study those --

20                       JUSTICE BREYER:      Should.     Now, you're not -- how

21      far are you prepared to go?             You can't go more than your

22      brief and your facts justify.                Are you prepared to say

23      that this water is an essential part of the park?

24                       MR. MINEAR:   Yes.

25                       JUSTICE BREYER:      Yes?

 1                       MR. MINEAR:     Yes.     Certainly --

 2                       JUSTICE BREYER:        Have you said that before this

 3      minute?

 4                       MR. MINEAR:     Not only have we said it, but the

 5      Park Service at statehood said that this is a water park

 6      when they were describing these lands and saying why they

 7      should be retained.            They told Congress -- the -- the park

 8      superintendent or the -- the director of the Park Service

 9      said this is a water park that's mostly -- this is, after

10      all, Glacier Bay National Park.

11                       And in that -- with that respect, I'd like to

12      point out this --

13                       JUSTICE SCALIA:        Why did they keep the other 80

14      percent then?

15                       MR. MINEAR:     Excuse me, Your Honor.

16                       JUSTICE SCALIA:        Why did they keep the other 80

17      percent?

18                       MR. MINEAR:     Well, the --

19                       JUSTICE SCALIA:        I gather only 20 percent of it

20      is water.

21                       MR. MINEAR:     It's slightly more than 20 --

22                       JUSTICE SCALIA:        They should have given away the

23      rest.

24                       MR. MINEAR:     We haven't given away.    We have all

25      of these lands.           The -- the uplands here are the glaciers

                                                45

 1      and the mountains that are inaccessible except by the

 2      water.        You cannot reach these areas.            There are no roads

 3      in this park except for the park visitors center, and

 4      beyond that --

 5                       JUSTICE SCALIA:      Then make it a water park.          I

 6      mean, you want to say it's a -- it's a water-accessible

 7      park, fine.

 8                       MR. MINEAR:   Yes.     But, Your Honor, the --

 9                       JUSTICE SCALIA:      20 percent of the park is under

10      water.        Right?

11                       MR. MINEAR:   More than 20 percent.         Roughly 25.

12      I'd say close to 25 percent of the park is -- within the

13      park boundaries is submerged lands.

14                       But there's another point I'd like to make with

15      regard to the establishment of the park.                 This park was

16      created under the Antiquities Act, and under the

17      Antiquities Act, the President is given authority to

18      create national monuments, but they cannot be

19      disestablished except by act of Congress.                 Now, Congress

20      could have disestablished this monument if it had meant to

21      give up the land.         It could have disestablished some part

22      of it, and it chose not to do so.                And yet, that's another

23      indication that Congress was intending to retain these

24      lands.

25                       Now, I would like to move on to the other two

                                              46

 1      counts we have here, unless we have further questions

 2      about -- about Glacier Bay.             But I -- I think one thing

 3      that I do -- one thought I want you -- to leave you with

 4      with regard to Glacier Bay is that these lands are

 5      essential to the park.          They are understood to be

 6      essential at the time that the park was created.                And the

 7      -- the line we're suggesting here is a very reasonable one

 8      with regard to this park.            Those lands are -- continue to

 9      be used -- the submerged lands for scientific research

10      that is vitally important.

11                       Now, I'd like to point out that the master also

12      correctly rejected the claim that the archipelago straits

13      are historic inland waters, and on that basis, Alaska

14      failed to satisfy any part of the Court's three-part test.

15      This Court specifically failed to show a continuous

16      assertion of -- of sovereignty to exclude vessels that

17      have -- that are visiting the park or passing through in

18      innocent passage or to indicate any acquiescence of

19      foreign nations.

20                       During the past 150-year period, neither Alaska

21      nor the United States ever attempted to exclude a vessel

22      based on -- merely on innocent passage.                Rather, Alaska --

23      Alaska cannot point to a single incident in which we

24      unambiguously did so.          The only --

 1      understand it now, that the -- the exclusion for purposes

 2      of fisheries regulation has the same implication as a

 3      matter of international law, which is a point that you

 4      disagree on.              What -- what is your response to their

 5      response to --

 6                       MR. MINEAR:        The answer is in order to establish

 7      a historic inland water claim, you have to exclude a

 8      vessel based on this passing through in innocent passage.

 9      Fisheries is not -- engaging in fishing activity under the

10      convention is not innocent passage.                         And so, therefore, an

11      exclusion based on fisheries can never -- can never give

12      rise to a claim of --

13                       JUSTICE SOUTER:          And what's -- what's your best

14      authority for that?

15                       MR. MINEAR:        Well, our best authority is the

16      convention itself.             The convention makes clear under

17      article 14 that fisheries is -- that fisheries activities

18      are not innocent passage.                 Rather, innocent passage is

19      merely transit through from one point to another.

20                       Moreover, the Marguerite incident that they

21      describe involves a single incident; that is, it does not

22      satisfy the continuity requirement that the inland -- the

23      historic inland waters test requires.

24                       And finally, it also didn't satisfy the

25      acquiescence test since the British Government protested

                                                  48

 1      the seizure of the ship.

 2                       And finally on top of that, this vessel -- we

 3      don't know exactly where this vessel was at the time that

 4      it was seized.            There continues to be a dispute and the

 5      master was unable to determine whether that -- the ship

 6      was in -- inside or outside the 3-mile limit.

 7                       Now, I'd also like to speak briefly to the

 8      juridical -- juridical bay claim as well.                  This is a

 9      matter that Alaska did not touch upon, but I imagine it

10      would address on rebuttal.

11                       The master correctly rejected Alaska's

12      extraordinary claim that the Alexander Archipelago can be

13      turned into two large -- large juridical bays.                   And

14      basically it attempted to do so by establishing a headland

15      on an island.             Now, that does not suffice the purpose of

16      the convention.            The only way that it can establish a bay

17      headland or -- or closing point is by showing that it's on

18      the mainland.             In order to establish that this is on the

19      mainland, Alaska has to ignore four intervening bodies of

20      water.        And as the master recognized, these bodies of

21      water are simply too substantial to ignore.                   In the case

22      of these bodies of water, Keku Strait is 41 miles long, on

23      average 4 and a half miles wide.                   It's -- simply those

24      intervening waters cannot be ignored in order to establish

25      that this is -- is part of the mainland.

                                                 49

 1                       It's also separated by Wrangell Narrows, which

 2      is a 12-mile-long strait that is an important passage for

 3      international navigation.             That too precludes it from

 4      being ignored and treated as dry land.

 5                       The failure of those two assimilations by itself

 6      is sufficient to establish that -- that these -- that

 7      these juridical bays do not exist.

 8                       And even if that were not enough, the master

 9      went on to say that this would not be a well-marked

10      indentation, that even if you were willing to assimilate

11      these lands, it's still the case that the bay itself would

12      not be -- the supposed, imaginary bays that Alaska has

13      created here would not be recognizable to a mariner who is

14      passing by.

15                       For all those reasons, the juridical bays here

16      are -- are simply not well founded, and the master was

17      correct in rejecting them.

18                       So what we see --

19                       JUSTICE O'CONNOR:       Mr. Minear, could I go back

20      to Glacier --

21                       MR. MINEAR:    Certainly, Your Honor.

22                       JUSTICE O'CONNOR:       -- Park again for a moment

23      and ask why the Government decided to base its claim to

24      the lands in Glacier Bay exclusively on that murky

25      provision of 6(e) rather than to talk about the standards

 1      set out in the Idaho case?

 2                       MR. MINEAR:    Well, Your Honor --

 3                       JUSTICE O'CONNOR:       Do you -- do you not rely on

 4      that standard --

 5                       MR. MINEAR:    Quite --

 6                       JUSTICE O'CONNOR:       -- of analysis?

 7                       MR. MINEAR:    Quite honestly we thought that

 8      under the Arctic Coast decision, the Court is required to

 9      create absolutely new -- no new law.                     It had already

10      interpreted 6(e) and it was clear that section 6(e)

11      applied to this case.

12                       We think the Idaho provisions provide another

13      opportunity for us to establish it.                     It's quite clear that

14      the purposes of the -- the lands here, the submerged

15      lands, are so essential to the park that it's simply

16      inconceivable that Congress would have intended for those

17      lands to pass out of ownership.

18                       However, we relied on --

19                       JUSTICE KENNEDY:      Would you -- would you tell us

20      again why, if you do not prevail on this argument, you

21      still go back before the -- the Special Master to show

22      certain facts?

23                       MR. MINEAR:    Well, first of all, Alaska has not

24      moved for summary judgment.              We moved for summary judgment

25      on some of our theories.            Other theories would require

                                              51

 1      some factual development.            One of the theories that we

 2      would -- we would go forward with is that these lands are

 3      occupied under a claim of right, and that's another

 4      exception under the Submerged Lands Act.

 5                       In addition, we would renew the argument with

 6      regard to Antiquities Act, that once Congress takes an

 7      area and authorizes the President to set it aside under

 8      the Antiquities Act and provides that it cannot be

 9      disestablished except by act of Congress, we think that's

10      a very clear indication of Congress' intent to retain

11      those lands.

12                       JUSTICE KENNEDY:     Well, given the absence of a

13      summary judgment, we wouldn't have to address that.

14                       MR. MINEAR:   No.    You would not have -- we -- we

15      believe the master adverted to this claim, but we do not

16      think that he foreclosed it.

17                       But rather, I'd like to discuss briefly the

18      relationship of Idaho and Alaska because I think it's

19      important and worthwhile.            We think that this case falls

20      squarely within the Alaska Arctic Coast case, and in

21      particular we relied on it primarily because it provides

22      an actual textual basis for showing that the -- the United

23      States retain those lands.            We do not need to go further

24      and show purpose, although we certainly can.            We relied on

25      the Alaska case because we think it provides a very clear

                                             52

 1      example of why retention is -- is required in this case.

 2                       The master agreed with us.             He analyzed the

 3      Arctic Coast decision and he concluded that the -- the

 4      proviso here necessarily must be considered an independent

 5      retention clause.         There's no other way to understand the

 6      Arctic Coast decision except on that basis.

 7                       And we think that's the right interpretation,

 8      and we think if we -- if you focus on what the Court said

 9      on pages 56 to 57, it becomes quite clear.                    The statement

10      that Alaska relies on to create its so-called subset test

11      is an afterthought at the end of the opinion.                    It's a

12      statement that's made in the Court's words to reinforce

13      the conclusion it's already reached.                    It doesn't provide a

14      basis for -- for departing from that.                    And in fact, as I

15      hope I have showed to the Court, the subset test doesn't

16      make any sense, that they're simply -- all of those lands

17      that fall within the proviso are lands that would not fall

18      within the main clause.

19                       The wildlife refuge is occupied for multiple

20      purposes.          It's -- the two wildlife refuges that they

21      point to both the record shows were used for multiple

22      purposes.          They were not used solely for conservation

23      purposes.          And in addition, they were -- to the extent

24      that those refuges adverted to any lands at all -- any

25      statutes, they were referring to a 1925 statute, not --

                                              53

 1      not the 1943 statute.

 2                       Furthermore, there are 24 other refuges that we

 3      believe that Congress intended to retain that Alaska has

 4      no answer for.            One -- one of those refuges, in

 5      particular, the Semidi Islands, quite clearly describes

 6      within its boundaries submerged lands, reefs, and other

 7      areas.        It clearly is being used for those purposes.               We

 8      think the right interpretation of the proviso is clearly

 9      that it was meant to ensure, to provide the clarity that

10      this Court needs to determine that Congress clearly did

11      intend to retain these lands.

12                       That was the point that -- that this proviso, as

13      Secretary Chapman himself indicated, and in fact, he

14      stated in -- the excerpt appears in page -- on page 47,

15      note 37 of our brief.             He stated that these reservations

16      -- the land and water would be reserved.                   He clearly was

17      aware and told Congress that that was the purpose here, to

18      reserve both land and water.

19                       Finally, I'd like to ask the Court to step back

20      and look at the big picture here.                   The United States'

21      position overall results in a very sensible division of

22      submerged lands in this case.                 We have not contested

23      Alaska's right to the vast majority of the submerged lands

24      here that are encompassed in Tongass National Forest.

25      Rather, we've identified two areas where the Federal

                                                54

 1      Government interests are paramount.

 2                       First of all, with regard to drawing

 3      international -- developing international principles to

 4      establish baselines, which creates these bays and -- and

 5      pockets, that's a necessary consequence of what our

 6      foreign policy requires.

 7                       Secondly, where the United States has clearly

 8      reserved a unique treasure, namely Glacier Bay National

 9      Park.       This park was set aside for the benefit of the

10      entire Nation.            We think that the Court should adopt the

11      master's report in full.

12                       Thank you.

13                       JUSTICE STEVENS:         Thank you, Mr. Minear.

14                       Mr. Franklin, you have about 3 and a half

15      minutes.

18                       MR. FRANKLIN:       Thank you, Your Honor.

19                       To get back to the Idaho case, we are, in fact,

20      advocating the principles of that case.                       It is not

21      sufficient that Congress be on notice of a reservation

22      that might include submerged lands.                       Congress has to take

23      some action to explicitly ratify that.                       That was what

24      happened in the Idaho case, according to the Court.                        And

25      the United States has identified one statute and one

                                                55

 1      statute only that it asserts can -- ratifies the bay, and

 2      that's section 6(e), the proviso.                We think the plain

 3      language to section (e) -- 6(e) is dispositive in this

 4      case.

 5                       We are operating here under a clear statement

 6      rule.       The presumption is, in fact, the strong presumption

 7      is, that if Congress does not expressly ratify the

 8      reservation, Congress is presumed not to have intended

 9      that the submerged lands -- title to submerged lands be

10      defeated.

11                       There was -- the statute says such transfer

12      shall not include.         There simply was no need for Congress

13      to have included -- to have specified that such transfer,

14      the main clause transfer, shall not include submerged

15      lands when they were not included -- or excuse me -- shall

16      not include properties that were not included in the first

17      place.        That includes Glacier Bay.

18                       JUSTICE SCALIA:     Would -- would you respond to

19      the -- to the argument that the Alaska Arctic Coast case

20      decided that the proviso goes beyond subsection (e)?

21                       MR. FRANKLIN:     Well, my -- my first response is

22      even the master, who ruled -- who -- who decided against

23      us, did not find that the Alaska case decided that, and

24      indeed, it could not have because the Court at pages 60

25      and 61 expressly assumed that the lands would fall within

                                             56

 1      the proviso.              Therefore -- excuse me.            The main clause.

 2      Therefore the Court did not hold and could not have held

 3      that lands that did not fall within the main clause were

 4      included by the proviso.

 5                       It is important, though, to -- to note this,

 6      that even if the statute is ambiguous -- and we think that

 7      it is not -- Alaska still prevails here because a -- there

 8      is a clear statement rule and a clear statement rule

 9      cannot be satisfied by definition by an ambiguous statute.

10                       JUSTICE SOUTER:          But the -- the argument is that

11      it is clear because the reservation without the

12      reservation of the waters would be crazy.

13                       MR. FRANKLIN:         Well, it --

14                       JUSTICE SOUTER:          Why isn't -- I mean, what's --

15      what's the answer?

16                       MR. FRANKLIN:         We dispute that for the following

17      reason, Your Honor, that -- that the -- the point of the

18      monument was to study the glaciers and the effects of the

19      glaciers as they recede on dry land.                        Title to the

20      submerged lands was simply not necessary for that purpose.

21                       But I think their sky-is-falling argument really

22      falls apart here.             All that the counsel can point to is

23      the idea is that they would like scientists to go scuba

24      diving down there and to perhaps look at the bottom.

25      There is absolutely no contention here that Alaska would

                                                  57

 1      -- would prevent scientists who want to study this --

 2      these lands from doing that.              We let scientists onto all

 3      of our properties, all of our submerged lands when they

 4      have a good reason for doing it.               We hope to work

 5      cooperatively with the Federal Government on this.

 6                       The -- the idea that Alaska is somehow going to

 7      be less receptive to scientific research here I think

 8      demeans our Federal structure.              We have a Federal

 9      structure here under which sovereignty of submerged lands

10      is given to the States because they are viewed as the ones

11      principally affected by the activities that go on there.

12      We are not planning on -- on preventing scientists from

13      scuba diving down there.            By the way, they did not at the

14      time of the monument, Your Honor, do scuba diving because

15      there -- there really wasn't any scuba diving going on.

16                       But to -- to move on -- I see my time is up.

17                       JUSTICE STEVENS:     Thank you, Mr. Franklin.

18                       The case is submitted.

20      above-entitled matter was submitted.)
