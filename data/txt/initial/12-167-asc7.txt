 6                ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN

 7                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8               MR. FEIGIN:        Yes, Your Honor, thank you.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you.

10               MR. FEIGIN:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

11   and may it please the Court:

12               The court of appeals' practice of

13   automatically granting appellate relief for every

14   violation of Rule 11(c)(1), irrespective whether it

15   prejudiced the defendant, is flawed.                    As this Court

16   recognized in United States v. Vaughn, Rule 11(h) was

17   adopted for the precise purpose of ending the

18   then-common practice of automatically reversing even for

19   non-prejudicial Rule 11 errors.

20               It would be especially inappropriate to

21   apply an automatic reversal rule in a case like this one

22   that comes to the appellate courts in a plain error

23   posture.

24               Erroneous judicial participation -

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              May -- may I ask you a

                                      3

                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   question about that?     It's plain error because the

 2   defendant didn't make an objection in the lower court.

 3   But the defendant doesn't know about Rule 11 and doesn't

 4   know about 11(c) that says a judge is not supposed to

 5   participate in plea bargaining, and his lawyer doesn't

 6   tell him the judge is doing something wrong because his

 7   lawyer wants him to plea.          So he lacks the information

 8   necessary to make a prompt objection.

 9               So it seems a bit unfair to say that he's

10   subjected to plain error when he hasn't got a clue that

11   the judge, magistrate wasn't supposed to do what he did.

12               MR. FEIGIN:        Well, first of all, Your Honor,

13   I'd respectfully disagree with the notion that just

14   because Respondent's counsel was advising him to plead

15   guilty, that Respondent's counsel had so advocated -- so

16   abdicated his representation that he couldn't be

17   expected to object to an error that the judge made.

18               I'd also point out that if the Court were to

19   create an exception to the plain error doctrine, this

20   would be a particularly inappropriate case in which to

21   do it because not only was there not a contemporaneous

22   objection, there wasn't an objection before the district

23   judge in the months and proceedings that followed.

24               They didn't raise any claim of error on

25   appeal until the court of appeals raised it.          And in

                                      4

 1   fact, in this case, Respondent did file a motion in the

 2   district court to withdraw his plea.                     And he didn't

 3   mention the magistrate's comments or any pressure he

 4   felt from those comments at all.

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Well, suppose you just

 6   stick with Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, or perhaps

 7   not even a hypothetical, what happened in this case.

 8   Just assume that the defense attorney likes this

 9   judicial intervention and he -- he wants this to take

10   place.   It -- it seems quite unfair to talk about the

11   plain error, because he doesn't tell -- as Justice

12   Ginsburg says, what does the defendant know about Rule

13   11(c)?   He doesn't know about it.

14                MR. FEIGIN:          Well, Your Honor, if Respondent

15   wants to make an ineffective assistance of counsel claim

16   on collateral review, he can make that.                     But I'm not

17   aware of any court of appeals that has abandoned the

18   plain error doctrine in this kind of case and I don't

19   think there should be any sort of special exception that

20   says when -- that we assume when counsel is advising his

21   client to plead guilty, that we can't expect counsel to

22   make objections to errors that occur based on the

23   judge's comments.

24                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 It doesn't really

25   matter -

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But this is a lawyer that

 2   had filed an Anders brief.            So he didn't -- even at that

 3   stage, the lawyer, the -- I don't want to absorb your

 4   time beyond this, but I think the plain error is

 5   questionable when it seems that the judge, the lawyer,

 6   they arranged against the -- the defendant, and the

 7   defendant doesn't know that he has this route.

 8               MR. FEIGIN:        Well, Your Honor, let me just

 9   say one other word about that.               I don't think it's going

10   to be easy for courts of appeals to tell exactly why the

11   lawyer may not have made an objection, and I just don't

12   think it's fair to assume that in every Rule 11(c)(1)

13   case that the lawyer is effectively acting at contrary

14   purposes to his client.

15               I mean, lawyers advise clients to plead

16   guilty all the time and that doesn't mean that they've

17   abandoned the representation to the point where you

18   can't assume they're acting on the client's behalf and

19   will raise objections.       But our basic point in this -

20               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Excuse me.   Does this

21   issue go -- it doesn't go to whether you should apply

22   the prejudice prong, because either under normal

23   harmless error or plain error you have to get to whether

24   it prejudices someone.

25               MR. FEIGIN:        That's exactly right, Justice

                                      6

 1   Sotomayor.   That was exactly the next sentence that was

 2   going to come out of my mouth is that our basic point in

 3   this case is that you have to apply prejudice analysis

 4   in some form, and whether it's harmless error or plain

 5   error, the court of appeals refuses to do it.                      And we

 6   think -

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 One of the most powerful

 8   arguments of your adversary is that in the most common

 9   of situations -- and it's how I read the advisory

10   notes -- it's going to be awfully difficult to say that

11   a judge's intervention hasn't influenced a defendant.

12   This is the unusual case where you might actually have a

13   no prejudice argument because of the unique facts.

14                But there is a purpose for keeping judges

15   out of this, and that's because the subtle influence

16   that judges exert is not so subtle.                      It's very palpable

17   and does influence most decision making, both by lawyers

18   and defendants.

19                So if that's the standard, why isn't it a

20   rebuttable presumption that prejudice exists?

21                MR. FEIGIN:          Well -

22                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 It has to be an awfully

23   high presumption, otherwise, you make mockery of the

24   rule, in my mind.

25                MR. FEIGIN:          Well, first of all, Your Honor,

 1   I want to take issue with the notion that all Rule

 2   11(c)(1) errors are alike.            There's actually a variety

 3   of different kinds of Rule 11(c)(1) errors.

 4               Rule 11(c)(1) has been held to cover, for

 5   example, a judge pressuring the government outside the

 6   defendant's presence to offer a plea, a judge

 7   discouraging a plea, a judge commenting in a

 8   well-intentioned manner about the obvious difference in

 9   potential sentencing consequences between a potential

10   plea agreement and a trial, or a judge, having rejected

11   one plea agreement that the parties reached, indicating

12   a bit too strongly what kind of plea agreement the judge

13   might accept.

14               I think adopting some sort of "one size fits

15   all" rule would -- would be inappropriate, and the

16   rebuttable presumption I think would also be

17   inappropriate, for a few reasons.

18               First of all, I don't think courts should

19   have to distinguish between different types of errors to

20   see whether a rebuttable presumption should apply.

21               Second of all -

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, I don't disagree

23   that one doesn't' have to use the word "rebuttable

24   presumption," but there has to be a strong prejudice

25   factor -

 1                  MR. FEIGIN:        Well, Your Honor -

 2                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- whether rebuttable or

 3   not, assumed in a judge's intervention.

 4                  MR. FEIGIN: -- I think that's already built

 5   into Rule 52 in a couple of different ways.

 6                  First of all, Rule 52 places a presumption

 7   based on whether or not the defendant objected.               If the

 8   defendant objected, the burden's on the government.                 If

 9   the defendant didn't object, the burden is on the

10   defendant.

11                  But also, I don't -- I want to be clear on

12   this:     The type of error -- if there is a very serious

13   error, the nature of the error and the error's

14   seriousness would of course be a factor, and a very

15   important factor, in the prejudice analysis.

16                  But, as Your Honor has recognized with this

17   case, there may be other circumstances that indicate

18   that the error did not in this case have a reasonable

19   probability of affecting the decision of the plea.

20                  JUSTICE BREYER:            But that's the problem.    Is

21   there a way of doing this, which I -- I don't see at the

22   moment?     But the judge intervenes in a serious way and

23   says, you go listen to your lawyer and this is a very

24   harsh penalty and, boy, you are into -- okay?               A serious

25   problem.

                                         9

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                  And now to track down whether that affected

 2   substantial rights, you have to try to track down the

 3   state of mind of the defendant and would he have pled

 4   guilty anyway.     And that's sometimes quite difficult to

 5   do, very hard.

 6                  But if you don't insist on doing it, and you

 7   have an absolute rule of structural error or something,

 8   then you suddenly discover these minor things.           The

 9   judge says, go to lunch, or -- or, you know, some really

10   trivial intervention, and you are going to say that -

11   the guilty plea, he can just void his guilty plea.

12                  So there should be a way of distinguishing

13   the trivial from the -- from the really important in

14   terms of how serious the intervention was, but I don't

15   see any way to do that.           Have -- have you thought about

16   that at all?     Do we have to go all the one way or all

17   the other way?

18                  MR. FEIGIN:        I have thought about that a

19   little bit, Your Honor, and I'd say that trying to break

20   Rule 11(c)(1) into different pieces and adopt different

21   rules based on different kinds of error would be

22   inappropriate, for three main reasons.

23                  The first one is I think it would be

24   inconsistent with this Court's position in Neder v. the

25   United States, which makes clear that in deciding

                                        10

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   whether an error is structural you have to look at the

 2   entire class of errors.

 3               And Rule 11(c)(1) defines the class of

 4   errors as cases in which a judge participates in plea

 5   negotiations in some way, and it doesn't define

 6   subcategories.

 7               Second, I think breaking this up into pieces

 8   would essentially be an incomplete and unsatisfactory

 9   form of prejudice analysis.            That is, reviewing courts

10   would still be looking at errors and differentiating

11   between them in order to decide whether relief is

12   warranted, but they would be narrowly focused only on

13   the binary inquiry of how to categorize the error,

14   they'd be disregarding how serious that particular error

15   was versus other errors in that category, and they would

16   be disregarding all the other facts and circumstances

17   the courts always look at and are well familiar with how

18   to look at in a normal prejudice analysis, to determine

19   whether the error affected the outcome.

20               Third, particularly because the

21   subcategories don't exist in the rule and would be

22   something of judicial invention, I think that approach

23   would be inherently inadministrable and manipulatable

24   and lead to inconsistent results.

25               It could be very difficult to tell whether a

                                     11

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   particular type of error should fall into one category

 2   or another, and under the approach you're suggesting,

 3   which I think is the approach Respondent is

 4   advocating -- I don't think Respondent is actually

 5   advocating the per se rule that the Eleventh Circuit

 6   adopted here -- I think under that approach, you know,

 7   everything turns on a narrow question of categorization.

 8                  I think the much better approach, and the

 9   approach that Rule 52 adopts, is to look at all the

10   facts and circumstances to attempt to determine the

11   effect on the outcome.

12                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Feigin, is there any

13   situation in which a -- a judge participating in a plea

14   bargaining, any situation that would be prejudicial,

15   that you recognize would be prejudicial, and if there is

16   can you describe what that would be?

17                  MR. FEIGIN:        Certainly, Your Honor.

18                  We -- the government loses many of these

19   cases even in circuits that have prejudice analysis.                  In

20   fact, one example the Court might want to look to, there

21   was a certiorari petition I think filed at the end of

22   last term, a case, 11-8966, Rebollo-Andino, which was a

23   case of Rule 11(c)(1) error.                The government conceded

24   that even on a plain error analysis that that was

25   prejudicial.

                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               I can describe -

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              What -- what makes it

 3   prejudicial and this not?

 4               MR. FEIGIN:        Well, let me take -- let me

 5   take a different example.

 6               The Fourth Circuit's decision in United

 7   States v. Bradley, the judge essentially told the

 8   defendants that he -- it boggled his mind that they were

 9   going to trial and kept essentially harassing them about

10   why they were going to trial.              And, eventually, they

11   said, all right, Your Honor, we are going to -- we're

12   going to plead guilty.       I mean, that kind of thing

13   obviously is going to be prejudicial.

14               But the advantage of a prejudice approach is

15   it allows you to separate that kind of case from kinds

16   of cases when there are less serious errors, or even a

17   case where there is a fairly serious error -- and this

18   case may fall within that category -- but there are

19   facts and circumstances that indicate that the error

20   didn't have a reasonable probability of affecting the

21   defendant's decision to plead.

22               And while we're not asking the Court to

23   resolve the prejudice analysis here in the first

24   instance, we -- we're just asking the Court to remand

25   the case to the court of appeals to do that, I think

                                     13

 1   it's just worth noting that -- a couple of the factors.

 2   One is that -- there was a 3-month break between the

 3   magistrate judge's comments and the entry of the plea,

 4   and a month into that a speedy trial motion was filed,

 5   which indicated at least some intent at that point to go

 6   to trial.

 7                 The plea and the sentencing occurred in

 8   front of the district judge, not the magistrate judge

 9   who made the comments.

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              On that point, do we

11   know -- do we know if the district judge who did preside

12   at the plea hearing knew about the episode with the

13   magistrate 3 months earlier?

14                 MR. FEIGIN:        I don't -- I'm not aware of

15   anything in the record that reflects whether he did or

16   did not.    There's never been an allegation that -- that

17   he said something about them, or that he was aware of

18   them or -

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              The same for the

20   prosecutor?

21                 MR. FEIGIN:        Your Honor, my understanding is

22   the government was not aware of this because it occurred

23   in an ex parte hearing in which the government wasn't in

24   attendance.    The government wasn't aware of it until the

25   Eleventh Circuit conducted its own review of the record

                                       14

 1   and asked for further briefing on the issue.

 2                 JUSTICE ALITO:            Suppose there's a case where

 3   the -- the defendant would not have pled guilty without

 4   the court saying something inappropriate about it's a

 5   case where the defendant would be crazy to go to trial

 6   because the trial would lead to a much more severe

 7   sentence.    Would there be prejudice there?

 8                 MR. FEIGIN:        Yes, Your Honor.         He has a

 9   right to go to trial if he wants to go to trial, even if

10   it would be crazy.     So under that circumstance, if he

11   wouldn't have, you know, pleaded guilty without the

12   erroneous comments from the judge, there would be

13   prejudice.

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             That's -- what happens

15   under -- under the rule if the magistrate asked that the

16   defendant be excused -- I don't know quite how you do

17   that; the defendant has to be present.                  But can the -

18   can the judge just have the attorneys before him and

19   say, now, I want you to be very, very clear that this is

20   a mandatory minimum, that we should try to avoid if at

21   all possible.

22                 Can he do that?

23                 MR. FEIGIN:        Well, Your Honor, I think

24   that's -

25                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             It's awfully hard to have

                                       15

 1   a hypothetical where you exclude the defendant.

 2               MR. FEIGIN:        Well, Your Honor, this actually

 3   happened in a non-hypothetical fashion in a case we cite

 4   in our reply brief, called In re United States, in which

 5   the judge was apparently unhappy with the Government's

 6   conduct in that case and had the prosecutor and defense

 7   counsel in chambers, or at least in court, without the

 8   defendant's presence, and was urging the parties to

 9   reach a plea agreement.

10               I think if something like that happens, Your

11   Honor, there'd be some question whether the defendant

12   was made aware of it, and whether it actually influenced

13   the defendant's decision to plead.                    I don't think there

14   can be a presumption that just because counsel heard it,

15   that necessarily -

16               JUSTICE ALITO:            What -- what if the judge

17   sees what the judge thinks is ineffective assistance of

18   counsel under our decision in Lafler taking place?                    Is

19   there anything that can be done?

20               MR. FEIGIN:        So -- Your Honor, I think one

21   of our main concerns in bringing this case before the

22   Court is the interaction of this Court's decisions in

23   Lafler and Frye with Rule 11(c)(1), and Frye suggests

24   that one way a judge can try to guard against a later

25   claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is to conduct

                                     16

 1   a colloquy with the defendant -- not a colloquy, but a

 2   discussion with the defendant -- during the initial

 3   proceedings to try to establish that he understands the

 4   consequences of his plea and that he's receiving

 5   effective assistance of counsel.

 6               I think that could be done very carefully by

 7   asking very general questions, but I think it's very

 8   easy to see how a judge might slip up and say, oh,

 9   that's an interesting offer.              Did you discuss that with

10   your counsel?   That seems like something you ought to

11   discuss with your counsel.

12               And I think what the automatic reversal rule

13   the court of appeals has adopted is it really puts

14   judges, and, frankly, the government, in kind of a box.

15   On the one hand, judges have to guard against these

16   later ineffective assistance of counsel claims by

17   discussing plea discussions, and on the other hand, any

18   slipup in that discussion is going to lead to automatic

19   reversal on appeal.

20               Now, I -- I just want to add one -- one more

21   thing, which is, I think, the best evidence that we have

22   that this -- the magistrate judge's comments here did

23   not create a reasonable probability of effecting the

24   defendant's decision to plead is, again, defendant

25   himself moved pro se to withdraw his plea in the

                                      17

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   district court, and his reasons for withdrawing his

 2   plea, which start on page 58 of the Joint Appendix,

 3   never mention the magistrate's comments.              Instead, in

 4   his own words, what he says is, "Your Honor, my decision

 5   to enter the plea was a strategic decision.

 6               The reason being is that I knew that the

 7   prosecutor had a duty with the courts to disclose the

 8   information relevant for this court's determination of

 9   the acceptance or rejection of the plea."

10               And what he means by that is that he took

11   issue with some aspects of the allegations in the

12   indictment, although he's quite clear, both in that

13   proceeding and at his guilty plea proceeding, that he

14   did commit the conspiracy offense, and he just believed

15   that those allegations in the record would be cleaned up

16   or have to be withdrawn by the prosecutor if he pleaded

17   guilty.

18               Now, he was wrong about that.              But what we

19   have in this case is a clear unvarnished explanation by

20   the defendant in his own words about why he pleaded that

21   doesn't mention the magistrate's comments.

22               The Court of Appeals erred in disregarding

23   that.

24               And if the Court has no more questions, I'll

25   reserve the balance of my time.

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                       Thank you, counsel.

 3               ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT M. YABLON

 4                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 5               MR. YABLON:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 6   please the Court:

 7               By imploring Anthony Davila to forego his

 8   trial rights, confess his alleged crimes, and accept a

 9   plea deal, the magistrate judge abandoned his role as

10   neutral arbiter and fundamentally distorted the pretrial

11   process.

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:                I -- I don't want to

13   interrupt your opening because I think -- I just didn't

14   hear your first -- "by foregoing"?

15               MR. YABLON:           By foregoing -

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:                By foregoing.

17               MR. YABLON:           -- his trial rights.

18               This -- the right at issue in this case is

19   not one that should be subject to post hoc speculation.

20   Judges, when an error of this kind occurs -

21               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  You're creating a sui

22   generis structural error analysis.                       You're basically -

23   because even with respect to constitutional violations

24   that we have found structural error in, we've created

25   the plain error rule that still requires a proof of

                                        19

 1   prejudice.    So you're asking us to create something

 2   that's really sui generis in saying it's always a

 3   structural error.

 4                 MR. YABLON:         That's -- that's not correct,

 5   Your Honor.    First, let's put to one side the fact that

 6   we do argue that we should not be in a plain error

 7   framework at all in this case because of the

 8   circumstances in which the judge's improper intervention

 9   occurred.

10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Assume I accept that

11   argument.

12                 MR. YABLON:         So this Court has -

13                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                You're -- you're saying

14   this is a structural error always.

15                 MR. YABLON:         And this Court has, at the very

16   least, strongly suggested that substantial rights when

17   you're dealing with a structural error are affected, per

18   se, where they've left the door open to some additional

19   analysis is the fourth prong of the plain error standard

20   where the Court is called upon to consider whether the

21   error affects the fairness, integrity, or public

22   reputation of the proceedings.

23                 And the government has never, in this case,

24   invoked that fourth prong.               They've never claimed that

25   the error here is one that -- that does not affect the

                                        20

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the fairness, integrity, or public reputation.

 2                 So when you're only dealing with the third

 3   prong of the plain error standard, does the error affect

 4   substantial rights, that language is the same in Rule

 5   52(b), the plain error standard, as it is in Rule 52(a),

 6   affects substantial rights, and if it means in Rule

 7   52(a) that this is the sort of error for which an

 8   individualized prejudice inquiry is not appropriate,

 9   then the same analysis necessarily carries over to Rule

10   52(b).

11                 So I would not say that this is at all the

12   kind of sui generis example that -- that you're

13   indicating.

14                 And I do want to -- to -- and try to show

15   that this error is quite similar, both to constitutional

16   and nonconstitutional violations in with -- which this

17   Court has said that an error should be said to affect

18   substantial rights without the sort of specific showing

19   of prejudice that the government is demanding.

20                 When you have a judge that, as in this case,

21   is stepping out of his proper role, is acting contrary

22   to his duties to guard against ill-considered and

23   involuntary waivers of the defendant's basic trial

24   rights, is actually ratcheting up the already tremendous

25   pressure on the defendant to plead guilty, that is a

                                       21

 1   systematic distortion of the process.                    That is not

 2   unlike the kind of error that occurs when a defendant is

 3   denied an impartial adjudicator.                 It is not unlike the

 4   kind of error that occurs when a defendant is denied

 5   counsel or is forced to -

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    What -- what if you

 7   have the situation where the judge is conveying purely

 8   factual information?     There's a -- a plea bargain on the

 9   table for one year and the judge says, you should know

10   that I -- I have these cases a lot.                    The last ten cases

11   that went to trial where the defendant was found guilty,

12   I sentenced them to a minimum of 12 years.                    Pure facts.

13               The facts might have the effect of pushing

14   the defendant one way or another, but it's also factual

15   information of which he ought to be aware.

16               MR. YABLON:        That's right, Your Honor, and

17   this raises a question about what the scope of the

18   participation prohibition actually is.

19               And we're in a strange posture in this case

20   because the government has conceded that we're dealing

21   with a conceded plain violation of the rule, and yet

22   their analysis, instead of proceeding from that

23   violation, it goes out to the periphery and tries to

24   figure out where are the boundaries of Rule 11.

25               Now -- and they cite some appellate cases

                                     22

 1   that arguably have applied too broad a construction of

 2   the rule and have reversed where maybe there was just a

 3   one-off comment or a purely informational comment, but

 4   it's not clear that that is actually what the text of

 5   Rule 11 forbids, particularly when you consider the

 6   context of the rule and its underlying purposes.                         So -

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      Well, we do need to

 8   have a good sense of how far your -- your per se

 9   structural argument is going to reach before we

10   decide -- in deciding whether it's appropriate or not.

11                MR. YABLON:          That's right, Your Honor, and

12   there are -- there are two ways to break it down.                        One

13   is we do argue that the remedy that we seek should apply

14   for all cases of judicial participation.                       And the

15   question then is:     Are judicial participation violations

16   as expansive a category as the government suggests that

17   they are?

18                Our second argument is that -

19                JUSTICE KAGAN:              Well, on that, what's the

20   most minor thing that the government could do that would

21   still count as a Rule 11(c)(1) violation?

22                MR. YABLON:          The most minor thing that the

23   government could do or a judge could do?

24                JUSTICE KAGAN:              That the judge could do.

25   I'm sorry.

                                        23

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               MR. YABLON:          Well, the most minor -- we

 2   think that Rule 11 is concerned with judicial pressure

 3   to plead guilty.   And so the most -- I mean, a judge

 4   might make a comment that, viewed from the transcript,

 5   would suggest that the evidence against the defendant is

 6   overwhelming or that the defendant is likely to get a

 7   much lower sentence if he pleads guilty than if he goes

 8   to trial.   Those we think are -

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      What -- what about

10   the hypothetical that I posed?

11               MR. YABLON:          So that hypothetical, if -- if

12   we were talking about a purely informational statement

13   like that, then, actually, we don't think that that is

14   likely to be a violation of Rule 11(c)(1).                      And the

15   reason is, if you look at 11(b), the rule expects that

16   judges are, in fact, going to be offering a lot of

17   advice to defendants before the defendant pleads guilty.

18               And so if a judge is making the kinds of

19   comments that Rule 11(b) is contemplating, informing the

20   defendant about the nature of the charges against him,

21   attempting to make sure that the defendant understands

22   that his trial right is a real one, telling the

23   defendant a little bit about what, in fact, the -- the

24   sentencing exposure might be if he is convicted, those

25   purely informational statements we don't think is what

                                       24

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   is meant to be prohibited by the rule.

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So if he -- if it's

 3   my example and he says, this is what I've done the past

 4   ten times, so you ought to think long and hard about

 5   whether a bargain for one year is a good deal.

 6                MR. YABLON:        So -- and -- and this is

 7   getting -- and then the judge may well be crossing the

 8   line.   And what the judge -

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    It's kind of a fine

10   line to -- to draw, isn't it?

11                MR. YABLON:        There's no question that there

12   will be close cases.      I would say that if you look to

13   the majority of cases that are actually out there, most

14   judges, of course, are very scrupulous about following

15   the rule.   And when a judge is not, the judge is not

16   usually being circumspect about it, the judge is trying

17   to get a message across to the defendant.

18                And so there may be difficult line-drawing

19   cases, and that's true whether you're looking at the

20   remedial approach that we're asking for or the remedial

21   approach that the Government's asking for.

22                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Yablon, the -- the

23   case that you're presenting would be quite strong if the

24   same judge -- if the magistrate judge also presided at

25   the plea hearing, but here we have two factors that are

                                      25

 1   special in this case.        One is it's a different judge,

 2   and two is we have the interval of some three months in

 3   between.   And then we have a plea hearing that looks to

 4   me like it's exemplary.          The district judge did go

 5   through everything that Rule 11 calls for.

 6                 So it is a different case, isn't it, when we

 7   have a plea hearing with a judge who is exerting no

 8   pressure at all, has nothing to do with encouraging the

 9   defendant to plead, but there was an earlier episode

10   where a magistrate judge did overbear?

11                 MR. YABLON:        And at no point during the plea

12   colloquy hearing is the district judge in any way

13   acknowledging or disavowing the magistrate judge's

14   comments, which, we submit, there is at least a very

15   strong probability that those comments affected the

16   defendant's thinking and the reason that the defendant

17   is at the Rule 11 hearing in the first place.

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But -- but the -- but the

19   judge did ask, do you recognize that your -- your

20   conduct satisfied the elements of the conspiracy?                 And

21   the defendant answered yes.              And the -- the judge asked,

22   has anyone pressured you to plead guilty?                And he

23   answers no.    So -

24                 MR. YABLON:        And, of course, in that

25   situation, the defendant is likely not thinking about

                                       26

 1   pressure that may come from the judiciary itself.                  And

 2   also, not to nitpick but when he's asking that pressure

 3   question he's asking whether anyone pressured him to

 4   plead guilty today, which may not cause the defendant to

 5   think back on why he started down the negotiation road.

 6                  I think an important -

 7                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Mr. Yablon, I agree with

 8   you totally.     I'm not as much convinced in the delay in

 9   pleading because defendants often think about it and I

10   can imagine a hypothetical where the lawyer comes in and

11   says:   I told him to plead guilty and he said to me:                    I

12   don't want to, but the judge told me to.

13                  So I don't think the time limit -- we don't

14   know if that happened.          But what did happen is that the

15   defendant made a motion to withdraw his plea and he

16   directly said:     "I entered the plea because I

17   strategically decided that the government would

18   eventually have to come forward and vacate the charges

19   against me."     He said it himself with no pressure by a

20   lawyer, because he was making the motion.                  How do you

21   get past that statement?

22                  MR. YABLON:        That statement reveals just how

23   little confidence we actually should have in the plea

24   decision that he made.          Here is a defendant who for the

25   better part of a year was adamant about his desire to go

                                        27

 1   to trial and exercise his rights.                       It's the reason that

 2   the in camera hearing happened in the first place,

 3   because he was unhappy that the lawyer just wanted him

 4   to plead guilty.     After that hearing, suddenly there are

 5   plea negotiations and a plea deal, which it's clear that

 6   he is never happy about from the start.

 7                Even at the plea hearing, he is attempting

 8   to tell the judge:     Look, I don't think that my conduct

 9   actually is consistent with the conspiracy charge as

10   alleged.   And he says later at the sentencing hearing

11   when they are discussing the withdrawal motion that

12   basically he went forward because his lawyer was

13   instructing him that it was the right thing to do.                       And

14   if you look at that sentencing -

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                But that is the whole

16   point, which is this may be IAC, but I don't know how -

17   how you prove that what the magistrate judge said to him

18   led to his decision.

19                MR. YABLON:         And we don't need to prove

20   that.

21                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                That's only if we don't

22   accept that prejudice is a consideration here.

23                MR. YABLON:         Either way, if you were looking

24   at whether this conduct should be viewed as inherently

25   prejudicial the reason that you might do that is because

                                       28

 1   you might think that at least in all of these cases

 2   there might at least be a reasonable probability that it

 3   would affect where the defendant is.                  And here you have

 4   a defendant who has been adamant that he's not going to

 5   plead, and when you have the judge making these comments

 6   in front of the defendant, having him lose confidence in

 7   his right to go to trial, then it's likely that that is

 8   shifting the defendant's mind set in a way that gets him

 9   to the negotiating table.          And it also reaffirms the

10   defense lawyer's position in this case.

11               And so you have a defense lawyer who may

12   then go back to the prosecutor and say:                  We're just

13   going to get this deal done, and it may not be the deal

14   that the defendant would otherwise have wanted reached.

15               JUSTICE BREYER:            You want us to basically

16   not apply the 11(h), the harmless error business, and

17   you basically want to prevent bizarre results by making

18   a tough definition of the word "participate."                  That's

19   how I understand you.      And maybe you are right, but it

20   sounds to me as you say it in reading the briefs that

21   this is really a job for the rules committee.

22               This is a rule.            We don't normally have

23   structural errors with respect to rules.                  We have rules

24   committees there to listen to this kind of complaint, to

25   weigh it in the system as a whole and to come up with

                                     29

 1   better rules.

 2                  MR. YABLON:        Let me address that in two

 3   ways, because we have two separate arguments and I want

 4   to try to keep them distinct.                 One is that if you look

 5   at the text and the history of Rule 11, there is strong

 6   evidence that Congress actually made an affirmative

 7   judgment not to sweep in Rule 11 violations within the

 8   scope of Rule 11(h).

 9                  Our second argument is even if Rule 11(h)

10   applies to all Rule 11 errors, that all Rule 11(h) does

11   is apply the same substantial rights language that you

12   see in Rule 52(a) and (b).               And this Court has

13   recognized that, while that substantial rights language

14   is often synonymous with a case of specific prejudice

15   inquiry, that's not always true.                    And there are a number

16   of examples.     The Court is familiar with the

17   constitutional cases in which the Court has said that an

18   error is structural without trying to determine, make a

19   case-specific determination of prejudice.

20                  But there are a number of nonconstitutional

21   cases as well in which the Court has said an

22   individualized prejudice inquiry is simply

23   inappropriate, that the error affects substantial rights

24   by its nature.     So one example that I think is fairly

25   close to the one we have here is Gomez v. United States,

                                        30

 1   where you have the Court addressing a statutory

 2   provision that prevents magistrate judges from

 3   conducting the jury voir dire and that proviso is

 4   violated and the Court is asked to conduct a prejudice

 5   analysis:    Did it matter that the magistrate judge

 6   conducted voir dire?

 7            And the Court said:             We are not going to go

 8   there; this is in effect a structural defect in the

 9   proceedings.

10                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, Mr. Yablon, have we

11   ever said that about the violation of a rule of criminal

12   procedure, that it's structural error no matter what the

13   circumstances?

14                  MR. YABLON:        First, Justice Sotomayor, this

15   Court has said that rules of criminal -- I'm so,

16   sorry -

17                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               That's not the first

18   time that has happened.

19                  MR. YABLON:        And I should be -

20                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            You worked for her, too, I

21   think.

22                  MR. YABLON:        That makes it that much more

23   embarrassing.     She used to sit over there.

24                  This Court has said that Federal rules and

25   statutes stand on equal footing, so whether we are

                                        31

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   talking about applying this with respect to a rule or a

 2   statute, it shouldn't make a difference; the analysis

 3   should be the same.      And in fact there is at least one

 4   case where the Court did apply in effect the structural

 5   analysis to -- to a rule violation and a second case in

 6   which the Court at least left open the possibility.

 7                So the case in which the Court did so is the

 8   McCarthy case, which is discussed extensively in the

 9   briefs.   The Court referred to the 1966 version of Rule

10   11 and said that prejudice adheres in a violation of

11   that rule and that it was not going to conduct an

12   individualized analysis.          It was simply going to grant

13   relief where there had not been full compliance with

14   that provision.

15                Of course, the rule has been amended since

16   then, but that provides evidence that the Court is not

17   unwilling to adopt this kind of rule in the context of

18   the Federal Rules.

19                JUSTICE KAGAN:            I would think, Mr. Yablon,

20   that one of the effects of what you are asking us to do

21   is that the rule would just get narrower and narrower.

22   In other words, if automatic reversal is always the

23   effect of finding a violation -- and I think you

24   acknowledge this in a way -- that people will just find

25   fewer and fewer violations.             And I'm wondering why we

                                      32

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   should do something like that rather than interpret the

 2   rule as it was meant to be interpreted, but then say:

 3   You know, somebody can look and say it really just

 4   didn't matter that it was violated in this case.

 5                  MR. YABLON:        So we think that our approach

 6   is consistent with how the rule is in fact meant to be

 7   interpreted.     The rule really is about this problem of

 8   placing judicial pressure on defendants to plead guilty,

 9   and those are the cases that ought to be reversed.

10                  But the Court has a line-drawing decision to

11   make either way.     Either the line that the Court should

12   focus on is the line that separates participation from

13   nonparticipation or, again, a narrower class of

14   participation.     And I want to get to this point that -

15                  JUSTICE ALITO:            But you are arguing for a

16   narrower interpretation of Rule 11(c)(1) than a number

17   of courts of appeals have adopted, isn't that correct?

18                  MR. YABLON:        I believe there are some

19   decisions out that have adopted probably a broader

20   construction than we think is necessary and appropriate.

21   But what is easier for reviewing courts to monitor?                  Is

22   it easier for them to monitor the narrowing, the

23   improper narrowing of the rule over time, or is it

24   easier for them to monitor improper applications of the

25   harmless error rule, especially applications of it that

                                        33

 1   are happening in this kind of setting, where it's going

 2   to be almost inherently a very speculative analysis, an

 3   attempt to read the defendant's mind and ascertain

 4   whether the defendant was influenced by what the judge

 5   was saying.

 6                 And it would be much easier for appellate

 7   courts to focus on the line-drawing exercise that

 8   determines whether or not a violation had occurred or,

 9   if you think that the rule is broader, whether the kind

10   of violation that occurred in this case occurred, than

11   it would be to try to make this case-by-case scouring

12   the record, individualized prejudice determinations.

13                 JUSTICE ALITO:            Could you say something

14   about Mr. Feigin's comments regarding what a judge can

15   and cannot do if the judge thinks that he or she sees a

16   violation of Lafler and Frye taking place?

17                 MR. YABLON:        So there ought to be things

18   that a judge is able to do in that situation.              Suppose,

19   for example, that the judge becomes aware that the

20   defense attorney has given the -- his client false

21   information about the elements of the charge.              It would

22   not violate Rule 11(c)(1) for the judge to say:              I

23   understand that you were told that the elements of the

24   charge are A, B, and C, but in fact they are X, Y, and

25   Z.

                                       34

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 So there are -- there are certainly steps

 2   that a judge can take to help root out the violation.

 3   And I would say that the fact is that generally when it

 4   comes to ineffective assistance of counsel claims there

 5   is only so much that the trial could court can do.              So

 6   the fact that the trial court may not be able to solve

 7   or prevent every ineffective assistance claim in this

 8   context is not necessarily an argument against the rule,

 9   because the judge often is not aware of the privileged

10   communications.

11                 JUSTICE ALITO:            What if the judge knows as a

12   result of pretrial motions that the evidence in the case

13   is very, very strong.

14                 Let's say there's a -- there's been a motion

15   to suppress extremely incriminating evidence and the

16   motion has been denied, so the judge knows this is going

17   to come in.    And the judge thinks if this comes in,

18   there's virtually very little chance that the defendant

19   is going to be acquitted, and yet the defendant -- and

20   the judge knows that a plea bargain -- a plea offer was

21   made and the defendant initially was going to take it,

22   and then before it was accepted, it's rejected.

23                 Is there anything a judge can do in that

24   situation?    Just sit back and, you know, wait for the

25   case to be -- to be reversed?

                                       35

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                MR. YABLON:        Well, the judge's role in that

 2   situation is -- is not to step in as defense counsel or,

 3   in effect, as second prosecutor.                  The judge -- I think

 4   that there may be ways in that case for the judge to try

 5   to alleviate the error without -- without crossing the

 6   line.   But when -- but when you start to make exceptions

 7   in that -- in that situation, you -- you go down the

 8   road of -- of the judge being the one who is evaluating

 9   the evidence and who is, in effect, potentially

10   presuming the defendant's guilt.                  And the judge -

11                JUSTICE ALITO:            It just puts -- puts the

12   judge in a very difficult position.                    It could -- can the

13   judge say, you -- do you realize that I denied your

14   motion to suppress that wiretap?                  And do you recognize

15   that on that wiretap, you conceded that the loss in this

16   case is $20 million, and do you know that under the

17   sentencing guidelines, the sentence where the loss is

18   $20 million is whatever it is, ten years in jail.

19                If the judge says all of that, has the judge

20   violated Rule 11(c)(1)?

21                MR. YABLON:        And if this is happening in the

22   context of active discussions of whether the defendant

23   should or should not take a plea, then that -- that may

24   well cross the line.

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I don't know when it can

                                      36

 1   happen, because there's no colloquy when there's a

 2   guilty plea.     The colloquy happens when there's a not

 3   guilty plea.

 4                  MR. YABLON:        I think -- isn't it the

 5   opposite, Justice Kennedy?               The colloquy happens after

 6   the defendant -

 7                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             No, no -- you're correct.

 8   You're correct.

 9                  MR. YABLON:        So -- so taking -- so in that

10   instance, again, you have a situation that may not be

11   different from situations that arise in completely

12   different contexts, where the attorney is doing

13   something that's ineffective, for example, and the judge

14   just doesn't know about it.               And -- and whether or not

15   that can be cured in this -- in this setting of the -

16   of plea discussions, it's just a little bit tangential,

17   I think, to the key issue.

18                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Now -- well, but

19   you've answered a lot of these questions by saying, you

20   know, it's hard to draw the line and, you know, maybe in

21   that case, maybe in this case.

22                  Most -- our precedents where we recognize

23   structural error and -- and plain error are ones that

24   are pretty easily categorized.                  Did a magistrate conduct

 1   the other.   Did he participate enough?                     You know, well,

 2   if he told them how many times he sentenced people this

 3   way, it's not, but if he said you ought to -- you ought

 4   to pay attention to what I'm telling you when you'd

 5   consider whether to plea or not, well, then it is.

 6                It -- it seems to me in the typical plain

 7   error cases, we're very -- the categories are very

 8   sharply defined.

 9                MR. YABLON:         That's actually not accurate.

10   I would say, for example, take the defendant's right to

11   self-representation.       And do you -- there may be obvious

12   cases and when the defendant's right to

13   self-representation has been clearly denied.                      But there

14   are going to be line-drawing problems when you're trying

15   to figure out did standby counsel intervene so much that

16   he denied that right.

17                Or similarly with the public trial,

18   obviously, a court can be totally closed, but then there

19   are going to be difficult cases when you have to decide

20   whether the justifications for closing the courtroom

21   are -

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     I would say in both

23   of those examples, the line -- the gray area, if you

24   were, is really quite narrow than here, where almost

25   every time you've been asked a question about a

                                       38

 1   difficult hypothetical, you say, well, maybe, maybe not.

 2   And I think that's quite different than saying is the

 3   court closed or not or was the person -- you know, did

 4   he represent himself in fact or not.                    And those just

 5   strike me as much easier cases.

 6               MR. YABLON:        And, of course, I'm being asked

 7   all of the difficult hypotheticals.

 8               If you look at the cases that actually

 9   rise -

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Yes, but if you were

11   -- if you were arguing whether or not it's -- it's

12   categorical error when the magistrate conducts voir

13   dire, it'd be pretty hard for somebody to come up with a

14   tough hypothetical.

15               MR. YABLON:        In that instance, yes.              But

16   there certainly are instances in which the structural -

17   in which the Court has found structural error, even when

18   there will be difficult line-drawing problems.                    And -

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Yablon, one problem

20   with calling this structural error is that it's not so

21   clear that this is a -- a bad thing.                    That is, some

22   States even today allow a judge to participate in plea

23   bargaining, and the advisors -- the rules advisory

24   committee -- said, when it -- when it framed this

25   rule that some commentators had said it was quite -

                                     39

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   quite a frequent thing that happened, that judges

 2   participated.     So it isn't like not having a public

 3   trial or not giving a person counsel of choice.

 4                  It's, this was -- this was something that

 5   still some jurisdictions think it's okay.

 6                  MR. YABLON:        Your Honor, no jurisdiction

 7   endorses judicial exhortations to plead guilty.                And -

 8   and so this Court can resolve the case just on that

 9   narrower basis, that there is a category of cases that

10   clearly do involve direct judicial pressure.                And no

11   State allows it, and those are clear violations of the

12   rules.     So without needing to draw these other lines

13   about how broad participation may reach, the Court can

14   do that.

15                  But even in those States, it's important to

16   note that -- that the Federal system has made a

17   different structural choice.                So whether or not it may

18   violate the Constitution for States to have carefully

19   tailored procedures that allow some type of judicial

20   involvement, that's not the structure that the Federal

21   system has chosen.      And when you're dealing with the

22   structural choice that was made in Rule 11, that judges

23   shall not, must not participate in plea discussions,

24   that that is as elemental to the Federal system of plea

25   bargaining that we have as many of the familiar elements

                                        40

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   of -- of the trial are.           And so, the fact that States

 2   have made -- made different structural choices does not

 3   mean that it's not a structural error here.

 4                 Now, I do want to get back to this

 5   line-drawing issue, because I think that this is not

 6   something that should trouble the Court too much, for a

 7   couple of reasons:      First, in most cases, the line will

 8   not be that hard to draw when you consider the purpose

 9   of Rule 11(c)(1), which is reducing judicial pressure,

10   and instances in which judges are stepping out of their

11   role as impartial adjudicators, and when reviewing

12   courts take that as the touchstone, there may be

13   difficult cases, but they're going to be able to resolve

14   most of them.

15                 Now, if the Court feels like it may be

16   difficult to do line drawing, and it is uncomfortable

17   extending the rule, the remedy that we're seeking that

18   far, it is entirely appropriate for the Court to -- to

19   take out a subcategory of Rule 11(c)(1) violations.

20                 JUSTICE KAGAN:             But that seems a bit odd,

21   don't you think, Mr. Yablon?                You know, you're saying,

22   well, there are core violations as opposed to noncore

23   violations.     I mean, presumably, that's part of what the

24   Court would think about when it was doing prejudice

25   analysis.

                                        41

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1                MR. YABLON:         It would factor into the

 2   prejudice analysis that the Court undertakes, but it

 3   also is a reason just to -- to draw the line.                    I mean,

 4   this Court in -- in various instances has

 5   indicated that -- I mean, there are some -- some broad

 6   rules out there:   The right to the assistance of

 7   counsel.   It comes in different shapes.                   And the

 8   prejudice analysis that applies for a total denial of

 9   the right to counsel is different from the one that

10   applies when you're dealing with mere deficiency in

11   counsel's performance.

12                And there is -- and again, this is -- this

13   is a comparative line-drawing problem.                    Either you draw

14   the line looking at what a violation is or looking at

15   what a judicial exhortation is from the statement that

16   is made, or you engage in this freewheeling speculation

17   that the government wants engaged in, where you were

18   trying to read the defendant's mind.                    And that is simply

19   not how harmless error analysis normally proceeds, where

20   you have a closed universe of a record, you have

21   specific criteria that are being applied, and you can

22   posit what a reasonable juror is.

23                There is no reasonable defendant that can be

24   posited in the same way, because defendants are

25   idiosyncratic and are entitled to be idiosyncratic.

                                       42

 1                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Yablon, do you know of

 2   any case where there is one of these core violations,

 3   these exhortation cases, where the Court did not find

 4   prejudice?

 5                MR. YABLON:        The answer is no, and that

 6   would be -- and we would urge the Court that if it does

 7   not accept our primary submission, that it make clear

 8   that judicial exhortations like this are highly unlikely

 9   to be harmless.

10                That is what the Fourth Circuit has done,

11   the Fifth Circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Tenth

12   Circuit, the D.C. Circuit.             They are in effect applying

13   a per se analysis, they're just not calling it that.

14   They are reversing in all of these cases.

15                And so, if this Court is uncomfortable

16   calling it a per se rule, at least it should give very

17   strong indications that comments like this cannot be

18   written off, that they are highly likely, given the

19   position of the judge relative to the defendant, to

20   affect the defendant's thinking, to affect the way that

21   the defense counsel approaches the case, and possibly

22   the prosecution as well in those cases in which the

23   prosecution is aware of the error.

24                And we would go further and say that if the

25   Court were to go down this road, it would be useful for

                                      43

 1   the Court to provide the additional guidance of holding

 2   that this particular type of error was not harmless.

 3   That would send a signal to the lower courts that this

 4   conduct is clearly off limits, and it would give them an

 5   indication that the court means what it's saying, that

 6   these kind of comments, where a judge is exhorting a

 7   defendant to come to the cross, that he needs to plead

 8   guilty -

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    How do we -- if

10   we're giving this guidance, what do we say about the

11   fact that he had a different judge subsequent to this,

12   that he filed a speedy trial motion after this coercion,

13   to suggest that he wasn't coerced all that much.

14                Are we supposed to take all that into

15   consideration, too?

16                MR. YABLON:        You should say that those

17   inferences are not adequate to overcome the inference

18   that you draw from this type of participation,

19   particularly here.

20                I mean, consider the change in judge.                       The

21   reason this hearing occurred before the magistrate judge

22   is because the defendant sent a letter to the district

23   court asking -- explaining his problems with his

24   counsel.   He got a response from the magistrate judge.

25   So in the defendant's mind, the magistrate judge and the

                                      44

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   district court are effectively one and the same, and you

 2   would not want a system where district courts are

 3   encouraged to send these issues to magistrate judges, so

 4   magistrate judges can engage in these kind of comments,

 5   but then the district judge can basically just cleanse

 6   it.   It is going to affect the way that the process

 7   plays out.

 8                 Now, the speedy trial issue, if I may

 9   just -- we can equally draw the inference that that was

10   only done because counsel wanted to put some pressure on

11   the government to actually reach a deal.                      And it is that

12   kind of speculation that makes this error ill-suited to

13   the kind of remedial analysis the government favors.

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

17                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

18                 MR. FEIGIN:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

19                 I just want to make one quick point in

20   response to the notion that we're asking for some form

21   of new prejudice analysis here.

22                 This is the exact same prejudice analysis

23   from Dominguez Benitez, that looks whether there is a

24   reasonable probability that the error affected the plea.

25                 Unless the Court has any further questions,

 1   I will rest -

 2                JUSTICE KAGAN:              Mr. Feigin, can I ask you

 3   the same question that I asked Mr. Yablon:                  Do you know

 4   of any cases where in these -- where there are really

 5   core violations, where a judge exhorts the defendant to

 6   plea it -- does the Court ever find that

 7   non-prejudicial?

 8                MR. FEIGIN:          I am aware of one or two State

 9   cases in which the court has looked at the passage of

10   time as a reason why that kind of error wouldn't have

11   been prejudicial.

12                But otherwise, I agree with Respondent that

13   in the Federal courts of appeals, that does tend to get

14   reversed.   And I think that supports the idea that if

15   the Court adopts the normal prejudice approach, and

16   reaffirms that approach in this case, that there's

17   not really that -

18                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 Do you disagree with how

19   the Fourth and Seventh Circuits and other circuits apply

20   a prejudice analysis, but one that says that it's highly

21   unlikely that you're not going to find prejudice?                  Do

22   you disagree with their analysis and approach?

23                MR. FEIGIN:          Well, Your Honor, there -

24   my -- I'm not going to go so far as to endorse the

25   results they've reached in every single case -

 1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               No.

 2               MR. FEIGIN:        -- but I think insofar as they

 3   approach the matter that -- you know, if there's a

 4   fairly serious error and the defendant pleads guilty

 5   right after that, that that's very likely absence of

 6   extenuating circumstances to be prejudicial; we don't

 7   have a problem with that.

 8               Unless there are further questions -
