 2                                                           (10:03 a.m.)

 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We'll hear

 4   argument first today in Bell Atlantic Corporation vs.

 5   Twombly.   Mr. Kellogg.

 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL KELLOGG

 7                  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 8              MR. KELLOGG:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 9   it please the Court:

10              I think the most important point that I

11   can make today is that this is a case about the

12   substantive requirements of antitrust law, and just

13   as in Dura and in Blue Chip Stamps, the Court

14   articulated the substantive requirements for pleading

15   a claim under the securities law, and just as in

16   Anza, it did so under RICO, so too in Associated

17   General Contractors, in Trinko.              And in the instant

18   case, the Court is faced with the question of what a

19   plaintiff needs to plead in order to state a claim

20   and show an entitlement to relief under the antitrust

21   laws.

22              In that regard, I'd like to direct the

23   Court's attention to paragraph 51 of the plaintiff's

24   complaint in this case, which is at page 27 of the

25   joint appendix, and which summarizes the grounds for


                                        3

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   plaintiffs' allegation that there is a contract

 2   combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade.             The

 3   complaint states, and I quote, "in the absence of any

 4   meaningful competition among the defendants," and,

 5   quote, in light of the parallel course of conduct

 6   that each engaged in to prevent competition, the

 7   plaintiffs -- the defendants conspired.

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Well, but isn't the next

 9   sentence, the substance of the sentence is

10   "plaintiffs allege upon information and belief that

11   defendants have entered into a contract combination

12   or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry in their

13   respective telephone and/or high speed interstate

14   markets, and agreed not to compete with one another

15   and otherwise allocated customers and markets to one

16   another."   Now, does that state a violation of the

17   Sherman Act?

18               MR. KELLOGG:       It does not, Your Honor.

19               JUSTICE STEVENS:            It does not?

20               MR. KELLOGG:       It does not state a claim.

21               JUSTICE STEVENS:            I mean, you could leave

22   out everything before plaintiff, the part you quoted,

23   that's not part of the declaration in the sentence.

24   But the sentence itself alleges a garden variety of

25   the violation of the Sherman Act, doesn't it?

 1                MR. KELLOGG:        The sentence recites the

 2   language of the Sherman Act, that is correct.                   But

 3   what this Court's cases indicate and what Rule 8

 4   requires --

 5                JUSTICE STEVENS:             It's got the language of

 6   the Sherman Act, a conspiracy to prevent competitive

 7   entry in their respective telephone and/or high speed

 8   markets.     That's not in the Sherman Act, that's a

 9   description of the alleged conspiracy in this case.

10                MR. KELLOGG:        It is true that they have

11   described the alleged conspiracy, but what Dura,

12   Associated General Contractors, and other cases of

13   this Court require is a statement of facts that

14   warrants the legal conclusion that the plaintiffs

15   wish to --

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Kellogg, the

17   Federal Rules of Civil Procedure assiduously avoid

18   using the word fact throughout.                And from 1938 on, it

19   has been repeated that it is not necessary to plead

20   facts.   The index of forms, the appendix of forms

21   shows how simple the plain statement of a claim is,

22   and you're not required to plead facts.                   And yet

23   that's the central -- seems to be the central thrust

24   of your argument.

25                MR. KELLOGG:        Your Honor, every case of


                                          5

 1   this Court dealing with pleading standards has

 2   indicated that it is not sufficient merely to recite

 3   a legal conclusion, and claim an entitlement to

 4   relief therefore.    In Dura, for example, the

 5   plaintiffs claimed proximate cause and loss

 6   causation, and the Court said --

 7             JUSTICE STEVENS:               But Mr. Kellogg, that's

 8   not a legal conclusion, it's an allegation of fact

 9   that there was an agreement to prevent competitive

10   entry into respective markets.               There are dozens of

11   antitrust complaints that are no more specific than

12   that.

13             MR. KELLOGG:          Your Honor, in the context

14   in which this claim is made, the allegation of

15   agreement or conspiracy is not a statement of fact.

16   It is an inference that the plaintiffs seek to draw

17   from the facts that they allege in the complaint.

18   Context here is everything.              In form 9, for example,

19   Justice Ginsburg, or in the case of Sherkovitz, you

20   had a specific context.         You had a time, a place,

21   individual participants named, a clear injury in form

22   9, a broken leg as a report --

23             JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But negligently drove.

24   It doesn't say whether it went through a stop light.

25   Doesn't say whether it was speeding.                     It doesn't say


                                         6

 1   any one of the umpteen ways one could be negligent.

 2                MR. KELLOGG:       That is correct, Justice

 3   O'Connor, but you have a direct context -- Justice

 4   Ginsburg, you had a direct context in which an

 5   eyewitness participant in the event is claiming

 6   negligence on behalf of the driver of the car.                   In

 7   the instant case, we have no injury that's separate

 8   from the alleged conspiracy, and we have no time,

 9   place or participants for the alleged conspirators.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:         But you do have a case --

11   anywhere, forget antitrust.              Suppose it's a tort

12   case, and the following complaint is filed.                   My foot

13   hurts.   I've gone to Dr. Smith for 15 years.                  I claim

14   he is negligent.    Is that valid?

15                MR. KELLOGG:       I do not think so, because I

16   don't think --

17                JUSTICE BREYER:         All right.          Now, if you

18   think that's valid, I understand that you think this

19   complaint does just what I said in the field of

20   antitrust.    But is there any case that you've come

21   across which would say a complaint just as I have

22   described it --

23                MR. KELLOGG:       Yes.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:         Either is valid or is not

25   valid.   You'd like to find one that says it's not


                                         7

 1   valid, so what's your best effort in any field of

 2   law.

 3                MR. KELLOGG:        I would cite, for example,

 4   the Court's decision in the Papasan case, where the

 5   plaintiffs claimed that they were not getting a

 6   minimally adequate education.               That sounds like a

 7   factual statement.      But what the Court expressly said

 8   in that case is that we do not have to accept legal

 9   conclusions in the guise of factual allegations.

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But of course, there the

11   legal standard was not clear.               And the Dura case, I

12   looked at, and perhaps you disagree based on what you

13   -- what I have just heard, and I thought Dura was a

14   lack of proximate cause.           They just didn't show any

15   relation between the injury they alleged to have

16   suffered, and their own.

17                MR. KELLOGG:        Well, I think Dura is --

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And that's the way I

19   read Dura.

20                MR. KELLOGG:        I think Dura is an exact

21   analogy.     In Dura, they allege proximate cause, they

22   allege loss causation.         And the Court said, well,

23   let's look at their statement of facts, which only

24   showed that they had bought at an inflated price.

25   And the Court said there was a fatal gap between that


                                          8

 1   factual allegation and the legal conclusion that they

 2   wished to draw.

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:           You can get into trouble

 4   by alleging too much, I guess, because if you allege

 5   a lot, you might leave something out.                    And you say,

 6   well, what about that one.           But suppose we keep it

 7   very, very minimal.      And a person just says, I'm hurt

 8   and the defendant, I claim, negligently injured me.

 9   Period.   Period.

10              MR. KELLOGG:         That would not provide --

11              JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, why not?

12              MR. KELLOGG:         The grounds upon which the

13   claim is based.

14              JUSTICE BREYER:           So the only thing that's

15   missing there are some facts.

16              MR. KELLOGG:         Some facts indicative that

17   the defendant is responsible for the --

18              JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.          So now you're

19   saying a complaint has to have facts?

20              MR. KELLOGG:         Absolutely.

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, I thought you were

22   also making a different argument.                 I thought you were

23   making the argument that they have, by their

24   pleadings, in effect, affirmatively indicated that

25   they don't have enough facts to support a general


                                         9

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   allegation.     I thought you were saying that because

 2   of the preface that you began reading, that in view

 3   simply of the fact that they are not competing, and

 4   in view of parallel conduct, they have violated the

 5   Act.

 6                So I guess my question is, would your

 7   position be different if there were no allegation

 8   simply of an absence of competition and parallel

 9   action if -- would your position be different if they

10   had simply alleged, as Justice Stevens emphasized,

11   that here were these parties and they had -- they had

12   taken some action, not specified, which resulted in

13   violation of the Act?

14                MR. KELLOGG:        Our position would not be

15   different.     It's the uniform view of the cases that I

16   cited, the Courts of Appeals and a requirement of

17   Rule -- Rule 8 that you do more than simply parrot

18   the words of the cause of action or announce legal

19   conclusions.     But as you point out, in this case --

20                JUSTICE SOUTER:          So that would not be good

21   enough, but are you saying that this is worse

22   because, in effect, they have gone some steps towards

23   specification.     And the specifications that they have

24   made affirmatively show that they don't have enough

25   for the agreement.


                                         10

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1             MR. KELLOGG:        It is certainly true that

 2   all they have alleged is conduct from which they seek

 3   to draw an inference of conspiracy.                    And they have

 4   made that quite clear, that they have made no direct

 5   allegation.

 6             JUSTICE SOUTER:          And you're saying that

 7   inference cannot be drawn from the particular facts

 8   that they have alleged.

 9             MR. KELLOGG:        That is correct.               Our

10   position is that as a matter of substantive antitrust

11   law, what this Court said in Matsushita is that

12   antitrust law limits the range of permissible

13   inferences that can be drawn from parallel conduct.

14   And if all you have is parallel conduct that's

15   consistent, on the one hand, with conspiracy, or on

16   the other hand, with ordinary business judgment, you

17   cannot draw an inference of the sort that the

18   plaintiffs depend upon in this case.

19             JUSTICE STEVENS:             Of course, that may be

20   true on summary judgment, you may be dead right on

21   the merits, but are you telling me that an allegation

22   that the defendants have agreed not to compete with

23   one another is not a statement of fact?

24             MR. KELLOGG:        I am.        I would say that

25   that's a -- that's a conclusion --

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1             JUSTICE STEVENS:             Well, what if they said

 2   they agreed in writing not to compete with one

 3   another, would that be sufficient?                 Or if they have

 4   agreed orally not to compete with one another, would

 5   that be sufficient?

 6             MR. KELLOGG:         If there were a specific

 7   context and they said --

 8             JUSTICE STEVENS:             If they said they have

 9   agreed orally not to compete with one another, would

10   that be a statement of fact, an allegation of fact?

11             MR. KELLOGG:         Yes.      Because you require --

12             JUSTICE STEVENS:             Then why did you leave

13   the words orally out?      Why is it not a statement,

14   allegation of fact?

15             MR. KELLOGG:         Because the plaintiffs here

16   were very careful, in light of Rule 11, not to make

17   any direct allegations of conspiracy, not to suggest

18   that there was a time and place --

19             JUSTICE STEVENS:             But that's a direct

20   allegation of conspiracy, that very statement.

21             MR. KELLOGG:         But they make it clear in

22   that paragraph that it's an inference.

23             JUSTICE STEVENS:             They make it fairly

24   clear that they may only have the evidence of

25   parallel conduct that you describe, and that may not


                                      12

 1   be sufficient, and maybe for that reason, you get a

 2   summary judgment.    But how you can say this is not an

 3   allegation of fact, I find mind-boggling.

 4                MR. KELLOGG:       I'm saying that it's not

 5   sufficient to state a claim.              Just as the allegation

 6   that there was lost causation in Dura, or that there

 7   was harm to the union in Associated General

 8   Contractors or there, that there was harm --

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:         Now you're, that's the

10   part precisely which you're following that I don't,

11   that I actually don't know, is the extent to which

12   you have to put in a complaint, in whatever field of

13   law, you can allege a fact.              You say the person ran

14   over me --

15                MR. KELLOGG:       Yes.

16                JUSTICE BREYER:         Or you say, they treated

17   me negligently.    That's a fact.             That means something

18   happened there.    But suppose you write the complaint

19   and there is just no notion that you have a what and

20   when, how, under what circumstances.                     It's just

21   totally out of thin air, and the defendant doesn't

22   know what, what period of time he is supposed to be

23   thinking about, what, what happens to such a

24   complaint?    There must be some law on it in torts or

25   someplace?

 1               MR. KELLOGG:         Well, ordinarily in a

 2   complaint like that, you could file a 12(e) motion

 3   and ask for more specificity.               Our problem --

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, why couldn't you do

 5   the same?

 6               MR. KELLOGG:         Our problem with the current

 7   complaint is not a lack of specificity, it's quite

 8   specific.     It provides color maps and such.               The

 9   problem is that the facts specifically alleged simply

10   don't amount to an antitrust violation because they

11   don't support the inference that the plaintiffs ask

12   the Court to draw.

13               JUSTICE BREYER:           Oh, but they're --

14   they're using the fact that there was parallel

15   behavior as a basis for thinking there was more than

16   parallel behavior.      They are using it as a basis for

17   thinking that once, on some occasion that's relevant,

18   there were people meeting in a room and saying things

19   to each other.    So they are not just saying that it's

20   sufficient.    They are saying it's evidence that

21   something else occurred.

22               MR. KELLOGG:         That's correct.          That's

23   exactly what they are saying and what Matsushita and

24   the other courses, cases of this Court dealing with

25   parallel conduct indicate, is that that's not a fair

 1   inference from parallel conduct.

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Wasn't that a summary

 3   judgment case and hadn't there been discovery before?

 4   The Matsushita decision?

 5               MR. KELLOGG:       That is correct.               But the

 6   Court announced that as a principle of substantive

 7   law.   They said substantive antitrust law limits the

 8   range of permissible inferences.               We are not

 9   suggesting that the plaintiffs need the sort of

10   specificity or certainly any evidence at the

11   pleadings stage.   For example --

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:         They just have to say

13   orally, I wish you would reconsider that?                     Because if

14   that's, if that's all you're arguing, I don't see

15   anything to be gained by -- by such a holding.                        It

16   doesn't tell you -- you know, this is a suit against

17   a number of large corporations, nationwide

18   businesses, thousands of employees.                     And on this

19   complaint you have no idea who agreed with whom,

20   where, when, any of that.

21               I can understand that you're saying that

22   does not give us enough notice to prepare a defense.

23   But if you say oh, but it would be perfectly all

24   right so long as they said orally.                 I mean -- forget

25   about it.

 1                MR. KELLOGG:       I -- I should not agree to

 2   that.   That's simply adding the word orally.                     It's

 3   certainly fair when you are talking about a

 4   nationwide class over a period of 10 years attacking

 5   an entire industry to suggest that the plaintiffs

 6   have to give some indication of what it is that the

 7   defendants have done that is wrong.                      Some concrete

 8   basis for the Court to believe there is a reason to

 9   go forward to the --

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So in the negligently

11   drove case, the plaintiff negligently drove over --

12   the defendant negligently drove over the plaintiff,

13   if it's not specific as to time and place it must be

14   dismissed?    If it's specific as to time and place

15   it's, it withstands the motion?

16                MR. KELLOGG:       Well certainly, Form 9 is

17   very specific.    It gives a specific corner, it gives

18   a time, it gives the names of the participants.

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What if it does say

20   within the last 10 years.

21                MR. KELLOGG:       I don't think that's

22   sufficient, Your Honor.         But with a -- with a --

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Do you have a case, do

24   you have a case I can look to that tells me that?

 1   12(e) motion could then specify the actual time and

 2   place, but the plaintiffs here have had ample

 3   opportunity to amend their complaint to supplement.

 4   If they had any specifics indicating that there was

 5   such an agreement as opposed to lawyer speculation

 6   and a desire to engage in expensive discovery they

 7   would have produced that.

 8             JUSTICE SCALIA:           Did you seek a more

 9   specific statement?

10             MR. KELLOGG:         We did not, Your Honor.

11             JUSTICE SCALIA:           Why not?            Why didn't you

12   ask when and where was this agreement.

13             MR. KELLOGG:         Well again the whole way

14   this was litigated below by the plaintiffs was that

15   they, they acknowledged they had no specifics.                    They

16   simply asked that an inference be drawn from the

17   parallel conduct they alleged.              And that is our

18   central point that you simply cannot infer an

19   agreement from this conduct.            If the Court has no

20   questions, I reserve my time.

23           ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. BARNETT,

24     ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

25              IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONERS

 1             MR. BARNETT:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 2   it please the Court.

 3             The fundamental concern of the United

 4   States is that the decision of the Second Circuit can

 5   be read to hold that a Section 1 Sherman Act

 6   complaint will survive a motion to dismiss merely by

 7   alleging parallel action or inaction in attaching the

 8   bare assertion of an agreement.             Such a result fails

 9   to appreciate that parallel action or inaction is

10   ubiquitous in our economy and often reflects

11   beneficial competitive forces.

12             JUSTICE SCALIA:          What do you mean can be

13   held, can be thought to hold that?                Is there any

14   interpretation of what they did.

15             MR. BARNETT:        Well there are certain

16   portions of the decision that talk about a

17   plausibility requirement but when it turns to the

18   specific area of a Section 1 complaint and a

19   complaint alleged on parallel conduct, I agree with

20   you, Justice Scalia, that that's the only

21   interpretation I can draw from that passage.                The

22   Court held that if you allege parallel action unless

23   there are no set of facts that can be proved, and

24   it's always possible to hypothesize an agreement, you

25   cannot dismiss that complaint.

 1                JUSTICE SOUTER:         Well, is that really what

 2   they -- I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I

 3   thought that the, that the Court spoke of no set of

 4   facts, only on the assumption that there had been a

 5   pleading which did raise a plausible, possible

 6   inference of forbidden conduct, and I thought the

 7   Court was saying if the, if the plausibility

 8   criterion has been satisfied, then the only way that

 9   the defendant can get a dismissal is by showing that

10   there is no set of facts which would actually support

11   the action.    And I'm not sure that that can be done

12   at the, at the, at the stage of simply pleading a

13   dismissal as opposed to summary judgment or something

14   like that.    But I thought the Court did not get to

15   its no set of facts point until it had first assumed

16   that there had been a, a pleading on the basis of

17   which a plausible inference of forbidden conduct

18   could be drawn.    Am I about that?

19                MR. BARNETT:       Well, Justice Souter, I read

20   that passage of the Second Circuit decision as not

21   expressly referencing the plausibility requirement.

22   There is language saying that the allegation needs to

23   be plausible but when you get to this specific

24   passage it says that if you allege parallel conduct a

25   court cannot dismiss the claim unless there could be


                                        19

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   no set of facts that could be proved.                   But

 2   regardless, even if I am, your interpretation is

 3   potentially permissible interpretation, the

 4   fundamental concern of the United States is that this

 5   Court, having the case now, clarify that a Section 1

 6   Sherman Act complaint should not be able to survive a

 7   motion to dismiss unless it alleges some facts beyond

 8   mere generic parallel action.

 9              JUSTICE SOUTER:          So, so that if

10   plausibility is the standard this does not meet the

11   standard of plausibility, that's your argument?

12              MR. BARNETT:        Well, we prefer the

13   formulation that, from the Court's opinion in Dura

14   that says that the facts need to demonstrate some

15   reasonably founded expectation that there is an

16   unlawful agreement within the meaning of Section 1 of

17   the Sherman Act.

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:          And some parallel action

19   would indicate that wouldn't it?               I mean, if for

20   example they, you have nine companies that change

21   their price at the same hour of the same day, 10

22   months in a row.

23              MR. BARNETT:        Absolutely, Justice Scalia.

24   I agree.

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:          So you're, you're not


                                       20

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   saying that parallel action can never create this,

 2   this kind of --

 3              MR. BARNETT:        That is correct.              If all you

 4   know is that there is parallel action or inaction,

 5   that in and of itself tells you nothing.                    Once you

 6   start to add the facts and circumstances surrounding

 7   it, particular parallel action can be suspicious

 8   enough, and the example you give is a good one, that

 9   demonstrates a reasonably founded expectation for

10   believing that discovery may yield evidence showing

11   that that parallel price increase at the same time by

12   nine different companies was the result of an

13   unlawful conspiracy.

14              If I can turn to, in -- in deciding

15   whether or not there is such a reasonably founded

16   expectation, you do need to look to the substantive

17   law.   Here the issue is the law on agreement under

18   Section 1 of the Sherman Act.             Some of the questions

19   I think I've heard go to this issue.                    Section 1 law

20   specifically limits the kinds of facts that can be

21   used to establish an agreement that is cognizable

22   under the Sherman Act.       In particular, the Court's

23   rulings made clear that conscious parallelism which

24   some economists might argue is a form of an

25   agreement, is not an agreement within the meaning of


                                       21

 1   Section 1.

 2                JUSTICE STEVENS:            It's clear it's not

 3   sufficient to prove it, but is it admissible

 4   evidence?

 5                MR. BARNETT:       It may be admissible

 6   evidence but depending on the facts and circumstances

 7   --

 8                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Should a plaintiffs's

 9   complaint fail because it includes unnecessary,

10   verbose, admissible evidence?

11                MR. BARNETT:       No.       It should fail if it

12   fail -- if it does not allege facts that indicate

13   reasonable found --

14                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Is not it an allegation

15   that they've agreed not to compete with one another

16   an allegation of fact?

17                MR. BARNETT:       It is a combined question of

18   law and fact in our view, because as I said the

19   Section 1 law limits the kinds of facts that can be

20   used to establish an agreement.               If all they have

21   alleged is parallel action without more --

22                JUSTICE STEVENS:            But they have alleged

23   more.   They have alleged an actual agreement.

24                MR. BARNETT:       But as paragraph 51 of the

25   complaint is, as you were discussing, in some ways


                                        22

 1   even worse.   Because it specifically relies upon

 2   parallel action and alleged parallel inaction.

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:           But what if it didn't?         I

 4   mean, I mean face the question that Justice Stevens

 5   puts.   Suppose you have a complaint that says nothing

 6   else except that these defendants entered into an

 7   agreement in -- in restraint of trade.

 8              MR. BARNETT:        And that is not sufficient

 9   because in our view the complaint needs to allege

10   some facts that demonstrate a basis for believing

11   there was an unlawful agreement within --

12              JUSTICE STEVENS:             What if the complaint in

13   addition to that alleged that up to a certain date,

14   it was unlawful for the companies to compete with one

15   another but the law was changed and after that change

16   took place they were advised by their lawyers they

17   could compete, but they agreed not to.                  Would that be

18   sufficient?

19              MR. BARNETT:        No.       Every business, every

20   day fails to enter some new line of business or take

21   some potential competitive action.                 The mere --

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But Justice

23   Stevens's question was that the allegation was that

24   after that date they agreed not to compete.                  That

25   states -- that states a cause of action under the


                                       23

 1   Sherman Act, doesn't it?

 2                MR. BARNETT:       No.      I would, with respect,

 3   Mr. Chief Justice, I would disagree with that.               There

 4   still needs in our view to be some allegation that

 5   indicates -- a factual allegation that indicates a

 6   reason for believing there may have been unlawful

 7   agreement.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:          Can they say on the 14th

 9   of January, 2004, we believe that in the city of New

10   York, they agreed upon this course of action?               That

11   would surely be sufficient?

12                MR. BARNETT:       That may be sufficient

13   because it is providing enough facts to give you a

14   reason to believe that the plaintiff has a basis for

15   --

16                JUSTICE BREYER:         Well, it's saying, all

17   I've done is limited it in time and space.               Just as

18   you might say on October the 24th, 2004 at the corner

19   of 14th and Third Avenue, defendant drove negligently

20   and injured me.    That's certainly a complaint, isn't

21   it?

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:         Well, I understand the

10   standard.

11               MR. BARNETT:       Yes.

12               JUSTICE BREYER:         I want to know how to

13   apply the standard and now I take my tort case --

14               MR. BARNETT:       Yes.

15               JUSTICE BREYER:         -- which is okay, and now

16   I say sometime during the last 10 years he drove

17   negligently and injured me.             Is that no good?

18               MR. BARNETT:       In my view that's probably

19   insufficient --

20               JUSTICE BREYER:         And so you're saying that

21   this case is like that, when because they don't say

22   when they met, they don't say what happened, they

23   don't give a time or place.

24               If that's, leaving your side parallelism

25   out of it, I'm past you on that, all right?                I'll

 1   accept for argument's sake all your point about that.

 2   Now if you're saying this is too vague, leaving that

 3   out of it, because it doesn't say time and place of

 4   the meetings or give any other clue for meetings

 5   etcetera, what's your best authority ?

 6              This is an area of law I'm not familiar

 7   with.   I'm looking for cases that will tell me how

 8   specific a complaint has to be to tie the events down

 9   to specific ones.

10              MR. BARNETT:         I believe that this Court's

11   decision in Dura Pharmaceutical --

12              JUSTICE BREYER:           Dura is still the best.

13   I think I, did I write that case?

14              (Laughter.)

15              MR. BARNETT:         You did --

16              JUSTICE BREYER:           I'm not drawing total

17   comfort from it.

18              (Laughter.)

19              JUSTICE BREYER:           In fact I'd like

20   something in tort law or something that, you know,

21   that I get a general idea of what the law is because

22   I don't know that antitrust is --

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:           Mr. Barnett, I thought --

24              MR. BARNETT:         I thought our brief lists

25   cases that go to that point.

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Mr. Barnett I thought you

 2   had, you had said that you don't need to indicate the

 3   particular day of the agreement.                That it would be

 4   enough if it was the kind of parallel action that

 5   suggested an agreement that over nine years they all

 6   raised the price at the same time.                  Now that doesn't

 7   really give the defendant notice of, you know, what

 8   individuals were responsible for this, when it

 9   occurred.   But you say that would still be adequate?

10               MR. BARNETT:        Well, it does provide notice

11   that -- this is a fairly low threshold.                  It provides

12   some indication.    It can be an indication of direct

13   evidence.   It can be an indication of circumstantial

14   evidence.   It does focus the litigation, however, by

15   providing a, a reason why the court and the defendant

16   should be defending themselves against a section 1

17   claim.

18               My time is up.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

22                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. DOUGLAS RICHARDS

23                      ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

25   it please the Court:

 1                There are four essential dimensions to the

 2   problem that's before the Court and on every one of

 3   those dimensions the guidance that the Solicitor

 4   General gave in its amicus brief in the Swierkiewicz

 5   case is 180 degrees opposite the guidance that the

 6   Solicitor General is providing in its amicus brief in

 7   this case.    The first of those dimensions I'll begin

 8   with because it's where petitioners began.                   In their

 9   brief, the Solicitor General in the Swierkiewicz case

10   very clearly said that evidentiary standards cannot

11   be made into pleading standards.                What they said on

12   page 5 was that by requiring pleading of the

13   McDonnell Douglas prima facie case from employment

14   law the Second Circuit had erroneously conflated the

15   fair notice owed the defendant at the outset of the

16   litigation with the standards governing the

17   plaintiff's present of proof in court.                   Later at page

18   11, they said the court's test confuses pleading ---

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Now you're reading from

20   the Swierkiewicz brief?

21                MR. RICHARDS:        From the Swierkiewicz

22   Solicitor General brief.

23                They said that the court test in the

24   Second Circuit that was reversed --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, i mean, you know,


                                        28

 1   that's shame on them.       But we're trying to get this

 2   case right and, you know, I don't care what position

 3   they took before.     I care about what the right answer

 4   is, and I find it difficult to believe that you can

 5   simply allege in a complaint, I was injured by the

 6   negligence of the defendant in driving an automobile,

 7   period.    Does that satisfy the, the Federal Rules?

 8               MR. RICHARDS:         There's a big difference

 9   between -- the answer is I don't know, perhaps.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Perhaps?

11               MR. RICHARDS:         Perhaps.          But that's very

12   different from this case and it's different in that

13   an automobile accident is something that happens all

14   in one moment in time.        An antitrust conspiracy like

15   the conspiracy alleged --

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:          The agreement happens at

17   one moment in time.

18               MR. RICHARDS:         Oh, it could happen in many

19   moments.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Meetings of the minds,

21   meeting of the minds.       I used to each Contracts.

22   Meeting of the minds at one moment in time, okay.

23               MR. RICHARDS:         But what the Second Circuit

24   said on this point, and I submit that the Second

25   Circuit was correct, was that the complaint does set

 1   forth the temporal and geographic parameters of the

 2   alleged illegal activity and the identities of the

 3   alleged key participants, and I think that's correct.

 4             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But where does it

 5   set forth agreement?

 6             MR. RICHARDS:           It alleges --

 7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Temporal,

 8   geographic, the identities, but where does it set

 9   forth anything evincing an agreement other than the

10   allegation of parallel conduct?

11             MR. RICHARDS:           It alleges that there was

12   an agreement, but it doesn't prove that there was an

13   agreement because proving the facts alleged is not a

14   plaintiff's burden in the complaint.

15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Do you have any,

16   is there an allegation of an agreement apart from the

17   parallel conduct?

18             MR. RICHARDS:           Yes.

19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  And what does that

20   consist of?

21             MR. RICHARDS:           The leading plus factor

22   that's generally used in, in the Matsushita context,

23   in the Monsanto context, is action that would have

24   been against the self-interest of the conspirators in

25   the absence of a conspiracy, and this complaint

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   alleges very clearly that the conduct of not entering

 2   into one another's territories and competing among

 3   the ILECs as a CLEC was contrary to what would have

 4   been --

 5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So it states --

 6   would it state an antitrust violation if had you a

 7   grocery store on one corner of the block and a pet

 8   store on the other corner of the block and you say,

 9   well, the grocery store is not selling pet supplies

10   and they could make money if they did, therefore

11   that's an antitrust violation?

12             MR. RICHARDS:         If that conspiracy were

13   implausible, if it made no sense.

14             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That's all the

15   facts that are alleged.

16             MR. RICHARDS:         Right, but the Second

17   Circuit standard and the standard we defend is that

18   if someone alleges a conspiracy I that just makes no

19   sense because it's obvious from the face of the

20   complaint that the alleged conspirators aren't in the

21   same product market, not in the same geographic

22   market or something of that kind, there is no

23   conceivable motive for them to enter into the kind of

24   conspiracy at hand, the complaint can be dismissed.

25             JUSTICE BREYER:          If my case, the gasoline,


                                      31

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   oil prices fell, but I happen to know there were four

 2   gasoline shops near each other, gasoline stations,

 3   and they didn't cut their prices.                 Complaint?

 4              MR. RICHARDS:          Yes.

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, then that's the

 6   economy, and you can go sue half the firms in this

 7   economy.   Every firm in a concentrated industry

 8   engages in -- I mean, normally conscious parallelism,

 9   and I know there are economists who think that that

10   should be the case, but I thought the law to date was

11   that the Department of Justice is not given by the

12   Sherman Act the authority to remake the entire

13   American economy.    But if we accept your view I guess

14   it is.

15              MR. RICHARDS:          Well, Justice Breyer, in

16   the NHL case, the National Hockey League case, which

17   is one of the cases that the petitioners relied upon

18   for a circuit conflict to get here, what the court

19   said is that allegations that defendant's action

20   taken independently would be contrary to their

21   economic self-interest will ordinarily tend to

22   exclude the likelihood --

23              JUSTICE BREYER:           Ordinarily, if you take

24   that sentence and read it for how you're reading, a

25   consciously parallel action is a violation of Sherman


                                        32

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Act section 2, then we have that radical change that

 2   many have advocated for the last 40 or 50 years, that

 3   half the economy is in violation, because in any

 4   concentrated industry, after all, it is in the

 5   interest of a firm to cut prices and to make a large

 6   market unless he knows his three competitors will

 7   also keep prices up.       Now, you have to know that or

 8   you'd cut them.    And that's called conscious

 9   parallelism.    And I had always thought that this

10   Court had not said that that in and of itself is a

11   violation of the Sherman Act.

12                MR. RICHARDS:        Well, Justice Breyer, we

13   don't just allege conscious parallelism.                 We

14   allege --

15                JUSTICE BREYER:         I know that, but if in

16   fact all you have to do in order to bring a

17   price-fixing case and get into discovery is to allege

18   conscious parallelism and then add without further

19   foundation, and we think there was a real agreement

20   too, but there's nothing other than the conscious

21   parallelism to back it up, now we've got just what I

22   said, with the exception you might not win at the end

23   of the day.    What have you is a ticket to conduct

24   discovery.    Now, that's what's bothering the

25   Department of Justice and so I'd like to know the


                                        33

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   answer to that problem.

 2              MR. RICHARDS:         Well, Justice Breyer, the

 3   difference between that, a critical difference

 4   between that scenario and what we have alleged in

 5   this complaint is that we do allege in great detail

 6   that not entering into one another's territories

 7   would have been contrary to the interests of --

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:          But that does not help

 9   you with respect to the other claim, the claim that

10   there was a conspiracy to prevent upstart competitors

11   from coming in.   There's no plus factor as I

12   understand it alleged there, and I also understand

13   that it would have been entirely in the interest of

14   each of your defendants to keep the upstarts out and

15   that there is no need for them to agree to do that.

16   It would be the most natural thing in the world to do

17   it.   What do you say about that part of your case?

18              MR. RICHARDS:         As to that aspect of the

19   case, paragraph 50 does allege two plus factors, but

20   they are essentially allegations of common motive,

21   which is a less strong, I'll grant you --

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:          Yes, but a common, isn't

23   the common motive consistent, just as consistent with

24   no agreement as with agreement?              In other words, they

25   didn't have to agree; their common motive was


                                       34

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   operative agreement or not?

 2             MR. RICHARDS:         The important thing as to

 3   that aspect of the conspiracy is the Continental case

 4   in this Court, which said that you're not supposed to

 5   dismember -- it's an inappropriate way to approach a

 6   conspiracy to dismember it, look at one piece of it

 7   in isolation, evaluate it as though it's by itself

 8   and then wipe the slate clean at the end of that

 9   analysis, and that's essentially what the other side

10   is trying to do repeatedly.

11             JUSTICE SOUTER:          No, what the other side

12   is saying is that simply by alleging parallelism when

13   it would be in the interest of each of the alleged

14   conspirators to do just as you claim they are doing

15   in the absence of an agreement, you have not alleged

16   something that gets to the threshold of plausibility.

17   That's their argument and I, I --

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:          I think, by the way, that

19   that argument applies not just to the keeping out the

20   upstart claim, but also to the not entering the other

21   alleged conspirator s' fields of monopoly, if you

22   want to put it that way, because if I, if I enter

23   your field I know that you're going to enter mine.

24   It just doesn't pay for me to do it.                   Yeah, I can

25   make money, but I'll lose money.              It seems to me


                                      35

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   perfectly natural for companies that have a certain

 2   geographic area in which they are the, the principal,

 3   the selected instrument and although they technically

 4   can enter somebody else's geographic area, they know

 5   that if they do it they will be subjected to the same

 6   thing.   That is nothing more than conscious

 7   parallelism.

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:          You may reply to us

 9   jointly or severally, however you may want.

10              (Laughter.)

11              MR. RICHARDS:         If I may, I'll try to pose

12   a hypothetical that I think addresses Justice

13   Souter's question and then, Justice Scalia, I'll try

14   to address your question.          Justice Souter, a good

15   example would be suppose one alleges a conspiracy to

16   rob a bank and to steal a number of getaway cars at

17   the same time and one comes -- in order to get away,

18   so that the conspirators couldn't be found at the

19   site of robbing the bank.          One could say, well,

20   there's a reason to rob the getaway cars totally

21   independent of the bank and without a conspiracy.

22   Why do they need a conspiracy to steal a car?             Why

23   isn't that something that they wouldn't individually

24   do?

25              JUSTICE SOUTER:          But the difference


                                       36

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   between that case and this is that the allegation

 2   with respect to the agreement to procure the getaway

 3   cars gets to a kind of specificity that is not

 4   present here.   Here the allegation simply is parallel

 5   conduct to make it hard for the upstarts to get in.

 6   And at that general level the answer is, of course

 7   anyone in his right mind would want to make it

 8   difficult to let the upstarts in.                  There's no need to

 9   assume that they might have agreed on some matter of

10   detail which is not essential to the scheme.                 This is

11   a general characteristic of competition and

12   resistance of competition.

13             MR. RICHARDS:            I understand, but the point

14   I'm trying to make with the hypothetical is that what

15   one does if one is just looking at the conspiracy to

16   keep CLECs out by itself first, taking the secondary

17   aspect of the conspiracy, putting it first and

18   analyzing it in isolation, is like taking the getaway

19   car theft, analyzing it in isolation, saying, well,

20   they have a reason individually to steal the cars, so

21   I guess that couldn't --

22             JUSTICE STEVENS:                Mr. Richards, can I ask

23   you this question.      Supposing that you were allowed

24   to have discovery and each chief executive of the

25   defendant companies got on the stand and said:                 I

 1   never talked to my, my competitors at all, I never

 2   seriously considered competing in the other, other

 3   company's territory for the reasons set forth in the,

 4   in your opponent's brief on the merits here.                 We

 5   never did agree.     And you're able to prove the things

 6   you've alleged in the agreement.                 Would the, would it

 7   be appropriate to enter summary judgment against you

 8   on that testimony if you had no evidence of a

 9   specific agreement?

10               MR. RICHARDS:          In the context of summary

11   judgment or at trial, we would be required to prove

12   what we have now alleged.

13               JUSTICE STEVENS:              But my question is you

14   can prove what you've now alleged factually, but they

15   deny the existence of any agreement and they

16   explained the reasons for it exactly as the lawyers

17   did in this brief.      Would you not lose on summary

18   judgment?

19               MR. RICHARDS:          If we don't have proof at

20   that point of what we've alleged here, we'd lose --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:           After several years --

22               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Prove what you have

23   alleged, in effect, except for the key allegation of

24   agreement among the competitors.                 If you had no other

25   evidence of that agreement, would you win.

 1                MR. RICHARDS:         If we had proof that they

 2   actually acted against what would have been their

 3   self-interest in the absence of a conspiracy, we

 4   would satisfy then the Matsushita standard for

 5   summary judgment.

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I don't understand

 7   acting in self interest.           I mean, they might just

 8   decide apart from, you know, if they go into their

 9   territory they'll come into mine, that investing in

10   this wired business isn't the best, the best bet for

11   them.     Maybe they want to get into the wireless

12   business and think that's a better way to spend their

13   money.

14                MR. BARNETT:        Surely it is possible to

15   conceive of facts under which they would not have not

16   conspired and they would have had a different motive,

17   but that's not the legal standard under Conley versus

18   Gibson.

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But I'm questioning

20   you.     You say you meet the plus factor because they

21   were acting against their self- interest, that a

22   self-interested player in this league would have gone

23   into the other's territory, and I'm questioning that

24   by saying that they might have seen this whole area

25   as not the best place to invest their money.

 1               MR. RICHARDS:        I understand that.      But we

 2   have alleged that as fact, Justice Ginsburg, and that

 3   fact and that allegation has to be treated as true

 4   under conventional pleading standards for purposes of

 5   a motion to dismiss.      If we are unable to prove that

 6   fact when we get to summary judgment --

 7               JUSTICE STEVENS:            You mean the mere fact

 8   that you have alleged something is against their

 9   self-interest is enough to make an issue of fact on

10   whether it's against their self-interest?

11               MR. RICHARDS:        Yes, yes.

12               JUSTICE STEVENS:            They could have gone on

13   the stand, they gave all the reasons in the red

14   briefs -- or the blue briefs in this case, that say

15   it's not against their self-interest; you'd say that

16   would be a jury question?

17               MR. RICHARDS:        No, not at summary

18   judgment.   What I'm saying is that at the pleading

19   stage to allege that, which is an allegation of fact,

20   satisfies pleading standards.             Just to allege it with

21   testimony on the other side and no evidence to prove

22   that allegation on summary judgment --

23               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Are you suggesting that

24   you don't have to prove an actual agreement?             You can

25   merely prove conduct contrary to self-interest is

 1   sufficient?

 2             MR. RICHARDS:         Conduct contrary to

 3   self-interest is a way of inferring actual agreement

 4   in the absence of direct evidence.

 5             JUDGE STEVENS:          Do you agree you must --

 6   do you agree that you must prove an actual agreement

 7   among the defendants?

 8             MR. RICHARDS:         There must be an inference

 9   of actual agreement, but the inference can be drawn

10   from circumstantial evidence, and that's what

11   Matsushita is all about.

12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So then when we

13   get back to the paragraph 51, let me start with your

14   statement at the bottom half of that paragraph, that

15   plaintiffs allege upon information and belief that

16   they have entered into a contract, is a conclusion

17   based upon your prior allegations, it's not an

18   independent allegation of an agreement.                It's saying

19   because of this parallel conduct, because we think

20   it's contrary to their self interest, therefore, they

21   have agreed.

22             MR. RICHARDS:         Counsel presented it as

23   though it's a complete summary of everything, but

24   what it says is, and the other facts and market

25   circumstances alleged above, and it's preceded by --

 1             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But it's a

 2   statement of a conclusion based upon your allegations

 3   that precede it.

 4             MR. RICHARDS:          Correct.

 5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It's not a

 6   statement that independently there apart from all of

 7   this, there's an agreement.

 8             MR. RICHARDS:          Well, it's also an

 9   independent statement and allegation on information

10   and belief, which is permitted under Rule 8, that

11   there is agreement.

12             JUSTICE ALITO:           I guess if you had just

13   alleged the last part of paragraph 51, plaintiffs

14   have alleged, plaintiffs allege upon information and

15   belief, et cetera, without the detail that you

16   provided, would that have been sufficient?

17             MR. RICHARDS:          If you gave no context of

18   what kind of a conspiracy you were alleging and what

19   kind of scope it had, so that a court could balance

20   --

21             JUSTICE ALITO:           But you omit all the

22   allegations about parallel conduct and the other

23   allegations that you think provide a basis for

24   inferring a conspiracy from the parallel conduct, if

25   you omit all that but you just include the last part


                                       42

 1   of 51, would that be enough?

 2                MR. RICHARDS:        If there isn't enough in

 3   the way of facts alleged to permit a court to

 4   understand what it is you're claiming in general

 5   terms happening, then you haven't satisfied Rule 8.

 6   I mean --

 7                JUSTICE SOUTER:         What's the answer to

 8   Justice Alito's question in this case?

 9                MR. RICHARDS:        Well, in this case we have

10   provided, as the Second Circuit --

11                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            No.    His hypothetical is

12   all you've done is to allege the final sentence

13   without the preceding clause, the five or six lines

14   before there's a comma.         That's out.              All there is is

15   the allegation of the conspiracy.                 Is that enough in

16   this case?

17                MR. RICHARDS:        In this case with the

18   allegations of the nature of the conspiracy that

19   precede that sentence, it's enough.

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            No.    The hypothetical is

21   without the preceding clause.              Is that enough --

22                MR. RICHARDS:        That sentence by itself --

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Is that enough in this

24   case for what Justice Alito asked, and I think we are

25   interested in the answer that you make given this

 1   complaint in this case that we are faced with.

 2               MR. RICHARDS:         I think that that would

 3   satisfy conventional pleading standards under Rule

 4   8(a).    On the other hand, I don't think it would

 5   satisfy the Second Circuit's standard below, because

 6   the Second Circuit required enough facts to enable a

 7   court to wrap its mind around a complainant,

 8   understanding what it is you claimed happened.                 You

 9   don't have to prove your case as a complainant, you

10   just have to --

11               JUSTICE BREYER:          I'd also like a clear

12   answer, and I would like to go back to Justice

13   Stevens' question because I'm not sure what you're

14   thinking there.    We have three steel sheet companies

15   in the United States, no more.               They sell at $10 a

16   sheet.   One day we have action in the case, a memo to

17   the president of the company.              He says Mr. President,

18   if you cut your prices to $7 you will make even more

19   money unless the others go along.                 And if they get

20   there first, you will lose money.                 So whether they

21   cut or not, you'd better cut your prices.                 Reply from

22   the president:    But if I don't cut my prices, they

23   won't cut theirs, and we are all better off.                 That's

24   your evidence.    Do you win?

25               MR. RICHARDS:         That would depend on the

 1   vehicle --

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:         There is no depend.

 3   That's the evidence.       Do you win?

 4                MR. RICHARDS:        If that's the evidence, I

 5   think I win.

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:         All right.          And you cite

 7   Matsushita for that?

 8                MR. RICHARDS:        No.      For that I would cite

 9   Judge Posner's decision.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:         If you're right, then I

11   guess we could engage in this major restructuring of

12   the economy, and if that's the law, I'm surprised

13   they haven't done it, but maybe they have just been

14   recalcitrant.

15                MR. RICHARDS:        Well, there's no major

16   restructuring of the --

17                JUSTICE BREYER:         Well, because we have

18   concentrated industries throughout the economy, I

19   guess, or at least we used to, and I suppose that

20   that's a perfectly valid way of reasoning for an

21   executive in such a company, at least they teach that

22   at the schools of government, and people who aren't

23   really experienced in these things, but --

24                MR. RICHARDS:        Well, the way Judge Posner

25   explains it in High Fructose is to say that it is


                                        45

 1   possible to have an agreement without a moment where

 2   there's a statement of agreement.                  The participants

 3   in a conspiracy can possibly treat what one of them

 4   does as an offer, which another one can accept by

 5   following it, to satisfy that way of showing a

 6   conspiracy.

 7              JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay, fine.         Now, let's

 8   forget my immediate disagreement or not.                   Let's say I

 9   agree with you on this.          Now we have our example

10   right in mind.     What other than the parallel to my

11   example could one reading this complaint think you

12   intend to prove?

13              MR. RICHARDS:           Well, Your Honor, the

14   strongest -- plus factors that, in the absence of

15   direct evidence of conspiracy at the outset of a

16   case, which private plaintiffs will almost never have

17   because people don't conspire in public parks.                   All a

18   plaintiff can have is what are called plus factors

19   under Matsushita, and the strongest of those plus

20   factors is what has been alleged in great detail in

21   this complaint of action against self interest.                     The

22   case law recognizes that --

23              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But how do you

24   tell?   I mean, companies get proposals all the time.

25   Here's a way you could make more money.                   You could

 1   all enter the market in some foreign country.                 The

 2   people decide, I mean, life is short and they've got

 3   certain objectives, and they don't have to do

 4   everything that an economist might think is in their

 5   economic self interest.        I mean, what is the limiting

 6   self interest to that?

 7             MR. RICHARDS:          This is different from that

 8   because this is a situation where when the

 9   Telecommunications Act was passed in 1996, Congress

10   expected that the ILECs would compete in one

11   another's territories as CLECs.              The defendants

12   pledged that they would compete in one another's

13   territories at ILECs.      They then for years in

14   Congress complained that the CLECs who were trying to

15   compete with them were given an unfair advantage in

16   the terms and conditions on which they were permitted

17   to --

18             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Is it an adequate

19   response for the executive to say, I'm a little risk

20   averse, I want to see how things work out over the

21   next five years.   They keep changing the laws, the

22   regulatory environment.        That's why I didn't jump in

23   and compete?

24             MR. RICHARDS:          If they can prove that

25   that's the reason why they didn't jump in and


                                       47

 1   compete, then they have a nonconspiratorial reason

 2   for what they did.

 3             JUSTICE SOUTER:             But if they don't do

 4   that, is it your argument that simply by behaving

 5   differently from the way Congress assumed when it

 6   passed the statute, that raises the plausible

 7   inference of violation?

 8             MR. RICHARDS:            Within the other facts that

 9   I was identifying, there is a strong suggestion here

10   that competition as a CLEC would have been, in the

11   absence of the pattern of conduct that we allege

12   here, would have been a profitable endeavor.

13             JUSTICE SOUTER:             Okay.        But is part of the

14   plausibility of that inference the fact, in your

15   argument, the fact that Congress assumed that would

16   happen?

17             MR. RICHARDS:            That's one factor that I

18   point to among several to --

19             JUSTICE SOUTER:             But I mean, the

20   congressional assumption is part of your case, in

21   other words?

22             MR. RICHARDS:            It is.

23             JUSTICE SOUTER:             Yes.

24             MR. RICHARDS:            I believe that along with

25   other factors such as the constant complaints to

 1   Congress about how CLECs had the better side of the

 2   deal than the ILECs, along with the pledges of the

 3   defendants that they would do, and that they didn't

 4   do.

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:         I used to work in the

 6   field of telecommunications and if the criterion is

 7   that happens which Congress expected to happen when

 8   it passed its law, your case is very weak.

 9               MR. RICHARDS:        Well, Your Honor, that -- I

10   certainly don't expect that that is the evidence that

11   we would be relying on at trial or at summary

12   judgment to support our case, but in our motion to

13   dismiss we don't have to have the evidence to support

14   our case.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, you need what is

16   called the plus factor, and I gather that you

17   acknowledge that if I disagree with you that this,

18   this parallel action seemed to be against the self

19   interest of the companies, you no longer have a plus

20   factor and you would lose.

21               MR. RICHARDS:        I don't think that the

22   Court, if the Court comes to a conclusion on its own

23   that the facts that we have alleged, which is that it

 1   not following conventional pleading standards.

 2             JUSTICE SCALIA:          So all you have to do to

 3   prove, to establish a plus factor is to say in your

 4   pleading, and there is a plus factor?

 5             MR. RICHARDS:         Well, you have to say what

 6   it is.

 7             JUSTICE SCALIA:          You have to say what it

 8   is, that's all, and even if it's implausible?

 9             MR. RICHARDS:         Well, if it's implausible,

10   that might be a different consideration.

11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Richards, didn't

12   the Second Circuit say you don't need a plus factor?

13   They said if you did, we think that the plaintiffs

14   could show it, but the second sentence is you don't

15   need a plus factor.

16             MR. RICHARDS:         That's correct.

17             JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And that can be wrong

18   or right, but the Second Circuit was very clear that

19   Rule 8 wants a plain statement of the claim and no

20   plus factor.

21             MR. RICHARDS:         I agree with that, Your

22   Honor, and my contention as to what the law is is

23   that we are not required to plead plus factors.           But

24   the fact remains that we have, and that our factual

25   pleading of plus factors has to be treated as true

 1   for purposes of a --

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:          What if you pled more than

 3   you had to, and it's clear from what you pled that

 4   you were drawing an implausible inference?                Can't the

 5   complaint then be dismissed for failure to state a

 6   claim?

 7                MR. RICHARDS:         No, I don't believe that it

 8   can be if -- because the Court is not, the correct

 9   function of the Court under a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is

10   not to be decided by whether it believes or is

11   persuaded by the allegations in the complaint.

12                JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, let's take the Form

13   9 where you take the form complaint for an automobile

14   accident, and suppose what it says is, I was injured

15   in an automobile accident at a particular place in

16   time.     I was hit by a compact car with Massachusetts

17   plates.     The defendant owns the compact car with

18   Massachusetts plates.        That's the complaint.         The

19   Court can't dismiss that for failure to state a claim

20   when it's apparent from the face of the claim that

21   you're, that the basis for suing the defendant is a

22   totally implausible inference?

23                MR. RICHARDS:         Well, if the allegation is

24   also made that the defendant was negligent, then I

25   think it clearly satisfies the pleading standard

 1   under Form 9.     I think it would be a more detailed

 2   complaint than the sample that comprises Form 9 of

 3   the rules.

 4                JUSTICE ALITO:          Even if it reveals that

 5   the only basis for identifying this person as the

 6   defendant is the fact that the person has a

 7   Massachusetts license plate and a compact car?

 8                MR. RICHARDS:         Yes, because that's more

 9   than nothing, and the rule in Form 9 contains

10   nothing.

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, it contains a

12   time and a place.     It's quite specific that there was

13   an accident and that defendant, defendant of a

14   certain name at a certain time and place negligently

15   drove.     What it doesn't tell you is the details of

16   the, of what was negligent, but it certainly is

17   specific in time and place and person, which is one

18   of the -- one of the concerns, I mean, if you strip

19   away everything, it seems that you have a suspicion

20   that there may have been a conspiracy and you want to

21   use a discovery process to find out whether or not

22   that's true.     Isn't that essentially what this

23   complaint is?

24                MR. RICHARDS:         That is the situation that

25   any plaintiff is going to be in in a horizontal

 1   conspiracy case in the sense that we don't know for

 2   certain that there was a conspiracy.                     We have

 3   observed market facts which are suggestive of a

 4   conspiracy and we allege that there was a conspiracy.

 5   Now under conventional standards, all we would have

 6   to do is allege that there was a conspiracy and say

 7   what it was.    We wouldn't have to plead a basis to

 8   infer that we are correct or incorrect because that's

 9   not the analysis that Rule 12(b)(6) --

10             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But you don't

11   think you have to prove that either?                     I mean, you

12   don't think you have to prove anything more than what

13   you've alleged in the complaint about the background

14   context, the parallel conduct?

15             MR. RICHARDS:           If the Court -- if we were

16   to prove to the satisfaction of the finder of fact

17   that the conduct we have pointed to here was or would

18   have been contrary to the interests of the defendants

19   in the absence of a conspiracy, we were to prove that

20   as distinguished from pleading, we would satisfy

21   Matsushita.    Now at that stage in the case, it's

22   inconceivable that there won't be all kinds of other

23   memos and, you know, real world things that will shed

24   light on why the defendants internally think they did

25   this.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:         How much money do you

 2   think it would have cost the defendants by then to

 3   assemble all of the documents that you're going to be

 4   interested in looking at?           How many buildings will

 5   have to be rented to store those documents and how

 6   many years will be expended in, in gathering all the

 7   materials?

 8                MR. RICHARDS:        Well, to address that

 9   concern, which we share, because we don't gain

10   anything with Matsushita.           At the end of the road in

11   the case, we don't gain anything by pursuing a case

12   for years in an unnecessarily burdensome way if we

13   are not sure that it's going to prevail.                 So we

14   proposed in this case a phased discovery process,

15   pursuant to which you would first have discovery into

16   conspiracy, and then the Court would have an early

17   opportunity for a Matsushita motion and we either

18   carry the day at that point or we don't.                 That's

19   discovery.

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           At what point does it

21   get characterized as a class action, before this

22   discovery or after?

23                MR. RICHARDS:        It's at the Court's

24   discretion when to entertain the motion for class

25   certification.    In this particular case the


                                        54

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   defendants, a couple of the defendants proposed that

 2   we include in that phased discovery proposal class

 3   certification as an additional subject of that first

 4   phase of discovery, and we would be amenable to that

 5   as a compromise.   But the point, getting back to

 6   Justice Scalia's point, that discovery as to whether

 7   there was a conspiracy in this case in order to

 8   satisfy that first phased analysis, would not need to

 9   be terribly burdensome and wouldn't necessarily be

10   more burdensome than all kinds of other cases.                It's

11   really a very targeted issue.             I think it's actually

12   an appropriate way to deal with cases of this kind

13   and it's actually a way that the Court has proposed

14   dealing with similar issues in the past in the

15   Anderson versus Creighton case.

16             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, how would it

17   be focused if you're talking about whether it's in

18   their economic interest?         You would have to say why,

19   why didn't you enter into this particular realm of

20   competition and they would say, well because we were

21   doing other things.     We had other areas that we were

22   focusing on.   And they would have to document all

23   that to your satisfaction.

24             MR. RICHARDS:          We'd -- we would ask for

25   production of documents reflecting their thinking


                                       55

 1   process about entering into one another's

 2   territories.     And that would be very enlightening.

 3   And after we get those documents we would have a much

 4   clearer idea and be able to share with the Court a

 5   much clearer idea of the entire picture of a kind

 6   that we can't have at the 12(b)(6) stage.

 7                Thank you.

11            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL KELLOGG,

12                   ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

13                MR. KELLOGG:        Thank you.               Your Honor.

14                I have three quick points that I would

15   like to make.     First following up on Justice

16   Ginsburg's point, the private plaintiffs do not have

17   an authority to issue purely investigative

18   complaints.     The Department of Justice of course can

19   issue civil investigative demands, but for private

20   plaintiffs the price of admission even to discovery,

21   particularly to the sort of massive discovery at

22   issue here, is to establish some basis for thinking

23   the plaintiff -- the defendants have done something

24   wrong.   In that regard, in the Trinko case, the

25   plaintiffs there specifically alleged that the


                                         56

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   defendants were engaged in actions against self

 2   interest by not cooperating with new entrants.                 And

 3   what the Court did is it went behind that mere

 4   allegation, looked at the complaint, looked at facts

 5   concerning the industry, looked at the statute,

 6   regulatory rulings and said that's ridiculous.                 Of

 7   course it is in the self interest of the incumbents

 8   to not go out of their way to cooperate with new

 9   entrants to allow them to take business away.

10              Now the flip side, the second half of the

11   conspiracy that the plaintiffs alleged here is our

12   failure to enter new markets.            And it's important to

13   recognize that they are suggesting we should have

14   relied upon a regulatory regime that we were

15   successfully challenging in the courts.                 We got it

16   struck down three separate times, and it was simply

17   not a viable business opportunity in light of those

18   facts and there is no reason to suggest that it was

19   anything but in the self interest of the defendants

20   to decline to enter these markets.                 Even conscious

21   parallelism is not sufficient to state a claim under

22   the antitrust laws.     And at best, that is what we

23   have here, and as a consequence they failed to state

24   a claim.

25              If the Court has further questions?                 I

 3   Mr. Kellogg.   The case is submitted.
