 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               We'll hear argument

 4   this afternoon in Case 08-969, Hemi Group v. The City of

 5   New York.

 6                Mr. Barnhouse.

 7           ORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDOLPH H. BARNHOUSE

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9                MR. BARNHOUSE:         Thank you, Mr. Chief

10   Justice, and may it please the Court:

11                Possessory and use taxes are extremely

12   difficult to collect, even under the best of

13   circumstances.   Indeed, here the city alleges in its

14   second amended complaint that it only collected 40 cents

15   on the dollar, and its response claims a collection rate

16   of 55 cents on the dollar.          Yet it wants to collect 300

17   cents on the dollar from my clients, who never owed

18   these taxes in the first place.

19                The Respondent City of New York alleged two

20   RICO claims and pendent State law violations that the

21   city said resulted in a lost sovereign opportunity to

22   collect cigarette possessory taxes from its city

23   residents.   The alleged lost opportunity to tax was

24   based on claims that my clients and 50 other defendants

25   in four consolidated cases did not send names of


                                       3

 1   customers to the State of New York and had statements on

 2   their website saying sales were tax-free and no tobacco

 3   taxes applied.

 4               The Federal district court dismissed all

 5   claims.   The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated

 6   one of the city's RICO claims against the Petitioners,

 7   the Hemi Group and its sole owner, Kai Gachupin, and

 8   affirmed dismissal of the city's other RICO and its

 9   common law fraud claims.

10               Yet reinstating the one RICO claim was

11   improper because the city does not have standing to sue,

12   based on the injuries that it has alleged.                     It does not

13   have standing because the city's claim that it lost the

14   sovereign opportunity to tax is not an injury to -- to

15   business, and it's not an injury to property.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Why -- why isn't the

17   money property?

18               MR. BARNHOUSE:            Money in the bank would be

19   property, Mr. Chief Justice Roberts, but an opportunity

20   to collect money is an inchoate interest, and so it

21   would not be property at that point.                     It would be the

22   opportunity to collect it.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, isn't a

24   lawsuit with a potential recovery regarded as property

25   of an individual?

 1                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         The lawsuit would be -- the

 2   lawsuit itself would be property, but the -- but any

 3   recovery would not be property until it became choate,

 4   until there was an amount of money assigned to it.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           There is no such

 6   adjective -- I know we have used it, but there is no

 7   such adjective as "choate."             There is "inchoate," but

 8   the opposite of "inchoate" is not "choate."

 9                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         All right.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Any more than the -- I

11   don't know.

12                 (Laughter.)

13                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         Well, I'm wrong on the -- on

14   the --

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Exactly.        Yes.   It's like

16   "gruntled."

17                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         But I think I am right on

18   the law, Your Honor.

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Exactly.        "Disgruntled" and

20   the opposite of "disgruntled" is "gruntled."

21                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         Is "gruntled."

22                 (Laughter.)

23                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         Well, it would -- it would

24   be inchoate at the time the -- the city was just

25   exercising its opportunity to tax, but had not -- or


                                        5

 1   exercising its sovereign right to tax, but had not yet

 2   assessed the tax --

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I thought the status of

 4   taxes owing for wire fraud purposes was settled in

 5   Pasquantino.     There it was a question of alcohol taxes

 6   owed to Canada.

 7                 There were taxes due, but not paid.            So why

 8   doesn't Pasquantino settle at least the property

 9   question that taxes owed to a sovereign qualify as

10   property?

11                 MR. BARNHOUSE:          Justice Ginsburg,

12   Pasquantino, the holding there was -- it was a criminal

13   prosecution by the U.S. Government, and it dealt with

14   the term "property" in the -- in the Mail and Wire Fraud

15   Statute, not the overlying 1964(c) requirement of injury

16   to business or property.

17                 Moreover, it was the taxpayer who was being

18   prosecuted, the person who actually had taken the liquor

19   into Canada, not some third party that said, let me sell

20   you the liquor.

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, there are certainly

22   differences from this case, and it wasn't a RICO case,

23   either.     But why would the determination of what --

24   whether an amount owed to a government qualifies as

25   property, why wouldn't -- why would that answer differ?

 1               MR. BARNHOUSE:          Justice Ginsburg, once the

 2   amount owed is assessed, once there's a determination of

 3   the amount owed --

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            There was no assessment

 5   by Canada in the Pasquantino case.

 6               MR. BARNHOUSE:          There was --

 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            They said the -- the

 8   defendant was smuggling liquor into Canada and getting

 9   it there without paying the Canadians' exorbitant taxes.

10               MR. BARNHOUSE:          The prosecution on the mail

11   and wire fraud criminal -- well, criminal standing was

12   not an issue there.      It was the U.S. Government --

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But we're talking

14   about -- only about property, not standing or anything

15   else.   And in Pasquantino, the Court said that a scheme

16   aimed -- aimed at depriving Canada of money to which it

17   was entitled by law qualifies as property for wire fraud

18   purposes.

19               MR. BARNHOUSE:          Yes, Your Honor, for wire

20   fraud purposes.   and the Court took a very expansive

21   view of property in Pasquantino.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:            So why is this different?

23   I mean, it's clear that "property" can mean that.            You

24   acknowledge that it can mean the government's

25   entitlement to money from taxes?

 1                 MR. BARNHOUSE:          For purposes of the -- of

 2   the Mail and Wire Fraud Statute, this Court has held

 3   that property can be for purposes of --

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            So it can mean that.     Now

 5   why -- why should we say it doesn't mean that here?

 6                 MR. BARNHOUSE:          At the time, because of the

 7   overlying standing requirement Congress placed in RICO

 8   of injury to a person's business or property, and

 9   because of Congress's reliance at that time on the

10   antitrust laws and the general understanding at that

11   time that business or property did not include the type

12   of sovereign interest in an opportunity to collect tax,

13   as confirmed by the Ninth Circuit and this Court in

14   Hawaii v. Standard Oil of California that this Court

15   affirmed, where the sovereign opportunity to tax is much

16   difference -- different from the actual collection of a

17   -- of a set amount of tax that the government knows it

18   has coming.

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is the word "property" used

20   in the antitrust laws?

21                 MR. BARNHOUSE:          Yes, Your Honor.       In fact,

22   the -- I'm sorry.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            What does it say?

24                 MR. BARNHOUSE:          The standing for purposes of

25   the antitrust laws is injury.              A person has standing who


                                         8

 1   has been injured in his business or property.                It's

 2   exactly the same as in RICO.              In fact, Congress took the

 3   language from the antitrust laws, Justice Scalia, and

 4   placed it into RICO unchanged.

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:               And it -- and it's clear

 6   that for purposes of the antitrust laws, property does

 7   not include the government's entitlement to income from

 8   taxes?

 9              MR. BARNHOUSE:             Yes, Your Honor.      In Hawaii,

10   this Court made it clear that --

11              JUSTICE STEVENS:               The Hawaii case didn't

12   involve a claim to taxes.

13              MR. BARNHOUSE:             Justice Stevens, it was a

14   claim of injury to the general economy, which included

15   --

16              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Right, and parens patriae

17   for the community at large.

18              MR. BARNHOUSE:             Yes, Your Honor.      The State

19   of Hawaii brought three claims.                One was its injury to

20   itself; one was the potential class action; and then the

21   parens patriae claim.

22              JUSTICE STEVENS:               But none of them involved

23   a claim to taxes.

24              MR. BARNHOUSE:             It was my understanding that

25   the injury to the general economy, the underlying claim


                                         9

 1   was that by losing that economic engine, that the State

 2   itself would be injured because of the loss to the

 3   economy and in its governmental functions.                    The actual

 4   --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes, but that -- that's

 6   something different.        This isn't just the general, you

 7   know, you hurt the economy and therefore you hurt the

 8   State.     Here, what they're saying is:                 You caused people

 9   who owed me taxes not to pay taxes, an identified sum of

10   money.

11                 MR. BARNHOUSE:          Justice Scalia, it's not an

12   identified sum of money.          They don't know -- they can't

13   tell who owed the taxes, in what amount, whether any of

14   those people were eligible for the exemption under the

15   law.     It was inchoate.      It was not known.            It was not

16   known who owed it or --

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, it might have been

18   inchoate but still -- they would have to be prove that,

19   I assume, in the litigation here, wouldn't they?                   I

20   mean, let's assume we let the litigation go forward.

21   Wouldn't they have to prove what taxes were not paid?

22                 MR. BARNHOUSE:          They would have to -- they

23   would absolutely have to prove that for purposes of

24   damages.

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           So worry about that later.

 1   I mean, just because some of them might be difficult to

 2   prove or not provable doesn't mean that the rest that

 3   are very clear do not constitute property.

 4                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         The -- the -- what they've

 5   alleged here is not that they've lost the taxes, but

 6   that they've lost the opportunity to tax.               Moreover,

 7   they should not be able to reach that point because the

 8   allegations themselves are that the injury is not

 9   proximate.    It is the city itself --

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          That's a different issue.

11                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         It is a different issue.

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          You're going to talk about

13   that one, aren't you?

14                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         I was hoping for a smooth

15   transition, Justice Scalia.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          You've got it.

17                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         The -- the injury to the

18   city is much like the injury in Holmes, where the city

19   claims to be at the tail end of the chain of causation.

20   They allege two injuries, sources of their injury.              One

21   was that statements made on an Internet website somehow

22   caused people who purchased cigarettes in New York City

23   not to pay.    The district court described that source of

24   injury as farfetched.       Those were Judge Batts' words.

25                 The second source of injury they claim is

 1   that by not reporting to the State of New York, the city

 2   then did not receive information about which city

 3   residents purchased cigarettes, and the city could then

 4   not go to those residents who had not self-assessed, and

 5   --

 6               JUSTICE ALITO:           Putting aside the fact that

 7   the Jenkins Act information would be sent to the State

 8   rather than the city, why -- how can you -- how can it

 9   be said that at this stage of the litigation that it's

10   farfetched that having a statement on the website "No

11   taxes due" is -- doesn't cause people to purchase those

12   cigarettes for the very purpose of avoiding the taxes?

13               MR. BARNHOUSE:           Well, Justice Alito, the

14   allegations here are not that there were no taxes due.

15   There wasn't someone waving a tea bag and saying, "Don't

16   pay your taxes."   What the website's allegations are is

17   that the sales are tax-free, and the sales were

18   tax-free.   As the city points out, they -- it was beyond

19   the power of the city to impose any sales tax on these

20   transactions which occurred on the Jemez Pueblo in New

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:            What is it, a user tax once

23   it gets into the city?

24               MR. BARNHOUSE:           Exactly, Justice Scalia.

25   It's a possessory tax --

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Like automobiles.

 2                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         Pardon me?

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Just like automobiles.      If

 4   you buy a car out of the State, you haven't paid the

 5   State sales tax, but if you bring it into the State, you

 6   have to pay a use tax.

 7                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         That's right.      That's right,

 8   Justice Scalia, and the obligation to pay that tax is on

 9   the person who brings the car into the State.              The

10   obligation to pay the possessory use tax is on the

11   citizens of the city of New York.

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          And that's all it was

13   alleged that these websites said, "tax-free"?              They said

14   "tax-free"?

15                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         "Sales are tax-free."

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          "Sales are tax-free."

17   That's very clever.

18                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         And "no tobacco tax."       Those

19   are the two allegations.

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          No -- "no tobacco tax"?

21                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         Yes, Your Honor.

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          But there is a tobacco tax,

23   isn't there?    Don't you -- wouldn't you call that use

24   tax a tax on tobacco?

25                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         No, Your Honor, it's

 1   specifically not a tax on tobacco.                  It's a tax on the

 2   possession of cigarettes and there are exemptions to it.

 3                JUSTICE ALITO:           Why isn't that just a

 4   question -- a substantive fraud question, rather than a

 5   proximate cause question?

 6                MR. BARNHOUSE:           The --

 7                JUSTICE ALITO:           Is it -- is it fraudulent to

 8   say "sales are tax-free" as opposed to, you know, saying

 9   no taxes are due?

10                MR. BARNHOUSE:           Well, it has to do with the

11   intervening, Justice Alito, with -- with intervening

12   causes of the city's failure to collect these taxes.

13                The -- RICO requires someone who has been

14   injured in their business or property by reason of the

15   alleged proximate act, and the fact is the city here was

16   injured in its -- was injured, if at all, by reason of

17   its citizens' failure to self-assess and pay their

18   taxes.

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             It was injured because it

20   couldn't find its citizens because it didn't know who

21   they were.   And that was the whole idea of the Jenkins

22   Act, was to help States find the people who were evading

23   the payment of the use tax on the cigarettes.

24                MR. BARNHOUSE:           Yes, Justice Ginsburg.       The

25   Jenkins Act was -- was focused on allowing States to

 1   help find those, and the city is therefore outside the

 2   zone of interest.

 3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, suppose -- suppose

 4   you had a case in which an individual that lives in New

 5   York goes to a person with a supply of cigarettes

 6   outside the State and says:             I want to buy a lot of

 7   cigarettes and I don't want to pay taxes; can you help

 8   me?   And they agree on an arrangement to ship, to ship

 9   the cigarettes.

10                 Is there proximate cause?                  Is it there if

11   the city sues for injury in that hypothetical case?

12   Would you say there's no proximate cause?

13                 MR. BARNHOUSE:          I would say that there is no

14   proximate cause for a lawsuit under RICO against the

15   seller who the person went to and said:                    My goal here is

16   not to pay taxes; can you help me figure out a way to

17   get them into the city in a way that I don't have to?

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And you think the city --

19   and you think the city cannot show proximate cause in a

20   suit for its injury against the seller of the

21   cigarettes?    You think there's no proximate cause in

22   that hypothetical case?

23                 MR. BARNHOUSE:          Yes, Your Honor, I would say

24   that there would be an intervening, Justice Kennedy,

25   there would be the intervening cause of the person's

 1   decision.   It's -- it's beyond the first step.

 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Even though those are the

 3   only two people that have made the arrangement, and that

 4   was the whole purpose and intent of the arrangement?

 5   And you still say there's no proximate cause?

 6               MR. BARNHOUSE:          Your Honor, the intent to

 7   injure, even if specific, as the Court held in

 8   Associated General Contractors, is not itself sufficient

 9   to change -- to give someone standing under RICO.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Does your answer to

11   Justice Kennedy depend upon a notion that the causation

12   standard as -- in RICO is different than general

13   proximate cause standards in tort law?

14               MR. BARNHOUSE:          No, Your Honor, because I

15   believe that the proximate cause standard that the Court

16   has adopted rests at its core in proximate cause

17   analysis in tort law.      When the Court first started

18   applying proximate cause requirements in the antitrust

19   law and in RICO, it was looking at, as I understand it,

20   the -- the common law analysis of proximate cause,

21   and -- and it really discussed the elements of that

22   quite clearly in the Associated General Contractors case

23   where it talks about five or six factors that the Court

24   has to look at, those factors being the nature of the

25   plaintiff's alleged injury, is it -- whether it was the

 1   type that the antitrust laws were intended to forestall,

 2   or here the RICO laws.         We would submit that it is not.

 3   It's an injury to a sovereign interest.

 4              The directness of the injury.                    Here the

 5   injury is indirect.      It either comes -- flows through

 6   the citizens who didn't pay their taxes or through the

 7   State that didn't get the reports of customers in the

 8   city.

 9              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Can you go back to the

10   question I had asked you and was not finished getting

11   your position on.     Jenkins requires report to the State.

12   You say the city was not within the zone of interest.

13   But from the point of view of the sellers, the

14   out-of-state sellers of cigarettes, my goodness, would

15   they really want not only to have the burden of sending

16   a list of names to the State, but to every county and

17   municipality?   Isn't it the -- just as it is in New

18   York, there is a working relationship.                   The State gets

19   all the names, and then it sends the names to the

20   cities.

21              You -- you -- I -- you're suggesting that it

22   would be okay if the Jenkins Act had made it even more

23   burdensome to the cigarette sellers by saying not only

24   do you have to disclose to the State but also to any

25   municipality that independently taxes cigarettes?

 1              MR. BARNHOUSE:            Justice Ginsburg, Congress

 2   could have given the States power to share those lists,

 3   but it did not under the Jenkins Act.                   And it's not

 4   clear that -- that -- even the agreement --

 5              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Is it -- we're told that

 6   New York City and New York State have a tax information-

 7   sharing agreement pursuant to which the State does share

 8   this information with the city.

 9              MR. BARNHOUSE:            The -- the agreement, and

10   it's quoted on page 6 of the response -- and I want to

11   get this right -- says, Justice Ginsburg in paragraph 1

12   of the quote, in footnote 6:             "Provided, that the

13   disclosure of that information is permissible under

14   existing laws and agreements."              And this is proprietary

15   information.    These are customer lists.

16              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, what do you do

17   with -- what do you do with Justice Ginsburg's

18   hypothetical?    I mean, she can pursue her own question,

19   but I'm interested in the answer.

20              Her question is, suppose the statute were

21   amended so that the information had to be given to the

22   city as well as to the State; would the case then be

23   different, hypothetical case?

24              MR. BARNHOUSE:            Yes, it would be different,

25   because in that instance the city would be the --


                                       18

 1   would -- would as -- would -- would be the direct

 2   victim, would be within the zone of interest of the

 3   statute.

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Are there any sanctions for

 5   failing to comply with the Jenkins Act, just on its own,

 6   without having to go through RICO?

 7                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         Justice Scalia, it's a

 8   misdemeanor violation and it has to be prosecuted by the

 9   U.S. Government.     Those -- that's the extent of the

10   Jenkins Act.    And -- and the -- and what the city has

11   done here, as Judge Winter noted in his dissent, is take

12   the misdemeanor Federal criminal law and bootstrap it

13   into RICO, seeking 300 cents on the dollar through mail

14   and wire fraud.

15                 These sales occurred on the Jemez Pueblo in

16   New Mexico.    And it's my client's position, and it's no

17   secret, he says on his websites that he doesn't -- that

18   the Jenkins Act, the scope of the Jenkins Act does not

19   include his sales.     There -- there's a dispute with the

20   city on that, but it's not even clear that the State had

21   a right to get these names, much less the city.

22                 Yet the city is claiming because it didn't

23   get the names -- and if it had the names it claims a

24   recovery rate between 40 cents and 55 cents on the

25   dollar -- it should be able to collect 300 cents on the


                                       19

 1   dollar from a business that didn't owe them in the first

 2   place.

 3               Because the civil RICO has a separate

 4   standing requirement separate from mail and wire fraud,

 5   as Justice O'Connor discussed in Holmes that it's not

 6   just the predicate act's standing requirement, but --

 7   but the person injured in his business or property by

 8   reason of -- because Congress took this "business or

 9   property" language right out of the antitrust laws

10   unchanged, the court in Hawaii interpreted that

11   language.   The court drew a bright line.                 It was a

12   pragmatic line, a workable line, an important line, that

13   that business or property did not include injury to a

14   sovereign interest.

15               The opportunity to collect taxes is a

16   sovereign interest.      The taxes themselves, once

17   collected or assessed, could be property, but not the

18   opportunity.     The injury flows either through the States

19   or consumers and, therefore, is not proximate.                  These

20   websites were not State-specific, much less

21   city-specific.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But you don't -- you

23   don't think that proximate cause is satisfied only with

24   respect to the person who is supposed to be paying the

25   taxes?   If there's some way in which someone else


                                        20

 1   contributes or makes it feasible or makes it more likely

 2   that the person is not going to pay his taxes, that's

 3   not automatically outside the scope of proximate cause,

 4   is it?

 5              MR. BARNHOUSE:           It wouldn't automatically be

 6   outside the scope of proximate cause, but if -- if it

 7   was action that made it more or less feasible.          But it

 8   would be unreasonable under this Court's decision in

 9   U.S. v. Boyle, where you -- where the Court held that

10   you cannot rely even on an agent for purposes of not

11   filing taxes -- it would be unreasonable for anyone to

12   rely on language on a vendor's Internet -- commercial

13   language on a vendor's Internet website to -- to -- to

14   decide that for some reason they didn't have an

15   obligation to pay.

16              And these websites had language that said --

17   the city attached the -- the pages from the websites

18   themselves to the -- they were part of the record, the

19   RICO record.   I had those just a second ago and I can't

20   seem to find them.

21              But the -- the website pages for my client

22   specifically had languages noted in the briefs that said

23   these are not city-specific or State-specific, that --

24   that you need to contact -- you should contact your

25   State officials for purposes of determining what your

 1   individual obligations are regarding possession and tax.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           How many people who buy

 3   cigarettes out of State come back to their home State

 4   and voluntarily pay the use tax?

 5                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         In the response to the

 6   petition, the city said it's a fraction, I believe, of

 7   the people.    They've also --

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Isn't there some exemption,

 9   anyway, for a couple of cartons?

10                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         There is an exemption, yes,

11   Justice Scalia.

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          For what, two cartons?

13                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         Two cartons of cigarettes.

14   And -- but -- but it's clear that possessory and use

15   taxes are a bear to collect for any government.             And the

16   city here, as I -- as stated in the record, says even

17   under the best of circumstances, Justice Ginsburg, it

18   collects only 40 cents on the dollar, perhaps as much as

19   55 --

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But it needs the names so

21   it can collect anything.         Otherwise, how is it -- how --

22   how would it ever know?

23                 MR. BARNHOUSE:         It would rely on its

24   citizens to step forward and pay it.

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           And they don't.

 1               MR. BARNHOUSE:            And they don't.     And that's

 2   the intervening cause of the -- that's --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:             It would probably cost them

 4   more to collect than -- than it's worth the money, don't

 5   you think, to sue individual citizens after they get the

 6   names?

 7               MR. BARNHOUSE:            It's a very expensive

 8   process, Your Honor, Justice Scalia, and it -- it's

 9   tedious.   You get the names.             You have to go through the

10   names and write.     There's a cost involved in all that.

11   There's a lot of friction in that entire process.

12   There -- there are lots of reasons that, even when the

13   city gets the names and even under its allegations of

14   collection rates, Justice Ginsburg, very small, 40 cents

15   to 55 cents on the dollar.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Do we know if these

17   Jenkins Act lists -- are they in fact maintained by the

18   State?

19               MR. BARNHOUSE:            It -- it's my understanding,

20   Justice Ginsburg, that the State would receive Jenkins

21   Act reports from some vendors.               Those can come in all

22   sorts of different formats, some of it just stacks of

23   paper perhaps.     And it would be the State's

24   responsibility then to go through those, select which

25   ones were residents of the city of New York, and then


                                        23
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   decide whether under existing laws it was even permitted

 2   to share this proprietary information with the city,

 3   before giving those to the city.

 4              It would then be the city's responsibility

 5   to take the list given to it by the State and decide who

 6   hasn't paid.   Then there's the exemption issue that

 7   comes on top of that.      And then go out and try to

 8   collect these amounts, which they allege to have done in

 9   at least two instances.

10              Finally, the policy -- I'm sorry.           The

11   policy that this Court adopted in Hawaii makes a --

12   makes very much sense, as recognized by courts who have

13   looked at issues such as additional fire protection,

14   payment of -- of public benefits, other instances where

15   governments have come forward and under RICO tried to

16   bring a claim to recover actual out-of-pocket expenses,

17   overtime that was paid to police that had to monitor

18   protests against abortion clinics, public benefits paid

19   to people who were not legally in the country and

21              Governments have brought those and the

25   property that Congress intended when it adopted RICO.

 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

 5              ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD J. KOERNER

 6                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 7              MR. KOERNER:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 8   please the Court:

 9              With respect to the definition of property,

10   this goes back to Wyoming v. Oklahoma, where in an

11   original jurisdiction case Wyoming sued the State of

12   Oklahoma on the ground that the State's regulation which

13   attempted to require Oklahoma coal-fired generation

14   plants to use 10 percent of Oklahoma coal, and prior to

15   the legislation all of Wyoming coal was used in the

16   generation plant.

17              Wyoming sued in this Court and the defense

18   was that Wyoming didn't have an interest because it lost

19   the opportunity to collect taxes.                  This Court found

20   standing and allowed them to sue and successfully

21   challenge under the interstate commerce rule.                  That was

22   before we get to Pasquantino.              Justice Ginsburg is quite

23   right --

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Excuse me.       Did -- was

25   there some statute at issue in that case which required

 1   not just an interest, but an interest in property?

 2                 MR. KOERNER:        No.

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well --

 4                 MR. KOERNER:        The -- it was just -- I was

 5   just going to -- yes, it was just a discussion of what

 6   was the nature of Wyoming's interest.                    Was it

 7   substantial enough to allow them to sue, challenging the

 8   Oklahoma statute.

 9                 In Pasquantino, though, the issue was

10   foreclosed.     In that particular case the issue of

11   definition of property was the exact same issue that you

12   have in the RICO case.         Indeed, mail and wire fraud is a

13   predicate for RICO.      In that case there was, as Justice

14   Ginsburg noted, a criminal prosecution based on the

15   importation of alcohol into Canada from Maryland.                     The

16   charge was wire fraud.

17                 And first, there were two issues:                   One, the

18   revenue rule, which is not relevant here.                   But the first

19   issue was whether or not the opportunity to collect

20   taxes which Canada lost, whether that was an injury to

21   property.     And there was a long discussion by this Court

22   equating the lost opportunity with embezzlement from the

23   Canadian treasury and pointing out in the definition of

24   Black's and the Webster's definition that property

25   includes not only that which you actually have, but that

 1   which you were denied the opportunity.

 2              In this particular case, the reason we don't

 3   have the taxes is because of the act of fraud as we

 4   allege of the defendant.         It's a little tough --

 5              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I'm sorry, because

 6   of -- because of what?

 7              MR. KOERNER:          The fraud of the defendant.

 8   It's a little hard to argue when you've created the

 9   situation so we can't collect that an inability to

10   collect then becomes no property.                 After Pasquantino

11   this Court decided the Anza case, which I'll discuss for

12   both issues.

13              JUSTICE BREYER:             Before you get to Anza,

14   this might be a good time to ask because I don't think

15   we focused on this in Pasquantino.                 But if in fact the

16   failure of a State to collect a tax is property, then

17   why isn't every corporation that files an income tax

18   return and makes two false statements automatically

19   liable for RICO?   I mean --

20              MR. KOERNER:          As long as they meet the

21   definition of --

22              JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, that would mean the

23   States have a new method, which I don't think they use,

24   a new method of collecting treble taxes from anyone who

25   makes two false statements or a false statement in two

 1   income tax returns, and it would seem to me that would

 2   have vast repercussions.          I mean, it might be very

 3   beneficial; the States are having a deficit crisis;

 4   but --

 5               MR. KOERNER:          If people --

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:             How, how -- why would it

 7   not be --

 8               MR. KOERNER:          Why would --

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:             But they left -- they don't

10   have the RICO predicate, not paying your State taxes.

11   But in effect you would read into the RICO

12   predicate protecting States.

13               MR. KOERNER:          This is precisely what

14   happened in Anza.

15               JUSTICE BREYER:             That may be, but nobody

16   focused on this issue.         So -- so that's what's bothering

17   me.   What is the -- what is the stopping place?

18               MR. KOERNER:          If you're --

19               JUSTICE BREYER:             Or is there one?          And if

20   there is none, how do we reconcile this view of --

21   they're suggesting a stopping place, Anza and

22   Pasquantino to the contrary.              Right.         But they're

23   suggesting a stopping place on a matter that hasn't come

24   up.

25               MR. KOERNER:          But they're suggesting --

 1              JUSTICE BREYER:            Or focused on.    It's come

 2   up but not focused on.

 3              MR. KOERNER:         But they're suggesting a

 4   stopping place which is inconsistent with the actual

 5   language of the RICO --

 6              JUSTICE BREYER:            So in your view

 7   California --

 8              MR. KOERNER:         Well, may I --

 9              JUSTICE BREYER:            -- which has a $10 billion

10   deficit, could go through, find every instance where a

11   corporation made two false statements in two tax

12   returns, one in each, and collect treble what they're

13   owed.

14              MR. KOERNER:         If there is a systematic

15   understatement under the statute, that's exactly --

16              JUSTICE BREYER:            It doesn't say systematic

17   understatement.

18              MR. KOERNER:         It says --

19              JUSTICE BREYER:            It says two --

20              MR. KOERNER:         Correct.

21              JUSTICE BREYER:            -- predicate acts.

22              MR. KOERNER:         And in these --

23              JUSTICE BREYER:            And the predicate acts are

24   a deliberate false statement.

25              MR. KOERNER:         And indeed that -- that is

 1   what Congress intended.        If you look --

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:            If they did, then why

 3   didn't they put in not paying your State tax returns as

 4   a predicate act?

 5               MR. KOERNER:         Well, in fact what they put in

 6   in 1978 was the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:            Oh, well, that cuts against

 8   you.

 9               MR. KOERNER:         No.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:            Because if they put in one,

11   your theory -- they don't even need, whether they need

12   that or not.   Your theory applies to every tax, every

13   tax.

14               MR. KOERNER:         Well, the reason they put it

15   in was to increase the criminal penalties as well as

16   recognize the civil penalties.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:            No, but go back to my

18   question.

19               MR. KOERNER:         The importation -- yes.

20               JUSTICE BREYER:            My question is, forget the

21   cigarette taxes.   If I accept your argument, am I then

22   saying that California, New York, and every other State

23   that's owed money by corporations in their taxes can go

24   through, look for two tax returns that have a false

25   statement in them that were mailed in, and thereby

 1   collect RICO damages?

 2                 MR. KOERNER:       Yes, that's correct.

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Well, that's a pretty

 4   far-reaching --

 5                 MR. KOERNER:       Well --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Do you know anybody, any

 7   court that has ever said that?

 8                 MR. KOERNER:       Well, the issue hasn't been

 9   raised.   But the -- but the -- RICO has been

10   consistently interpreted by this Court in an

11   expansionist mode, and despite that Congress has not

12   truncated it except in the one area of securities

13   violation and only because they found that there were

14   ample remedies in securities law, and because they

15   thought it was inappropriate to use exclusively mail and

16   wire fraud.

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Why would --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Why should that help?

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:          If Congress wanted that

20   result, why didn't they put in as a predicate act not

21   paying your income tax or not paying your State tax?

22                 MR. KOERNER:       Because they had a more

23   general definition, and they wanted the broadest

24   possible interpretation.         But the Cigarette Contraband

25   Trafficking Act was put into RICO as a predicate crime.

 1   The sole economic injury in that act is lost taxes to

 2   the State and the city.         It's the only economic injury.

 3   It's hard to say that Congress didn't contemplate this

 4   when, in addition to the general definition, they put

 5   this in.

 6                 In addition, the Jenkins Act was passed in

 7   1949 precisely for this problem, so it was on

 8   congressional minds.

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Yes, but Congress said --

10   we were just told by counsel for the Petitioner,

11   Congress said you can only -- only the Federal

12   prosecutor can sue for violations of Jenkins --

13                 MR. KOERNER:        Correct.

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- not New York City, not

15   New York State --

16                 MR. KOERNER:        Correct.

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- and it's a

18   misdemeanor.

19                 MR. KOERNER:        Correct.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And now you -- you are

21   saying the Jenkins Act gives you a basis to go after

22   what are basically aiders and abettors of use tax

23   violations?

24                 MR. KOERNER:        No.      What we're saying is the

25   Jenkins Act is some evidence of the state of mind of the


                                        32

 1   defendant when he commits this fraud.                   What we are

 2   saying is he is aware that he has an obligation to file

 3   reports with the State indicating both the identity of

 4   the seller and the identity of the purchaser.                   Our

 5   predicate act is not Jenkins.             Our predicate act is wire

 6   and mail fraud.    Even if Jenkins did not exist, we would

 7   still have a wire and mail fraud cause of action based

 8   on the representations of the seller, which is that all

 9   the sales are tax-free.

10                 What Jenkins does through the cooperation

11   agreement is it gives us the mechanism to collect these

12   taxes when they're complied with.                 If the defendant by

13   active intervention does not file and instead advertises

14   no sales tax required, he is preventing us from --

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But do you know -- do we

16   know that?    Do we know whether the Petitioner has in

17   fact filed the Jenkins Act report with New York State?

18                 MR. KOERNER:       No.      We have -- we have

19   alleged that he has not -- not filed one report with New

20   York State.    Indeed, he has actively represented in the

21   website that he has no obligation to file the report,

22   and that any information that he obtains from the

23   purchaser is confidential.

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:          All right.        So I think that

25   their response to the mail and fraud is, you're right,


                                       33

 1   it is all mail -- it is all mail fraud.                  All these tax

 2   violations, in fact every one, you mail in your tax

 3   return normally.

 4                 MR. KOERNER:        Correct.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So all of these would be

 6   mail fraud.    But mail fraud is not a treble damages

 7   statute.    And therefore the question is who will

 8   prosecute, State or Federal?              So normally it's State if

 9   it's a State tax.     But it's one thing to say Congress

10   didn't care about that and quite another thing to say

11   that Congress didn't care if the States were going to

12   use this in order to collect three times what the taxes

13   are owed.   And so they're looking for a way to cut off

14   this tax liability for ordinary, simpleminded tax --

15   failure to pay your State taxes.                 And that's why they've

16   hit on this idea of the antitrust.                  I don't know if

17   that's a satisfactory idea.             I don't see the solution.

18   I think I see the problem.

19                 MR. KOERNER:        But in the antitrust case in

20   the State of Hawaii, the reason there that the State was

21   not allowed to sue was not because of the injury.                     It

22   was not -- it was the directness of the injury.                  This

23   Court pointed out the fact that there was the

24   possibility of duplicative recoveries, and the State of

25   Hawaii was acting on behalf of the consumers.

 1                 Here, we have a direct injury.                  The city was

 2   the only one injured as a --

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               But it was injured

 4   by the consumer's failure -- it was injured by the

 5   consumer's failure to pay the taxes.                    That is an

 6   intervening cause.

 7                 MR. KOERNER:       Correct.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Now, why shouldn't

 9   that be the end of the causation chain?

10                 MR. KOERNER:       Because it's -- while the

11   consumer has failed, we are suing the seller because he

12   set up the ambiance, the environment for the consumer

13   not to pay.    It is his --

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               You're suing him for

15   setting up the ambiance?

16                 MR. KOERNER:       Yes.       He is the one who

17   created the fraud, by leading the consumer to believe

18   they didn't have an obligation to pay.                   We are suing

19   based on impedence with the opportunity to collect

20   taxes, where there are three parties to this

21   transaction --

22                 JUSTICE ALITO:         In order to -- in order

23   to -- to prevail on that theory, would you have to prove

24   that these -- these alleged misrepresentations in fact

25   caused people not to pay taxes?

 1                 MR. KOERNER:        Yes.

 2                 JUSTICE ALITO:          You would have -- you would

 3   have to prove that?

 4                 MR. KOERNER:        Yes, and that's something we

 5   could establish at trial, Your Honor.

 6                 JUSTICE ALITO:          And you think you could

 7   prove that?

 8                 MR. KOERNER:        Absolutely, because the

 9   response rate of individuals on their own when the

10   Jenkins report is not filed is extremely low.             Yet when

11   the Jenkins report is filed they do --

12                 JUSTICE ALITO:          What -- what percentage of

13   the -- of the residents of New York State or New York

14   City voluntarily pay a use tax on their income tax

15   returns for items that they purchase on the Internet?

16                 MR. KOERNER:        I don't know the answer to

17   that.   I know with respect to --

18                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Would you make a guess?

19                 MR. KOERNER:        Probably very low.     But in

20   this particular --

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           So how can you call it -- I

22   mean, part of the problem with calling it property is

23   there -- there is such a low chance of recovery of the

24   amount owed here.

25                 Even if the Jenkins Act filing had been

 1   made, you still have to -- have to assume that this --

 2   number one, you have to assume that the State would turn

 3   the list over to the city, which the State isn't

 4   required to do.

 5                MR. KOERNER:       But we do have a cooperation

 6   agreement.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Well, that may be, but the

 8   State isn't required to, and the State can terminate

 9   that agreement whenever it likes.

10                But, secondly, after you get the information

11   we have to assume that you're going to move against

12   these people.

13                MR. KOERNER:       If you look in footnote 8 of

14   our brief, we point out, even in this case, when we've

15   settled with parties and they've turned over the

16   information we have been able to recover significant

17   amounts of the taxes owed.

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Does it -- does it

19   affect your ambiance theory that the website has the

20   language that your friend told us is on it, that you

21   have to -- you know, this is -- viability varies from

22   State to State or whatever the exact language is?

23                MR. KOERNER:       No.      No.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               That still creates

25   the ambiance?

 1               MR. KOERNER:       When you look at the website

 2   and you have flashing lights that say "No taxes

 3   required," indeed we allege in the complaint that the

 4   entire business model is predicated on the fact that

 5   they don't have to pay State and city taxes.

 6               The wide difference allows for the profit

 7   for the seller and a savings for the buyer.             That is

 8   what we allege and, given the opportunity, we can prove

 9   that.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Yes.

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Could you satisfy Justice

12   Breyer's concern -- and maybe the answer is not -- by

13   saying that if there were a corporation that went around

14   to California taxpayers and said, we have a way to avoid

15   taxes, that then there would be a RICO violation, and

16   that would be closer to your case?

17               MR. KOERNER:       It would be -- it would be

18   easier to prove, but I can't dispute Justice Breyer's

19   fact pattern, that if you had an underpayment through a

20   fraudulent return that it may be a predicate for RICO,

21   and indeed --

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well -- well, you're

23   certainly consistent and persistent on that point.

24               MR. KOERNER:       Yes.       That would be a better

25   factor --

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But it -- it would seem to

 2   me -- it would seem to me that I gave you a way to

 3   differentiate this case.          And isn't that consistent with

 4   RICO because we have a very specific enterprise here?

 5               MR. KOERNER:          Well, I do want to reiterate

 6   the fact that, apart from the general language in this

 7   case, we do have this Contraband Cigarette Trafficking

 8   Act, which I alluded to earlier.                 That -- that Act

 9   precisely deals with the problem of underpayment of

10   taxes for cigarettes.        It was passed in 1978 and then

11   amended in 2006 to include localities.                   It has very

12   severe penalties under RICO criminally.                   It allows for

13   fines and forfeitures.         But more important, you can use

14   RICO civilly, and the only economic injury in that

15   entire legislation is the lost opportunity to collect

16   taxes.   So it's difficult to say that Congress was not

17   aware of this problem, aware of its potential scope.

18               And while I understand this Court's

19   frustration, it seems to me, as this Court has said in

20   many cases, including the last one, Boyle, it resides

21   with Congress to change it.             If they feel there is a

22   misuse of this legislation and suits are exploding out

23   of context in terms of what they contemplated, then they

24   should change it.

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, but the

 2   definition and giving scope and meaning to the concept

 3   of proximate cause is one that's in our bailiwick.

 4              MR. KOERNER:          It is, but if you look at --

 5   Chief Judge, if you look at how you've applied proximate

 6   cause in the past in Anza, in Holmes, what you said is

 7   that there are other factors that are not associated

 8   with the unlawful act, and therefore you didn't want

 9   courts or juries to have to parse -- parse out

10   legitimate business problems and illegitimate business

11   problems because they become too complex.

12              You don't have that here.                    Here, you have

13   direct injury to the city, and it's an easy calculation.

14              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Do we know -- you gave an

15   instance in your brief or two instances of successful

16   attempts to recoup from the taxpayer, that is the

17   cigarette buyer.   Did those come about because the city

18   received the Jenkins Act list from the State?                   How did

19   the city get --

20              MR. KOERNER:          In the particular cases that

21   we mentioned in footnote 8, they were parts of

22   settlements for the people who had, similar to this

23   particular defendant, had advertised as tax-free, and we

24   had settled with those people to get the reports, and

25   then, based on the reports, we were able to track them

 1   down.

 2              Where we get the Jenkins -- where people

 3   voluntarily disclose the Jenkins Act reports, we do

 4   follow up aggressively, but the --

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, you follow up by

 6   writing them a letter and what your footnote 8 says is,

 7   when you wrote them a letter, about half of them

 8   coughed -- coughed up the tax.

 9              MR. KOERNER:         Correct.

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:            They may have been the

11   foolish half.   Did --

12              (Laughter.)

13              MR. KOERNER:         No.

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Were the other -- were the

15   other half pursued by the city?

16              MR. KOERNER:         Not yet, no.

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Not yet.         I don't --

18              MR. KOERNER:         But that -- but --

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:            It can't be worth it.         It

20   can't possibly be worth it.

21              MR. KOERNER:         Here's what would be worth it:

22   If we can stop the fraudulent practices that these

23   sellers represent through the treble damages.                 The only

24   benefit that these Internet sellers have is the cost

25   saving as a consequence of the tax saving.

 1              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Why is what they're doing

 2   any different from what out-of-State mail order houses

 3   have done in -- they set -- they set up in States

 4   without a sales tax, they ship into a State that has a

 5   compensating use tax, that, apart from automobiles, I

 6   don't know is ever collected.

 7              MR. KOERNER:         Well, I would like to think

 8   that those out-of-State sales entities don't exist

 9   solely to try to deprive receiving States of tax.                    The

10   difference here is the entire business plan is based on

11   not paying tax.

12              Now, RICO has been in business since 1970.

13   Your decisions have expanded its use.                  As I indicated,

14   there has been no attempt to restrict it in any way,

15   and, indeed, despite --

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, but that's

17   because in every one of those cases, or at least in many

18   of them, we kind of wring our hands and say, well, we

19   don't have any choice, this is what Congress did, and

20   we're faithful to that intent.

21              But I guess, as I tried to point out

22   earlier, this is a different question.                 This is the

23   usual judicial application of concepts of proximate

24   cause, and I would have thought concern about how broad

25   RICO was written and how broadly it has been interpreted

 1   would cause us to look very carefully to the proximate

 2   cause question.

 3                 MR. KOERNER:        But in the proximate cause

 4   equation, as you yourself have defined it, meaning the

 5   Court, you've talked about unlawful issues and lawful

 6   issues.     And as I indicated, where there's a combination

 7   you don't want a Court to weigh what's lawful and

 8   unlawful.

 9                 But here our injury -- injury is solely the

10   result of an unlawful use.            There are no intervening

11   factors.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No -- I don't

13   understand that.    The injury is directly caused by the

14   consumers who don't pay the taxes.

15                 MR. KOERNER:        And I -- that's -- that's the

16   way you frame it, I understand, but it can be equally

17   framed by saying the injury is caused by the seller's

18   misrepresentation, which encourages the purchasers not

19   to pay taxes.

20                 And if you look at the websites, there is no

21   doubt about what this --

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So do you say then that

23   proximate cause is in part established because of the

24   specific intent?    Is that --

25                 MR. KOERNER:        No.      I'm saying --

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, I'm glad -- I'm glad

 2   you said that, because the Associated Contractors said

 3   specific intent is not --

 4               MR. KOERNER:        I know.          What I am saying is

 5   that, given the opportunity to prove this, we can show

 6   that the entire business model was intended never to

 7   have any taxes paid on these transactions.

 8               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But in -- in the world and

 9   in the lexicon of proximate cause, why is there

10   proximate cause because this was the business model?

11   How do I explain that in terms of proximate cause?

12   There's not specific intent.

13               MR. KOERNER:        There are no other intervening

14   causes between the fraud and the injury to the city.                  It

15   is -- we lost an opportunity.            Look --

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I know.        But there is no

17   other -- take a case which was put to you as the seller

18   who has many reasons for selling from out of State.

19   They have a good catalog business, it's a

20   well-established name, and so it's not just to avoid

21   taxes.   How is that different from what happened here?

22               MR. KOERNER:        Because in this case, they

23   don't have any other reason --

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Okay, and in terms of

25   proximate -- the universe of the law that we call


                                      44
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   proximate cause, how do you explain that?                   It's not

 2   specific intent.

 3               MR. KOERNER:         The law of proximate cause in

 4   the case you described, you would have to consider all

 5   of the issues, some related to the transaction that

 6   you're suing on, some not.           If the mail order catalog

 7   could show there were other reasons for their sales, not

 8   attributable to the unlawful RICO definition, then it's

 9   the type of injury you don't want to make an inquiry to.

10   But if you have --

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Reason on whose part?           Some

12   reason on whose part?       On the seller's part or on the

13   New York buyers' part?        They will be -- the New York

14   buyer is doing it because it's cheaper because he is not

15   going to pay taxes on it.          But it seems to me the seller

16   couldn't care less whether the buyer pays taxes on it or

17   not.   So long as he pays the money for the cigarettes,

18   the seller has gotten what the seller wanted.

19               MR. KOERNER:         Except that the buyer -- the

20   seller is advertising it as tax-free.                   He's not --

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So it's a mail order

22   house and they put a little line on it, says:                  By the

23   way, if you live out of State, no taxes, no sales taxes.

24   Then they're also subject to RICO prosecution?

25               MR. KOERNER:         As I said, it's a harder case

 1   because there may be other reasons why that mail order

 2   house is -- is successful, just like you said in Anza,

 3   just like you said in Holmes.              But in this case there's

 4   only -- it's the whole model.              There's only one reason

 5   why they're successful.

 6                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Well, maybe that isn't

 7   completely true.    Maybe it's a matter of convenience, at

 8   least theoretically.       You buy stuff over the Internet,

 9   you buy these advertised cigarettes, the price seems all

10   right, and you don't -- whether you pay the tax or not

11   is your decision.

12                MR. KOERNER:         Except that the seller --

13   that's not the facts in this case.                  The seller

14   affirmatively represented that there are no taxes.                    He

15   told the consumer, and then kept the consumer's identity

16   unknown --

17                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Well, we were --

18                MR. KOERNER:         -- by deliberately not filing

19   as required by Federal statute, and places us in a -- in

20   the position in the circle of having no knowledge of who

21   the buyer is, having affirmative misrepresentation, and

22   we are the only one in this transaction who are directly

23   injured.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 To whom was the

25   permanent misrepresentation made?

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Usually you're not liable

 3   for misrepresentation unless it causes -- it's relied

 4   on.   You really think that the -- that a large

 5   percentage of the people who were getting this stuff

 6   really, really were gulled into believing that New York

 7   State was somehow being done out of taxes?

 8                MR. KOERNER:         Yes, because of the

11                MR. KOERNER:         -- they would never contact

12   the State with any information concerning the

13   transaction.     That's exactly what they did.              Everybody

14   understands in the nature of these purchasing exactly

15   what it's about.

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:            No, I am sure the purchaser

17   knows:   I'm not going to pay taxes, even though I should

18   pay taxes.     But you're -- you're telling me that the

19   only reason the purchaser doesn't pay taxes is because

20   of this misrepresentation that you don't have to

21   purchase -- you don't have to pay taxes.                 I've known a

22   lot of New Yorkers, and not many of them are that

23   gullible.

24                MR. KOERNER:         What I'm telling you, that

25   it's probably easier to go to the corner store and

 1   obtain a package of cigarettes than order it over the

 2   Internet.   What I'm saying, you have to look at the

 3   context of the facts.        The facts were affirmative

 4   misstatements by the seller.

 5               JUSTICE STEVENS:              But what if the seller

 6   didn't make those misstatements but just says -- the

 7   whole operation is set up exactly as this one is, but

 8   they don't have that statement in there; they just say:

 9   Get advice from your lawyer about whether you need to

10   pay taxes or not.

11               And what if that was the -- that was exactly

12   the -- and then they all got the advice, and the lawyer

13   says:   They'll never catch you if you don't pay it.

14               MR. KOERNER:          I think it's a question of

15   proof, and if we're able to show that these individuals

16   thought it was tax-free, then we should be able to

17   pursue -- let me just say, forget the Jenkins Act.                        You

18   have the Cigarette Trafficking Act.                      That is within

19   RICO.   That sole economic injury is loss of revenue to

20   the State and the city.

21               So if we allege the Cigarette Trafficking

22   Act -- it was not applicable at the time of this case;

23   it was amended to apply to localities slightly after,

24   but if we predicated the case on that, would you still

25   say there's a proximate cause issue when you have

 1   Congress's express intent to allow that to be a

 2   predicate to the RICO count?

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               I don't want silence

 4   to be interpreted as acquiescence, but --

 5                 MR. KOERNER:       No, no, no.            It was

 6   rhetorical.    I wasn't --

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Yes.

 8                 MR. KOERNER:       I'm just trying to --

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Just to get back at

10   maybe the same point Justice Kennedy was raising, which

11   is you're focusing on -- you keep saying:                  The whole

12   purpose of this, look at their website.

13                 But the issue is proximate cause, and if

14   you've got to go through the individual consumer, it's

15   either proximate cause or not.              And if the -- if the

16   indirect nature of what they're doing because the direct

17   cause is the consumer's failure to pay, it doesn't seem

18   to me that their intent is pertinent.

19                 MR. KOERNER:       But we're seeking -- the

20   injury is the opportunity to collect, which we've been

21   denied, which is the Cigarette Traffic Act contemplates.

22   Indeed, if you look at the legislative history of that

23   Act, the sole purpose was to make it a very, very

24   serious felony, and with civil undertones, in order to

25   discourage the act as a disincentive, so that this

 1   trafficking, which is a major problem, started to be

 2   reduced.

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Well, I'm -- I'm not sure.

 4   Let's talk about the contraband cigarette trafficking.

 5   I'm not sure that these people would be in violation of

 6   it.   It makes it unlawful for any person knowingly to

 7   ship or transport, also receive, possess, sell,

 8   distribute, or purchase, cigarettes which bear no

 9   evidence of payment of applicable State or local

10   cigarette taxes.

11                 MR. KOERNER:       Yes.

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          But there is no applicable

13   State or local cigarette tax upon the shipment of these

14   cigarettes.

15                 MR. KOERNER:       But if the shipment is done

16   with the intent of avoiding taxes, which was

17   contemplated by this statute --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          That's not what it says.

19   It makes it unlawful to knowingly ship it when they bear

20   no evidence of payment of applicable taxes, and --

21                 MR. KOERNER:       That's correct.        There's a

22   question of proof.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          -- there is no applicable

24   taxes at the time that they ship it.

25                 MR. KOERNER:       But if you look at the

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:           Oh, I don't look at

 3   legislative history.

 4              (Laughter.)

 5              MR. KOERNER:        May I address the rest of you?

 6              JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, why is it that you

 7   haven't argued -- why haven't you --

 8              JUSTICE ALITO:          I don't see a difference --

 9   would appreciate if you would tell me the difference

10   between your argument as to this situation and the

11   typical Internet site where I think a lot of people buy

12   goods on the Internet, because they're convenient and

13   also because they know that they're not going to have to

14   pay State sales tax when they make those purchases.

15              MR. KOERNER:        In those cases, you have

16   established companies and you may have to look behind to

17   see what is the reason; why are they at -- I assume they

18   have other businesses that are legitimate.            This

19   particular enterprise has no legitimate aspect.

20              JUSTICE BREYER:           Why is that relevant as far

21   as cause is concerned?

22              JUSTICE ALITO:          You have a company that is

23   selling televisions, cameras, whatever over the Internet

24   and they -- you know, you put your -- you put in your

25   credit card information or whatever, and then it tells

 1   you, "sales tax due," and if they have no outlet in the

 2   State, it says "sales taxes due:                Zero."      What is the

 3   difference between that situation and this situation?

 4                 MR. KOERNER:       Well, first of all, in time,

 5   the Internet has raised many issues.                    It's unclear how

 6   Congress feels about this.           We have legitimate

 7   enterprise.

 8                 But cigarettes have been a particular focus,

 9   and I think, in effect, you cannot use the general

10   argument as to the Internet, when you have congressional

11   legislation which, one, under the Jenkins Act, was

12   specifically passed in 1949 because of transactions like

13   this, where States were -- were being deprived of the

14   revenues through the interstate shipments.

15                 And you have the traffic -- the Cigarette

16   Trafficking Act which is, again, an expression by

17   Congress that they want these individuals to be put out

18   of business.    That's exactly what RICO is about.

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Judge Winter in the

20   Second Circuit said the State appears uninterested in

21   enforcing the Jenkins Act and may not collate or

22   maintain accurate records of reports from out-of-State

23   vendors.   What -- what was the basis for his statement

24   that the State appears uninterested?

25                 MR. KOERNER:       The State has records, but

 2   political reasons.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, counsel.

 6         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RANDOLPH H. BARNHOUSE

 7                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 8                MR. BARNHOUSE:         Thank you, Mr. Chief

 9   Justice.

10                Justice Stevens, the city brought exactly

11   that case, where one of the 50 defendants here was a

12   defendant that didn't say sales are tax-free, and that

13   case was similarly dismissed by the district court, and

14   that dismissal was affirmed by the Second Circuit.

15                Justice Breyer, in Illinois v. Fawaz, the

16   States was going after $14,500 in back sales and

17   gasoline taxes.   After having prosecuted the individual,

18   they were seeking civil RICO damages, in that Seventh

19   Circuit case, when the Seventh Circuit became the first

20   circuit to say, we -- we hesitantly believe that the

21   case could go forward beyond a motion to dismiss.

22                JUSTICE BREYER:          On cause, why isn't it a

23   causal connection for them to say, look, your clients

24   don't tell them who's bought it.               They're supposed to,

25   but they don't.   And if we got the information, we go

 1   write a letter to the people, and half of them would

 2   pay.

 3                MR. BARNHOUSE:         That would be but for; But

 4   for your failure to give us the names --

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:          Yeah.

 6                MR. BARNHOUSE:         -- we would have collected.

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:          But why isn't that a direct

 8   applicant action, but for foreseeable?

 9                MR. BARNHOUSE:         This Court said, in Holmes,

10   that but for is insufficient.

11                JUSTICE BREYER:          Yeah.       I know, but there is

12   more here.   It is also foreseeable proximate cause.                 I

13   mean, it is absolutely foreseeable, not just but for.

14                MR. BARNHOUSE:         This was an Internet

15   website, Justice Breyer, that --

16                JUSTICE BREYER:          Forget the website.        What

17   if there had been no website?

18                MR. BARNHOUSE:         Was it foreseeable --

19                JUSTICE BREYER:          Is it foreseeable that,

20   when they don't know who owes the money, that the people

21   won't pay, but when they know who owes the money, they

22   can write them a letter, and half pay?

23                MR. BARNHOUSE:         And is it foreseeable that

24   no one will pay or that some will pay?                 Some will pay.

25                JUSTICE BREYER:          Some pay.        Some don't.

 1   They have the numbers there.              They get more than half.

 2                 MR. BARNHOUSE:          It's -- it's foreseeable

 3   that some won't pay.       That's foreseeable, but --

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           So you get half-treble

 5   damages.     What is that?      One-and-a-half damages.

 6                 MR. BARNHOUSE:          But, at that point, it

 7   becomes speculative, Justice Scalia, and it's -- it's

 8   foreseeable that some won't pay, but it's also

 9   foreseeable that some people won't pay --

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:           And, if you put people in

11   front of railroad trains and half survive, then it's

12   speculative?

13                 MR. BARNHOUSE:          I'm sorry?         I didn't --

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I mean, if you put somebody

15   in front of a railroad train and half survive because

16   they jumped, does that make it a speculative cause?

17                 MR. BARNHOUSE:          No, Your Honor, but, in that

18   instance, I would be the one pushing the person, and not

19   the one -- I would be the person, as in Pasquantino, who

20   did not --

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:           And you say it's

22   foreseeable that they won't get a lot of money.                   And

23   that's what they're arguing?

24                 MR. BARNHOUSE:          Yes.

 1   that?

 2                MR. BARNHOUSE:          That it's foreseeable that

 3   they won't get a lot of money?

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:           The reason is because of

 5   what your clients did, so it's but for and foreseeable.

 6                MR. BARNHOUSE:          It's but for, and it is

 7   foreseeable that some -- some taxpayers in New York will

 8   not pay.    Yes, Your Honor.

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:           End of case.          Now, we go to

10   the damage section.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:           But for -- no, no, your

12   response is, but for, plus foreseeable, is not a

13   definition of proximate cause.

14                MR. BARNHOUSE:          But it's not a definition of

15   proximate cause.

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:           You need more than that.

17                MR. BARNHOUSE:          That, itself is not --

18                JUSTICE BREYER:           I took torts a long time

19   ago.    I thought that was part of it.

20                MR. BARNHOUSE:          What -- what the Court said

21   in Associated General Contractors is, even if it's not

22   only foreseeable, but that's your intent, but that--

23                JUSTICE BREYER:           No, no.          There can be other

24   things that cut it off.        Proximate cause.              Foreseeable.

 1   like some odd fluke or something.

 2               MR. BARNHOUSE:         But --

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:          No policy reason or others

 4   for cutting the chain.      I mean, it's Torts 1 in 1962,

 5   okay?

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Isn't it -- well, I

 7   don't know, maybe it's more -- but isn't it a

 8   proposition that you don't rely on illegal conduct, that

 9   the -- the assumption of illegal conduct cuts the chain?

10               In other words, there's only proximate cause

11   if you assume people are going to not pay taxes that

12   they're due, contrary to law, and that that breaks the

13   proximate cause chain?

14               MR. BARNHOUSE:         It -- if we assume that --

15   that the assumption that they will pay their taxes

16   breaks the proximate cause?          I'm not -- I'm sorry --

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               No, that you have

18   to -- in order to maintain -- this is a helpful

19   question.

20               In order --

21               MR. BARNHOUSE:         Yes, sir.          That's why --

22   that's why I'm trying to understand.

23               (Laughter.)

 1   one of those links in the chain, that a party is going

 2   to commit illegal action.

 3              MR. BARNHOUSE:             Yes, Your Honor.

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, that's wrong.       I

 5   mean, at least for civil torts, you can -- there are a

 6   lot of cases where the landlord leaves out the bulb

 7   in the -- in the stairway and one of the residents gets

 8   mugged and he sues the landlord and wins, even though

 9   there is an intervening criminal act.

10              Now, maybe what you want to argue is that

11   that -- that has never been applied, to my knowledge, to

12   either criminal liability or -- or penal provisions, and

13   that maybe the -- an intervening criminal act does cut

14   off causality, for purposes of penal statute, such as --

15   such as RICO.     That would be a reasonable argument.

16              MR. BARNHOUSE:             That's a great argument,

17   Justice Scalia.

18              (Laughter.)

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   And a good place to

20   end.

21              Thank you, counsel.

22              The case is submitted.

23              (Whereupon, at 2:01 p.m., the case in the

24   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
