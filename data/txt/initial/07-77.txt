 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  We will hear

 4   argument next in Riley, Governor of Alabama, versus

 5   Kennedy.

 6               Mr. Newsom.

 7                ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN C. NEWSOM

 8                   ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

 9               MR. NEWSOM:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               This appeal presents two issues, both a

12   threshold jurisdictional question and a substantive

13   question concerning scope of section 5.                   We have

14   explained in some detail in our briefs why Governor

15   Riley's appeal in this case is timely and why this Court

16   has jurisdiction to resolve the merit.                   The Solicitor

17   General has agreed with us on the jurisdictional

18   question.

19               I certainly want to answer any questions

20   that the Court may have concerning the jurisdictional

21   issue, but with the Court's permission I would like to

22   proceed in my affirmative presentation directly to the

23   merits, and specifically the second of two independent

24   bases that we have urged for reversal here.                   Our

25   argument under this Court's decision in Young versus


                                         3

 1   Fordice is perhaps the simplest and most straightforward

 2   way to resolve this case.           In Young, this Court held

 3   that a state voter registration plan, despite its

 4   promulgation, preclearance and active implementation to

 5   register 4,000 voters, was nonetheless in force or

 6   effect within the meaning of section 5 and thus was not

 7   a valid section 5 baseline for purposes of measuring

 8   future changes, because the Court said it resulted only

 9   from a temporary misapplication of State law and it was

10   immediately corrected upon acknowledgment that it was

11   unlawful in fact.

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  It's pretty hard to

13   argue something wasn't in force and effect when they

14   have an election under it, isn't it?

15               MR. NEWSOM:         Your Honor, I don't think --

16   Your Honor is correct that the only possible distinction

17   between Young and this case is the holding of the 1987

18   election, but I don't think the election can make the

19   difference here, for this reason:                 It preceded solely by

20   virtue of the vagaries of the State litigation process.

21   The challenge preceded the election by two months.                 That

22   election was conducted under a cloud of litigation that

23   everyone certainly knew about and it went forward only

24   because, in the wake of Young, the trial court

25   temporarily misapplied State law.

 1               If a trial court had gotten State law right

 2   to begin with, Your Honor, and had enjoined the election

 3   as we now all know it should have, then there never

 4   would have been the election to point to as evidence

 5   that 85-237 ever went into force or effect.                  And it

 6   seems to me inconceivable, consistent with any

 7   meaningful notion of federalism, that section 5 can

 8   require a world in which a State trial court, as we say

 9   in the reply brief, which exists at the bottom of the

10   state judicial hierarchy, can by getting State law wrong

11   in the first place lock into State law as a section 5

12   baseline an unconstitutional statute.                   I don't anybody,

13   on this side of the podium anyway, to be denying that

14   85-237 was, is now and was at its inception,

15   unconstitutional and thereby strip the Alabama Supreme

16   Court of its sovereign prerogative to correct the errors

17   of lower courts.

18               JUSTICE STEVENS:            What if there had been no

19   challenge to that election, but two or three years later

20   somebody challenged the election and then the Supreme

21   Court said it was invalid.

22               MR. NEWSOM:        Well, Justice Stevens --

23               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Then there never would

24   have been a State statute.

25               MR. NEWSOM:        I'm sorry?

 1                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Then there never would

 2   have been a State statute, a valid State statute.

 3                MR. NEWSOM:       Right.        There are -- we have

 4   pitched two different arguments in this case, Your

 5   Honor.   And under the, I think it's fair, to say the

 6   broader of the two arguments, contained in Roman II of

 7   our brief, that, the later action, nonetheless would not

 8   be a change under section 5.            But under the argument

 9   that I was talking about specifically under Young versus

10   Fordice, I think it does make a difference that the

11   Alabama Supreme Court stepped in at the earliest

12   possible opportunity to invalidate this statute, again

13   as part of litigation that preceded the first and only

14   implementation, attempted implementation, of the

15   statute.

16                And I think the question at bottom here in

17   this case is whether section 5 provides State courts

18   with any breathing space whatsoever in which to conduct

19   this exercise of judicial review, and our submission is

20   that at the very least that it ought to extend so far as

21   to allow State courts to step in, as they did here, at

22   the earliest possible opportunity.

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           If the respondent prevails

24   in this case and you have a case similar to this one

25   that begins in the trial court, how do you think it


                                        6

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   would work, that the plaintiffs in the trial court

 2   action have to get preclearance either way?              They have

 3   to get preclearance in the event that they prevail?              And

 4   then the other side has to get preclearance in the event

 5   that it doesn't.   I mean, is that the way it would work

 6   in your view?

 7               MR. NEWSOM:        I'm not frankly --

 8               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            If I'm in State trial

 9   court, how can I make a ruling if -- assuming the

10   respondents win in this case, if I know there has to be

11   preclearance?

12               MR. NEWSOM:        Well, I think, Your Honor,

13   that's certainly part of the point that we've emphasized

14   here as one of the key federalism issues in this case,

15   is that this case really does in a very functional way

16   strip State courts of their jurisdiction to exercise

17   judicial review, whether at the trial court stage or at

18   the supreme court stage because on Appellee's theory

19   once the statute is precleared it is effectively locked

20   in place and that the trial court or the supreme court

21   needs permission from the Executive Branch in Washington

22   to exercise the authority to --

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I suppose States get --

24   State courts get preclearance all the time with district

25   changes, don't they?      Or how does it work?          They just


                                        7

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   hold the judgment in abeyance until there is

 2   preclearance, and couldn't -- and if so, couldn't do you

 3   that here?

 4                MR. NEWSOM:       Well, to be sure the Appellees

 5   are correct that it is the administration of the change

 6   itself that requires preclearance.                 So I don't want the

 7   Court to think that our position here is that courts are

 8   having to -- to render sort of provisional judgments

 9   that are then subject to preclearance in Washington.

10   The point is that, so I think in the redistricting

11   example, Your Honor, it would be the implementation of

12   the redistricting that would require preclearance.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Are there any other

14   district cases that require preclearance except those

15   that redistrict the, the State?

16                MR. NEWSOM:       No Your Honor, and the point is

17   that no one here denies, certainly the State does not

18   deny, that a State court order redistricting, redrawing

19   a map, in essence, and giving rise or exercising what is

20   functionally, as this Court has said, a legislative

21   power requires redistricting.             No one doubts that.       But

22   the question here is quite different:                   Whether if there

23   is a spectrum of State court decisions with

24   redistricting at one end, my case has to be at the other

25   end of the spectrum.

 1                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Are there district court --

 2   there must be -- district court cases in which the State

 3   trial court has invalidated on some State constitutional

 4   ground legislation redistricting that has been passed by

 5   the legislature?   When that happens, have those opinions

 6   been precleared?

 7                MR. NEWSOM:       Not to my knowledge, Your

 8   Honor.   And I will confess that I'm not aware of any

 9   right off the top of my mind that fit that paradigm.

10   But not to my knowledge.         The only --

11                JUSTICE SOUTER:            But isn't the reason that

12   there would be no reason to preclear them?              I mean, if

13   the State court invalidates legislative redistricting,

14   and does so before there has been a preclearance

15   request, in other words, if it gets into State court

16   right off the bat, then there's no State law

17   subsequently to ask the feds to preclear.

18                MR. NEWSOM:       That might be right, Justice

19   Souter, but I'm not sure that I understand the

20   implications for this case.             If you could --

21                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, I guess what I'm

22   saying is your "No" answer does not prove much.              In

23   other words, you're trying to make the case here that

24   there is something extremely unusual about this.              And I

25   thought your answer to Justice Scalia in effect was one


                                        9

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   reason that it's unusual is that we don't have any of

 2   these cases in, in which a State court has knocked out a

 3   State law that is then subject to some kind of

 4   preclearance review.        And my only point was, if I

 5   understand the situation, as long as the preclearance

 6   review had not preceded the State constitutionality

 7   judgment, following the State constitutionality judgment

 8   there would be no law to take to Washington, whether it

 9   be to -- to the Justice Department or to -- or to the

10   Court, and ask to have precleared.                   So the fact that

11   there are no such cases doesn't prove anything.

12               MR. NEWSOM:          Well, I think the point that I

13   was trying to make, Your Honor, is that this Court has

14   said in construing section 5 that it will not construe

15   it so as to exacerbate federalism costs.                   And one of the

16   reasons that the federalism costs are exacerbated here

17   is that this is -- this scenario is simply unlike any,

18   as we say in the brief, that this Court has --

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:               Well, that may be --

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:               But you said in answer to

21   Justice Souter that this is your case.                    There is no law

22   that's precleared.

23               MR. NEWSOM:          Well, it's certainly true, Your

24   Honor, that when a state Court, as any court --                   as this

25   Court made clear only last month in Danforth, when a


                                         10

 1   court exercises judicial review to invalidate a practice

 2   that's unconstitutional it is not changing or making new

 3   law as it goes along, but declaring what the law has

 4   always been.

 5                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            There is a law to be

 6   cleared if you -- if you assume that the existence of a

 7   law to be cleared occurs before that law has been tested

 8   in the courts.    In the hypothetical we've been

 9   discussing, just as in this case, there was a State law

10   and if you assume the State law is valid before it's

11   gone through the judicial clearance process, there is a

12   State law change when the clearance process results in

13   striking down the law.         I don't -- it seems to me that

14   the two situations are pretty parallel.

15                  MR. NEWSOM:       Well, with respect, Justice

16   Scalia, my case is the latter situation, where there was

17   technically a law in place.               85-257 to be sure was in

18   place.   Now, whether it was in force or effect within

19   the meaning of this Court's decision in Young is

20   different, but it was in place.

21                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And it was precleared at

22   what point?    The 1985 law was precleared before the

23   litigation?

24                  MR. NEWSOM:       Yes, Your Honor, it was

25   precleared virtually immediately, so let's say in '85.

 1   I don't remember the month specifically, but it was

 2   precleared in '85.

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And it was submitted by?

 4                 MR. NEWSOM:        Submitted by the State of

 5   Alabama.


 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Yes.          And then the


 7   litigation came.


 8                 MR. NEWSOM:        Right.        The litigation was


 9   commenced in April of 1987.


10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And so your point is that

11   if the circuit court -- there are only two levels of

12   court in this, the circuit court and the supreme court?

13                 MR. NEWSOM:        For purposes of this

14   litigation.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So if the circuit

16   court had gotten the State law right, then there never

17   would have been an election?

18                 MR. NEWSOM:        Well, that's right.

19                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             There never would have been

20   perhaps preclearance if it got it right soon enough.

21                 MR. NEWSOM:        Well, that's true, but of

22   course courts don't get to reach out and grab the

23   disputes and bring them into courts.

24                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, but if the -- if the

25   challenging parties go into court at the first

 1   opportunity and you don't have an election sort of

 2   coming up next week, I would suppose that in cases like

 3   that, the State would at least allow the State

 4   litigation to proceed to some level.                     And if in point of

 5   fact that State litigation resulted in a declaration


 6   that the new statute was unconstitutional in some


 7   fashion, one would not expect the State then to bull


 8   ahead and ask for preclearance, as opposed to trying


 9   either to appeal at the State level or to correct the


10   statute.

11                 MR. NEWSOM:       That's right, Your Honor, but

12   it -- but the challenge here would not have been ripe

13   until 1987.   There was no vacancy on the horizon.                   And

14   so the challenge here was brought at the earliest

15   conceivable opportunity when the vacancy became a

16   reality.

17                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            I will assume that.

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Even in the hypothetical

19   Justice Souter proposes, I don't know the rules in

20   Alabama, but I can see a Federal court saying:                    Well,

21   this is premature; it hasn't been precleared; why should

22   I pass on the validity of something that might not be

23   precleared?

24                 MR. NEWSOM:       Well, I think that's entirely

25   possible, Your Honor, and --

 1                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            On the other hand, I can

 2   also see the attorney general saying:                     Why should I

 3   preclear it?    It hasn't even been determined to be law

 4   in Alabama yet.

 5                  Does the Justice Department preclear stuff

 6   that is -- that is in the midst of litigation?

 7                  MR. NEWSOM:       The Justice Department's

 8   regulations at 51.22, Your Honor, say that they will not

 9   preclear things that are not final and that are subject,

10   it says, to revision by court -- by court judgment.                      But

11   that regulation is specific, the Federal Register

12   says --

13                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:            How does that apply to a

14   State statute which is fully enacted and then there's

15   going to be a challenge?

16                  MR. NEWSOM:       The truth is the regulations

17   don't speak specifically to that question, and the

18   reason is that the regulations are quite clear in the

19   Federal Register at 46 Federal Register 872 that they

20   don't deal with changes, so-called, brought about as a

21   result of court judgments.            The regulation that I was

22   referring to, 51.22, refers specifically to State courts

23   having an administrative role to play in --

25   districting or --

 1                  MR. NEWSOM:       That's right, redistricting,

 2   reannexation.

 3                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Do you know of any cases

 4   where -- where a piece of State legislation has been in

 5   the middle of litigation where the Justice Department

 6   has precleared it?

 7                  MR. NEWSOM:       No, Your Honor, not right off

 8   -- not as I'm standing here, I don't.

 9                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            It seems like an exercise

10   in futility.

11                  MR. NEWSOM:       But the point -- Justice

12   Ginsburg, getting back to your point so you'll

13   appreciate the timeline, in April of 1987 the challenge

14   is brought.    In June of 1987 the election goes forward.

15   So the challenge here preceded the election by two

16   months.   And the point that I've been trying to make is

17   that the -- had the trial court gotten State law right

18   to begin with and enjoined the election, as we now know

19   it should have, there never would have been an election

20   to point to, to show within the meaning of Young that

21   the -- that the statute was ever put into force and

22   effect.

23                  JUSTICE BREYER:            What happened -- I have a

24   factual question.     In around July, Mr. Sam Jones is

25   sworn in and now he is in office until sometime after, I

 1   guess, September 1988, a little over a year, and then

 2   the Governor appointed him.             Well, he must have gotten

 3   paid during that year.

 4                MR. NEWSOM:       Yes.

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:            And then when the Governor

 6   appointed him, what does the appointment look like?

 7   Does it say it's retroactive?             No.      I would be

 8   surprised.   I mean, you're not going to tell me it is.

 9   So my guess is he's appointed as of -- let's say he's

10   appointed by the Governor.          It must have said as of

11   when, and it probably said as of September '88.

12                MR. NEWSOM:       The truth is, Your Honor, I do

13   not know what --

14                JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, I think it's

15   important to me because, for this reason:                 I would guess

16   they don't make it retroactive or you'd know it, and

17   therefore we -- we have more.             We have the facts, the

18   following facts, as to whether -- and this is what

19   Fordice says; it says this is a practical question.

20   It's not some theory about whether it's unconstitutional

21   or not unconstitutional.         The question is as practical

22   matter was it in force and effect?                 And, as a practical

23   matter, one, there was an election under it; two,

24   somebody was elected; three, he took office; four, he

25   held that office for a year and was paid for it.                All

 1   right?   Why, as a practical fact, as a practical matter,

 2   we do not say that special election law was in force and

 3   effect for about a year and two months?

 4                 MR. NEWSOM:       Your Honor, the difference, or

 5   what makes this case just like Young versus Fordice, is

 6   that the relevant -- the relevant implementation in

 7   Young was not election.         The relevant implementation in

 8   Young was registration.         And this Court's opinion makes

 9   clear that 4,000 real, live flesh-and-blood voters were

10   registered.

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes, their registering is a

12   precondition of voting.         Not one person had ever voted.

13   Moreover, they all had to register again.                  So the net

14   practical effect of the election, of plan two in Young

15   v. Fordice, was null, zero, zilch.                  And the practical

16   effect here is that somebody is elected under the law,

17   holds office for a year and two months, and is paid.                    It

18   seems to me quite a big difference.

19                 MR. NEWSOM:       With respect, Your Honor --

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.      I mean, that's

21   what I wanted to know.        I mean, maybe it's different if

22   this was a retroactive something or other, but I --

23   you're not aware of that.

24                 MR. NEWSOM:       No, I can't --

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:            So I assume it wasn't.

 1                MR. NEWSOM:        -- tell you as I'm standing


 2   here that the --

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:             Yes.


 4                MR. NEWSOM:        -- that the appointment was


 5   retroactive, but I do think that, given the nature of

 6   the implementation, the relevant implementation in Young

 7   being registration, the fact that 4,000 people were

 8   registered does bring this case pretty close to Young.

 9   And the fact that --

10                JUSTICE BREYER:             All right.         Suppose I

11   reject that on the ground of what I said.                     I'm not

12   saying I would, but suppose I did.                  Isn't that the end

13   of this case?    Because then, if I reject that, there is

14   a plan.   The plan is called "the special election plan."

15   It is in effect for a year and two months.                     People hold

16   office in election and they're paid.                     And then a new

17   plan comes along, the governor's plan.                     Now that seems

18   to me a change, and the statute says that if you have a

19   change, which this would be, you've got to preclear it.

20   End of matter.

21                Now, what's your argument about that?

22                MR. NEWSOM:        With respect to that, Your

23   Honor, it's that I don't think it is accurate to say

24   that this was the governor's plan.                  The Governor was not

25   --

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:            No, I'm just using that as

 2   shorthand, the shorthand for a system under which the

 3   officeholder is appointed by the government -- by the

 4   governor.

 5               MR. NEWSOM:       Right.        And --

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:            And I'm saying if we start

 7   from the base that the plan is special election which

 8   was in force and effect for a year and two months, then

 9   for whatever set of reasons there is a change, and the

10   State has to preclear the change.               Now, what's the

11   answer to that?

12               MR. NEWSOM:       The answer to that, Your Honor,

13   is that the shorthand misses the fact here that what

14   we're talking about is that the change results here from

15   a State court exercising judicial review.               And this is

16   -- that is different in kind from any sort of decision

17   that this Court has ever rendered about --

18               JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.      So you're

19   saying that if the cause of a change is a court

20   decision, then you do not have to preclear.               So that if

21   in Mississippi in 1975, there had been a ruling of a

22   court which said segregationist plan number one here is

23   no good, so we're going to go back to the even worse

24   plan that was before, that that wouldn't have had to

25   have been precleared?

 1                  MR. NEWSOM:       The point, Your Honor, is that

 2   that --

 3                  JUSTICE BREYER:            You see where I'm going,

 4   and I'm not phrasing it correctly, but you can answer it

 5   anyway.

 6                  MR. NEWSOM:       So the point, Your Honor, is

 7   that the result of that court decision would have been

 8   immediately enjoined under the Fourteenth Amendment, the

 9   Fifteenth Amendment, or section 2.                   The point about

10   section 5 --

11                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            It would have been able to

12   be brought up here if it was based on a discriminatory

13   intent, certainly.

14                  MR. NEWSOM:       Absolutely.              This Court would

15   have cert jurisdiction if there were -- if you have the

16   --

17                  JUSTICE BREYER:            But what my question is, is

18   there any authority for the proposition that between

19   1964 and today, it mattered whether the cause of a

20   change in a State plan was a decision of let's say five

21   members of a court -- of a State court -- or whether it

22   was a legislative decision.               Because that's what I think

23   you're arguing, and is there any authority that supports

24   you on that?

25                  MR. NEWSOM:       If I -- if I may, Justice

 1   Breyer, as a preface it's important that I emphasize

 2   simply as sort of a superstructure point here that as --

 3   not only as the plaintiff in this case, but as the party

 4   asking the Court to exacerbate federalism costs, within

 5   the meaning of Bossier Parish, over what they have been

 6   to this point, I think it's my opponents' burden to show

 7   you that Congress clearly intended to include these

 8   provisions, as opposed to my burden to show you that

 9   Congress intended to exclude them.                 That's essentially

10   what this Court said in Gregory versus Ashcroft.

11               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, they argue in their

12   brief that there were instances in which State supreme

13   courts participated prior to the enactment of the Voting

14   Rights Act in changes in election requirements for the

15   purposes of disenfranchising African-Americans.                 Are

16   they wrong on that?     And if they're right on that, what

17   reason is there to think that, without any text in

18   section 5 to making an exception for changes that are

19   made by State courts, what would be the reason for

20   reading that in?

21               MR. NEWSOM:        Well, I think there are -- if I

22   can answer in two parts.         First with respect to the

23   legislative history, to be sure the Appellees and their

24   amici have brought forward a number of examples of State

25   court judges, principally southern State court judges,


                                       21

 1   doing some pretty despicable stuff, and I'm not here to

 2   defend that.    But with respect to the specific question

 3   at issue here, whether Congress was in enacting section

 4   5, was clued into this question and it had reason to

 5   think that State Court exercises of judicial review

 6   would give rise to the sorts of problems that section 5

 7   was designed to inhibit, there simply is nothing to

 8   support that suggestion.

 9                  Section 5, of course, was intended to do

10   something very specific.           It was designed to prevent or

11   to catch government conduct that the more traditional

12   remedies in place at the time under the '57, '60 and '64

13   Civil Rights Acts, what we would today I think call a

14   section 2 suit, couldn't get.               And the point here, in

15   addition to the Danforth that at some deep

16   jurisprudential level courts don't change law, the more

17   important practical point is that courts exercising

18   judicial review are institutionally incapable of

19   changing the law specifically in the way that Congress

20   was concerned about when it enacted Section 5.

21   Congress --

22                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Now, counsel, since

23   you mentioned section 5, perhaps you ought to look at

24   it.   It says that you have to preclear standards,

25   practices, whatever, different from that in force or


                                         22

 1   effect on November 1st, 1964.

 2               Now, the Respondents in their brief accused

 3   you of making the argument that since this isn't

 4   different from what was in effect in 1964 you don't have

 5   to preclear it.   And you said, no, that's not what we're

 6   saying; we take no position on that.

 7               Why in the world did you say that?                It says

 8   quite clearly the standard has to be different from that

 9   in force or effect on November 1st, '64.                At that point

10   these people were appointed.

11               MR. NEWSOM:        That's right, Your Honor.

12   There are two sort of different things going on here.

13   One, as a matter again of the Appellees' burden to show

14   you that these decisions are clearly included within the

15   text, quite clearly they are not, because November 1,

16   1964, as Your Honor quite correctly points out --

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, in your reply

18   brief on page 8 you say you take no position on that

19   question.

20               MR. NEWSOM:        With respect, what I say at

21   page 8 of the reply is that there is no need for this

22   Court to determine specifically how the November 1,

23   1964, language ought to operate in the legislative and

24   administrative change scenario.              This Court in Presley

25   and again in Young versus Fordice has suggested in dicta

 1   that perhaps the baseline might float, notwithstanding

 2   the November 1, 1964 --

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, there wouldn't

 4   be a different baseline for judicial changes than there

 5   would be for legislative or executive changes, would

 6   there?

 7               MR. NEWSOM:       No.      You're -- I think you're

 8   right, Your Honor, perhaps not.             And this again goes to

 9   the burden point that I was trying to make earlier.               My

10   -- the sole purpose in citing the November 1, 1964,

11   language is to show that at the very least, to the

12   extent you're looking for some clear indication that

13   Congress intended to get these decisions, the text

14   cannot provide that clear indication.

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, I take it it's your

16   position -- and I noticed this in the question put to

17   you by Justice Breyer -- tell me if this is wrong, but

18   that it's not just the fact that the court makes a

19   decision, because the court may have discretion to

20   choose plan one, plan two, plan three, but it is if the

21   court makes a decision to show that the prior practice

22   was invalid, was void under State law.

23               MR. NEWSOM:       That's right, Your Honor.

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           That's the distinction, I

25   take it.

 1               MR. NEWSOM:       That's right, Your Honor.


 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Not the fact that it's


 3   just the court, but the kind of decision the court


 4   makes.


 5               MR. NEWSOM:       That's right.            There are

 6   different lines the court might choose to draw.                This

 7   case at most presents a question where a court is

 8   exercising the power of judicial review to invalidate a

 9   previously precleared statute.             It might decide the case

10   more narrowly, as I said, under Young versus Fordice, on

11   a more fact-specific basis.            But at the very most, the

12   Court would need to decide in this case is that the

13   State court exercises a judicial review to invalidate

14   previously precleared practices as compliant with

15   section 5 do not give rise to section 5 changes.

16               And, Chief Justice Roberts, just to get back

17   to the textual piece of this, we have, pointed, in

18   addition to the "in force or effect" language, which we

19   think -- which we think requires judgment for the

20   Governor on Young versus Fordice grounds and the

21   November 1, 1964, language, we have also pointed to the

22   provision in section 5 that we have referred to as the

23   savings clause, which I think provides good reason at

24   the very least to think that Congress was thinking about

25   court decisions enjoining existing baselines differently


                                      25

 1   from the way it was thinking about the typical


 2   legislative and administrative changes that have been


 3   the grist of this Court's section 5 jurisprudence.


 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Newsom, before you


 5   finish I would like to ask you a question about what

 6   action Governor Riley would take if you're right on the

 7   law?   That is, a mistake by the Alabama Circuit Court

 8   can't invalidate a law that the Supreme Court says on

 9   judicial review of -- on review of the circuit court,

10   that the circuit court got it wrong.

11                The first time around, when Jones was

12   elected and then the Governor mooted any controversy by

13   just appointing him.      Now we have a similar situation.

14   We have somebody who has won an election overwhelmingly

15   against the person that the Governor appointed.                There

16   are, what, five months left in the term?                If your

17   position on the law is correct, would the Governor in

18   fact oust the person who was a four-to-one 1 winner in a

19   popular election and install the person who was a loser

20   in -- would that happen?         Could we project based on what

21   happened the first time around that the Governor would

22   not so thwart the will of the people?

23                MR. NEWSOM:       It would be the Governor's

24   option, Your Honor, whether to -- to do what was done in

25   1987 or '8, I suppose, and to install the winner of the


                                       26

 1   election or to reinstate Juan Chastang to his position.

 2   I have not discussed with the Governor what his specific

 3   intentions would be with respect to that.                 But it would

 4   be his option to take one of those two courses under the

 5   law.

 6                 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

 8   Mr. Newsom.

 9                 Ms. Karlan.

10                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN

11                    ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

12                 MS. KARLAN:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

13   and may it please the Court:

14                 I want to turn initially to two cases that

15   weren't mentioned yet by the Court that I think dispose

16   of the question of whether the law was in force or

17   effect.   And I would like to direct the Court's

18   attention to page 101 of the joint appendix, because the

19   language I'm going to be talking about appears there in

20   the course of the Governor's request for reconsideration

21   of DOJ's objection.      This is the language from this

22   Court's opinion in Young against Fordice.                 And it starts

23   midway down the page, where the Court says that:                 "The

24   simple fact that a voting practice is unlawful under

25   State law does not show entirely by itself that the


                                        27

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   practice was never in force or effect."                We agree.


 2               And then the Court goes on to say:                "A


 3   State, after all, might maintain in effect for many


 4   years a plan that technically or in one respect or


 5   another violated some provision of State law," citing

 6   Perkins against Matthews and City of Lockhart against

 7   United States.

 8               All that Young against Fordice does is

 9   explain that that case is a sport that deviates from the

10   general rule that this Court has had that when a law is

11   in force or effect its constitutionality under State law

12   doesn't matter.

13               I'd also like to direct the Court's

14   attention to page 114 of the joint appendix, where Act

15   85-237's text appears, and direct you to the bottom of

16   the page in section 4, which says:                "This Act shall

17   become effective immediately upon its passage and

18   approval by the Governor upon its otherwise becoming a

19   law," which it did in June of '85 when the State

20   obtained preclearance.

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Do you agree that the

22   lawsuit to invalidate it was filed as soon as was

23   feasible?

24               MS. KARLAN:       I don't honestly know the

25   answer to that question, Justice Scalia, because Alabama


                                      28

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   law has different views, for example, on ripeness and

 2   the like than Article III does.               And this also goes to

 3   the question that Justice Ginsburg asked at the very end

 4   of the argument about the remedy in this case, because

 5   Alabama law here is quite peculiar.                      And since we filed

 6   our brief there have been two opinions by the Alabama

 7   Supreme Court, in a case called Roper against Rhodes and

 8   a case called Wood against Booth, that reiterated under

 9   Alabama law once an election has been held, if no

10   contest litigation was timely brought, the fact that the

11   person is unentitled to remain in office does not allow

12   contest after the fact.

13                 So we have a peculiar problem in this case,

14   which is, even if this Court were to reverse, there was

15   an election held here pursuant to Alabama Act 2006-342

16   that was conceivably valid under Alabama law.                     And the

17   question whether to replace Merceria Ludgood who won

18   that election, as you noted, by a four-to-one margin,

19   with either Juan Chastang or somebody else is quite up

20   in the air.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why didn't the Alabama

22   Supreme Court say that in this very case?

23                 MS. KARLAN:       Well, in this case, the

24   election hadn't been held yet, Justice Scalia.                     That is,

25   the Alabama Supreme Court in the Riley decision here


                                        29

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   ruled in the Governor's favor before we brought our

 2   preclearance action, so there was no election on the

 3   table.

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Then it was the district

 5   judge that made Alabama go to the preclearance after the

 6   second --

 7               MS. KARLAN:        Yes, that's correct.

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But still, if you take

 9   this case at its essence, a circuit court got Alabama

10   law wrong and that's what you say counts as to make the

11   law operative.

12               The law becomes operative because an Alabama

13   intermediate court or trial court made a wrong decision

14   about Alabama law; and then when the supreme court

15   corrects it, that doesn't count.               That's essentially

16   your position, that they're locked, Alabama is locked

17   into a mistake that was made about Alabama law by that

18   circuit court.

19               MS. KARLAN:        No, Your Honor.              We're not

20   saying that Alabama is locked in by the mistake of the

21   circuit court.   What we're claiming here is that in

22   April of 1985, Alabama passed Act 85- 237.                    As a matter

23   of Alabama law, it went into effect.                    In 1985, Alabama

24   received preclearance.       That law was on the books; an

25   election was held; a man served for three years.                    But


                                       30

 1   it's not just that, Justice Ginsburg.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Excuse me.       I don't think

 3   -- I don't think I follow you that, as a matter of

 4   Alabama law, it went into effect.                 Just because the

 5   statute said it went into effect does not prove that it

 6   went into effect.    I think the Alabama --

 7                MS. KARLAN:        Your Honor --

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:             -- the Alabama Supreme

 9   Court would say it never went into effect because it was

10   unconstitutional.

11                MS. KARLAN:        No.       No, Your Honor.       If you

12   look at page 5 of the defendant's trial brief, which is

13   -- I think it's Docket No. 16 -- you'll see that there

14   in footnote 5 the State says:              We asked for the Alabama

15   Supreme Court to hold Act 85-237 void ab initio.                   They

16   did not do that, but we think they ought to have.

17                And so even as a matter of Alabama law, I

18   don't think this is 100 percent clear.                   But if I can

19   turn to the 2004 Act, because we think --

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But suppose they didn't

21   have that footnote.      Suppose they said:               We hold it void

22   ab initio.   Then, what's your answer to Justice Scalia's

23   question?

24                MS. KARLAN:        My answer to his question is

25   Perkins against Matthews and City of Lockhart against


                                        31

 1   United States still compel the result of finding that

 2   this law went into effect as a matter of Federal law,

 3   because the question of whether a law is in force or

 4   effect is a question of construing section 5 of the

 5   Voting Rights Act, which is Federal law.

 6                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, you're saying that if

 7   a State passes a statute -- a State legislature passes a

 8   statute that's flagrantly in violation of the State

 9   constitution, it immediately is precleared, it's locked

10   into place?

11                 MS. KARLAN:       Yes, I am.

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That rule of law renders

13   constitutional under State law an act that would

14   otherwise not be constitutional.

15                 MS. KARLAN:       No, it does not render it

16   constitutional.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, that's what you're

18   saying.

19                 MS. KARLAN:       No.

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            You're saying that's the

21   effect:   It locks it in.

22                 MS. KARLAN:       It locks it in until the State

23   comes up with a constitutional cure, in the same way --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Oh, but it can't go back.

25                 MS. KARLAN:       No, it cannot go back.

 1               JUSTICE SCOUTER:            It locks it in.

 2               MS. KARLAN:       Well, it doesn't -- it doesn't

 3   require that they stay with that law.                  It simply says

 4   they cannot make a change without obtaining

 5   preclearance, because that's what section 5 does.                  It's

 6   a clear, bright-line rule.

 7               JUSTICE SOUTER:            May I ask:        You're not --

 8   correct me if I'm wrong.        I didn't think you were

 9   arguing that because of the preclearance followed by the

10   State determination of unconstitutionality, that the

11   State was required to follow that unconstitution law.

12               I thought your argument simply was that, in

13   effect, there was a stalemate at that point, and the

14   State was going to have to come up with some new law

15   that would be precleared.         Am I correct?

16               MS. KARLAN:       It's a little trickier than

17   that, Justice Souter, for the following reason.                  Let me

18   give you a hypothetical that will --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:            For the reason that, absent

20   their coming up with a new law, what law would be in

21   effect?

22               MS. KARLAN:       That's what I was about to

23   explain.

24               JUSTICE SOUTER:            And isn't the answer that

25   no law would be in effect?         I mean, you're in the same


                                      33

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   situation then that you would be in if there had been no

 2   judicial litigation going on, the law had been brought

 3   to the Justice Department or the D.C. court, had --

 4   preclearance had been refused.              The State at that point

 5   didn't have the old law because it had been repealed.

 6   It couldn't apply the new law because it wasn't

 7   precleared, and somebody in Alabama would have to do

 8   something.

 9                Aren't we in essentially the same position

10   here?

11                MS. KARLAN:       Well, we are, but as I

12   suggested, it's a little trickier than that.             Because,

13   of course, the existing practice is for purposes of

14   section 5 the law that's in force or effect.             So, for

15   example, suppose you had a State that --

16                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, it was in force and

17   effect.

18                MS. KARLAN:       Excuse me?

19                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Does the theory require

20   that we assume it remains in force and effect by virtue

21   of the preclearance even when there is a subsequent

22   determination of unconstitutionality?

23                MS. KARLAN:       I think the answer to that

24   question, candidly, is yes, and the State can cure that

25   quite quickly.   But let me explain it with a


                                       34

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   hypothetical that might make this clearer, which is:

 2   Suppose you had a State in which people were voting in

 3   an election, and then the State supreme court held that

 4   that part of the county had never been properly annexed.

 5   The State would be required to continue letting those

 6   people vote in the election unless and until it received

 7   preclearance from the Department of Justice.                 That's

 8   what Perkins against Matthews and City of Lockhart

 9   require.

10                So the State has to, once it adopts a

11   practice, continue using that practice unless and until

12   it receives preclearance for a new practice or -- and

13   this is somewhat --

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I'm not sure that in those

15   cases you had what you had here, which was a

16   declaration, let's assume, of invalidity ab initio.

17                Let me give you this hypothetical.                 A county

18   council goes to the board of commissioners or the board

19   of supervisors of the local county or legislative branch

20   and says:   The legislature has just adjourned; it passed

21   a lot of laws, and one of the laws it passed is that

22   that you now have to set the qualifications locally for

23   certain officials, so we have to act on this right away.

24                They pass the legislation.                 Three weeks go

25   by.   The county council says:            You know, I made a

 1   mistake; that law was never passed; it was never signed

 2   by the governor.    What rule?           What result?

 3                 MS. KARLAN:       Well, in your hypothetical

 4   there would be no problem at all, and this goes back to

 5   Justice Souter's hypothetical that he asked Mr. Newsom,

 6   which is:    That law hasn't been precleared.               Therefore,

 7   it's never in force or effect as a baseline.

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, suppose it had been

 9   precleared?

10                 MS. KARLAN:       Then it would be Perkins

11   against Matthews.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, is it?      Because -- I

13   mean, what they're saying is let's use a little common

14   sense here.    And you look at Fordice and there it was an

15   instance where it just didn't take effect at all as a

16   practical matter.

17                 And then we cited those two cases you're

18   talking about, but I can't tell from the Fordice opinion

19   -- there was a ward system that was in fact in force or

20   effect.   But I don't know how long that ward system was

21   in effect.    It might have been for a long time, and

22   people might have taken action under it.

23                 And the same thing is true in City of

24   Lockhart.    I can't tell.        You may know.          But my point is

25   they are saying:    Here we have a middle case, and what


                                        36

 1   we want is to use enough sense to say, look, it wasn't

 2   really in effect.    People challenged it the minute they

 3   could.   They -- everybody knew it was unconstitutional,

 4   or a lot of people believed it.               And the Governor then

 5   did something to make up for it.

 6                If you're going to say that that little bit

 7   counts as putting it in force and effect, you know what

 8   we're going to have?       We're going to have every

 9   municipality all over the country that doesn't always

10   know what the rules are, and they pass something, and

11   people challenge it immediately, it's obviously wrong,

12   and they're stuck with it as a matter of Federal law.

13   That's going to be a mess.

14                They're saying something like that, so I'd

15   like to hear your response.

16                MS. KARLAN:        Well, there are two factual

17   points in response to your question, Justice Breyer.

18   The first is, with respect to Perkins against Matthews,

19   the Mississippi statute that required the use of

20   at-large rather than district elections was passed in

21   1962 and used precisely once before the preclearance, so

22   it was on all fours with this case.                      It was a three-year

23   lag between the unconstitutionality of the City of

24   Canton's practice and the preclearance.                     So if we were

25   to ask what does our case look most like that this Court


                                        37

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   has already decided, it would be Perkins.

 2                 The second point which I want to direct the

 3   Court to is we are not actually talking in this case --

 4   and this goes as well to the Court's judicial function

 5   -- about just Act 85-237.            We are also talking in this

 6   case about Act 2004-215, which was the attempt by the

 7   Alabama Legislature to revise the constitutionality of

 8   Act 85-237.   Because the central problem in this case

 9   was a provision of the Alabama Constitution, Section

10   105, that said you couldn't pass local legislation

11   unless the act -- unless the general act made that very

12   clear.

13                 So in 2004 the Alabama legislature thought

14   it had solved the entire problem here by amending the

15   section of chapter 11 of the Alabama election law to say

16   unless a local law provides otherwise you can use

17   gubernatorial appointment.            That law was intended to

18   revive Act 85-237.      We know this because, among other

19   things, our clients were the sponsors of the act, among

20   the sponsors of the act.

21                 Now, the Alabama legislature --

22                 JUSTICE ALITO:          If I could just ask you, in

23   making that argument, aren't you asking us to say that

24   the purpose of this act -- that the intent of the

25   Alabama legislature in passing that act is different


                                         38

 1   from the intent as determined by the Alabama Supreme

 2   Court?

 3               MS. KARLAN:        Yes, but if I can explain why I

 4   think this is important in a sense.                     It's because the

 5   claim of the State is that this is a case about

 6   fundamental constitutional provisions of Alabama law,

 7   but in fact in its current guise, which is whether the

 8   2004 Act revived the 1985 Act, this is purely a matter

 9   of statutory construction and what the Alabama Supreme

10   Court said is:   We don't think the legislature meant to

11   make this law retroactive; we think they meant to make

12   it only prospective.      But that's not the same thing as

13   talking about fundamental Marbury against Madison

14   judicial review of the kind that the --

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             It's a review of a lower

16   court by a higher court.         That's what higher courts do.

17   They review for correctness, and the Alabama Supreme

18   Court said the circuit court got it wrong.                     It

19   misconstrued the law, and we are correcting that.                     And

20   that's -- that's correct.

21               MS. KARLAN:        That is correct, Justice

22   Ginsburg, which leads to the second pair of cases that

23   we think this Court has already decided that provide you

24   absolutely clear guidance as to why preclearance was

25   required here.   And that's this Court's decision in


                                       39

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Hathorn against Lovorn and this Court's decision in

 2   Branch against Smith.

 3                In both of those cases as well, you had the

 4   question, quite acutely in Hathorn against Lovorn, of

 5   whether or not the chancery court in Mississippi, which

 6   is a trial-level court, got the law right or wrong on

 7   whether elections should be conducted in a particular

 8   way in Warren County.        The Mississippi Supreme Court

 9   said they got it wrong.

10                But this Court said that decision and the

11   implementation require preclearance because the presence

12   of a court decree doesn't exempt a contested change from

13   section 5.

14                So in this case, had Governor Riley decided

15   completely by himself that he, having taken an oath to

16   support the Alabama constitution, could not in good

17   conscience let a special election go forward here, it

18   would be no different from having the Alabama Supreme

19   Court decide that.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:              What does the Alabama

21   Supreme Court preclear?          Where it was redistricting and

22   it had a redistricting plan, I can see it would send

23   over to the attorney general the new redistricting plan.

24   What -- what do the justices of the Alabama Supreme

25   Court have to come before the attorney general to get

 1   his benediction upon?

 2               MS. KARLAN:          They have to --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Do they submit their

 4   opinion and say, "Mr. Attorney General, please approve

 5   our opinion"?

 6               MS. KARLAN:          No.       No, Justice Scalia.

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:               All right.         What?

 8               MS. KARLAN:          They do not have to come before

 9   this court at all.      The chief election administrators of

10   Alabama or, in this case, the governor must come before

11   the court before he issues a certificate of office.

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Before the attorney

13   general, you're talking about?

14               MS. KARLAN:          He doesn't even have to come

15   before the attorney general.              If you look at the

16   statutes, he could have come to the United States

17   District Court for the District of Columbia and gotten a

18   --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:               No, no.         First of all,

20   you're trying to get -- the quick way is to get it from

21   the attorney general.

22               MS. KARLAN:          Well, the attorney general

23   found that this was a retrogressive change.

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:               I understand.         What was

25   supposed -- what should have been submitted to the

 1   attorney general?    What is the Alabama Supreme Court's

 2   --

 3                 MS. KARLAN:       Exactly what was submitted

 4   after the Federal court did, which is the -- the

 5   decision to appoint rather than to elect someone to

 6   District 1 of the Mobile County Commission.                The Alabama

 7   Supreme Court didn't have to submit anything, and the

 8   Federal court could not have been clearer in this case.

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The Federal court told

10   the Alabama --

11                 MS. KARLAN:       No, it told --

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            It told Alabama.     I

13   thought -- I thought that one of the reasons was

14   adjudication wasn't complete when the district court

15   made its first ruling, so the district court said, now,

16   go off and get those two Alabama Supreme Court decisions

17   precleared.

18                 MS. KARLAN:       No, Your Honor.          That's not

19   what they said.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What did they say?

21                 MS. KARLAN:       If you turn to the August 18th

22   final judgment, which is on page 9a over to page 10a of

23   the jurisdictional statement, they said judgment is

24   entered in our favor -- that was the declaratory

25   judgment -- and then said the State of Alabama has 90


                                        42

 1   days to obtain preclearance.


 2               The State was free to come to the DDC and


 3   seek judicial preclearance if they wanted.               The State


 4   was free, as Justice Scalia suggested, to try and use


 5   the quick way.

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But the State's position

 7   was it shouldn't have to preclear a decision of the

 8   State's highest court --

 9               MS. KARLAN:       But it -- it --

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- saying that the State

11   lower court got it wrong.

12               MS. KARLAN:       Justice Ginsburg, this does not

13   say the State has to preclear the decision of the

14   Alabama Supreme Court.      It simply says -- and if you

15   look at page 8a, which is the end of the district

16   court's opinion -- you know, it's enjoining enforcement

17   of those decisions; it's not enjoining those decisions.

18   You don't have to spin the Alabama Supreme Court here.

19   But they literally sued only the governor in this case.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Why did Alabama have

21   to preclear anything?     On November 1st, 1964, this was

22   an appointed position.      This is not a change from what

23   was, quote, "in force or effect" on November 1st, 1964.

24               MS. KARLAN:       Well, for one thing, this Court

25   would have to overrule its decisions --


                                      43

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Oh, no, no.    Those

 2   decisions are all dicta.

 3                MS. KARLAN:       But let me go then straight to

 4   a factual point, which is this is not the same practice

 5   as they were using on November 1st of 1964, because that

 6   practice was a combination of two things.                It was

 7   gubernatorial appointment under Alabama Section 11-3-6,

 8   and it was gubernatorial appointment in the context of

 9   at-large elections, but --

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So something else

11   changed --

12                MS. KARLAN:       No, the --

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- whether they are

14   membership elections or at-large elections.

15                MS. KARLAN:       It's a huge difference, Your

16   Honor.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                The argument you

18   made in your brief was that this was already decided in

19   Reno versus Bossier Parish.             I didn't see the --

20                MS. KARLAN:       No, we didn't --

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Is the argument that

22   this was not, in fact, a change in your brief?

23                MS. KARLAN:       We didn't see that until their

24   reply brief, and we didn't think we needed to file a

25   surreply brief.   This Court doesn't allow them.

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No.    They had the


 2   argument -- you at least thought they did --

 3               MS. KARLAN:       No.


 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You quote in your


 5   brief Reno versus Bossier Parish and one other case.

 6   I'm thinking of one other.

 7               MS. KARLAN:       I think you're probably

 8   thinking about Young against Fordice, itself.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Yes.    And you raised

10   the argument -- you criticized them for raising this

11   argument; that this wasn't any different; but you did

12   not say that it wasn't any different.

13               MS. KARLAN:       Well, their claim there was

14   that -- not that this wasn't any different, but part of

15   our explanation is that, in context, we think there is a

16   difference between what was going on in 1964.

17               They actually, I think, want to go back to

18   the 1977 to 1985 practice, which is the post -- the

19   post-election practice in Alabama once Brown against

20   Moore had been decided.

21               Now, the other thing is I will say that the

22   Department of Justice regulations on this, which are

23   quite clear, have been in effect since 1987.                  And in the

24   2006 -- in the 2006 re-enactment of the Voting Rights

25   Act, if you look at the House report, they talk about


                                      45

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Young against Fordice there.           And they say

 2   "Mississippi's attempt to revive and to resuscitate" --

 3   and those are the House's words, "to revive or

 4   resuscitate" -- the --

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I think you're quite

 6   right on the DOJ regulations and the House report, but I

 7   just don't see how that squares with the statutory

 8   language.

 9               MS. KARLAN:       Well, Your Honor, if I could

10   just make an observation about section 5 more generally

11   in Allen, and I'll start here.             In Allen, itself, this

12   Court recognized that the text of section 5 doesn't

13   provide for private rights of action, and yet it found

14   them.

15               It recognized that the text of section 14 of

16   the Voting Rights Act suggests that the only place that

17   can be -- that the only place that can litigate section

18   5 --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So because we've

20   ignored the text in other areas, we should just forget

21   about it here?

22               MS. KARLAN:       No, because that's -- that's

23   the -- those sets of decisions by this Court have been

24   ratified by Congress and have been the longstanding

25   practice under section 5.         You should continue that.

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I thought that --

 2   they ratified -- these cases were ratified by Congress,

 3   but Congress did not change the language in the statute.

 4                MS. KARLAN:       Because it thought that the

 5   purpose of section 5 -- if I could spend just one

 6   sentence on this -- the purpose of section 5's November

 7   1st language was to prevent a sort of game of

 8   Whac-A-Mole in which the States would keep changing the

 9   practice.   And the idea of that freeze was to hold it in

10   place so that it could be challenged as a constitutional

11   matter before the State switched again.                 It wasn't to

12   create a safe harbor against attacks on the November 1st

13   practice.

21                    SUPPORTING THE APPELLEES

22                MR. SHANMUGAM:         Thank you, Mr. Chief

23   Justice, and may it please the Court:

24                As this Court has repeatedly recognized,

25   section 5 of the Voting Rights Act requires a cover

 1   jurisdiction to seek preclearance whenever it seeks to

 2   administer any change in its voting practices.                 And

 3   there is no basis in either text or policy for carving

 4   out an exception for all or some changes precipitated by

 5   State-court decisions.       The judgment of the district

 6   court should, therefore, be affirmed.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Do you have any problem

 8   with the republican form of government provision of the

 9   Constitution?

10                MR. SHANMUGAM:         Absolutely not.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:            As I understand what's

12   going on here, the -- the legislative process of the

13   people of Alabama, whereby something is invalid as a

14   law, suddenly becomes a law because the Federal attorney

15   general has given it preclearance.                 The people have

16   never voted for that properly under their Constitution.

17   Yet, it becomes law in Alabama.              And that's a republican

18   form of government?

19                MR. SHANMUGAM:         Well, I don't think, with

20   respect, Justice Scalia, that that's actually happened

21   here.   What happened in this case was that the practice

22   of special elections actually went into effect while the

23   litigation was ongoing.

24                The Alabama Supreme Court then held that the

25   statute adopting that practice was invalid as a matter


                                       48

 1   of State law, to be sure, and, therefore, was void ab

 2   initio as a matter of State law.

 3               As a result of that decision, the remedy in

 4   some sense was to revert to the practice of

 5   gubernatorial appointments.               And what happened then was

 6   that it was then incumbent on the attorney general under

 7   section 5, the Alabama attorney general, to seek

 8   preclearance of that practice.                And the Federal attorney

 9   general made the determination that it would be

10   retrogressive to go back to that practice.

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:               From an Alabama law that

12   had never been adopted by the people of Alabama?

13               MR. SHANMUGAM:            It had been adopted by the

14   people of Alabama.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Not validated, so --

16               MR. SHANMUGAM:            It was invalid, to be sure,

17   as a matter of State law.            And then -- and then what

18   happens at that point is that the Alabama attorney

19   general is in very much the same position as he would be

20   if the Federal attorney general had held that some

21   statutory provision that had been enacted by the Alabama

22   legislature was improperly retrogressive.                 He would be

23   faced with a choice:        He could either proceed under a

24   practice that was invalid under State law, or the State

25   could pass a new law providing a --

 1                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            That all depends on there

 2   having been a change.        What there was was gubernatorial

 3   appointment.    Then the legislature passes a law.

 4   Suppose that the circuit court had said, sorry,

 5   legislature, you got it wrong, general prevails, you

 6   can't do it this way, the law is invalid.                  Suppose the

 7   circuit court had said that.              Then there would not have

 8   been an election, right.

 9                  MR. SHANMUGAM:         That's exactly right, and

10   under our view there would not have been a change,

11   because it was the fact that there was a special

12   election that was critical.

13                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So there becomes -- there

14   becomes a change only because the circuit court has made

15   the mistake about what the State law is.                  That's very

16   odd.

17                  MR. SHANMUGAM:         There becomes a change,

18   Justice Ginsburg, because the practice of special

19   elections actually went into effect by virtue, at a

20   minimum of the fact that an election was held.                  And to

21   be sure --

22                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What if the district

23   court -- circuit court I guess it is in Alabama.                  This

24   action is filed before the election and the circuit

25   court says:    You may have a successful claim here, but

 1   I'm not going to disrupt the election, there isn't time;

 2   so this election can go forward and during that period

 3   I'll be considering the law.            We do that all the time,

 4   or three-judge district courts do, saying we're going to

 5   look at this question, but we don't have time to stop

 6   the election so it's going to go forward.                In that case,

 7   would that lead to the same result?

 8                MR. SHANMUGAM:         Well, with respect,

 9   Mr. Chief Justice, I think what a State court might do

10   in that circumstance would be to enter a stay until it

11   could adjudicate the validity --

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, sure, but not

13   always.   You know, if it's a week before the election or

14   something, even if they think it's a serious claim, they

15   sometimes say:   We're going to allow the election to go

16   forward because we're going to look at this and perhaps

17   the State Supreme Court has to look at it, and we don't

18   want to hold up the election.

19                MR. SHANMUGAM:         Well, it is certainly the

20   implication of our position that if the law actually

21   goes into effect and an election is held and if

22   preclearance has already been granted for, in some

23   sense, the contrary position, then, yes, if the State

24   Supreme Court or the State trial court subsequently

25   gives State law a different interpretation, then that


                                       51

 1   change is going to require preclearance.

 2                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           That's not just an

 3   implication.    That's your whole theory.

 4                  MR. SHANMUGAM:         Well, it is our theory as to

 5   what the "in force or effect" requirement means.                    And we

 6   believe that that follows from this Court's decision in

 7   Young versus Fordice, which sets out the parameters for

 8   determining --

 9                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, Young versus Fordice,

10   that's Young versus -- I mean, if it never went into

11   force and effect, of course we don't reach questions

12   like republican form of government or 1964 safe harbors

13   and so forth.    And so I think it's an important matter.

14   And as I read Fordice, we have over here an instance

15   where nothing happened.          You know, some people

16   registered and then immediately they were told the

17   registration was no good.            So it wasn't in force and

18   effect.

19                  When I looked at Perkins v. Matthews, that

20   was not a case where the law was challenged immediately.

21   Rather, what Justice Brennan said is that this has been

22   in effect from 1962 to 1965 at least, and in 1965 they

23   had an election under the ward system.                    So even if it

24   might have been unconstitutional or it was, it was still

25   in effect for three years.

 1                In the other case, City of Lockhart, Justice

 2   Powell says this statute has been in effect, we assume,

 3   from 1917 to 1973.      That's not exactly a fleeting

 4   matter.   So -- so here we have a case where they

 5   challenged it instantly, where it was litigated as fast

 6   as it possibly could be, where in fact, as Justice

 7   Ginsburg just said, a different decision of the circuit

 8   court would have led to the opposite of it never would

 9   have even had it.     So what harm does it do to the

10   enforcement of the civil rights laws of the United

11   States if the holding of this Court were, well, under

12   these circumstances, where challenged immediately, et

13   cetera, it never took force and effect?

14                MR. SHANMUGAM:           Justice Breyer, the harm is

15   that there would be actual retrogression.                 And I think

16   that there are two critical and distinct legal issues

17   that this Court needs to address.                  The first is whether

18   this practice was in effect for long enough for it to

19   have been in force or effect.               The governing precedent

20   on that issue is Young versus Fordice.

21                And we believe that there is more here.

22   There is not simply the partial implementation of voter

23   registration procedures for a very brief period of time,

24   a matter of weeks.      An election was actually held and if

25   that is not sufficient to satisfy the "in force or


                                         53

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   effect" requirement, it's hard to see what would be.

 2                The second question is whether a practice

 3   can be said to be in force or effect when it was void ab

 4   initio as a matter of State law.               And we do respectfully

 5   submit that the City of Lockhart and Perkins answer that

 6   question because in both of those case the Court held

 7   that the relevant question was whether the practice was

 8   actually in effect.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, you talk

10   about force and effect.        Of course, the statute says

11   "force or effect on November 1st, 1964."                Do you have

12   anything to add to Ms. Karlan's response on my quaint

13   fixation on the language of the statute?

14                MR. SHANMUGAM:         Well, it isn't quaint at

15   all.   I would say that I do think that as a textual

16   matter one could perhaps make the argument that where a

17   covered jurisdiction changes its voting practice after

18   the statutory coverage date and then enacts basically a

19   new version of the pre-existing practice, that the new

20   practice could as a formal matter be said to be a new

21   practice.

22                But I want to make two additional points.

23   The first is that the question of whether the statute

24   covers reversion to coverage date practices is really

25   not properly before the Court.              Appellant seemingly did


                                       54

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   not raise it before the district court and it is not --

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, that can't tie

 3   our hands in properly interpreting the statute.

 4               MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, it's not within the

 5   scope of the question presented, either.                The question

 6   presented focuses solely on the question of whether

 7   changes precipitated by State court decisions require

 8   preclearance.   And that's a question that this Court has

 9   answered twice in Hathorn and Branch.

10               The only other thing that I would say is

11   that it has been not only the consistent interpretation

12   of the attorney general, but also the consistent

13   interpretation as far as we are aware of the lower

14   court, that the statute does reach reversions to

15   preexisting practices as well.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I don't see how --

17   regardless of how consistent the interpretation is, how

18   can you read "November 1st, 1964," to mean anything

19   other than that date?

20               MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, I do think that a

21   textual argument could be made, Mr. Chief Justice, that

22   the practice that was in effect as of the coverage date

23   in some sense ceases to exist when the jurisdiction

24   adopts an intervening distinct practice.                And certainly

25   there is enough ambiguity, I believe, to get us into the


                                       55

 1   realm of deference, and this Court has repeatedly

 2   recognized that the attorney general's interpretations

 3   of section 5 are entitled to substantial deference.

 4                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Shanmugan, what does

 5   the attorney general do when he gets -- I mean, does he

 6   just preclear any old thing that somebody shoves under

 7   his nose?   Does he look to see whether there is

 8   litigation pending on it?            Was this litigation pending

 9   when it was --

10                  MR. SHANMUGAM:         I think this bears --

11                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- the plan was

12   submitted --

13                  MR. SHANMUGAM:         This bears on a critical

14   point, Justice Scalia.         And this Court has a line of

15   cases in the section 5 area that says that it is really

16   incumbent on covered jurisdictions when they seek

17   preclearance clearly to identify the relevant change in

18   their voting practices when they come to the attorney

19   general for preclearance.            And when the 1985 act was

20   submitted for preclearance, there was nary a word in the

21   Alabama attorney general's submission that there was any

22   potential difficulty with the statute under State law.

23                  And so, the attorney general precluded on

24   the understandable understanding that the statute simply

25   affected a shift to special elections.                    And I do think


                                         56

 1   that the great price of Appellant's interpretation is if

 2   the court were to adopt it, it would suddenly shift the

 3   burden to the Federal attorney general or the D.C.

 4   District Court to when they receive a preclearance

 5   submission, essentially assess the meaning and validity

 6   of any State statute, lest the State statute be

 7   construed differently by a State court, and thus, lock

 8   in the preclearance court or attorney general.                  And we

 9   believe that that problem along with this Court's

10   decision in Branch and Hawthorne support our

11   interpretation.

12               Thank you.

14               Mr. Newsom, four minutes.

15               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Mr. Newsom, I hate to

16   intrude on your rebuttal time, but I would like to ask

17   you this question.      Supposing a State after 1964 and

18   before 2000 made 35 different changes of all improved

19   voting rights, could they always go back to the practice

20   in effect of 1964 and not have to preclear?

23               MR. NEWSOM:          Your Honor, if we are talking

24   about a legislative or administrative change, the answer

25   may well be no under this Court's dicta.

 1                JUSTICE STEVENS:           It could be any kind of


 2   change, legislative, administrative, judicial, could


 3   they always go back to 1964 and have a safe harbor?


 4                MR. NEWSOM:       I think that, Your Honor, if


 5   you're going to treat all forms of changes together,

 6   then they may well be able to.              Although I would say

 7   this, that that will very rarely, if ever, be the case.

 8   This is sort of the odd ball case in which the reversion

 9   happens to be --

10                JUSTICE STEVENS:           I understand.       I'm just

11   trying to understand how much teeth there is in the 1964

12   date.   Is it safe harbor or isn't it?

13                MR. NEWSOM:       Well, I think the explanation

14   for 19 -- for November 1, 1964 is section 5 was

15   implemented as a five-year stopgap measure.                It's now

16   been extended through 2031 with no amendment of the

17   language.   So it might have made some sense as a hard

18   requirement in 1964.      It makes much less practical

19   sense, I recognize, today.          But the language is what the

20   language is I'm sorry.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What about

22   Ms. Karlan's response that this is not the same practice

23   but it's different because the underlying method of

24   election has been changed.

25                MR. NEWSOM:       With respect, Your Honor, I

 1   think the plaqueities is gubernatorial appointment.                      It

 2   doesn't strike me that the underlying method of how the

 3   election might have operated if the rule were election

 4   should matter, the rule was gubernatorial appointment.

 5   The rule is by virtue of these decisions gubernatorial

 6   appointment.

 7                  If I may, just a couple of housekeeping

 8   items.

 9                  Justice Ginsburg, the question of what DOJ

10   was asked to preclear here is crystal clear from the

11   district court's opinion.            On August 18, 2006, this

12   three-judge court held that two Alabama Supreme Court

13   decisions Stokes v. Noonan and Riley v. Kennedy must be

14   precleared before they can be -- so the notion that the

15   State was not asked to preclear judicial decisions is

16   simply incorrect.

17                  The second thing I'd like to mention just

18   briefly is that the Federalism exacerbation here exists

19   in a very real way for this reason.                       The entire

20   legislative and litigation history of section 5 has been

21   about legislative and administrative change.                       Even with

22   respect to those sorts of changes, this Court has said

23   most recently and most forcefully in Presley that that

24   application of section 5 even there works an

25   extraordinary change of the traditional course of


                                         59

 1   relations between the states and the Federal Government.

 2   So the -- to this point to be sure the Court has been

 3   willing to accept that extraordinary departure.              The

 4   question in this case, however, is whether this

 5   extraordinary departure ought to become this


 6   extraordinary departure to account for this new


 7   category, this new universe of changes.


 8               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Why as a matter of


 9   Federalism is it more extraordinary to review a court


10   determination than the determination of a popularly

11   elected legislature?

12               MR. NEWSOM:       Well, Your Honor, there are two

13   pieces of this, really.       That's more extraordinary

14   simply in a quantitative sense.             We are talking about a

15   lot more changes, so in sheer numbers we have got an

16   exacerbation.

17               But it's also in a qualitative sense the

18   sense that we are living in a post Marbury, post Cooper

19   versus Aaron, post Bernie world in which State courts

20   just like Federal courts are tasked with finally

21   deciding what State law means.             And so, there is a very

22   real difference, I think, in upsetting the considered

23   judgment of a State court with respect to what State

24   court -- with respect to what State law means than there

25   is --

 1               JUSTICE SOUTER:               But they are not saying

 2   State law is different from what it means.                   They are

 3   saying that you cannot put a change in effect until you

 4   get it precleared.

 5               MR. NEWSOM:          Right, Your Honor.           But with

 6   respect I think that that doesn't do justice to the

 7   functional reality of what's going on here.                   In 1988 the

 8   Alabama Supreme Court says, may I, says in Stokes versus

 9   Noonan that 85-237 is and always was unconstitutional.

10   We have an issue of doctrine that's simply part of

11   Alabama law and, again, I don't think anybody here

12   seriously disputes that 85-237 was unconstitutional.

13               And 20 years later DOJ steps in and refuses

14   to bless that determination, and to be sure, is not

15   meddling around in the intricacies of state law but the

16   functional equivalent is the same.                   They set that

17   judgment aside, and notwithstanding the Stokes court

18   invalidation of that, DOJ says very clearly in its

19   objection letters that 85-237, despite its invalidation,

20   remains in full force and effect.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you counsel.

22   The case is submitted.

23               (Whereupon, at 2:02 p.m., the case in the

24   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
