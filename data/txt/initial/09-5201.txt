 7                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. SADY

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9                  MR. SADY:     Mr. -- Mr. Chief Justice, and may

10   it please the Court:

11                  The phrase "term of imprisonment" appears

12   three times in the first sentence of the Federal good

13   time statute.     The first two times the parties are in

14   agreement.     "Term of imprisonment" means "sentence

15   imposed."     The third use, which sets the rate for good

16   time credit, also means the "sentence imposed" when it's

17   used in the phrase "up to 54 days of good time credit

18   towards the service of the sentence."

19                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           But it doesn't always mean

20   that.     I think you say somewhere in your brief that it

21   always means that.      It surely does not always mean that.

22   Because in -- what is it, 3624 -- wait a minute, now.

23   3624(d) says that, "Upon the release of a prisoner on

24   the expiration of his term of imprisonment, the Bureau

25   of Prisons shall give him clothes, money and


                                          3

 1   transportation."

 2                Now there the expiration of his term of

 3   imprisonment does not mean the -- the assigned term of

 4   imprisonment.    It means the assigned term of

 5   imprisonment less all the good time credits he has had.

 6                MR. SADY:      Exactly.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Unless you think they are

 8   supposed to give him his clothes, you know, several

 9   months after he leaves.

10                MR. SADY:      Your Honor, that is a perfect use

11   of "term of imprisonment" to mean actual time and any

12   good time credits earned.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Right.

14                MR. SADY:      And it uses the term "release."

15   "Release" is defined in 3624(a), which says that you are

16   released when you have your actual time served and any

17   good time.

18                The flaw in the Bureau of Prisons system is

19   that they do not give credit towards the term of

20   imprisonment as this statute in 3624(b) dictates.

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I'm not addressing that.

22   All I'm -- look, it -- the text says "upon the release

23   of a prisoner on the expiration of his term of

24   imprisonment."    My only point is that that -- you have

25   to acknowledge that that is a use of the phrase "term of


                                         4

 1   imprisonment" that does not mean the sentence he was

 2   given, but rather means the sentence that he served.

 3                 MR. SADY:      I respectfully disagree because

 4   it expires.    A term of imprisonment, a ten-year

 5   sentence, expires.      When you have 311 days 10 times,

 6   that means it has expired, because you also are giving

 7   those 54 days of good time credits 10 times.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             That's right.

 9                 JUSTICE ALITO:             But why isn't the term of

10   imprisonment most reasonably understood to mean the term

11   that is imposed viewed at the time when it is imposed?

12   So that if someone is sentenced to a term of 360 days, 5

13   years, and begins serving his sentence on January 1st,

14   year 1 of the term imposed ends on December 31st of that

15   year; year 2 of the term imposed begins on January 1st

16   of the following year, and so forth.

17                 MR. SADY:      Justice Alito, that would be the

18   end of the time served for 1 year, but for the term of

19   imprisonment, because if we assume at the end of the

20   365 days that person has earned maximum good time

21   credit -

22                 JUSTICE ALITO:             Right.

23                 MR. SADY:      That he should receive credit

24   towards the service of the sentence.                      That means on the

25   365th day he should move back on the calendar a

 1   adjustment for good time and a reset for the next year.

 2   That way, if you have a ten-year sentence, you have ten

 3   opportunities to -

 4               JUSTICE ALITO:             Well, hang on.         I understand

 5   what you are arguing, but I don't understand why the

 6   term of imprisonment changes.             We look at the -- we look

 7   at the term of the imprisonment on the day when it is

 8   imposed and the day when the defendant begins serving

 9   the sentence, and you can say:              Year one ends at the end

10   of 2010; year two ends at the end of 2011.

11               Why do you think that the term -- the phrase

12   "term of imprisonment" has to change as -- the

13   understanding of the "term of imprisonment" has to

14   change as the prisoner progresses in serving the

15   sentence?   I totally fail to understand that.

16               MR. SADY:      It doesn't change.                It's still -

17   the two components of a term of imprisonment are actual

18   time and good time credits.             So the way we are

19   presenting it is the first year of the term of

20   imprisonment is the 311 days of actual service and the

21   54 days -

22               JUSTICE ALITO:             But you don't know whether

23   that -- you don't know whether that prisoner is going to

24   be eligible for the 54 days until the 365 days are over.

25               MR. SADY:      That's fine.                 We -- if the Bureau


                                        6

 1   of Prisons determines that the person should receive up

 2   to 54 days at day 365, then they receive credit towards

 3   the service of their sentence.               That means moving it

 4   back 54 days because they didn't have to serve those

 5   days.   And then you reset -

 6                 JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, I'm not sure where you

 7   get that -- I'm not sure where you get that out of the

 8   statute.    But I still don't think you have answered my

 9   question.    I don't want to belabor it too much.

10                 On the day when the prisoner in my

11   hypothetical begins serving his sentence, if you said,

12   When will your first year of imprisonment -- first year

13   of your term of imprisonment end?                 You would say

14   December 31st, 2010.       When will the second year of the

15   term of imprisonment end?           December 31st, 2011.          That's

16   what you would have to say at that point, because you

17   don't know whether the prisoner will earn any good time

18   credits.    So why do you think that the meaning of the

19   year of the term of imprisonment changes as the sentence

20   goes on?

21                 MR. SADY:     I do -- do not think it changes.

22   I think that it is adjusted for good time, which is

23   exactly what Congress intended.                They said that every

24   day, you get credit beyond time served.                  They use the

25   phrase "beyond time served" for credit towards the

 1   service -

 2               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Counsel, I'm -- perhaps

 3   I can, if you will permit me, rephrase Justice Alito's

 4   question in sort of the more simplistic way I looked at

 5   it.

 6                Why is it that we have to do the calculation

 7   that you're talking about, which is start at 311 days

 8   and take back days, which makes no sense to me, or their

 9   very complicated ten-page number?

10                Why can't they just take 54 days at the end

11   of every year that there is actual service, and that the

12   time served, plus whatever number of days have been

13   earned, you subtract it from the term of imprisonment?

14   So if he was imprisoned for 10 years, he got 540 days

15   for whatever it is.       At the end of the 9th year, he made

16   up whatever -- you added up 9 times 54, and you took it

17   away from 10.     He serves 9 and that.                   That would make

18   sense of "beyond the time served" language that's in

19   this provision.

20                MR. SADY:       Justice Sotomayor, we are not

21   asking -- 311 doesn't have to be the magic day of when

22   they determine whether they should receive it.                      We are

23   saying, go ahead, assume exactly what they are doing

24   now.   Go up to 365 days.

25                But they do make a determination.                     At that


                                          8

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   point of making the determination, that's when they go

 2   back to 54 days and have to reset.                  That way on a

 3   10-year sentence you have 10 blocks that Congress

 4   intended to give prisoners to be able to earn 54 days in

 5   each of those blocks.

 6               Now, the way that we were hearing it posited

 7   from Justice Alito, if we have the 54 days on top of

 8   time served without any adjustment, then we end up with

 9   a 419-year first day -- first year, and you can only fit

10   8 opportunities to earn the 54 days.

11               JUSTICE ALITO:              No, not at all.     No.     At the

12   end of -- at the end of 2010, in my hypothetical, you

13   would take the 54 days off the end, just as Justice

14   Sotomayor suggested.

15               MR. SADY:       And the -

16               JUSTICE ALITO:              And -- but it doesn't mean

17   that the service doesn't -- your -- your argument is

18   predicated on the idea that service of year two begins

19   on the 311th day.

20               MR. SADY:       If there is an adjustment for

21   good time, because "term of imprisonment" is a term of

22   art that doesn't mean time served only.                  It can mean -

23               JUSTICE ALITO:              But I don't understand that.

24   I will not belabor it.        I don't understand why the

25   parties have spent so much time sparring over that

 1   issue, which seems to me to be totally unnecessary and

 2   irrelevant.

 3                 MR. SADY:     Justice Alito, if I could refer

 4   you to 3621(a), 3624(a), and 3624(b), each of those

 5   refers -- when they are talking about a term of

 6   imprisonment, each refers to it as "less good time."

 7   And -- and unless you do that, the reason -

 8                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Well, do you do it if

 9   you take (a), and (a) says:             A prisoner shall be

10   released by the Bureau of Prisons on the date of the

11   expiration of the prisoner's term of imprisonment -- 10

12   years, we are assuming, an imprisonment -- less any time

13   credited towards the service of the prisoner's sentence,

14   as provided in subsection (b).

15                 MR. SADY:     Exactly.

16                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So each year that he

17   served, you add up the number of days he has served, the

18   good time credit, and you subtract them from the

19   120 months that you have given him, and you figure out

20   when he's going to get out.             You work backwards, not

21   forward, the way everyone seems to be doing.

22                 MR. SADY:     If you do that, you only end up

23   with eight opportunities to -- to have 54 days.               That's

24   why it's the difference between -- I think anybody

25   reading -

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But that's the way the

 2   language is written.      So I mean you may want the greater

 3   opportunity, but it says by its explicit phrase:                   Terms:

 4   At the date of the prisoner's -- expiration of the

 5   prisoner's term of imprisonment, take that day and

 6   subtract from it time credited towards the service of

 7   the prisoner's sentence.

 8                MR. SADY:     We are going to -- the rate

 9   phrase is:   Up to 54 days at the end of each year of the

10   term of imprisonment.

11                If there is a 10-year term of imprisonment,

12   that means there's 10 opportunities to earn 54 days.

13   The Bureau of Prisons' math ends up with 470 days,

14   70 days less.   And the reason for that is that they do

15   not interpret "term of imprisonment" to encompass the

16   possibility of good time.

17                That is the only -- because you should have

18   10 blocks of 365 days.       Each of those blocks, you may be

19   able to get 54 days.      Then it's 311.                But maybe you

20   didn't earn any time.      Then it would be a 365-block.

21   But the -- actually, the very good idea that Congress

22   had was that you had an incentive at every stage of your

23   term of imprisonment for good behavior.

24                Even if you were misbehaving early in your

25   prison term, at the end you still have the opportunity

 1   to earn 54 days against that last 365 days.                   It counts

 2   for every word in the statute.               It gives every statute

 3   meaning.   And it doesn't put us in the position of

 4   giving two -- two phrases the exact same meaning in the

 5   same sentence.

 6               This Court has never found that phrases -

 7   two phrases, uses of "term of imprisonment" in the same

 8   sentence, mean different things.

 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             What do you do with -

10   if -- it's a very short sentence?                 A year and a day, in

11   your view, is a year and a day less 54.

12               MR. SADY:       Yes.

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But 360 days, what do you

14   do with that?

15               MR. SADY:       With 360 -

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Yes.       If -- suppose it's

17   for -- just -- the whole sentence is 360 days.

18               MR. SADY:       If it says 366 days, so that the

19   year -

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             No, 360.        In other words,

21   short of a year.

22               MR. SADY:       Then it -- a 360-day sentence

23   would not be eligible, because we -- the parties are

24   agreed that "term of imprisonment" means a sentence of

25   more than a year.    So it has to be more than 365 days.

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             So the person that gets a

 2   year and a day serves less than the person that gets

 3   less than a year?

 4                MR. SADY:      That is correct.                 And district

 5   courts frequently address that problem.                      When you have a

 6   relatively short sentence, you say:                      Judge, could you

 7   give us -- instead of an 11-month sentence, could you

 8   give us a year and a day sentence, so that you could

 9   earn the good time on that?

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:            How can you earn the good

11   time?   I mean you only earn the good time if -- if you

12   are a good prisoner for a year.

13                MR. SADY:      That gets us to the -

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:             So you are going to let him

15   out 54 days before the year, even though he hasn't

16   earned the good time in the year?

17                MR. SADY:      He has.

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:            What did he do?           How has

19   he?

20                MR. SADY:      He has because of the last

21   sentence in 3624(b) that says that for the last year or

22   portion of the year, that you go ahead and establish the

23   two-step process.    First, you figure out the projected

24   release date, which is a release date with maximum good

25   time.   Then you make the decision about whether the


                                        13

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   prisoner should receive that within six weeks of that -

 2   of that projected release date.

 3               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Yes, but that still

 4   couldn't give him the full 54 days, because there's only

 5   42 days in six weeks.

 6               MR. SADY:      That's only a measure when you

 7   make the determination.        They -- they were recognizing

 8   that for the last period of time, or for a year and a

 9   day sentence, that you are not going to be able to do

10   the time all the time, but you will, so that's why there

11   is a special mechanism at the end.

12               JUSTICE STEVENS:            But I'm saying the special

13   mechanism can't give the full 54 days.

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Exactly.

15               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Because they don't make it

16   until 42 days before the end of the sentence.

17               MR. SADY:      They make it until 311 days at

18   the end of the sentence, because what they do is they

19   make the -- they figure out what the maximum good time

20   would be, which would be 312 days on a 300 and -- on a

21   year and a day sentence, and they make that

22   determination earlier.

23               They say, okay, you have been good for that

24   period of time.   We recognize that this is going to be a

25   problem, the same problem you would have on a sentence


                                       14

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   of 10 years and 6 months, where you have to prorate the

 2   credit, 27 days instead of 54, half, and then figure out

 3   the projected release date with 180 days, subtract the

 4   27 days, and then make the determination sometime within

 5   the 6 weeks up to that last point.

 6               So that there is a mechanism for

 7   understanding that it is -- that in the last year there

 8   is going -- going to be an assumption that if you are

 9   behaving all the way up to -- in the full sentence -

10   day 311, you should get the full 54 days.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm sure there is

12   something wrong with this predicate to this question,

13   but the -- the statute allows the Bureau to make a

14   determination of good time credit within 15 days after

15   the end of each year of the sentence.

16               MR. SADY:     Yes.

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                They cannot make

18   that determination within 15 days of the 311 days.                   And

19   so "each year of the sentence" must mean each -- the

20   full year, the 365 days.

21               MR. SADY:     Our position is that the Bureau

22   of Prisons can make its determination as it pleases.

23   We -- we are asking the Court to do -- to construe a

24   statute, not write a policy statement.                 So we understand

25   that there are going to be some mechanics of it.                But


                                      15

 1   the mechanics in this work very easily with the

 2   assurance that they are receiving good time credit

 3   against the period of the sentence imposed by the judge.

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You treat each year

 5   of the sentence as the 311 days if there has been good

 6   behavior, no?

 7               MR. SADY:       Not necessarily.             We are --

 8   I'm -- if the Bureau of Prisons wants to make that

 9   determination at day 365, that's fine, as long as they

10   adjust by doing exactly what the statute says:                  Credit

11   towards the service of the sentence, move it back 40 -

12   54 days, and then reset.         If you do that, you have 10

13   blocks of 365 days.

14               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, why do you do have to

15   do that?   I mean you read it.            It so complicated.          Just

16   reading this, I -- I think the language should say this:

17   10 years, he's got a 10-year sentence.                  At the end of

18   the first year you write the number 54 on a piece of

19   paper if he has done well.

20               Suppose he comes in on January 1, okay?                     So

21   January 2, after the first year, you write the word

22   50 -- the number 54.      And you do that each year.                 And by

23   the time you get to the year 8, what you have done is

24   you have got 432 days.

25               So then you subtract the 430 days from 10


                                       16

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   years, and what you get is you are 67 days short of 9

 2   years.    So now you look at the last sentence, and what

 3   you do is you take 67 days, subtract that from 365, and

 4   you've got 298, and you simply prorate for those 298.

 5   And you subtract that, too, so he gets another 10 days

 6   or so, or 15 days credit, and that's it.

 7                And that's following the statute, it seems

 8   to me, absolutely literally.             And it also seems to me to

 9   make sense, because you don't want to give him credit

10   for time he never serves.

11                MR. SADY:      Justice Breyer, I think it

12   doesn't make sense, because what it does is it creates

13   an 87.2 minimum sentence that is served, and we note

14   that the sentencing table upon which every Federal

15   sentence is predicated is based on 85 percent.                That

16   being -

17                JUSTICE BREYER:            No, that isn't what the -

18   if you want to know what the sentencing commission did,

19   I think the best evidence of that is you read the

20   introduction to the guidelines.                And what the

21   introduction to the guidelines says is that, roughly

22   speaking, many of the sentences approximate the time

23   actually served before.

24                Now, what to me that suggests is that the

25   sentencing commission never considered this question.

 1   And if there's something more specific than that, that

 2   shows they did, I would like to know what it is, because

 3   I don't trust memory.

 4                 MR. SADY:     Your Honor, we are relying very

 5   heavily on the supplemental report at -- at page 140 of

 6   the joint appendix that says we -- we divide it by .85

 7   in order to calibrate the sentencing table to include

 8   good time.    That means that every sentence has been

 9   calibrated based on assuming 10 opportunities to earn

10   54 days, which -

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Of course, the government

12   contends it's none of the sentencing commission's

13   business.    It's up to the Bureau of Prisons.                 Isn't that

14   the government's position?

15                 MR. SADY:     That is their position.              And our

16   position is that it's -- administering the statute is

17   the Bureau of Prisons's business, but deciding what the

18   minimum sentence that can -- minimum time that can be

19   served to satisfy a term of imprisonment is a policy

20   decision, and that the policy is properly placed -

21                JUSTICE BREYER:            But there is nothing in

22   there -- that's not a policy statement; that's not a

23   guideline.   That's a staff conclusion.                  And the staff

24   conclusion, I think, is conflicting with what it says in

25   the -- in the introduction to the guidelines, which is


                                        18

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that all of this was very approximate.                 I don't see

 2   how -- how -- a court would be bound by that.

 3               MR. SADY:       I think that the court could be

 4   advised by it in terms of knowing that we are looking at

 5   a harsher sentence.     Everybody is serving more time than

 6   -- the sentence that the judge imposed was -- whether it

 7   was advisory guidelines or mandatory guidelines, the

 8   sentencing table provided the initial baseline.

 9               And that initial baseline was boosted by 2.2

10   percent, which is not an insignificant amount, and there

11   is a very simple way for the court to construe the

12   statute consistently throughout to conform the two, so

13   that people are not serving 2.2 percent more time in

14   custody than the sentencing table that every judge uses

15   in imposing their sentence.

16               We are institutionalizing a harsher system

17   in a way that doesn't meet the statutory language,

18   because the statutory language says "term of

19   imprisonment."

20               And if it's term of imprisonment, 10 years

21   of a term of imprisonment, I think a reasonable plain

22   meaning is that you have 10 opportunities to earn

23   54 days.

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Sady, you -- you said

25   something about 15 percent or 85 percent is a more

 1   workable system than -- was it 12.9 percent?

 2                 Do we have any information on, (A), the

 3   number of Federal prisoners who get good time and in

 4   that universe, the ones who get good time, how many get

 5   the full credit and how many get something less than the

 6   full 54 days?

 7                 MR. SADY:     Justice Ginsburg, there are

 8   approximately 200,000 prisoners, and of those about

 9   195,000 of them are eligible for good time credits.

10                 My anecdotal experience is that most

11   prisoners get most of the -- the good time credits, so

12   it's not at all unusual for prisoners to achieve most of

13   that.    There is some that have minor amounts, and there

14   is a relatively smaller number, at least in my

15   experience, who do not get a lot of it.

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Is this right?   I'm -- I'm

17   sorry to ask you this question, but I get lost in the

18   math of this sometimes.

19                 Do you remember my example I just gave, you

20   know, with the 9 years you go and put it on a piece of

21   paper?

22                 MR. SADY:     Yes, the 419 -

23                JUSTICE BREYER:            I take it what you want is

24   you, in -- in essence, want him to get credit for

25   54 days for that tenth year?

 1              MR. SADY:         Yes.

 2                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes.      And the argument

 3   against that, reading the language and so forth, is,

 4   well, look this is an imaginary 10th year.                       He is not

 5   actually in prison for 10 years.                 He is going to be

 6   released sometime late in year 8.                  And so why should we

 7   add 54 days?     I mean maybe it would be a nice thing

 8   because sentences are awfully long, but -- but why would

 9   anybody want to add 54 days in respect to a year that's

10   never going to be served?

11                  MR. SADY:     Each year is served in the -- if

12   you take away the 54 days, if you credit it towards the

13   service of the sentence and do the adjustment and reset

14   that we are asking the Court to do so that you have 10

15   opportunities, then in the last year, you are -- when

16   you are in -- you go to the last sentence that

17   acknowledges that you are going to have to make some

18   arbitrary time that you are going to, say, okay, we are

19   going to decide that you have done well enough that you

20   are going to be able to get the full credit for the last

21   year.

22                  But the flaw in the Bureau of Prisons is by

23   having the 54 days and actual time and that that's what

24   happens at the first year, that's a 419-day first year.

25   You can only squeeze 8 of those in.                       The prisoners look

 1   at it and they see, plain statute, what was your term of

 2   imprisonment, how many ends of each year of a term of

 3   imprisonment should you have in a 10-year sentence.                Ten

 4   years.

 5               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, the statute says that

 6   it is -- the credit, it can be received, quote, at the

 7   end of each year of the prisoner's term of imprisonment

 8   beginning at the end of the first year of the term.

 9               MR. SADY:     Yes.

10               JUSTICE ALITO:          Now, when does -- when is

11   that point, in your opinion?

12               MR. SADY:     The Bureau of Prisons probably

13   has discretion in administering.              I'm accepting as a

14   proposition on the day 365 they make that determination.

15               JUSTICE ALITO:          Okay.       So the -- day 365 is

16   the end of the first year of -- of the term of

17   imprisonment?

18               MR. SADY:     That's -- that's when they are

19   making the determination.         If they make a determination

20   that he is -- should receive credit, then the end of the

21   first year becomes day 311, because he has received -

22              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              And then what do -

23              MR. SADY:      -- 311.

24               JUSTICE ALITO:          The statute says that

25   they -- that the prisoner may receive credit at the end

 1   of each year of the prisoner's term of imprisonment

 2   beginning at the end of the first year of the term.

 3               MR. SADY:     No.

 4               JUSTICE ALITO:          And what I'm asking is, when

 5   is the end of the first year of the term within the

 6   meaning of that language?

 7               MR. SADY:     The meaning of that language is

 8   day 3 -

 9              JUSTICE ALITO:           Is it day 3 -

10              MR. SADY:      Excuse me.

11               JUSTICE ALITO:          Is it day 365, or is it day

12   311?

13               MR. SADY:     It depends.             And the reason it

14   depends is because the language of the statute says

15   "credit toward the service of prisoner's sentence beyond

16   time served," so if you do it beyond time served and you

17   give him credit towards that sentence -- the Bureau of

18   Prisons is making a determination.                Once we -- they make

19   their determination, and we respect that determination,

20   we then have to go -- from the 365th day, back, because

21   for 54 of those days he doesn't have to be there.                He

25   365.

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               -- you start it at 311?

 2                MR. SADY:       No.

 3                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               And he now serves

 4   another year and you back him up again at the end of

 5   that year?   To 300 -

 6                MR. SADY:       Yes, that is -- that is certainly

 7   one way of mechanically doing it so that you have 10

 8   blocks of 365 days each as a term of imprisonment.

 9   Because term of -

10                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               And you -- and you think

11   that their system is easier?

12                MR. SADY:       Yes.

13                (Laughter.)

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               That their system is -

15                MR. SADY:       No, absolutely not.          Their -

16   their system makes -- nobody can understand the math.

17                JUSTICE BREYER:             Another way to think, and I

18   think probably you'll -- if you look through the records

19   of the commission, they even thought about this problem,

20   and the -- the -- you will see a lot of talks given by

21   various people who were there, which say that for this

22   reason you are bringing up, that it might have been

23   thought there was no credit for the first year.

24                In other words, you don't cut the sentence

25   in the first year.      You don't begin cut until the second

 1   year has been served, so he has to serve 365 days.                 Now

 2   when you point that out, that is not the Bureau of

 3   Prisons's interpretation, that's nobody's

 4   interpretation.    They're all going to let him out if

 5   it's a year and a day.        They are going to let him out

 6   several weeks before the end of the first year, aren't

 7   they?

 8                 MR. SADY:     Yes.        There was a technical

 9   amendment.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Everybody's going to do

11   that.    Oh -- there was a technical amendment.

12                 MR. SADY:     To address that first year, to

13   make sure that they did that.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:           That's what happened.      In

15   other words, the statute made before -

16                MR. SADY:      Exactly.

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Ah, I better get that -

18                MR. SADY:      -- when it was at 36 days.            And

19   it's interesting, so page 56 of the -- of the Senate

20   report on this, they used the term "adjust for good

21   time."   Now that -- then it was 36 days.                But Congress

22   was using exact same thought as the language here that

23   says that the time is -- that you give credit towards

24   the service of a sentence.

25                 And with the Court's permission I will

 4                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL

 5                      ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 6                 MR. WALL:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 7   please the Court:

 8                 Justice Breyer, I think you stole my

 9   thunder.    I wanted to explain how the bureau does it,

10   and you laid it out exactly right.                    If you have -- and I

11   think just looking at the language of the statute, it

12   tracks perfectly.      If you have a prisoner serving a

13   10-year sentence and he comes in on January 1st, the end

14   of his first year of imprisonment is December 31st, and

15   on that date he gets 54 days taken off the back end of

16   the sentence.      That cycle repeats itself for the next 8

17   years.     And -

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:             But the trouble with that,

19   and I'm glad to know about that technical amendment,

20   because then -

21                 MR. WALL:       Right.

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:             -- we never considered it

23   when I was on the -- nobody thought about it at that

24   time because the language was different.

25                 But now that you had have got this language


                                          26

 1   now, it's hard to reconcile with that first year.                  He is

 2   sentenced for a year and a day, you see.                  So literally,

 3   it says calculated on January 2 of the next year.                  But

 4   he's already been in for longer than he should be by

 5   that point.     So you really have to calculate it before

 6   the year ends; you have to calculate it at least by

 7   October.

 8                  And -- and -- and once you start calculating

 9   it before, the statute literally says, we are into a

10   more complicated thing than I thought.

11                  MR. WALL:     Well, and that's why they have

12   the sentence at the end, as you pointed out about the

13   proration.     So when the -- when the statute says, what

14   it says -- starts by saying is, if you are serving a

15   sentence of longer than a year you are eligible for good

16   time credit.     So you are earning credit as you go

17   through that first year.

18                  Congress knew then if you had have a year

19   and a day sentence, you wouldn't be actually serving a

20   full year because of the credits bringing you below the

21   year mark.     So what it does in the last sentence, it

22   says if you are in your last year and that's a partial

23   year, we prorate.     So on your 319th day you have earned

24   47 days of good time credit.              Those combined equal a

25   sentence of a year and a day, and you are out after your


                                         27

 1   319th day.   On the hypothetical -

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             There is a premise flaw

 3   there.   And that premise flaw is that you have told us

 4   that you don't earn the credit until the end of the

 5   year.

 6                MR. WALL:     Well -

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So your answer about

 8   this probation is not an answer, because it's -- your

 9   premise is not the same.

10                MR. WALL:     That's why for each full year

11   served, so for a 10-year sentence, you are right that

12   you are making a determination at the end of the year

13   for the first 8 years, but when you get to that ninth

14   year, as Justice Breyer pointed out -

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             I'm not worried about

16   sentences that are more than 2 years.                   I'm worried about

17   the prisoner who is sentenced to a year and a day.                   How

18   does that proration help that individual, since they are

19   not going to get the good time credit until they've

20   served a year?

21                MR. WALL:     So, the way this works is that

22   for the prisoner sentenced to a year and a day or

23   13 months or 14 months, because they are receiving

24   credit through that first year, their good time credit

25   brings them below a year.          They'll never serve a full


                                       28

 1   year.

 2                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Counsel, I -

 3                 MR. WALL:     And what the law -

 4                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             That's what I'm saying

 5   to you.    The whole brief says to us, they measure the

 6   entitlement to good time credit at the end of the first

 7   year.

 8                 MR. WALL:     Except for the last year or

 9   partial year.    And what the final sentence of B1 says

10   is, credit for the last year or portion of a year of the

11   term of imprisonment shall be prorated and credited

12   within the last 6 weeks.          So for the prisoner who has a

13   year and a day sentence, his sentence is literally all

14   proration.    He is just serving a partial year.

15                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             He is not going to get

16   54 days?     He's going to get -

17                 MR. WALL:     That's right.                On the 319th day

18   he has come through about nine tenths of the year, he

19   has accrued 47 days.

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             I just want to make

21   absolutely sure because I hadn't done the math forward;

22   I did the math backwards.

23                 MR. WALL:     Right.

24                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Which was the one that

25   Justice Breyer and Justice Alito set forth -

 1                MR. WALL:       Right.

 2                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Which is 54 days are

 3   earned back for each year, and you take it off the full

 4   term of imprisonment.

 5                  The -- you are representing to me that the

 6   math that is in your program statement is accomplishing

 7   that result?

 8                  MR. WALL:     Absolutely.             Which is to say when

 9   the prisoner gets to his last year, if that's a partial

10   year, he is not going to get the 54 days, he's going to

11   get some portion of the 54 days, based on what part of a

12   year he served.     And that is prorated and credited

13   within the last 6 weeks.           Now, it's normally done on the

14   release date.     So in that 9th year for the 10-year

15   prisoner -

16                JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I just interrupt with

17   one question?    If he got a total of 540 or whatever it

18   is, he should never enter the 9th year because he would

19   finish the 10-year sentence in less than 8 years.

20                  MR. WALL:     Well -

21                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Or less than 9 years,

22   rather.

23                  MR. WALL:     That's -- that's right.             540

24   wouldn't be quite 2 years, but setting that to the

25   side -

 1               JUSTICE STEVENS:             So how does he -- how does

 2   he get his 10th block of good time?                      How does he ever

 3   get it under your -

 4               MR. WALL:       Well, under the government's view

 5   he can only earn good time credit when he is actually

 6   incarcerated.    And what Petitioners are coming in and

 7   saying -

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:             Right.           I understand.     But

 9   explain to me how -- how he can get more than a year of

10   good time credit before the 10th year begins?

11                MR. WALL:      Well, so, if you take a 10-year

12   prisoner -- a prisoner with a 10-year sentence, the way

13   it currently works, at the end of the 8th year he has

14   accrued 432 days of good time credit.

15                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Which is more than a year.

16                MR. WALL:      Right.         So he knocked off his

17   full 10th year and he's knocked off a part of his 9th

18   year.   Now we are at that final 9th year, which is a

19   prorated year.    He has got 298 days left and by the

20   260th day he earned 38 days of credit.                      So he is

21   released after the 260th day of his 9th year.

22                And as Justice Breyer pointed out, that

23   precisely tracks the language of the statute.                      You do it

24   at the end of each full year until you get to the last

25   partial year, and then you prorate and you do it in the

 1   last 6 weeks.

 2                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And each of those 4 years

 3   included 54 days of credit?

 4                  MR. WALL:     That's right.                So the -- the

 5   Petitioners here, Petitioner Barber, for instance, has

 6   been incarcerated for over 17 years.                      At the end of each

 7   of his 17 years in prison, he has gotten 54 days of

 8   credit.     What Petitioner Barber is here saying is, I am

 9   going to get 3 whole years knocked off the end of my

10   sentence; I want the 54 days for those years, too.

11                  I want 54 days for every year of my sentence

12   as imposed by the court, not as served by me behind

13   bars, and that's what doesn't track the language of the

14   statute.     Because the only way you can do that, as

15   Justice Alito pointed out, is to read "year" to mean

16   311 days, and it is no answer to say, as Petitioners do,

17   well, you can do the determination whenever.                      What they

18   are saying is at the end of a 311-day period, you should

19   determine whether the prisoner gets the credit.

20                  But what the statute says is the

21   determination itself has to occur at the end of the

22   year.     So you can't fold the 54 days into the year

23   because you haven't made the determination yet.

24                  JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, I didn't understand

25   them to be saying that.          I understood them to be saying


                                         32

 1   that the determination could be made at the end of

 2   365 days, but if it's determined that the prisoner is

 3   entitled to 54 days of credit, then year 1 should be

 4   regarded as having begun on the 312th day, rather than

 5   the 366th day.

 6                MR. WALL:     I think that's right, which first

 7   it is inconsistent with the language of the statute,

 8   which says at the end of each year, so that reads "year"

 9   to be an 311-day cycle.        But it also sets up a very odd

10   system.   What happens if the prisoner misbehaves during

11   days 312 and day 365?

12                On Petitioner's approach, it seems to me,

13   the new year has started on day 312.                    Now, but take the

14   example, he says, well, you can do it on the 365th day.

15   Well, if the prisoner's misbehaved on day 340, is that

16   coming out of the first year or out of the second year.

17                JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, I think that they

18   would say you won't know when the second year has begun

19   until the full calendar year has been completed.

20                MR. WALL:     And I guess the -- the difficulty

21   with that approach is that it seems to me that once the

22   311-day cycle is finished, you have to start a new

23   311-day cycle on day 312.

24                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, they are just not

25   vested until the year has -- the full year has passed.

 1                 MR. WALL:       Well, so vesting is a little bit

 2   unique, Justice Kennedy, under the statute, because none

 3   of the time vests under (b)(2) until they are actually

 4   released.    But -

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, I -- I use it just

 6   in the calculating sense.

 7                  MR. WALL:      I see -- I see what you're

 8   saying.     They could do the bookkeeping determination on

 9   day 365.    But I don't think that's what's important.

10   What is important is that on Petitioner's view, the

11   second year, for credit purposes, has to start on day

12   312.   You have to have 10 blocks of 311 days and you

13   have to be measuring after every 311th day.

14                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            No, no, you don't

15   measure -- I don't think that -- you -- you begin

16   measuring on 311, but you measure 365 days from -- from

17   311.   And if he has behaved well during all -- all of

18   those 365 days, then you knock off another 51 days or

19   whatever it is.      And you begin the third year from then,

20   but you give him another 365 days to determine whether

21   he has behaved well.

22                  MR. WALL:      Justice Scalia, if you are

23   measuring 365 days from day 311 -

24                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Right.

25                  MR. WALL:      -- then you should equally be

 1   measuring 365 days from day 1.              Which is to say, if

 2   you're doing -

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:            He did.          He did.   You

 4   didn't give him the credit until he served the whole

 5   365 days.   At that point, he gets the credit and you

 6   count the second year as though it begins on day 311.

 7                MR. WALL:     Well, the -- I was half with you

 8   there.

 9                The bureau does do it by looking at what

10   they do during the full year, from January 1 to

11   December 31, and then it determines whether you get

12   54 days knocked off the end of your sentence.                     What

13   happens between day 311 and day 365 is not different

14   than what happens during the rest of the year.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Exactly.

16                MR. WALL:     What the -- what the statute asks

17   the bureau to determine is, at the end of each year,

18   has, during that year, the prisoner demonstrated

19   exemplary compliance with institutional regulations?                     So

20   the prisoner has got to go a full year, a full 365 days,

21   and be well-behaved.      Then he gets 54 days taken off the

22   back end of the sentence.          And if that's the way that

23   you're saying it should work, that is precisely how the

24   bureau interprets the statute.

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Except that they're not


                                       35

 1   taking it off from the back end.                They are taking it off

 2   from the next year.       So that in the second year, if he

 3   -- if he behaves well for 365 days from 311 -- okay?                       He

 4   behaves well for the next 365 days.                      The next year will

 5   begin at 622.

 6                 But then he has to serve another 365 days

 7   before he gets good time credit.                And then the next year

 8   will begin three times 311:             933.      And so forth.

 9                 MR. WALL:     Justice Alito, I think that sets

10   up an odd system.

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Isn't that right?          See, he

12   agrees with me.

13                 (Laughter.)

14                 No, I'm not saying that's right.                   I'm saying

15   that that's -- that is what he is proposing.

16                 MR. WALL:     No, I -- I agree.                That is the

17   difference.    Petitioners think that you measure credit

18   over these 311-day cycles, and if you -- you know, you

19   get to the 311th day, you take the 54 days of credit,

20   and together, they equal a year of the sentence imposed.

21                 But what the statute says is you make the

22   determination at the end of the year.                     And we don't read

23   "year" to be a 311-day period.               We read it to be a

24   365-day period.

25                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Yes, but as Justice Scalia


                                        36

 1   says, you know, you do make the determination on the

 2   365th day, but what you determine is that the -- having

 3   been a good prisoner, his first year expired 54 days

 4   earlier, and then you start over.

 5                 MR. WALL:      But what -- that's right.          But

 6   what the statute -- the statute doesn't just say,

 7   Justice Stevens, you make the determination at the end

 8   of the first year of the term.                The determination is

 9   that during that year, the prisoner has displayed

10   compliance.   So he has got to display compliance through

11   day 1 through day 365.

12                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Let me interrupt and get

13   one thing off my mind that I just -- supposing he

14   misbehaves in year 3.        Does that just affect his good

15   time credits in year 3, or does it mean he is canceled

16   for years 1 and 2?

17                 MR. WALL:      No.       He can lose credit that he

18   has accrued up to that point, but he can't lose credit

19   that he has -- that he is eligible for in future years.

20   So let's say that we are coming up on the end of the 3rd

21   year.   He's earned his full 108 days for his first two

22   years, and he has earned some prorated portion.                 He can

23   lose any of that, but he is still eligible going forward

24   to keep getting 54 days at the end of each year.

25                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            But he can lose his


                                         37

 1   108 days?

 2               MR. WALL:       Yes.

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 How can he do that?

 4   I'm looking at page 14A of your appendix.                  It says:

 5   Such credit toward service of sentence vests at the time

 6   that it is received.      Credit that is vested may not

 7   later be withdrawn.

 8               MR. WALL:       I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.             I

 9   should have been more clear.

10               For prisoners sentenced subject to the SRA,

11   which was in effect from 1987 to 1994, you are right.

12   And that is the SRA according to your brief.

13               Their credit vests.              That vesting

14   requirement was eliminated in the PLRA, which governs

15   prisoner's sentences since 1986.              So for the vast bulk

16   of prisoners in the Federal system who are subject to

17   the PLRA, their credit does not vest until they are

18   released.

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Wall, the -- if we

20   consider both methods plausible, the number comes out at

21   15 percent -- 85 percent, 15 percent.                  It's a more

22   workable number, and there are some hints in the

23   legislative history that Congress thought 85 percent,

24   not 87.2 or whatever it is.

25               So in choosing between those two methods,


                                      38

 1   why not take the easier number to work with?

 2               MR. WALL:       Well, two reasons.           I think to

 3   the extent that you are suggesting the statute is

 4   ambiguous, the Bureau of Prisons is charged by Congress

 5   with administering the statute in both Reno v. Koray and

 6   Lopez v. Davis.    This Court deferred to the bureau's

 7   interpretation of other prisoner credit statutes.                We

 8   think the bureau is equally entitled to the same

 9   discretion here to interpret this statute.

10               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             We -- if we disagree with

11   that, if we disagree that the BOP has authority in this

12   area, then -- as Justice Ginsburg's question, I think,

13   suggests -- does not the Rule of Lenity apply?

14               MR. WALL:       Well, this Court's been clear -

15   and I -- I can't put it any better than Justice

16   Sotomayor did in her first opinion in Sash -- that this

17   is not a criminal statute.            It neither imposes a

18   criminal prohibition on conduct nor -

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, how do you explain

20   the Granderson case?

21               MR. WALL:       I'm sorry?

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             The Granderson case.

23               MR. WALL:       I'm not familiar with that case,

24   Justice Kennedy.

25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I had thought that in that


                                        39

 1   case, Justice Ginsburg, for this Court, established the

 2   proposition that the Rule of Lenity is applicable.                     I

 3   know it wasn't cited in the Petitioner's brief, either.

 4   That was a parole revocation case.

 5                 But in -- in any event, the -- shouldn't the

 6   Rule of Lenity apply?       If the Rule of Lenity is thought

 7   of as a notice requirement insofar as giving you warning

 8   to what conduct is punishable, that's one thing, but

 9   doesn't the Rule of Lenity mean more than that?                     It's a

10   check against the power of the State, so that you simply

11   mitigate the -- the power of the State in favor of the

12   individual.   In a case like this, apply the Rule of

13   Lenity.

14                 MR. WALL:     I think it's a check against the

15   power of the State when it's penalizing conduct or when

16   it's putting forth a penalty for a criminal prohibition.

17   But in both Koray and Lopez, this Court was considering

18   what prisoner credit statutes meant, other prisoner

19   credit statutes.    18 U.S.C. 3585 and 3621.                And in both

20   of those, it deferred to the bureau's interpretation.

21   And in both, it specifically rejected application of the

22   Rule of Lenity.

23                 And I think the notion there is that this

24   statute is not a criminal statute.                  It's about an

25   administrative reward for compliance with institutional


                                        40

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   regulations.   And that's different from setting forth a

 2   prohibition on conduct where the penalty that someone is

 3   sentenced to by a court once they have been convicted of

 4   a criminal offense -

 5               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, the Granderson case

 6   is cited in the brief for the National Association Of

 7   Criminal Defense Lawyers, and as I read it, it applies

 8   to this area and it seems to me that it ought to.

 9               I mean, you tell us this is not a criminal

10   statute.   I -- I certainly think it has -- it has all

11   the impact and force of the State detaining a person for

12   a criminal act.

13               MR. WALL:      Well, it is a statute that

14   determines in some sense how long you will be in prison,

15   so I take your point.      But it does so not by extending

16   the penalty applicable to the conduct, but by offering

17   an administrative reward; sort of relieving you of part

18   of the burden of that -- that penalty.

19               And I am not aware of any case -- and I am

20   obviously not familiar with Granderson, but I am not

21   aware of any case from this Court, or indeed any lower

22   court, finding that section 3624 is a criminal statute,

23   as this Court's cases uses the term.

24               JUSTICE STEVENS:            No, but isn't there

25   another consideration?       It's not the Rule of Lenity, but


                                       41

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   it's something else we should take into account.

 2               In the -- in their reply brief, they say it

 3   costs about 25 or $26,000 to house a particular

 4   prisoner, and the number of prisoners involved is -

 5   something like $100 million in taxpayers' money is at

 6   issue in this case.     It -- is -- you don't disagree with

 7   that general figure, do you?

 8               MR. WALL:       I'm -- I think the basis for that

 9   is just math that the Petitioners have done.                   I don't

10   have any independent basis for confirming or denying it.

11               JUSTICE STEVENS:           But in any event, it's

12   clear it's a lot of money.          And -- and is that not a

13   factor that we should be aware of in this case, because,

14   all other things being equal -- assume the statute is

15   totally ambiguous, and if you -- if one -- one -- one

16   version will save the -- the government $100 million a

17   year and the other version will cost it, is that -

18   isn't that a factor we -- we should take into

19   consideration?

20               MR. WALL:       I think it's a factor that the

21   bureau could, should and has taken into consideration in

22   the developing its interpretation as the agency in

23   charge of administering the statute.                   But what the

24   bureau has found is that it's method allows you to earn

25   good time for all the time you are incarcerated, so you


                                      42

 1   always have incentive to follow prison regulations.

 2                 And what Petitioners haven't responded to

 3   and the government's point in our brief that if you

 4   start measuring by 311-day cycles, you are assuming that

 5   they getting the full 54 days of credit.                   And to the

 6   extent that they don't, no matter how they calculate it,

 7   Justice Scalia, no matter what their matter of

 8   bookkeeping is, if they don't get the 54 days of credit

 9   for each cycle, there will be some corresponding period

10   at the end of the sentence when they are serving time

11   and they have already had their ten -- you know, their

12   reviews and they are no longer eligible for the -

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:           That's true.        But the

14   strongest argument -- I -- I don't want to put words in

15   his mouth because this is complicated.                   But I see it as

16   this.   Let's call that time you are talking about, that

17   tenth year, phantom time.

18                 MR. WALL:     Okay.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Now, you are saying don't

20   put in any phantom time.          And he's saying let's put some

21   in.

22                 Now, the strong -- a strong argument, I

23   think, for his is the following -- think about that

24   first year.    That first year we are going to calculate

25   54 days, subtract it, everybody seems to agree we get to


                                        43

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the number 311, right?

 2                  But if you were to apply the last sentence

 3   to that first year, the prorating sentence, you wouldn't

 4   get 54.     You would get like 45 days, or 47 or something

 5   like that.     But everybody agrees under the Bureau of

 6   Prisons system that it is 54.               And, therefore, in

 7   respect to the first year, they are calculating phantom

 8   time, i.e., not the first year, but a person who had a

 9   sentence to a year and a day.               If you had a sentence to

10   a year and a day, you agree it's 54 days, and everybody

11   agrees with that, and that includes phantom time.

12                  So he said, well, if you include it for the

13   first year, since the statute says nothing about the

14   first year, why not include it for the other years, too?

15   How can you possibly justify phantom time being included

16   in the first year but not in the other years?

17                  MR. WALL:     Justice Breyer, I disagree with

18   your premise.     Someone sentenced to a year and a day is

19   eligible for credit, but because that person is accruing

20   credit as he serves, he will never actually get 54 days.

21   By the time he gets to the 319th day, he has accrued

22   47 days of credit, those combine to equal his 366-day

23   sentence.

24                  JUSTICE BREYER:           So, in other words, they

25   don't let him out under 311?


                                         44

 1               MR. WALL:      That's -- that's exactly -

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:            In other words, the Bureau

 3   of Prisons for a person whose has a sentence of a year

 4   and a day does not let him out 54 days short, rather

 5   they let him out 47 days short, because they apply the

 6   last sentence in the prorating of that sentence?

 7                MR. WALL:     And that's exactly our difference

 8   with Petitioner's view.        Exactly.          What Petitioner -

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:            Is that -- is that what

10   happens?

11                MR. WALL:     Yes.        Yes.      He is released after

12   the 319th day.

13                And I think what Petitioners actually want

14   is phantom time even in the first year.                 What they are

15   saying is fine, he may only serve 311 days, 312 days,

16   319 days, we want the full 54.              So, instead of letting

17   him out at 319, back him up to 312, we want the phantom

18   week in the first year.

19                And, so, I think the way the bureau

20   interprets it, there is no phantom time in any year.

21   The way the Petitioners interpret it, there is phantom

22   time in every year, no matter the length of the

23   sentence.   As I said I think it creates a gap in

24   coverage.   It rests on this assumption that prisoners

25   are always getting 54 days.            That is just not the case.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Do you disagree with your

 2   colleague that that is the case most of the time, that

 3   most Federal prisoners get good time credit, and of the

 4   ones who get credit, most of them get the full 54 days?

 5               MR. WALL:       There are no statistics on this,

 6   but, yes, Justice Ginsburg, I think the majority of

 7   prisoners do earn the full credit, certainly these

 8   Petitioners have.    But I would say that there are, say,

 9   15 to 20 percent Federal prisoner who tend to be repeat

10   offenders, and they are often being docked to good time

11   credit.

12               So, I think what you will see is that the

13   ones getting 54 days do it consistently, and the ones

14   not getting 54 days, often do that pretty consistently.

15   And, you know, the difficulty on Petitioner's method is

16   that no matter when you want to do that calculation,

17   Petitioners at bottom are saying what you should be

18   looking at is a 311-day period, and you take the

19   311 days served, you take the 54 days of credit, and

20   together they give you a year of the sentence imposed.

21               And not only does that not serve penological

22   interest, as the bureau has found, but it just doesn't

23   track the language of the statute, which says during

24   each year you have got to comply with the regulations.

25   The statute cares not just about your conduct from days

 1   1 to 311, but your conduct from day 312 to 365.                  All of

 2   those days are equal in the statute's eyes.                   If you want

 3   54 days of credit knocked off the back end of your

 4   sentence, you have got to behave and comply with the

 5   rules for a full year each time you want the credit.

 6                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Counsel, this

 7   explanation that has been given in your brief and the

 8   one you are giving to us now as to why BOP chose what it

 9   did, is there any statement outside of the penned

10   affidavit that explains why this choice was made?

11                  MR. WALL:     Other than the positions -

12   positions that the bureau has taken before the 11 courts

13   of appeals in which it has prevails, no, the -

14                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But in each one of them

15   they have taken the position that the statute was

16   unambiguous.     Assuming that that is not accepted by us,

17   that it's ambiguous, what and where are we giving

18   Chevron or Skidmore deference to what set of facts or to

19   what -

20                  MR. WALL:     Two points, Justice Sotomayor.             I

21   don't think the bureau has always taken the position

22   that the statute is unambiguous.                 It has taken the

23   fallback position, and it has prevailed on this position

24   in a number of courts of appeals.                  And it is worth

25   pointing out the bureau has prevailed in the First

 1   through the Eleventh Circuits.                It has won in 11 court

 2   of appeals.     And it has often prevailed on the ground

 3   that it had discretion to interpret the statute to the

 4   extended it was ambiguous.

 5                  Your second point, what would you defer

 6   to -

 7                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Well, did they exercise

 8   discretion when they took the position that it was

 9   unambiguous?

10                  MR. WALL:     As the pen declaration makes

11   clear, and this is at page 154 of the Joint Appendix,

12   when the bureau promulgated its rule in 1997, it did

13   that based on the statutory language and on making a

14   policy choice to accommodate penological interest,

15   ensuring that credit would always be an incentive to

16   good behavior and providing clear notice to inmates of

17   their projected release dates.                So, I think -- you know,

18   the government has -

19                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             We have never given

20   deference, have we, to an affidavit submitted in

21   litigation to explain something that on its face is not

22   explained either in an agency's regulation or in its

23   policy statement that -- that -- this is giving

24   deference to an affidavit.

25                  MR. WALL:     Well, it's giving deference to


                                         48

 1   the rule, because the affidavit informs the court that

 2   the rule is an exercise of the bureau's discretion.                    So

 3   far as I know, the court has never faced that question

 4   but the lower courts have.          And a number of courts of

 5   appeals faced with rulemaking and informal adjudication

 6   have accepted supplementation of the record with

 7   affidavits and declarations very much like this one.

 8   Because what we are talking about here is an affidavit

 9   from one of the agency's original decisionmakers.

10               If this was just a post hyperactualization,

11   I grant you it might not be enough.                    But this is one of

12   the bureau's lawyers involved in the decisionmaking in

13   the mid-1980's coming in and saying, here is why we

14   adopted the interpretation -

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Subsequent legislative

16   history, so to speak, right?

17               (Laughter.)

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:           I mean, we -- we wouldn't

19   allow that -- those of us who use legislative history

20   don't allow a congressman to come in several years after

21   the bill has passed and say, oh, by the way, the reason

22   we voted for that is thus and such.                    We would kick that

23   out.

24               Why is it any different for an agency's

25   subsequent statement?

 1                MR. WALL:     Justice Scalia, I think it is

 2   different because that would be broadside in Overton

 3   Park.   And what this Court said is if there is not

 4   enough in the agency action itself to enable judicial

 5   review, the right answer is not to set it aside, the

 6   right answer is to send it back to the agency to let the

 7   agency decision makers explain why they did what they

 8   did.

 9                And while that might normally be the right

10   course here, the agency has already done that.                     It has

11   put forward its explanation, so I think this is one of

12   the rare circumstances where we don't need to remand on

13   Overton Park.   We know why the agency adopted the rule,

14   and it did it both because of the statutory language and

15   because they thought it was the most sensible policy

16   choice.

17                And I guess I would turn it around a little

18   bit and say you have a rule promulgated by the agency

19   charged with administering the statute, an agency to

20   which this Court has twice deferred in the

21   interpretation of similar statutes.                     That rule has been

22   upheld as a substantive matter now in 11 courts of

23   appeals.

24                The Ninth Circuit set the rule aside on a

25   procedural basis, which has now been corrected by the


                                       50

 1   agency.     It's a republished rule which corrects the

 2   infirmities that the court of appeals identified.

 3                 And, so, the question is, faced with those

 4   facts, what would be the point of asking the government

 5   to recalculate 195,000 Federal sentences?

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't think we sent cases

 7   back under Overton Park for an agency's description of

 8   history.    I think we sent it back for the agency to give

 9   a reason for its rule, whether that's its current reason

10   or its past reason.       It -- it's the current reason that

11   counts.

12                 MR. WALL:      Justice Scalia, even -- even if

13   you thought as the court of appeals did that the rule

14   was procedurally invalid, you would still, as the court

15   of appeals did, defer to the program statement under

16   some level of deference, at least Skidmore.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            You don't have to worry

18   about me.

19                 (Laughter.)

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I'm -- I'm willing to

21   accept the -- the government's assertion here that

22   that's the government's position.

23                 MR. WALL:      And I -

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't think you are

25   lying.

 1                 MR. WALL:     I -- I -

 2                 (Laughter.)

 3                 MR. WALL:     My only point, Justice Scalia,

 4   was that whether you get there by deferring to the rule

 5   or by deferring to the program statement, as the court

 6   of appeals did, every court of appeals to consider it

 7   has come out in the same place, which is that by hook or

 8   by crook, the bureau has exercised its discretion to

 9   answer this question.       And I -

10                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           You say there are 195,000

11   sentences affected by this rule.                I don't know which way

12   that cuts.    If there are 195,000 people spending more

13   time in -- you know, significantly more time in jail

14   than they should, that's kind of troublesome.

15                 MR. WALL:     Justice Stevens, I think what I

16   would say is the bureau has been doing it the same way

17   since 1987.    Congress has amended this statute five

18   times in the last 20 years.             It has never moved to alter

19   the bureau's methods.

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But the cumulated -

21                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Probably they didn't

22   understand it because it's an awfully hard statute to

23   understand.

24                 MR. WALL:     Justice Stevens, with all

25   respect, Justice Breyer got it in the first 5 minutes.

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   So I think the -

 2                 (Laughter.)

 3                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Well, he's a lot smarter

 4   than I am.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Even Justice Breyer has got

 6   it!   Whoa!

 7                 (Laughter.)

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But what -- what we

 9   were -- what we were saying, is this is 36,000 years of

10   prisoner time, I mean -- 36,000, that is older than

11   Marbury versus Madison.

12                 MR. WALL:     Justice Kennedy, that's true.            I

13   think the point is that the language of the statute has

14   remained unchanged, and for the last 20 years the bureau

15   has interpreted that in a reasonable way.                 The language

16   is unambiguous, but even if it weren't, at least the

17   bureau's interpretation is reasonable, which is why 11

18   courts of appeals have deferred to it.

19                 And so I take your point that they are

20   serving more time than under Petitioner's

21   interpretation, but I don't think that that policy

22   rationale is properly before this Court.                 It is properly

23   before the bureau, which has found that policy

24   consideration outweighed by other penological interests,

25   and I think that's the judgment to which this Court


                                        53

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   should defer, not its own judgment about how much time

 2   these prisoners should -- should be serving.

 3               And I do think it's important in that regard

 4   that Congress has returned the statute several times.

 5   And I take your point that it is complicated, Justice

 6   Stevens, but -

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  You can finish

 8   the -

 9               MR. WALL:       -- but Congress has made a number

10   of technical amendments and I don't think there is any

11   evidence it did not understand of how this longstanding

12   system works.

13               Thank you.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, Mr. Wall.

17                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

18               MR. SADY:       Thank you.

19               The -- the idea that there could be time at

20   the end of the sentences is premised on "term of

21   imprisonment" mean "time served," which it cannot mean

22   in the same sentence where it says "beyond time served."

23               If you make the adjustment for good time

24   credit that is earned at the end of the year, it is

25   credit towards the service of the sentence; that means

 1   that it's blocks of 365 days, that at the last day of

 2   Mr. Barber's sentence if it's properly computed, he

 3   would be looking at 365 days.               If he behaved well until

 4   close to the end, if we go to the last statute that says

 5   prorate the remaining period of time, the 30 -

 6   remaining 36 days he could earn, and credit it in the

 7   last 6 weeks, because they are doing that simply as an

 8   administrative technique.

 9                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Just so -- in your

10   system they do the measurement at the end of the

11   365 days.   He misbehaves on the 340th day.                     And they say

12   for that reason, I'm only going to give you 10 days of

13   full time -- of good time credit.

14                MR. SADY:       Yes.

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So now your year starts

16   at 350?

17                MR. SADY:       355.        Yes.

18                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               No, they said they are

19   only giving you 10 days of good time credit.                      Because at

20   the end of -- 355.

21                MR. SADY:       Right.         And so the 355 -

22               (Laughter.)

23                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               That was pretty bad.

25                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               355.        Now, your year

 1   starts again on 355 days -

 2                MR. SADY:     365, and if he behaves very badly

 3   he has to go all the way to the end of that 365 and

 4   doesn't get any adjustment, but if he -- next year he

 5   starts all over again for 365 days, and if he is very

 6   good he gets the 54 days.

 7                If I could address the question that was

 8   raised by Justice Ginsburg on the Rule of Lenity.             I

 9   would like to point out that in the -- we have relied on

10   both R.L.C. and in -- on Granderson for your

11   articulation of the Rule of Lenity as it would apply in

12   this case.   Which, if after we're looking at all the

13   other -- the statute, the history, the context, and if

14   we cannot -- if we apply the Rule of Lenity, if the

15   government's position cannot be shown to be

16   unambiguously correct, we have at least ambiguity here,

17   and then we go to Chief Justice Marshall's seminal

18   discussion of lenity.

19                And what he said was that we look at lenity

20   for the proposition -- to back the principle that the

21   power of punishment belongs to the legislative

22   department; and the tenderness of the law for the rights

23   of individuals, both of -

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But the argument -- one

25   of the arguments is it is not punishment at all.             This

 1   is a reward; this is a reward for good behavior.

 2               MR. SADY:     The Court in -- in Lynce and in

 3   Weaver used the term "increase in punishment" when there

 4   was no longer available good time credit.                For -- to say

 5   that somebody has to serve 87.2 percent of the term of

 6   imprisonment imposed by the judge instead of 85 percent,

 7   that is imprisonment.

 8               For Mr. Barber that's over 6 months'

 9   additional time behind bars in a prison.                That's -
