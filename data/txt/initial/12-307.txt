 4   argument this morning in Case 12-307, United

 5   States v. Windsor, and we will begin with the

 6   jurisdictional discussion.

 8                ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICKI C. JACKSON

 9        ON BEHALF OF THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE

10                MS. JACKSON:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11   please the Court:

12                There is no justiciable case before this

13   Court.   Petitioner, the United States, does not ask this

14   Court to redress the injuries it asserts.                       The House of

15   Representatives' Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, the

16   BLAG, which does seek redress in the form of reversal,

17   asserts no judicially cognizable injury.

18                While it is natural to want to reach the

19   merits of such a significant issue, as in Raines v.

20   Byrd, this natural urge must be put aside because

21   however important the constitutional question, Article

22   III prevents its decision here and requires this Court

23   to await another case, another day, to decide the

24   question.

25                In the district court, Ms. Windsor alleged

                                         5

 1   classical Article III injury for which she sought

 2   redress.    Other persons injured by DOMA's operation

 3   could likewise sue in a first instance court and, if

 4   their challenge succeeds, obtain relief.                  But to

 5   exercise jurisdiction on this appeal when the United

 6   States asked for the judgment below, fully agrees with

 7   it, and -

 8                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Who else is going to be

 9   aggrieved if she is not?            Meaning another person who

10   is -- whose benefits are withheld, tax refund is

11   withheld, is going to be in an identical situation to

12   her?    Who else could come in?

13                  MS. JACKSON:         Your Honor, it is possible

14   that in district courts where other taxpayers sue the

15   United States on similar relief, that the district

16   courts will rule differently.                 At least one district

17   court that I'm aware of, in a case called

18   Louie v. Holder, ruled against -- upheld DOMA even

19   though the government had switched its position at that

20   time.

21                  In addition, the issue of DOMA -

22                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Excuse me.     If there is no

23   jurisdiction here, why was there jurisdiction at the

24   trial level?

25                  MS. JACKSON:         Your Honor -

                                         6

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I mean, the government

 2   comes in and says "I agree" -- or if there was

 3   jurisdiction, why did the Court ever have to get to the

 4   merits?

 5               If you have a, let's say, a lawsuit on an -

 6   on an indebtedness and the alleged debtor comes in and

 7   says, yes, I owe them money, but I'm just not gonna pay

 8   it, which is the equivalent of the government saying,

 9   yes, it's unconstitutional but I'm going to enforce it

10   anyway.

11               What would happen in that -- in that

12   indebtedness suit is that the court would enter judgment

13   and say, if you agree that you owe it, by God, you

14   should pay it.   And there would be a judgment right

15   there without any consideration of the merits, right?

16   Why didn't that happen here?

17               MS. JACKSON:          Your Honor, the -- the two

18   questions that you asked me, why did the district court

19   have jurisdiction, the first answer is that the party

20   invoking the district court's jurisdiction was Ms.

21   Windsor, who did have an injury.

22               As to why the district court didn't enter

23   judgment when the United States switched its position,

24   I -- I imagine that the Court was -- would have wanted

25   to have development of that issue, which was achieved

                                       7

 1   through the intervention of the BLAG in the trial court,

 2   so that the judgment of unconstitutionality and of

 3   refund would have had a robust hearing as it did.

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:              Really, that's very

 5   peculiar.   When -- when both parties to the case agree

 6   on what the law is?       What, the -- just for fun, the

 7   district judge is -- is going to have a hearing?

 8                MS. JACKSON:           Well, Your Honor, the

 9   jurisdiction of the Court, it seems to me, is not

10   affected by the length of the proceedings it undertook.

11   In Kentucky -

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:              I'm not talking about

13   jurisdiction now.     I'm talking about why the district

14   court, without getting to the merits, should not have

15   entered judgment against the government.

16                MS. JACKSON:           I am not sure I have a

17   wonderful answer to that question, Justice Scalia, but I

18   do think the case bears some similarities to Kentucky v.

19   Indiana, which was discussed by the parties, where

20   Kentucky sued Indiana in this Court's original

21   jurisdiction on a contract.               The two States had a

22   contract.   Indiana agreed it was obligated to perform,

23   but it wasn't performing.             There -- it was worried about

24   a State court lawsuit.          This Court exercised original

25   jurisdiction to give Kentucky relief.                    And I think

                                         8

 1   that's analogous to what the district court did there.

 2                The issue before us today, I think, is an

 3   issue of appellate jurisdiction.                  And the U.S. is

 4   seeking to invoke the appellate jurisdiction of Article

 5   III courts, notwithstanding that it doesn't seek relief,

 6   it seeks affirmance.

 7                JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, the Solicitor

 8   General's standing argument is very abstract.                  But here

 9   is one possible way of understanding it, perhaps the

10   Solicitor General will disavow it, but it would go like

11   this.   The President's position in this case is that he

12   is going to continue to enforce DOMA, engage in conduct

13   that he believes is unconstitutional, until this Court

14   tells him to stop.

15                The judgment of the Second Circuit told the

16   Executive Branch to comply with the Equal Protection

17   Clause immediately.      The President disagrees with the

18   temporal aspect of that, so the Executive is aggrieved

19   in the sense that the Executive is ordered to do

20   something prior to the point when the Executive believes

21   it should do that thing.

22                Now, wouldn't that be sufficient to make -

23   to create injury in the Executive and render the

24   Executive an aggrieved party?

25                MS. JACKSON:         I think not, Your Honor.          I

                                       9

 1   think not because I don't see how that would be any

 2   different from any party saying, well, we really don't

 3   want to pay this judgment until we're sure all of the

 4   courts agree.   And I think this Court's -- this Court

 5   doesn't have a lot of case law where a party seeks

 6   review to get affirmance.

 7                But in the Princeton University v. Schmidt

 8   case, there was a State court conviction, high State

 9   court overturns it, Princeton University seeks review

10   because its regulations were at issue.                   New Jersey joins

11   in seeking review, but does not ask for relief, does not

12   take a position on what relief would be appropriate.

13                JUSTICE BREYER:              Why -- why wouldn't -

14   imagine -- there in Article II, it says that the

15   President shall take care that the laws be faithfully

16   executed.   So the President has worked out -- I,

17   personally, and for reasons in -- in my department,

18   others think that this law is unconstitutional, but I

19   have this obligation.         And because I have this

20   obligation, I will not -- I will continue to execute

21   this law.   I will continue to execute it though I

22   disagree with it.     And I execute it until I have an

23   authoritative determination not to.

24                Now, how is that different from a trustee

25   who believes that he has an obligation to a trust to do

                                        10

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   something under a certain provision that he thinks

 2   doesn't require that, but -- you know, there's a debate

 3   about it, but he says, I have the obligation here.                  I'm

 4   going to follow this through.

 5                  There'd be standing in the second case for

 6   any fiduciary, despite his personal beliefs, to

 7   continue.     We'd understand that and say there was

 8   standing.     Why don't we here?

 9                  MS. JACKSON:         Well, the trustee, I think,

10   would be able to go to a court of first instance to get

11   an adjudication of the claim.                 What I'm submitting to

12   you that the trustee could not do, after getting the

13   first -- the judgment in the court of first instance

14   stating what the remedy -- what the liability is, then

15   seek review of that judgment, but ask only for it to be

16   affirmed.

17                  JUSTICE BREYER:            And that's the part I don't

18   understand.     For -- if, in fact, as you agree, the

19   trustee or other fiduciary in my example would indeed

20   have standing to act according to the law, even though

21   he thinks that that law is unconstitutional because of

22   his obligation such as under Section 2.                  You agree he

23   has the -- he has -- there is standing when he goes into

24   court in the first place, which surely he could

25   interpret Article II as saying and you follow it through

                                        11

 1   as long as you can do it, which includes appeals until

 2   the matter is determined finally and authoritatively by

 3   a court.    If you could do the first, what suddenly stops

 4   you from doing the second?

 5                 MS. JACKSON:         In the first instance, the

 6   obligations are uncertain the trustee is presumably

 7   subject to potentially adverse competing claims on his

 8   or her action.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, I would have

10   thought -

11                 MS. JACKSON:         Those are -

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I would have thought

13   your answer would be that the Executive's obligation to

14   execute the law includes the obligation to execute the

15   law consistent with the Constitution.                      And if he has

16   made a determination that executing the law by enforcing

17   the terms is unconstitutional, I don't see why he

18   doesn't have the courage of his convictions and execute

19   not only the statute, but do it consistent with his view

20   of the Constitution, rather than saying, oh, we'll wait

21   till the Supreme Court tells us we have no choice.

22                 MS. JACKSON:         Mr. Chief Justice, I think

23   that's a hard question under Article II.                      But I think

24   the Article III questions that this Court is facing turn

25   on what the parties in the case have alleged, what

                                       12

 1   relief they're seeking, and what the posture is.

 2                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             In Federal court's

 3   jurisprudence, are you saying there's a lack of

 4   adversity here?

 5                  MS. JACKSON:         I am saying primarily -

 6                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Can you give us a

 7   pigeonhole?

 8                  MS. JACKSON:         I -- it's a little difficult

 9   because the circumstance is unusual, Justice Kennedy,

10   but I think the most apt of the doctrines, although they

11   are overlapping and reinforce each other, the most apt

12   is standing.

13                  This Court has made clear that a party on

14   appeal has to meet the same Article III standing

15   requirements of injury caused by the action complained

16   of and redressable by the relief requested by the

17   parties.

18                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But it seems to me

19   there -- there's injury here.

20                  MS. JACKSON:         Well, Your Honor, I do not

21   agree that the injuries alleged by the United States

22   should be cognizable by the Article III courts because

23   those injuries are exactly what it asked the courts

24   below to -- to produce.           But even if we treat the

25   injuries as sufficiently alleged, Article III requires

 1   that the party complaining of injury ask the court to

 2   remedy that injury.    And that's a very important

 3   requirement, I think, under Article III for several

 4   reasons.

 5               The idea of the case or controversy

 6   limitation, as I understand it, is part of a broader

 7   separation of powers picture, to make sure the Federal

 8   courts perform their proper role.                     Their proper role is

 9   the redress of injury.       And it is the need to redress

10   injury in ordinary litigation that justifies judicial

11   review of constitutional issues.                 But -

12               JUSTICE KAGAN:            But, Ms. Jackson, I mean, to

13   go back to Justice Kennedy's point, we have injury here

14   in the most classic, most concrete sense.                     There's

15   $300,000 that's going to come out of the government's

16   treasury if this decision is upheld, and it won't if it

17   isn't.

18               Now, the government is willing to pay that

19   $300,000, would be happy to pay that $300,000.                     But

20   whether the government is happy or sad to pay that

21   $300,000, the government is still paying the $300,000,

22   which in the usual set of circumstances is the classic

23   Article III injury.

24               Why isn't it here?

25               MS. JACKSON:         Justice Kagan, there is a

                                     14

 1   three-prong test.     Even if you treat that as injury, it

 2   does not meet the requirements for standing on appeal

 3   because the government has not asked this Court to

 4   remedy that injury.       The government has not asked this

 5   Court to overturn the rulings below so it doesn't have

 6   to pay the $365,000.        It has asked this Court to affirm.

 7   And the case or controversy requirements that we're

 8   talking about are nested in an adversarial system where

 9   we rely on the parties to state their injuries and make

10   their claims for relief.

11               If the government or any party is not bound

12   with respect to standing by its articulated request for

13   a remedy, what that does is it enables the Court to fill

14   in, to reshape.     And for a doctrine that is supposed to

15   be limiting the occasions for judicial review of

16   constitutionality, that is troubling.

17               JUSTICE KAGAN:               But don't we often separate

18   those two things, ask whether there's injury for Article

19   III purposes and causation and redressability, as you

20   say, but then say, well, sometimes when all of those are

21   met, there's not going to be adequate presentation of

22   the arguments, and so we will appoint an amicus or we'll

23   restructure things?       And we do that when the government

24   confesses error often.          I mean, we do that several times

25   a year in this courtroom.

 1                MS. JACKSON:          Yes, Your Honor.             But

 2   concession of error cases, with respect, are quite

 3   different because in concession of error cases typically

 4   both parties at the appellate level end up being adverse

 5   to the judgment below and they are asking relief from

 6   this Court from the judgment below.

 7                But here we have a situation where, putting

 8   BLAG to one side for the moment, between the United

 9   States and Ms. Windsor there is no adversity, they're in

10   agreement, and neither of them is asking this Court to

11   reverse or modify the judgment below.                      And so I think

12   the confession of error cases are quite different from

13   the perspective of Article III.

14                JUSTICE BREYER:             No, they're -- they're not

15   in agreement about whether to pay the money or not.

16   They are in agreement about what arguments are correct

17   legal arguments.   And I can't think of a case other than

18   the sham cases which -- which this isn't, where -- where

19   you would find no standing or other obstacle.                         And I can

20   think of one case, which you haven't mentioned, namely,

21   Chadha, which seems about identical.

22                MS. JACKSON:          Your Honor, I don't think that

23   Chadha is identical, with respect.                      In -- for two main

24   reasons.   In Chadha, the Court was, I think, quite

25   careful to avoid deciding whether the United States had

                                       16

 1   Article III standing.        It intensively analyzed a

 2   statute, since repealed, 1252, which gave this Court

 3   mandatory jurisdiction in cases in which a Federal

 4   statute was held unconstitutional and the U.S. was a

 5   party.   And it framed its analysis of whether the

 6   statute permitted the appeal.                What I think was -- oh,

 7   may I reserve my time for rebuttal?

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    You can finish your

 9   sentence.

10                 MS. JACKSON:         Thank you.

11                 What was -- what was going on there was the

12   Court said, well, the statute wanted to reach very

13   broadly, perhaps implicit, not stated, perhaps more

14   broadly than Article III.

15                 Congress said whenever you have this

16   configuration, you go up to the Supreme Court.                      Then the

17   Supreme Court in Chadha says, of course, in addition to

18   the statute, there must be Article III case or

19   controversy, the presence of the congressional

20   intervenors here provides it.                And that -

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

22   That was more than a sentence.

23                 MS. JACKSON:         Oh, I'm sorry.             I'm sorry,

24   Your Honor.    Thank you.

 1                ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN

 2                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER,

 3                     SUPPORTING AFFIRMANCE

 4               MR. SRINIVASAN:            Thank you,

 5   Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

 6               This Court has jurisdiction in this case

 7   based on the petition filed by the United States for the

 8   same reasons it had jurisdiction in parallel

 9   circumstances in Chadha and Lovett.                    There are two

10   issues that have been -- that have been brought up this

11   morning and I'd like to address each in turn.

12               One is whether there's a concrete case or

13   controversy -- case or controversy in the sense of

14   adversity in this Court.         And the second is the question

15   of whether there's Article III standing for the

16   government to bring this case before the Court.

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    On the first one, is

18   there any case where all the parties agreed with the

19   decision below and we upheld appellate jurisdiction?

20   Any case?

21               MR. SRINIVASAN:            Where the parties agreed -

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    All the parties

23   agreed with the decision below and we nonetheless upheld

24   appellate jurisdiction.

25               MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, you didn't speak to

                                     18

 1   it in Lovett, Your Honor, but that was the circumstance

 2   in Lovett.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      No, it wasn't

 4   raised -- it wasn't raised or addressed, and that had

 5   the distinct situation of an appeal, direct appeal from

 6   an Article I tribunal.

 7                MR. SRINIVASAN:              Well, I don't -- I don't

 8   know that that matters because you had to satisfy

 9   Article III prerequisites to have the case in this

10   Court.   Now, Your Honor is, of course, correct that

11   the -- the Court didn't affirmatively engage on the

12   issue of jurisdiction, but that is a scenario -

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      Okay.   So putting

14   Lovett aside, since none of this was discussed, is there

15   any -- any case?

16                MR. SRINIVASAN:              No, I don't know of one.

17   But these -- but, Mr. Chief Justice, with all due

18   respect -

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      So this is totally

20   unprecedented.     You're asking us to do something we have

21   never done before to reach the issue in this case.

22                MR. SRINIVASAN:              Let me say two things about

23   that if I might, Your Honor.                First is that it's -- it's

24   unusual, but that's not at all surprising because the -

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      No, it's not just -

                                        19

 1   it's not unusual.     It's totally unprecedented.

 2                MR. SRINIVASAN:              Well, it's totally

 3   unprecedented in one respect, Your Honor.                If you look

 4   at Chadha -- okay, the second point I'd make.                  Let me

 5   make one point at the outset, though, which is that

 6   whether it's totally unusual or largely unusual, I grant

 7   you that it doesn't happen.               But the reason it doesn't

 8   happen is because -- I wouldn't confuse a numerator with

 9   a denominator.    This set of circumstances just doesn't

10   arise very often.

11                Now, it's true that when this set of

12   circumstances -

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:              It has not arisen very

14   often in the past because in the past, when I was at the

15   Office of Legal Counsel, there was an opinion of the

16   Office of Legal Counsel which says that the Attorney

17   General will defend the laws of the United States,

18   except in two circumstances.                Number one, where the

19   basis for the alleged unconstitutionality has to do with

20   presidential powers.        When the presidential powers are

21   involved, he's the lawyer for the President.                So he can

22   say, we think the statute's unconstitutional, I won't

23   defend it.

24                The second situation is where no possible

25   rational argument could be made in defense of it.                   Now,

                                        20

 1   neither of those situations exists here.                 And I'm

 2   wondering if we're living in this new world where the

 3   Attorney General can simply decide, yes, it's

 4   unconstitutional, but it's not so unconstitutional that

 5   I'm not willing to enforce it, if we're in this new

 6   world, I -- I don't want these cases like this to come

 7   before this Court all the time.

 8               And I think they will come all the time if

 9   that's -- if that's -- if that's the new regime in the

10   Justice Department that we're dealing with.

11               MR. SRINIVASAN:               Justice Scalia, one

12   recognized situation in which an act of Congress won't

13   be defended in court is when the President makes a

14   determination that the act is unconstitutional.                    That's

15   what happened here.       The President made an accountable

16   legal determination that this Act of Congress is

17   unconstitutional.

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:                But then why does he

19   enforce the statute?

20               MR. SRINIVASAN:               Well, that's an option

21   that's available to him, Justice Kennedy.                 In certain

22   circumstances, it makes sense not to enforce.                 But I

23   don't think the take-care responsibility is an all or

24   nothing proposition, such that when the President

25   reaches a determination that a statute is

                                        21

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   unconstitutional, it necessarily follows that he

 2   wouldn't enforce it.       That's not what happened in

 3   Lovett.    That's not -

 4                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But let me ask you,

 5   suppose that constitutional scholars have grave doubts

 6   about the practice of the President signing a bill, but

 7   saying that he thinks it's, unconstitutional -- what do

 8   you call it, signing statements or something like that.

 9   It seems to me that if we adopt your position that that

10   would ratify and confirm and encourage that questionable

11   practice because if the President thinks the law is

12   unconstitutional he shouldn't sign it, according to some

13   views.    And that's a lot like what you're arguing here.

14   It's very troubling.

15                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            I -- in the -- in the

16   signing statement situation, Your Honor, one example in

17   the past is Turner Broadcasting.                   In Turner

18   Broadcasting, that was a circumstance in which it was -

19   it was a veto, but in the course of the veto the

20   President made the determination that a particular

21   aspect of that statute was unconstitutional.

22                 And what happened as a result of that is

23   that the Department of Justice didn't defend that aspect

24   of the statute in litigation.                Now, a subsequent

25   President reached a contrary conclusion.                   But -- but my

                                       22

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   point is simply that when the President makes a

 2   determination that a statute is unconstitutional, it can

 3   follow that the Department of Justice won't defend it in

 4   litigation.

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Sometimes you do and

 6   sometimes you don't.       What is the test for when you

 7   think your obligation to take care that the laws be

 8   faithfully executed means you'll follow your view about

 9   whether it's constitutional or not or you won't follow

10   your view?

11                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            Mr. Chief Justice, I'd

12   hesitate to give you a black-and-white algorithm.                       There

13   are -- there are several considerations that would

14   factor into it.    One of the considerations -

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Excuse me.          It's not your

16   view.   It's the President's.              It's only when the

17   President thinks it's unconstitutional that you can

18   decline to defend it?        Or what if the Attorney General

19   thinks it's unconstitutional?

20                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            No, no.          Of course -

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Or the Solicitor General,

22   is that enough?

23                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            28 U.S.C. 530(d)

24   presupposes -- Congress presupposes that there are going

25   to be occasions in which a statute is -- is not defended

                                       23

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   because of a conclusion by the Attorney General that

 2   it's unconstitutional.

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Oh, it can be either the

 4   Attorney General or the Solicitor General?

 5               MR. SRINIVASAN:              It could be, but this is a

 6   situation in which the President made the determination.

 7   And when the President makes that determination, there

 8   are a few considerations that I think would factor into

 9   the mix in determining whether enforcement will follow.

10   One of them would be the consequences of enforcement for

11   the individuals who are affected.

12               And so, for example, I would assume that if

13   it's a criminal statute that we're talking about, an

14   enforcement would require criminal enforcement against

15   somebody and -- which would beget criminal sanctions.

16   That may be -

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:              So when Congress enacts a

18   statute, it cannot be defended, it has no assurance that

19   that statute will be defended in court, if the Solicitor

20   General, in his view, thinks it's unconstitutional?

21               MR. SRINIVASAN:              There have --

22   Justice Scalia -

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Is that right?

24               MR. SRINIVASAN:              -- there have been

25   occasions in the past.

                                       24

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yes or no?

 2                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            Yes.           Yes, it's true.   And

 3   28 U.S.C. 530(d) exactly presupposes that.                       That's the

 4   exact occasion in which that process is -- is

 5   occasioned.    Congress knew that this would happen.                      Now,

 6   it can happen also when -- in the rare instance in which

 7   the President himself makes that determination.                       And I

 8   don't think that the take-care clause responsibility has

 9   this all or nothing capacity to it.                       It can be that the

10   President decides -

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Srinivasan -

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            It's not what the OLC

13   opinion said, by the way.

14                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            It can be that the

15   President decides to enforce it.                   That's what happened

16   in Lovett and that's the course of events that was

17   sought -- that happened in Chadha.                       And there's -

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But when the

19   government -- when the -- when the case is adjudicated

20   in the first instance -- we're talking here about

21   appellate authority.

22                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            Correct.

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              The government sometimes

24   loses cases in the first instance and then it doesn't

25   appeal.   If it agrees with the result that the court

                                       25

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   reached, it doesn't appeal and then the judgment in the

 2   first instance where there was adversity is -- is the

 3   last word.     So when does the government decide, yes, we

 4   agree with the -- the adjudication in the court of first

 5   instance and so we'll leave it there?                    And when does it

 6   say, yes, we agree, but we want higher authority to

 7   participate?

 8                  MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, there are -- there

 9   are a number of considerations that could factor into

10   it, Justice Ginsburg.         You're right that either of those

11   scenarios is possible.          The reason that the government

12   appealed in this case is because the President made the

13   determination that this statute would continue to be

14   enforced, and that was out of respect for the Congress

15   that enacted the law and the President who signed it,

16   and out of respect for the role of the judiciary in

17   saying what the law is.

18                  The point of taking an appeal here is that

19   the government suffered an injury because a judgment was

20   entered against the government in the court of appeals.

21   That's a classic case for injury.

22                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Counsel, could you not

23   run out of time on the BLAG standing?                    I know we -- we

24   didn't permit Ms. Jackson to -- to address it.                    So don't

25   run out of time on that.

 1                MR. SRINIVASAN:              I -- I won't, Your Honor.

 2   I'll be happy to turn -- turn to BLAG standing.                      I would

 3   like to make a couple of points on the question of our

 4   own standing to bring the petition before the Court.

 5                And I think Justice Breyer was right.                        The

 6   key precedent here is Chadha.                 Chadha establishes a

 7   couple of things.     First, Chadha establishes that there

 8   is aggrievement in the circumstances of this case.                         And

 9   I don't see what the difference is between aggrievement,

10   for purposes of statutory -- the statutory analysis at

11   issue in Chadha, and injury, for purposes of Article

12   III.

13                JUSTICE ALITO:              Well, how are you aggrieved?

14   "Aggrieved" means that you are deprived of your legal

15   rights.   And you don't think that you've been deprived

16   of your legal rights because your rights -- your

17   obligations under the Constitution supercede DOMA, and

18   you haven't been deprived of anything that you're

19   entitled to under the Constitution.                      So how are you

20   aggrieved?

21                MR. SRINIVASAN:              I guess we'd -- I'd

22   subscribe to the aggrievement analysis that the Court

23   made in Chadha at pages 929 to 931 of its opinion.                         And

24   what the Court said is this:                "When an agency of the

25   United States is a party to a case in which an act of

                                        27

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Congress that it administers is held unconstitutional,

 2   it is an aggrieved party.            The agency's status as an

 3   aggrieved party is not altered by the fact that the

 4   Executive may agree with the holding that the statute in

 5   question is unconstitutional."                 That description is on

 6   all fours with the circumstances of this case.

 7                 JUSTICE ALITO:            Could I just -- before you

 8   go on to the House group, could I just clear up

 9   something?    In your brief, you argue that you are

10   representing all three branches of the government, is

11   that right?

12                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            Correct.

13                 JUSTICE ALITO:            You're -- you're

14   representing the Judiciary as you stand before us here

15   today -

16                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well -

17                 JUSTICE ALITO:            -- trying to persuade the

18   Court, you're representing the Court?

19                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            We represent the sovereign

20   interests of the United States.                  Of course, in a case

21   like this, the -- the -- we're submitting the dispute to

22   the Judiciary for resolution, so in that sense, we -

23   I'm not going to stand here and tell you that I can

24   dictate the -- that the Judiciary comes out in one

25   direction or the other.          I certainly would like to be

                                       28

 1   able to do that, but I don't think I can, in all

 2   fairness, do that.     But I -

 3                 JUSTICE ALITO:            It seems very strange.         So

 4   in -- in a criminal case where it's the United States v.

 5   Smith, appearing before an Article III judge, the United

 6   States, the prosecutor is representing the court as

 7   well?

 8                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, I think -- I guess

 9   what I would say is this, the United -- the United

10   States -- the Executive Branch represents the sovereign

11   interests of the United States before the Court.                     It's

12   not -- I think the point of this is that it's not that

13   the Executive Branch is representing the Executive

14   Branch alone.

15                 The Executive Branch is representing the

16   sovereign interests of the United States.                  And those

17   interests would include the interests of the Congress

18   that enacted the law, the interests of the President

19   that signed it, and the interests of the Judiciary in

20   pronouncing on what the law is.                  And the course of

21   action that the President chose to undertake here is in

22   keeping with all of those considerations.

23                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Srinivasan, Chadha says

24   what you said it said about what it means to be

25   aggrieved -

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                  MR. SRINIVASAN:            Yes.

 2                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            -- but Chadha also left open

 3   the Article III question.             Why did Chadha leave it open

 4   if it's the same thing?

 5                  MR. SRINIVASAN:            I don't -- I don't know why

 6   Chadha didn't engage on it in particular.                 I think part

 7   of it, Justice Kagan, is that the Court didn't have the

 8   methodology at that point in time that it does now.                 I

 9   don't know that it neatly divided between those

10   questions in the same way.               So yes, it left the Article

11   III question open, but I think the question of Article

12   III injury necessarily follows from aggrievement and I

13   haven't -- I haven't heard a persuasive argument to the

14   contrary.

15                  If we were aggrieved in the circumstances of

16   Chadha, it seems to me it necessarily follows that we're

17   injured.     We're injured in a couple of ways.              An act of

18   Congress has been declared unconstitutional, which

19   Chadha itself says constitutes aggrievement and

20   therefore constitutes injury.                 In this case also, we're

21   required to pay a judgment -

22                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Didn't Chadha -- didn't

23   Chadha suggest that Congress could have standing in -

24   in Chadha?

25                  MR. SRINIVASAN:            I'm sorry?

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            In Chadha, there was an

 2   argument that Congress had standing because what was at

 3   issue in the case was precisely a prerogative of

 4   Congress to exercise the one-house or two-house veto.

 5                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            There wasn't a -- there -

 6   that was an issue in Chadha.               I don't know that that

 7   issue was joined, actually, Justice Scalia.                      The Court

 8   did say, at page 939 of its opinion, that Congress is a

 9   proper party to defend the constitutionality of the Act

10   and a proper petitioner, and I think that's the best

11   language for the other side on this issue.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So you say we

13   shouldn't be concerned about that part of Chadha because

14   the issue wasn't joined there?

15                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, I don't -- I don't

16   read the -

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But we should take

18   Lovett as a binding precedent even though the issue

19   wasn't addressed at all?

20                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            I didn't -- to be -- to be

21   fair or, as was suggested this morning, to be crickets,

22   I -- I didn't mean to suggest that Lovett is binding

23   precedent, Mr. Chief Justice.                What I'm saying is Lovett

24   is a case in which this same scenario as happens here

25   occurred.    That's my -- that's my point about Lovett.

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 All right.         Let's go to

 2   the BLAG issue.

 3                MR. SRINIVASAN:              So -- sure.

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 And the issue wasn't

 5   joined.   So what do you think we meant?                      And I know

 6   Justice Scalia doesn't care what you think we meant.

 7                MR. SRINIVASAN:              Right.          Well -

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 But what is your reading

 9   of what that means, that Congress can -

10                MR. SRINIVASAN:              I think that -

11                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 -- intervene in

12   situations in which its interests are injured?

13                MR. SRINIVASAN:              Sure.          So there are two

14   aspects of Chadha that are relevant on pages 939 and

15   940.   The second discussion at page 940, I think, deals

16   with prudential considerations that this Court ought to

17   take into account to make sure that it has a sufficient

18   adverse presentation of the competing arguments before

19   it.

20                And that's accounted for by an amicus type

21   role, and I think that's what the Court had in mind in

22   Chadha because the two cases that are cited in support

23   of that proposition were both cases in which there was

24   an appointed amicus.        So that -- that deals with that

25   aspect of Chadha.

                                        32

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               The other aspect of Chadha is the sentence

 2   that I alluded to earlier.            And I guess I'm not -- I'm

 3   not going to tell you that that sentence doesn't bear on

 4   the issue at all, but I will say this, what's cited in

 5   that is 28 U.S.C. 1254.

 6               So I think the point that was directly -

 7   directly being made is that the House and Senate were

 8   parties for purposes of the statute and they were

 9   parties because they had intervened and so they had

10   party status.

11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So are you accepting the

12   amici's formulation that somehow the representative has

13   to be of both houses and not just one?

14               MR. SRINIVASAN:            No.       I guess my -- my point

15   is a little bit different.            My point is that this was

16   talking about whether they're a party for statutory

17   purposes under 1254.     I don't read this to address the

18   question of Article III standing.

19               On the question of Article III standing, I

20   guess what I would say is this, Chadha at most, if it

21   says anything about Article III standing -- and I don't

22   know that it does with respect to the House or Senate -

23   at most what it would say was in the unique

24   circumstances of that case, where you had a legislative

25   veto that uniquely affected a congressional

                                     33

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   prerogative -

 2                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So you take the position

 3   that Congress -

 4                  MR. SRINIVASAN:            -- there might be standing

 5   in that situation.      Even that I don't want to concede,

 6   but -

 7                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, I want to know

 8   what you're conceding.

 9                  MR. SRINIVASAN:            I'm conceding that at

10   most -

11                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Let's assume this very

12   case.    Would -- who would ever have standing on behalf

13   of Congress?     Anyone?      Or are you saying there's never

14   standing?

15                  MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, there are two

16   different cases.     This case is different because this

17   case doesn't involve the kind of unique congressional

18   prerogative that was at issue in Chadha.                       Chadha

19   involved a legislative veto.

20                  Here, if I could just finish this -

21                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    You can finish your

22   sentence.

23                  MR. SRINIVASAN:            -- this thought.          Thank

24   you, Mr. Chief Justice.

25                  Here, I don't think the interest that's

 1   being asserted is even in the same plane as the one that

 2   was asserted and found deficient in Raines v. Byrd.

10   and may it please the Court:

11                  This Court not only addressed the issue of

12   the House's standing in Chadha, it held that the House

13   is the proper party to defend the constitutionality of

14   an Act of Congress when the executive agency charged

15   with its enforcement agrees with plaintiff that the

16   statute is unconstitutional.

17                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Mr. Clement, Chadha was

18   somewhat different because there was a unique House

19   prerogative at question.            But how is this case any

20   different than enforcing the general laws of the United

21   States?   There's no unique House power granted by the

22   legislation.

 3   until they stop defending it, at which point we

 4   submit -

 5                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, then, why

 6   shouldn't -- why shouldn't taxpayers have a right to

 7   come in?   And we say they don't.

 8                  MR. CLEMENT:         Because the House is very -

 9   in a very different position in a case like this and in

10   Chadha from just the general taxpayer.                   Now, in a case

11   like Chadha, for example, you're right, it was the

12   one-house veto, if you will, that was at issue.                   But it

13   would be a strange jurisprudence that says that the

14   House has standing to come in and defend an

15   unconstitutional one-house veto, but it doesn't have

16   standing to come in and defend its core Article I

17   prerogative, which is to pass statutes and have those

18   statutes -

19                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, that -- that assumes

20   the premise.     We didn't -- the House didn't know it was

21   unconstitutional.     I mean -

22                  MR. CLEMENT:         Well, with all due respect,

23   Justice Kennedy, I think the House -

24                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             We are talking about ex

25   ante, not ex post, what is standing at the outset?                   And

                                        36

 1   the House says this is constitutional.

 2                MR. CLEMENT:          Sure.         And it -- there is a

 3   presumption that its acts are constitutional.                  That

 4   presumption had real life here because when Congress was

 5   considering this statute it asked the Justice Department

 6   three times whether DOMA was constitutional, and three

 7   times the Justice Department told them that it was in

 8   fact constitutional.       So I think it's a fair assumption

 9   that they at least have standing to have that

10   determination made by the courts, and this Court has

11   held that in the context of State legislatures and the

12   courts have -

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:              So you don't think that

14   there is anything to the argument that in Chadha the

15   House had its own unique institutional responsibilities

16   and prerogatives at stake, either the one-house veto or

17   the legislative veto?

18                MR. CLEMENT:          Well, I would say two things.

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:              That's irrelevant?

20                MR. CLEMENT:          I don't think -- I don't think

21   it's irrelevant.   I would say two things.                 One is, I

22   don't think there was anything particularized about the

23   fact that it was the House that exercised the one-house

24   veto because the Court allowed the Senate to participate

25   as well.   And the Senate's interest in that was really

                                       37

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   just the constitutionality of the legislation and

 2   perhaps the one-house veto going forward.

 3               But what I would say is I just -- I would

 4   continue to resist the premise, which is that the

 5   House's prerogatives aren't at stake here.                       The House's

 6   single most important prerogative, which is to pass

 7   legislation and have that legislation, if it's going to

 8   be repealed, only be repealed through a process where

 9   the House gets to fully participate.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                       What if you -- what

11   if you disagree with -- the executive is defending one

12   of your laws, if that's the way you insist on viewing

13   it, and you don't like their arguments, you say, they

14   are not making the best argument.                       Is that a situation

15   in which you have standing to intervene to defend the

16   law in a different way than the executive is?

17               MR. CLEMENT:           No, I would say we would not,

18   Mr. Chief Justice.     I would say in that circumstance the

19   House would have the prerogative to file an amicus brief

20   if it wanted to.     But that's because of a sound

21   prudential reason, which is when the Executive is

22   actually discharging its responsibility, its traditional

23   obligation to defend an Act of Congress, if Congress

24   comes in as a party it has the possibility of

25   second-guessing the way that they are actually defending

                                       38

 1   it.

 2                  But if the Executive is going to vacate the

 3   premises or, in a case like this, not just vacate the

 4   premises, but stay in court and attack the statute, you

 5   don't have that prudential concern.                      And that's why what

 6   I -

 7                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            How about a couple of cases

 8   sort of in the middle of the Chief Justice's and this

 9   one?   So let's say that the Attorney General decides

10   that a particular application of the statute is

11   unconstitutional and decides to give up on that

12   application.     Or even let's say the Attorney General

13   decides that the application of the statute might be

14   unconstitutional, so decides to interpret the statute

15   narrowly in order to avoid that application.                      Could

16   Congress then come in?

17                  MR. CLEMENT:         Well, I think -- if in a

18   particular case, which is obviously not this case, the

19   Executive decides, we are not going to defend the

20   statute as applied I think in that situation the House

21   could come in.     I think as a matter of practice it

22   probably wouldn't.

23                  And it's not like the House and the Senate

24   are very anxious to exercise this prerogative.                      In the

25   30 years since the Chadha decision, there's only been 12

                                        39

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   instances in which the -- in which the House has come in

 2   and intervened as a party.            And I think it's very

 3   important to recognize that whatever -

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Does that include the -

 5   does that include the courts of appeals or just this

 6   Court?

 7               MR. CLEMENT:         That includes all courts, but

 8   excluding the DOMA cases.          So from the point of Chadha

 9   until the DOMA cases, there were a total of 12 cases

10   where the House intervened as a party.

11               And I do think that particularly in the

12   lower court cases, it's very important to understand

13   that party status is critical.               I mean, in this case it

14   doesn't make a huge differences if you are an amicus

15   with argument time versus a party.                    But in the district

16   court that makes all the difference.                    Only a party can

17   take a deposition.

18               JUSTICE BREYER:            This is what -- we have

19   always had the distinction between the public action and

20   the private action.      A public action, which does not

21   exist under the Federal Constitution, is to vindicate

22   the interest in the law being enforced.                    Now, when the

23   government, State or Federal, in fact has the interest,

24   a special interest, in executing the law, here given to

25   the President, and they can delegate that interest to

                                     40

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Congress, if they did, which arguably they didn't do

 2   here.   But to say that any legislator has an interest on

 3   his own without that delegation to defend the law is to

 4   import in that context the public action into the

 5   Federal government.

 6                  Now, that -- it hasn't been done, I don't

 7   think, ever.     I can see arguments for and against it,

 8   but I can't think of another instance where that's

 9   happened.

10                  MR. CLEMENT:         Well, I would -- a couple of

11   things, Justice Breyer.           I mean, I would point you to

12   Chadha and I realize you can distinguish Chadha.

13                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Chadha is really different

14   because of course there is an interest in the

15   legislature in defending a procedure of the legislature.

16   Now, that's -- that isn't tough.                    But this is because

17   the only interest I can see here is the interest in the

18   law being enforced.

19                  MR. CLEMENT:         Well, if I -

20                  JUSTICE BREYER:            And that's -- I'm afraid of

21   opening that door.

22                  MR. CLEMENT:         Well, it's understandable.            I

23   mean, obviously nobody's suggesting, at least in the

24   Legislative Branch, that this is a best practices

25   situation.

                                        41

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               JUSTICE BREYER:            No, no.        But think of

 2   another instance where that's happened.                  Where in all of

 3   the 12 cases or whatever that what this Court has said,

 4   without any special delegation of the power of the State

 5   or Federal government to execute the law, without any

 6   special delegation, a legislator simply has the power,

 7   which a private citizen wouldn't have, to bring a

 8   lawsuit as a party or defend as a party to vindicate the

 9   interest in the law being enforced, the law he has voted

10   for?

11               Now I can imagine arguments on both sides,

12   so I'm asking you only, is there any case you can point

13   me to which will help?

14               MR. CLEMENT:         I can point to you a couple of

15   cases that will help, but may not be a complete solution

16   for some of the reasons you built into your question.

17   The cases I would point to help are Coleman v. Miller,

18   Karcher v. May, and Arizonans for Official English.                  And

19   all of those -- I don't think Coleman involved any

20   specific legislative authorization, but you can

21   distinguish it, I suppose.

22               But in trying to distinguish it, keep in

23   mind that this Court gave those 20 Senators not just

24   standing to make the argument about the role of the

25   lieutenant governor, but also gave them standing to make

                                     42

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the separate argument, which is the only one this Court

 2   reached because it was divided four to four on the

 3   lieutenant governor's role, the only issue that the

 4   Court reached is the issue whether prior ratification

 5   disabled them from subsequent legislation action, which

 6   is just a way of saying what they did was

 7   unconstitutional.

 8                 So I think Coleman is quite close.                Karcher,

 9   Arizonans against English, there was an authorization.

10   We would say H. Res. 5 is enough of authorization for

11   these purposes.

12                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Can you tell me where

13   the authorization is here?               I know that there is a

14   statute that gives the Senate specifically authorization

15   to intervene.     And there was consideration of extending

16   that right to the House.            But the appointment of BLAG is

17   strange to me because it's not in a statute, it's in a

18   House rule.

19                 So where -- how does that constitute

20   anything other than a private agreement among some

21   Senators, the Senate -- the House leadership?                  And where

22   -- from where do they derive the right, the statutory

23   right, to take on the power of representing the House in

24   items outside of the House?               I know they control the

25   procedures within the House, but that's a very different

                                        43

 1   step than saying that they can decide who -- or to

 2   create standing in some way, prudential or otherwise,

 3   Article III or otherwise.

 4                MR. CLEMENT:          Well, Justice Sotomayor, I can

 5   point you to two places.           One is the House rules that

 6   are pursuant to the rulemaking authority and approved by

 7   the institution.     They're approved in every Congress.

 8   Rule 2.8.

 9                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                What other House Rule

10   creates the power of the majority leaders to represent

11   the House outside of the functions of the House?

12                MR. CLEMENT:          I'm not sure there is another

13   one, but that's the sole purpose of Rule 2.8.                 It

14   creates the Office of the General Counsel -

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                This would be, I think,

16   sort of unheard of, that -

17                MR. CLEMENT:          I don't think so,

18   Justice Sotomayor.     That's the same authority that gave

19   the House, essentially a predecessor to it -- - it would

20   be the same authority that has had the House appear in

21   litigation ever since Chadha.                In Chadha, there was a

22   vote that authorized it specifically, but we have that

23   here in H. Res. 5, which is the second place I would

24   point you.

25                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                We don't even have a

                                       44

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   vote here.

 2                MR. CLEMENT:         We do.          We do have a vote in

 3   H. Res. 5.   At the beginning of this Congress in

 4   January, the House passed a resolution that passed, that

 5   authorized the BLAG to continue to represent the

 6   interests of the House in this particular litigation.

 7   So I think if there was a question before H. Res. 5,

 8   there shouldn't be now.

 9                I would like to -

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Under your view, would the

11   Senate have the right to have standing to take the other

12   side of this case, so we have the House on one side and

13   the Senate on the other?

14                MR. CLEMENT:         No, Justice Kennedy, they

15   wouldn't have the standing to be on the other side of

16   this case.   They would have standing to be on the same

17   side of this case, and I think that's essentially what

18   you had happen in the Chadha case.

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, why not?       They're

20   concerned about the argument and you say that the House

21   of Representatives standing alone can come into the

22   court.   Why can't the Senate standing alone come into

23   court and intervene on the other side?

24                MR. CLEMENT:         It -- because it wouldn't have

25   the authority to do so under Chadha.                   What -- Chadha

                                      45

 1   makes the critical flipping of the switch that gives the

 2   House the ability to intervene as a party is that the

 3   Executive Branch declines to defend the statute.                        So if

 4   the Senate wants to come in and basically take -- share

 5   argument time or something as an amicus, they can, but

 6   there's no need for them to participate as -- as a

 7   party.

 8                And I would want to emphasize that in the

 9   lower courts, participation by a party is absolutely

10   critical.   It doesn't make sense to have the party that

11   wants to see the statute invalidated be in charge of the

12   litigation in the district courts.                     Because whether the

13   statute is going to be invalidated is going to depend on

14   what kind of record there is in the district court.

15                It'd be one thing, Justice Scalia, if all

16   that happened is they entered consent judgment.                     I

17   suppose then the thing would end, and then in the long

18   run, the Executive would be forced to do their job and

19   actually defend these statutes -

20                JUSTICE ALITO:            Then why is -

21                MR. CLEMENT:         -- but if that's not going to

22   happen -

23                JUSTICE ALITO:            Then why is it sufficient

24   for one house to take the position that the statute is

25   constitutional?   The enactment of legislation requires

                                      46

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   both houses, and usually the signature of the President.

 2               MR. CLEMENT:           Justice Alito, I think it

 3   makes perfect sense in this context because every -

 4   each individual house has a constitutional rule before a

 5   statute is repealed.       And so yes, it takes two of them

 6   to make the law.     But each of their's participation is

 7   necessary to repeal a law.              So if the Executive wants to

 8   go into court and effectively seek the judicial repeal

 9   of a law, it makes sense that one house can essentially

10   vindicate its role in our constitutional scheme by

11   saying, wait a minute, we passed that law, it can't be

12   repealed without our participation.

13               JUSTICE ALITO:              Well, if the law is passed

14   by a bare majority of one of the houses, then each

15   member of that -- of that house who was part of the

16   majority has the same interest in defending its

17   constitutionality.

18               MR. CLEMENT:           I don't think that's right

19   after Raines, Justice Alito.               In Raines, this Court

20   carefully distinguished between the situation of an

21   individual legislator and the situation of one of the

22   houses as a whole.     And it specifically said this might

23   be a different case if we had that kind of vote.                 And

 1               And again, I do think that -- I mean, the

 2   only alternatives here are really to say that the

 3   Executive absolutely must enforce these laws, and if

 4   they don't, I mean because after all -- you know, I -- I

 5   really don't understand why it's -- if they're not going

 6   to -- if they've made a determination that the law is

 7   unconstitutional, why it makes any sense for them to

 8   continue to enforce the law and put executive officers

 9   in the position of doing something that the President

10   has determined is unconstitutional.

11               I mean, think about the qualified immunity

12   implications of that for a minute.

13               So that's problematic enough.                     But if

14   they're going to be able to do that and get anything

15   more than a consent judgment, then the House is going to

16   have to be able to play its role.                     And it's going to

17   have to play the role of a party.                     An amicus just

18   doesn't get it done.     And I really think, in a sense,

19   the Executive gives the game away by conceding that our

20   participation as an amicus here is necessary to solve

21   what would otherwise be a glaring adverseness problem.

22               Because once you recognize that we can

23   participate as an amicus, you've essentially recognized

24   that there's nothing inherently executive about coming

25   in and defending the constitutionality of an act of

                                     48

 1   Congress.     Or more to the point, there's nothing

 2   inherently unlegislative about coming in and making

 3   arguments in defense of the statute.

 4                  And if that's critical, absolutely necessary

 5   to ensure there's an adverse presentation of the issues,

 6   well, there's no reason the House should have to do that

 7   with one hand tied behind its back.                      If its

 8   participation is necessary, it should participate as a

 9   full party.     And as I say, that's critically important

10   in the lower courts so they can take depositions, build

11   a factual record, and allow for a meaningful defense of

12   the statute.

13                  Because the alternative really puts the

14   Executive Branch in an impossible position.                       It's a

15   conflict of interest.         They're the ones that are making

16   litigation decisions to promote the defense of a statute

17   they want to see invalidated.                 And if you want to see

18   the problems with their position, look at Joint Appendix

19   page 437.     You will see the most anomalous motion to

20   dismiss in the history of litigation.                      A motion to

21   dismiss, filed by the United States, asking the district

22   court not to dismiss the case.

23                  I mean, that's what you get under their view

24   of the world, and that doesn't serve as separation of

25   powers.

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:                That -- that would give

 2   you intellectual whiplash.

 3               I'm going to have to think about that.

 4               (Laughter.)

 6   then -- you know -- and the last thing I'll say is, we

 7   saw in this case certain appeals were expedited, certain

 8   appeals weren't.    They did not serve the interest of

 9   defending the statute, they served the distinct interest

10   of the Executive.

14             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF VICKI C. JACKSON

15        ON BEHALF OF THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE

16               MS. JACKSON:            Thank you, Your Honor.

17               I have five points I'll try to get to.

18               Just very quickly, Justice Breyer, I only

19   answered part of a question you asked me earlier, and I

20   just want to say, the U.S. is asking this Court to tell

21   it to pay money.    It's not asking for relief.

22               Justice Sotomayor, you asked me about how

23   the issue could come up otherwise.                       I don't think I had

24   a chance to mention, private party litigation, employees

25   against employers, there's an interpleader action right

                                        50

 1   now pending that was cited in the brief of the 287

 2   employers on page 32 at note 54 giving examples of how

 3   the issue of DOMA's constitutionality could arise in

 4   private litigation.

 5                In addition, State and local government

 6   employees might have, for example, FMLA claims in which

 7   the issue could arise.        So I think that there are a

 8   number of ways in which the issue could arise.

 9                On the question of what the purpose of 1252

10   could be if it wasn't to coincide with Article III

11   injury that was raised by my -- my friend in his

12   argument, I wonder whether the Court in Chadha wasn't

13   saying something like this, 1252 was Congress's wish

14   list.   It was like -- like a citizen suit provision, to

15   be exercised only to the extent that Article III power

16   was there.   That's a way to make sense out of what the

17   Court is doing in the text and footnote there.

18                As to the question of BLAG, which has been

19   very fully discussed already, I do want to say that

20   after-the-fact authorization seems to me quite troubling

21   and inconsistent with this Court's approach in Summers

22   v. Earth Institute, and in the -- I think it was in the

23   plurality in Lujan, where you -- you -- if a party has

24   standing, they need to have it in the first court that

25   they're in, either when it starts or certainly before

                                      51

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   judgment.

 2                  And the rule as Justice Sotomayor observed

 3   just doesn't seem to say anything about authority to

 4   litigate.     I think that in addition, the -- the big

 5   problem here is the injury being complained of is

 6   inconsistent with the separation of powers.

 7                  Bowsher and Buckley make very clear that

 8   once the litigation is enacted, Congress's authority to

 9   supervise it is at an end.               It goes over to the

10   Executive Branch.     And whether the Executive Branch does

11   it well or badly, in the view of Congress, it's in its

12   domain.     And separation of powers will not be meaningful

13   if all it means is the Congress has to stay out unless

14   it thinks that the President is doing it badly.

15                  So I think Article II helps give shape to

16   what kinds of injuries alleged by parts of Congress can

17   be cognizable.

18                  Finally, the three -- two or three cases

19   cited by my colleague who last spoke:                    Coleman, Karcher

20   and Arizona, all involved State level of government,

21   where the Federal separation of powers doctrines

22   articulated in cases like Bowsher and Buckley were not

23   at issue.

24                  Unless there are other questions, I will sit

25   down.

 1               JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, could I ask you this

 2   question, on the question of the House resolution -

 3               MS. JACKSON:         Yes, sir.

 4               JUSTICE ALITO:            -- if -- if a house -- if

 5   one of the houses passes a resolution saying that a

 6   particular group was always authorized to represent us,

 7   do you think it's consistent with the separation of

 8   powers for us to examine whether that's a correct

 9   interpretation of the rules of that House of Congress?

10               MS. JACKSON:         Yes, I do, Your Honor, because

11   that resolution is not something operating only

12   internally within the House.             It is having effect in the

13   world of the Article III courts, which this Court, in

14   proceedings in it, is in charge of.

15               Moreover, in the Smith case, the -- this

16   Court said that when the Senate passed an after-the-fact

17   interpretation of what a prior rule meant,

18   notwithstanding the great respect given to the Senate's

19   interpretation, this Court could reach and did reach an

20   alternative interpretation of the meaning of the Senate

21   rules, and I would urge this Court to do the same thing

22   here.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:            Maybe I -- as long as you

24   have a minute, I -- what did you think of Mr. Clement's

25   argument this way, that -- that the execution -- can

 1   I -

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Sure.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:            -- to execute the laws is

 4   in Article II, but where the President doesn't in a

 5   particular law, under those circumstances, a member of

 6   the legislature, appropriately authorized, has the

 7   constitutional power -- a power that is different than

 8   the average person being interested in seeing that the

 9   law is carried out, they can represent the power to

10   vindicate the interest in seeing that the law is

11   executed.   And that's a special interest, existing only

12   when the Executive declines to do so.

13                MS. JACKSON:         Your Honor, I think that when

14   the Executive declines to do so, it is exercising its

15   Take Care Clause authority.             The Take Care Clause says

16   that the Executive shall take care that the laws be

17   faithfully executed.      I think the laws include the

18   Constitution.

19                So I don't think the distinction offered by

20   my colleague is -- is appropriate.                     I think it would

21   result in a significant incursion on the separation of

22   powers between the legislature and the Executive Branch,

23   and would bring this -- the Federal courts into more

24   controversies that have characteristics of interbranch

25   confrontation, in which this Court has traditionally

                                      54

 2                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Ms. Jackson, before

 3   you sit down, I would like to note that you briefed and

 4   argued this case as amicus curiae at the invitation of

 5   the Court, and you have ably discharged the

 6   responsibility, for which you have the gratitude of the

13                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I meant that we

19                ADVISORY GROUP OF THE UNITED STATES

20                  MR. CLEMENT:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

21   please the Court:

22                  The issue of same-sex marriage certainly

23   implicates profound and deeply held views on both sides

24   of the issue.     But the legal question on the merits

25   before this Court is actually quite narrow.                       On the

 1   assumption that States have the constitutional option

 2   either to define marriage in traditional terms or to

 3   recognize same-sex marriages or to adopt a compromise

 4   like civil unions, does the Federal government have the

 5   same flexibility or must the Federal government simply

 6   borrow the terms in State law?

 7               I would submit the basic principles of

 8   federalism suggest that as long as the Federal

 9   government defines those terms solely for purposes of

10   Federal law, that the Federal government has the choice

11   to adopt a constitutionally permissible definition or to

12   borrow the terms of the statute.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Clement, the problem

14   is that if we are totally for the States' decision that

15   there is a marriage between two people, for the Federal

16   government then to come in to say no joint return; no

17   marital deduction; no Social Security benefits; your

18   spouse is very sick, but you can't get leave; people -

19   if that set of attributes, one might well ask, what kind

20   of marriage is this?

21               MR. CLEMENT:         And I think the answer to

22   that, Justice Ginsburg, would be to say that that is a

23   marriage under State law, and I think this Court's cases

24   when it talks about the fundamental right to marriage, I

25   take it to be talking about the State law status of

                                     56

 1   marriage, and the question of what does that mean for

 2   purposes of Federal law has always been understood to be

 3   a different matter.       And that's been true certainly in a

 4   number of situations under a number of statutes, so it's

 5   simply not the case that as long as you are married

 6   under State law you absolutely are going to be treated

 7   as married -

 8                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              How about divorce?   Same

 9   thing?   That you can have a Federal notion of divorce,

10   and that that doesn't relate to what the State statute

11   is?

12                  MR. CLEMENT:         Well, we've never had that,

13   Your Honor, and I think that there is a difference when

14   it comes to divorce because with divorce uniquely, you

15   could have the -- possibility that somebody's married to

16   two different people for purposes of State law and

17   Federal law.

18                  But with the basic question of even whether

19   to recognize the marriage -- or probably the best way to

20   put it is just whether the Federal law treats you as

21   married for a particular purpose or not, there always

22   have been differences between the Federal law treatment

23   and the State law treatment.

24                  The Federal treatment, for example,

25   recognizes common law marriages in all States whereas a

                                        57

                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   lot of States don't recognize common law marriages, but

 2   Federal law recognizes that for some purposes -- the

 3   Social Security Act, I think it's at page 4 of our

 4   brief.   And -

 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               But only if the State

 6   recognizes it.

 7               MR. CLEMENT:         No, I don't think that is true

 8   for purposes of that provision.

 9               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               And so there is a common

10   law, Federal common law definition?

11               MR. CLEMENT:         That's my understanding,

12   that's -- as discussed -

13               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I thought it was

14   reverse, that if the State law recognized common law

15   marriages, the Federal law -

16               MR. CLEMENT:         My understanding is that there

17   is a Federal -- that the Federal law recognizes in -- in

18   the Social Security context even if it doesn't.                 And in

19   all events, there are other situations -- immigration

20   context, tax consequences.            For tax consequences, if you

21   get a divorce every December -- you know, for tax

22   consequences, the State may well recognize that divorce.

23   The Federal government has long said, look, we are not

24   going to allow you get a divorce every December just to

25   get remarried in January so you'll have a filing tax

                                     58

 1   status that works for you that is more favorable to you.

 2               So the Federal government has always treated

 3   this somewhat distinctly.          It always has its own

 4   efforts, and I do think for purposes of the federalism

 5   issue, it really matters that all DOMA does is take this

 6   term where it appears in Federal law and define it for

 7   purposes of Federal law.         It would obviously be a

 8   radically different case if Congress had, in 1996,

 9   decided to try to stop States from defining marriage in

10   a particular way or dictate how they would decide it in

11   that way.

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, it applies to over

13   what, 1,100 Federal laws, I think we are saying.             So

14   it's not -- it's -- it's -- I think there is quite a bit

15   to your argument that if the tax deduction case, which

16   is specific, whether or not if Congress has the power it

17   can exercise it for the reason that it wants, that it

18   likes some marriage it does like, I suppose it can do

19   that.

20               But when it has 1,100 laws, which in our

21   society means that the Federal government is intertwined

22   with the citizens' day-to-day life, you are at -- at

23   real risk of running in conflict with what has always

24   been thought to be the essence of the State police

25   power, which is to regulate marriage, divorce, custody.

 1                  MR. CLEMENT:         Well, Justice Kennedy, two

 2   points.     First of all, the very fact that there are

 3   1,100 provisions of Federal law that define the terms

 4   "marriage" and "spouse" goes a long way to showing that

 5   Federal law has not just stayed completely out of these

 6   issues.     It's gotten involved in them in a variety of

 7   contexts where there is an independent Federal power

 8   that supported that.

 9                  Now, the second thing is the fact that DOMA

10   affects all 1,100 statutes at once is not really a sign

11   of its irrationality.         It is a sign that what it is, and

12   all it has ever purported to be, is a definitional

13   provision.     And like every other provision in the

14   Dictionary Act, what it does is it defines the term

15   wherever it appears in Federal law in a consistent way.

16   And that was part and parcel of what Congress was trying

17   to accomplish with DOMA in 1996.

18                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, but it's not really

19   uniformity because it regulates only one aspect of

20   marriage.     It doesn't regulate all of marriage.

21                  MR. CLEMENT:         Well, that's true but I don't

22   think that's a mark against it for federalism purposes.

23   And it -- it addressed a particular issue at a point,

24   remember in 1996, Congress is addressing this issue

25   because they are thinking that the State of Hawaii,

                                        60

 1   through its judicial action, is about to change the

 2   definition of marriage from a way that it had been

 3   defined in every jurisdiction in the United States.                     And

 4   what that meant is that when Congress passed every one

 5   of the statutes affected by DOMA's definition, the

 6   Congress that was passing that statute had in mind the

 7   traditional definition.

 8                  And so Congress, in 1996, at that point

 9   says, the States are about to experiment with changing

10   this, but the one thing we know is all these Federal

11   statutes were passed with the traditional definition in

12   mind.   And if rational basis is the test, it has to be

13   rational for Congress then to say, well, we are going to

14   reaffirm what this word has always meant for purposes of

15   Federal law.

16                  JUSTICE ALITO:            Suppose we look just at the

17   estate tax provision that's at issue in this case, which

18   provides specially favorable treatment to a married

19   couple as opposed to any other individual or economic

20   unit.   What was the purpose of that?                    Was the purpose of

21   that really to foster traditional marriage, or was

22   Congress just looking for a convenient category to

23   capture households that function as a unified economic

24   unit?

25                  MR. CLEMENT:         Well, I think for these

                                        61

                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   purposes actually, Justice Alito, if you go back to the

 2   beginning of the estate tax deduction, what Congress was

 3   trying to do was trying to provide uniform treatment of

 4   taxpayers across jurisdictions, and if you look at the

 5   brief that Senator Hatch and some other Senators filed,

 6   they discussed this history because what was happening,

 7   in 1948 when this provision was initially put into

 8   Federal law, was you had community property States and

 9   common law States, and actually there was much more

10   favorable tax treatment if you were in a community law

11   State than a common law State.

12               And Congress didn't want to have an

13   artificial incentive for States to move from common law

14   to community property.       It wanted to treat citizens the

15   same way no matter what State they were in.           So it said,

16   we will give a uniform Federal deduction based on

17   marriage, and I think what that shows is that when the

18   Federal government gets involved in the issue of

19   marriage, it has a particularly acute interest in

20   uniform treatment of people across State lines.

21               So Ms. Windsor wants to point to the

22   unfairness of the differential treatment of treating two

23   New York married couples differently, and of course for

24   purposes of New York law that's exactly the right focus,

25   but for purposes of Federal law it's much more rational

                                     62

 1   for Congress to -- to say, and certainly a rational

 2   available choice, for Congress to say, we want to treat

 3   the same-sex couple in New York the same way as the

 4   committed same-sex couple in Oklahoma and treat them the

 5   same.    Or even more to the point for purposes -

 6                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               But that's begging the

 7   question because you are treating the married couples

 8   differently.

 9                  MR. CLEMENT:         Well -

10                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               You are saying that New

11   York's married couples are different than Nebraska's.

12                  MR. CLEMENT:         But -- but the only way -

13                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I picked that out of a

14   hat.    But the point is that there is a difference.

15                  MR. CLEMENT:         But the -- the only way they

16   are different is because of the way the State law treats

17   them.    And just to be clear how -- you know, what this

18   case is about, and how sort of anomalous the -- the

19   treatment, the differential treatment in two States is,

20   is this is not a case that is based on a marriage

21   license issued directly by the State of New York after

22   2011 when New York recognized same-sex marriage.                  This

23   is -- the status of Ms. Windsor as married depends on

24   New York's recognition of an Ontario marriage

25   certificate issued in 2007.

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:            You would say it would be

 2   the same thing if the State passed a law -- Congress

 3   passes a law which says, well, there's some States -

 4   they all used to require 18 as the age of consent.                    Now,

 5   a lot of them have gone to 17.                So if you're 17 when you

 6   get married, then no tax deduction, no medical, no

 7   nothing.

 8                Or some States had a residence requirement

 9   of a year, some have six months, some have four months.

10   So Congress passes a law that says, well unless you're

11   there for a year, no medical deduction, no tax thing, no

12   benefits of any kind, that that would be perfectly

13   constitutional.   It wouldn't be arbitrary, it wouldn't

14   be random, it wouldn't be capricious.

15                MR. CLEMENT:         Well, I guess I would -- I

16   would say two things.       I would say that the first

17   question would be what's the relevant level of scrutiny

18   and I assume the level of scrutiny for the things -

19                JUSTICE BREYER:            No, I just want your bottom

20   line.   The bottom line here is we can imagine -- you

21   know, I can make them up all day.                      So can you -

22   differences between -

23                (Laughter.)

24                JUSTICE BREYER:            Differences between States

25   have nothing to do with anything -- you know, residence

                                      64

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   requirements, whether you have a medical exam,

 2   whether -- we can think them up all day -- how old you

 3   are.    And Congress just passes a law which takes about,

 4   let's say, 30 percent of the people who are married in

 5   the United States and says no tax deduction, no this, no

 6   that, no medical -- medical benefits, none much these

 7   good things, none of them for about 20, 30 percent of

 8   all of the married people.

 9                 Can they do that?

10                 MR. CLEMENT:         Again, I think the right way

11   to analyze it would be -- you know, is -- is there any

12   distinction drawn that implicates what level of scrutiny

13   is implicated.    If the level of scrutiny is a rational

14   basis, then my answer to you would be, yes, they can do

15   that.    I mean, we'd have to talk about what the rational

16   basis would be -

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:            No, there isn't any.         I'm

18   trying to think of examples, though I just can't imagine

19   what it is.

20                 MR. CLEMENT:         Well, I -- I think the uniform

21   treatment of individuals across State lines -

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.       So you're

23   saying uniform treatment's good enough no matter how odd

24   it is, no matter how irrational.                   There is nothing but

25   uniformity.    We could take -- no matter.                 You see what

 1   I'm -- where I'm going?

 2                  MR. CLEMENT:         No, I see exactly where you're

 3   going, Justice Breyer.

 4                  JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.

 5                  (Laughter.)

 6                  MR. CLEMENT:         And -- and obviously, every

 7   one of those cases would have to be decided on its own.

 8   But I do think there is a powerful interest when the

 9   Federal government classifies people -

10                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes, okay.       Fine.

11                  MR. CLEMENT:         -- there's a powerful interest

12   in treating -

13                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Fine, but once -- the first

14   part.   Every one of those cases has to be decided on its

15   own, okay?     Now, what's special or on its own that

16   distinguishes and thus makes rational, or whatever basis

17   you're going to have here, treating the gay marriage

18   differently?

19                  MR. CLEMENT:         Well, again, if we're -- if

20   we're coming at this from the premise that the States

21   have the option to choose, and then we come at this from

22   the perspective that Congress is passing this not in a

23   vacuum, they're passing this in 1996.                    And what they're

24   confronting in 1996 is the prospect that one State,

25   through its judiciary, will adopt same-sex marriage, and

                                        66

 1   then by operation of the through full faith and credit

 2   law, that will apply to any -- any couple that wants to

 3   go there.

 4                  And the State that's thinking about doing

 5   this is, Hawaii, it's a very nice place to go and get

 6   married.     And so Congress is worried that people are

 7   going to go there, go back to their home jurisdictions,

 8   insist on the recognition in their home jurisdictions of

 9   their same-sex marriage in Hawaii, and then the Federal

10   government will borrow that definition, and therefore,

11   by the operation of one State's State judiciary,

12   same-sex marriage is basically going to be recognized

13   throughout the country.

14                  And what Congress says is, wait a minute.

15   Let's take a timeout here.               This is a redefinition of an

16   age-old institution.        Let's take a more cautious

17   approach where every sovereign gets to do this for

18   themselves.     And so Section 2 of DOMA says we're going

19   to make sure that on full faith and credit principles

20   that a decision of one State -

21                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               But what gives the

22   Federal government the right to be concerned at all at

23   what the definition of marriage is?                      Sort of going in a

24   circle.     You're saying -- you're saying, we can create

25   this special category -- men and women -- because the

 1   States have an interest in traditional marriage that

 2   they're trying to protect.               How do you get the Federal

 3   government to have the right to create categories of

 4   that type, based on an interest that's not there, but

 5   based on an interest that belongs to the States?

 6               MR. CLEMENT:            Well, at least two -- two

 7   responses to that, Justice Sotomayor.                    First is that one

 8   interest that supports the Federal government's

 9   definition of this term is whatever Federal interest

10   justifies the underlying statute in which it appears.

11               So in every one of these statutes that

12   affected, by assumption, there's some Article I Section

13   8 authority -

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  So they can create a

15   class they don't like -- here, homosexuals, or a class

16   that they consider is suspect in the marriage category,

17   and they can create that class and decide benefits on

18   that basis when they themselves have no interest in the

19   actual institution of marriage as marriage.                    The State's

20   control that.

21               MR. CLEMENT:            Just to clarify, Justice

22   Sotomayor, I'm not suggesting that the Federal

23   government has any special authority to recognize

24   traditional marriage.         So if -- the assumption is that

25   nobody can do it.     If the States can't do it either,

                                        68

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   then the Federal government can't do it.                  So the Federal

 2   government -

 3                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               No, I'm -- I'm

 4   assuming -

 5                MR. CLEMENT:         Okay.         So then the question

 6   is -

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Assuming I assume the

 8   States can -

 9                MR. CLEMENT:         So then, if the States can -

10                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               -- what creates the

11   right -

12                MR. CLEMENT:         -- the Federal government has

13   sort of two sets of authorities that give it sort of a

14   legitimate interest to wade into this debate.                  Now, one

15   is whatever authority gives rise to the underlying

16   statute.   The second and complementary authority is

17   that -- you know, the Federal government recognizes that

18   it's a big player in the world, that it has a lot of

19   programs that might give States incentives to change the

20   rules one way or another.

21                And the best way -- one way to stay out of

22   the debate and let just the -- the States develop this

23   and let the democratic process deal with this is to just

24   say, look, we're going to stick with what we've always

25   had, which is traditional definition.                  We're not going

                                      69

 1   to create a regime that gives people an incentive and

 2   point to Federal law and say, well, another reason you

 3   should have same-sex marriage is because then you'll get

 4   a State tax deduction.          They stayed out of it.               They've

 5   said, look, we're --

 6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But I -- I see an illogic

 7   in your argument.     I -- I hadn't thought of the

 8   relation between Section 2 and Section 3 in the way you

 9   just said.    You said, now Section 2 was in order to help

10   the States.    Congress wanted to help the States.                     But

11   then Section 3, that Congress doesn't help the States,

12   which have come to the conclusion that gay marriage is

13   lawful.   So that's inconsistent.

14                 MR. CLEMENT:          No, no.              They treat them -

15   which is to say they -- they are preserving, they are

16   helping the States in the sense of having each sovereign

17   make this decision for themselves.

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:              We're helping the States

19   do -- if they do what we want them to, which is -- which

20   is not consistent with the historic commitment of

21   marriage and -- and of questions of -- of the rights of

22   children to the State.

23                 MR. CLEMENT:          With respect, Justice Kennedy,

24   that's not right.     No State loses any benefits by

25   recognizing same-sex marriage.                  Things stay the same.

 1   What they don't do is they don't sort of open up an

 2   additional class of beneficiaries under their State law

 3   for -- that get additional Federal benefits.                   But things

 4   stay the same.     And that's why in this sense -

 5                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              They're not -- they're

 6   not a question of additional benefits.                   I mean, they

 7   touch every aspect of life.               Your partner is sick.

 8   Social Security -- I mean, it's pervasive.                   It's not as

 9   though, well, there's this little Federal sphere and

10   it's only a tax question.

11                  It's -- it's -- as Justice Kennedy said,

12   1,100 statutes, and it affects every area of life.                      And

13   so he was really diminishing what the State has said is

14   marriage.     You're saying, no, State said two kinds of

15   marriage, the full marriage, and then this sort of skim

16   milk marriage.

17                  (Laughter.)

18                  MR. CLEMENT:         With respect, Justice

19   Ginsburg, that's not what the Federal government is

20   saying.     The Federal government is saying that within

21   its own realm in Federal policies, where we assume that

22   the Federal government has the authority to define the

23   terms that appear in their own statutes, that in those

 1                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Clement, for the most

 2   part and historically, the only uniformity that the

 3   Federal government has pursued is that it's uniformly

 4   recognized the marriages that are recognized by the

 5   State.   So this was a real difference in the uniformity

 6   that the Federal government was pursuing.              And it

 7   suggests that maybe something -- maybe Congress had

 8   something different in mind than uniformity.

 9                So we have a whole series of cases which

10   suggest the following -- which suggest that when

11   Congress targets a group that is not everybody's

12   favorite group in the world, that we look at those cases

13   with some -- even if they're not suspect -- with some

14   rigor to say, do we really think that Congress was doing

15   this for uniformity reasons, or do we think that

16   Congress's judgment was infected by dislike, by fear, by

17   animus, and so forth?

18                I guess the question that this statute

19   raises, this statute that does something that's really

20   never been done before, is whether that sends up a

21   pretty good red flag that that's what was going on.

22                MR. CLEMENT:         A couple of responses, Justice

23   Kagan.   First of all, I think I would take issue with

24   the premise, first of all, that this is such an unusual

25   Federal involvement on an issue like marriage.              If you

                                      72

 1   look at historically, not only has the Federal

 2   government defined marriage for its own purposes

 3   distinctly in the context of particular -- particular

 4   programs, it's also intervened in -- in other areas,

 5   including in-State prerogatives.                    I mean, there's a

 6   reason that 4 State constitutions include a prohibition

 7   on polygamy.     It's because the Federal Congress insisted

 8   on them.   There is a reason that, in the wake of the

 9   Civil War and in Reconstruction, Congress specifically

10   wanted to provide benefits for spouses of freed slaves

11   who fought for the Union.

12                  In order to do it, it essentially had to

13   create State law marriages because in the Confederacy,

14   the slaves couldn't get married.                    So they developed

15   their own State -- essentially, a Federal, sort of,

16   condition to define who was married under those laws.

17   So where there was the needs in the past to get

18   involved, the Federal government has got involved.

19                  The other point I would make -- but I also

20   eventually want to get around to the animus point -- but

21   the other point I would make is, when you look at

22   Congress doing something that is unusual, that deviates

23   from the way they -- they have proceeded in the past,

24   you have to ask, well, was there good reason?                    And in a

25   sense, you have to understand that, in 1996, something's

                                        73

 1   happening that is, in a sense, forcing Congress to

 2   choose between its historic practice of deferring to the

 3   States and its historic practice of preferring

 4   uniformity.

 5                 Up until 1996, it essentially has it both

 6   ways, every State has the traditional definition.

 7   Congress knows that's the definition that's embedded in

 8   every Federal law.        So that's fine.                  We can defer.

 9                 Okay.     1996 -

10                 JUSTICE KAGAN:               Well, is what happened in

11   1996 -- and I'm going to quote from the House Report

12   here -- is that "Congress decided to reflect an honor of

13   collective moral judgment and to express moral

14   disapproval of homosexuality."

15                 Is that what happened in 1996?

16                 MR. CLEMENT:            Does the House Report say

17   that?   Of course, the House Report says that.                       And if

18   that's enough to invalidate the statute, then you should

19   invalidate the statute.             But that has never been your

20   approach, especially under rational basis or even

21   rational basis-plus, if that is what you are suggesting.

22                 This Court, even when it's to find more

23   heightened scrutiny, the O'Brien case we cite, it

24   suggests, look, we are not going to strike down a

25   statute just because a couple of legislators may have

                                          74

 1   had an improper motive.           We're going to look, and under

 2   rational basis, we look, is there any rational basis for

 3   the statute?

 4                  And so sure, the House Report says some

 5   things that we are not -- we've never invoked in trying

 6   to defend the statute.

 7                  But the House Report says other things, like

 8   Congress was trying to promote democratic

 9   self-governance.     And in a situation where an unelected

10   State judiciary in Hawaii is on the verge of deciding

11   this highly contentious, highly divisive issue for

12   everybody, for the States -- for the other States and

13   for the Federal government by borrowing principle, it

14   makes sense for Congress -

15                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, but your statute

16   applies also to States where the voters have decided it.

17                  MR. CLEMENT:         That's true.         I -- but again,

18   I don't know that that fact alone makes it irrational.

19   And I suppose if that's what you think -

20                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well -- just to be clear,

21   I think your answer is fair and rational.

22                  We've switched now from Federal power to

23   rationality.     There is -- there is a difference.                We're

24   talking -- I think we are assuming now that there is

25   Federal power and asking about the -- the degree of

                                        75

 1   scrutiny that applies to it.                Or are we going back to

 2   whether there is a Federal power?                        They are -- they are

 3   intertwined.

 4                  MR. CLEMENT:         I think -- I think there is so

 5   clearly is a Federal power because DOMA doesn't define

 6   any term that appears anywhere other than in a Federal

 7   statute that we assume that there is Federal power for.

 8   And if there is not Federal power for the statutes in

 9   which these terms appear, that is a problem independent

10   of DOMA, but it is not a DOMA problem.                        So I will assume

11   we have Federal power.

12                  Then the question is -

13                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, I think -- I think

14   it is a DOMA problem.         The question is whether or not

15   the Federal government, under our federalism scheme, has

16   the authority to regulate marriage.

17                  MR. CLEMENT:         And -- and it doesn't have the

18   authority to regulate marriages, as such, but that's not

19   what DOMA does.     DOMA provides certain -- DOMA defines a

20   term as it appears in Federal statutes, many of those

21   Federal statutes provide benefits.                        Some of those

22   Federal statutes provide burdens.                        Some of those Federal

23   statutes provide disclosure obligations.                        It appears in

24   lots of places, and if any one of -

25                  JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, Congress could have

                                        76

 1   achieved exactly what it achieved under Section 3 by

 2   excising the term "married" from the United States Code

 3   and replacing it with something more neutral.                  It could

 4   have said "certified domestic units," and then defined

 5   this in exactly the way that Section 3 -- exactly the

 6   way DOMA defines "marriage."

 7                 Would that make a difference?                In that

 8   instance, the Federal government wouldn't be purporting

 9   to say who is married and who is not married, it would

10   be saying who is entitled to various Federal benefits

11   and burdens based on a Federal definition?

12                 MR. CLEMENT:         That would make no difference,

13   Justice Alito.    It does -- the hypothetical helpfully

14   demonstrates, though, that when the Federal government

15   is defining this term as it appears in the Federal Code,

16   it is not regulating marriage as such.                  And it is

17   important to recognize that people that are married in

18   their State, based on either the legislative acts or by

19   judicial recognition, remain married for purposes of

20   State law.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:            When you started, you

22   started by, I think, agreeing -- maybe not -- that

23   uniformity in and of itself with nothing else is not

24   likely to prove sufficient, at least if it's rational

25   basis-plus.    And -- and why?             Because we can think of

                                       77

 1   weird categories that are uniform.

 2                So you say, look at it on the merits.                 Now

 3   that's where you are beginning to get.                  But so far, what

 4   I've heard is, well, looking at it on the merits, there

 5   is certainly a lot of harms.               And on the plus side what

 6   there is, one, we don't want courts deciding this.                     But

 7   of course, as was just pointed out, in some States it's

 8   not courts, it's the voters.

 9                Then you say, ah, but we want -- there are

10   too many courts deciding it.               Now, is -- too many courts

11   might decide it.   Now what else is there?                 What else?        I

12   want to -- I want to be able to have a list -- you know,

13   of really specific things that you are saying justify

14   this particular effort to achieve uniformity.                  And I

15   want to be sure I'm not missing any.

16                And so far, I've got those two I mentioned.

17   What else?

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:             I didn't understand that

19   courts were so central to your position.                  I -- I thought

20   you didn't want the voters in one State to dictate to

21   other States any more than you would want the courts in

22   one State to dictate to other States.

23                MR. CLEMENT:          Well, I -- I think that's

24   true, Justice Scalia.        The point about the courts,

25   though, is -- I mean, it's particularly relevant here.

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:            That means courts -- the

 2   courts, they do dictate in respect to time.            They

 3   dictate in respect to age.            They dictate in respect to

 4   all kinds of things.     And what I'm looking for is what,

 5   in your opinion, is special about this homosexual

 6   marriage that would justify this, other than this kind

 7   of pure uniformity, if there is such a thing?

 8               MR. CLEMENT:         Well, let me -- let me just

 9   get on record that -- to take issue with one of the

10   premises of this, which is we are at somehow rational

11   basis-plus land because I would suggest strongly that

12   three levels of scrutiny are enough.

13               But in all events, if you are thinking about

14   the justifications that defend this statute, that

15   justify the statute, they are obviously in the brief.

16   But it's uniformity -- but it's not -- it's not just

17   that Congress picked this -- you know, we need a uniform

18   term, let's pick this out of the air.

19               They picked the traditional definition that

20   they knew reflected the underlying judgments of every

21   Federal statute on the books at that point.            They knew

22   it was the definition that had been tried in every

23   jurisdiction in the United States and hadn't been tried

24   anywhere until 2004.     And then, of course, it was, as

25   they correctly predicted, a judicial decision.

                                     79

 1                  And in this context, in particular, they are

 2   thinking about an individual -- I mean, this couple goes

 3   to Ontario, they get the -- they get a marriage

 4   certificate.     A couple could -- from Oklahoma, could

 5   have gotten -- gone to Ontario and gotten a marriage

 6   certificate that same day and gone back to Oklahoma.

 7   And from the Federal law perspective, there is certainly

 8   a rational basis in treating those two couples the same

 9   way.

10                  If I could reserve my time.

19                  The equal protection analysis in this case

21   does Section 3 do.      And second, to whom does Section 3

22   do it?

23                  What Section 3 does is exclude from an array

24   of Federal benefits lawfully married couples.                         That

25   means that the spouse of a soldier killed in the line of

 1   duty cannot receive the dignity and solace of an

 2   official notification of next of kin.

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I suppose your -

 4   you agree that Congress could go the other way, right?

 5   Congress could pass a new law today that says, we will

 6   give Federal benefits.       When we say "marriage" in

 7   Federal law, we mean same -- committed same-sex couples

 8   as well, and that could apply across the board?                    Or do

 9   you think that they couldn't do that?

10               GENERAL VERRILLI:              We think that wouldn't

11   raise an equal protection problem like this statute

12   does, Mr. Chief Justice.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, no, my point

14   is it wouldn't -- you don't think it would raise a

15   federalism problem either, do you?

16               GENERAL VERRILLI:              I don't think it would

17   raise a federalism problem.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Okay.

19               GENERAL VERRILLI:              And I -- but the key for

20   the -- for the -- our purposes is that, in addition to

21   denying these fundamental important -- fundamentally

22   important benefits, is who they are being denied to.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So just to be clear,

24   you don't think there is a federalism problem with what

25   Congress has done in DOMA?

 4                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              The question is what is

 5   the constitutionality for equal protection purposes, and

 6   because it's unconstitutional and it's embedded into

 7   numerous Federal statutes, those statutes will have an

 8   unconstitutional effect.            But it's the equal protection

 9   violation from -- from the perspective of the United

10   States that -

11                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             You think Congress can use

12   its powers to supercede the traditional authority and

13   prerogative of the States to regulate marriage in all

14   respects?     Congress could have a uniform definition of

15   marriage that includes age, consanguinity, et cetera, et

16   cetera?

17                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              No, I'm not saying that,

18   Your Honor.     I think if Congress passed such a statute,

19   then we would have to consider how to defend it.                       But

20   that's not -

21                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, but then there is a

22   federalism interest at stake here.                       And I thought you

23   told the Chief Justice there was not.

24                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, with respect to

25   Section 3 of DOMA, the problem is an equal protection

 1   problem from the point of view of the United States.

 2                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Yes, but General, surely the

 3   question of what the Federal interests are and whether

 4   those Federal interests should take account of the

 5   historic State prerogatives in this area is relevant to

 6   the equal protection inquiry?

 7                GENERAL VERRILLI:              It's central to the

 8   inquiry, Justice Kagan.         I completely agree with that

 9   point.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Oh, so it would be

11   central to the inquiry if Congress went the other way,

12   too?

13                GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, the difference is

14   what Section 3 does is impose this exclusion from

15   Federal benefits on a class that has undeniably been

16   subject to a history of terrible discrimination on the

17   basis of character -

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I understand that.

19   That's your equal protection argument.                     It's not very

20   responsive to my concern that I'm trying to get an

21   answer to.   You don't think federalism concerns come

22   into play at all in this, right?

23                GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, I think -- I want

24   -- I just want to clarify.             The equal protection

25   question would be different than the other circumstance.

 1   That's a matter of -

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     I know the equal

 3   protection argument would be different.

 4               GENERAL VERRILLI:              But the federalism

 5   concerns come into play in the following way in that Mr.

 6   Clement has made the argument that, look, whatever

 7   States can do in terms of recognizing marriage or not

 8   recognizing marriage, the Federal government has

 9   commensurate authority to do or not do.                     We don't think

10   that's right as a matter of our equal protection

11   analysis because we don't think the Federal government

12   should be thought of as the 51st State.                     States, as we

13   told the Court, yesterday we believe heightened scrutiny

14   ought to apply even to the State decisions -

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But you're -- you are

16   insisting that we get to a very fundamental question

17   about equal protection, but we don't do that unless we

18   assume the law is valid otherwise to begin with.                     And we

19   are asking is it valid otherwise.                     Is -- what is the

20   Federal interest in enacting this statute and is it a

21   valid Federal interest assuming -- before we get to the

22   equal protection analysis?

23               GENERAL VERRILLI:              Yes.         We think whatever

24   the outer bounds of the Federal government's authority,

25   and there certainly are outer bounds, would be, apart

                                     84

 1   from the equal protection violation, we don't think that

 2   Section 3 apart from equal protection analysis raises a

 3   federalism problem.       But we do think the federalism

 4   analysis does play into the equal protection analysis

 5   because the Federal -- the Federal government is not the

 6   51st state for purposes of -- of the interests that Mr.

 7   Clement has identified on behalf of BLAG.

 8                  JUSTICE ALITO:            Can I take you back to the

 9   example that you began with where a member of the

10   military is injured.        So let's say three soldiers are

11   injured and they are all in same-sex relationships, and

12   in each instance the other partner in this relationship

13   wants to visit the soldier in -- in a hospital.

14                  The first is a spouse in a State that allows

15   same-sex marriage, the second is a domestic partner in a

16   State that an allows that, but not same-sex marriage,

17   the third is in an equally committed loving relationship

18   in a State that doesn't involve either.                     Now, your

19   argument is that, under Federal law, the first would be

20   admitted -- should be admitted, but the other two would

21   be kept out?

22                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              The question in the case,

23   Justice Alito is whether Congress has a sufficiently

24   persuasive justification for the exclusion that it has

25   imposed.   And it -- and it does not.                    The only way in

                                        85

 1   which -- that BLAG's arguments for its -- for the

 2   constitutionality of this statute have any prospect of

 3   being upheld is if the Court adopts the minimal

 4   rationality standard of Lee Optical.                     But the

 5   fundamental -

 6                JUSTICE ALITO:              Let me take you back to the

 7   example.   Your -- your position seems to me, yes, one

 8   gets in, two stay out, even though your legal arguments

 9   would lead to the conclusion that they all should be

10   treated the same.

11                GENERAL VERRILLI:                Well, the question before

12   the Court is whether the exclusion that DOMA imposes

13   violates equal protection, and it does violate equal

14   protection because you can't treat this as though it

15   were just a distinction between optometrists and

16   ophthalmologists, as the Lee Optical case did.                     This is

17   a different kind of a situation because the

18   discrimination here is being visited on a group that has

19   historically been subject to terrible discrimination on

20   the basis of personal -

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:              But that's -- that's the

22   same in the example that we just gave you, that

23   discrimination would have been visited on the same

24   group, and you say there it's okay.

25                GENERAL VERRILLI:                No, I didn't say that.         I

                                        86

 1   said it would be subject to equal protection analysis,

 2   certainly, and there might be a problem.

 3                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            So you think that's bad as

 4   well, that all three of those has to be treated the

 5   same, despite State law about marriage.

 6                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              But the issue -- they

 7   have to be analyzed under equal protections principles,

 8   but whatever is true about the other situations.                    In the

 9   situation in which the couple is lawfully married for

10   purposes of State law and the exclusion is a result of

11   DOMA itself, the exclusion has to be justified under

12   this Court's equal protection analysis, and DOMA doesn't

13   do it.

14                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               General Verrilli, I have

15   a question.     You think, I think from your brief

16   yesterday and today, that on some level sexual

17   orientation should be looked on an intermediate standard

18   of scrutiny?

19                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              Yes, Your Honor.

20                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               All right, heightened in

21   some way.     Going back to the Chief's question about a

22   law that was passed recognizing common law

23   heterosexual -- homosexual marriages.                    I think even

24   under your theory that might be suspect because -- that

25   law might be suspect under equal protection because once

                                        87

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   we say sexual orientation is suspect, it would be

 2   suspect whether it's homosexual or heterosexual.                      The

 3   law favors homosexuals, it would be suspect because it's

 4   based on sexual orientation.

 5               GENERAL VERRILLI:                 You would have -- you

 6   would have to impose the -- the heightened scrutiny

 7   equal protection analysis, sure.

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  Exactly.      And so when we

 9   decided race was a suspect class, people who are not

10   blacks have received -

11               GENERAL VERRILLI:                 Yes, that's certainly -

12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  -- strict scrutiny on

13   whether the use of race as a class, whether they are

14   white or a black, is justified by a compelling interest.

15               GENERAL VERRILLI:                 That -- that is certainly

16   true, Your Honor.     If I could turn to the interest that

17   BLAG has actually identified as supporting this statute,

18   I think there are -- there are -- I think that you can

19   see what the problem is here.

20               Now, this statute is not called the Federal

21   Uniform Marriage Benefits Act; it's called the Defense

22   of Marriage Act.    And the reason for that is because the

23   statute is not directed at uniformity in the

24   administration of Federal benefits.                      All -- there is two

25   equally uniform systems, the system of respecting the

                                        88

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   State choices and the system of -- that BLAG is

 2   advocating here.

 3                And what BLAG's got to do in order to

 4   satisfy equal protection scrutiny is justify the choice

 5   between one and the other.              And the difference between

 6   the two is that the Section 3 choice is a choice that --

 7   Section 3 choice is a choice that discriminates.                      And so

 8   it's not simply a matter sufficient to say, well,

 9   uniformity is enough.        Section 3 discriminates.                And

10   with respect -

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     So as soon as one

12   State adopted same sex marriage, the definition of

13   marriage throughout the Federal code had to change?

14   Because there is no doubt that up until that point every

15   time Congress said "marriage" they understood they were

16   acting under the traditional definition of marriage.

17                GENERAL VERRILLI:               Well, I don't know,

18   Mr. Chief Justice, why you wouldn't assume that what

19   Congress was doing when it enacted a statute,

20   particularly a statute that had the word "marriage" in

21   it, was assuming that the normal rule that applies in

22   the vast majority of circumstances of deference to the

23   State definition of marriage would be the operative

24   principle.

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     So you don't think

                                       89

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that when Congress said "marriage" in every one of these

 2   provisions that they had in mind same-sex marriages?

 3                GENERAL VERRILLI:              No, but they may well

 4   have had in mind deferring to the normal State

 5   definition of marriage, whatever it is.                Not that they

 6   were making the specific choice that my friend suggested

 7   they were.   But whatever is the case, when Congress

 8   enacted DOMA that choice of exclusion has to be

 9   justified under appropriate equal protection principles.

10                And so the issue of uniformity just doesn't

11   get you there because there is no uniformity advantage

12   to Section 3 of DOMA as opposed to the traditional rule.

13   The issue of administration doesn't get you there.                  I

14   mean, at a very basic level administrative concerns

15   ought not be an important enough interest to justify

16   this kind of a discrimination under the Equal Protection

17   Clause.

18                But even if you look at them, there are no

19   genuine administrative benefits to DOMA.                If anything,

20   DOMA -- Section 3 of DOMA makes Federal administration

21   more difficult because now the Federal government has to

22   look behind valid State marriage licenses and see

23   whether they are about State marriages that are out of

24   compliance with DOMA.

25                It's an additional administrative burden.

                                      90

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   So there is no administrative -- there is no

 2   administrative advantage to be gained here by what -- by

 3   what Congress sought to achieve.                    And the fundamental

 4   reality of it is, and I think the House report makes

 5   this glaringly clear, is that DOMA was not enacted for

 6   any purpose of uniformity, administration, caution,

 7   pausing, any of that.

 8                  It was enacted to exclude same-sex married

 9   -- lawfully married couples from Federal benefit regimes

10   based on a conclusion that was driven by moral

11   disapproval.     It is quite clear in black and white in

12   the pages of the House report which we cite on page 38

13   of our brief -

14                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So that was the view

15   of the 84 Senators who voted in favor of it and the

16   President who signed it?            They were motivated by animus?

17                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              No, Mr. Chief Justice.

18   We quoted our -- we quoted the Garrett concurrence in

19   our brief.     And I think there is a lot of wisdom there,

20   that it may well not have been animus or hostility.                       It

21   may well have been what Garrett described as the simple

22   want of careful reflection or an instinctive response to

23   a class of people, or a group of people who we perceive

24   as alien or other.

25                  But whatever the explanation, whether it's

                                        91

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   animus, whether it's that -- more subtle, more

 2   unthinking, more reflective kind of discrimination,

 3   Section 3 is discrimination.             And I think it's time for

 4   the Court to recognize that this discrimination,

 5   excluding lawfully married gay and lesbian couples from

 6   Federal benefits, cannot be reconciled with our

 7   fundamental commitment to equal treatment under law.

 8               This is discrimination in its most very

 9   basic aspect and the House Report, whether -- and I

10   certainly would not suggest that it was universally

11   motivated by something other than goodwill -- but the

12   reality is that it was an expression of moral

13   disapproval of exactly the kind that this Court said in

14   Lawrence would not justify the law that was struck down

15   there.

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               General, your bottom

17   line is, it's an equal protection violation for the

18   Federal government, and all States as well?

19               GENERAL VERRILLI:              Yes, Your Honor, and

20   that's the -- we took the position we took yesterday

21   with respect to marriage -- the analysis -

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Is there any argument

23   you can make to limit this to this case, vis--vis the

24   Federal government and not the States?

25               GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, as we said

 1   yesterday, we think it's an open question with respect

 2   to State recognition of marriage, and they may well be

 3   able to advance interests -- they may be able to advance

 4   it.    I guess I shouldn't say "may well," because I do

 5   think it would be difficult, as we said yesterday.                  They

 6   may be able to advance interests that would satisfy

 7   heightened scrutiny and justify non-recognition -

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Then yet -- but here -

 9                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              But -- but here, the

10   Federal government's not in the same position because as

11   BLAG concedes, the Federal government at the most can

12   act at the margins in influencing these decisions about

13   marriage and child rearing at the State level.                And the

14   Second Circuit and the First Circuit both concluded that

15   there's no connection at all, and that's of course

16   because Section 3 doesn't make it any more likely that

17   unmarried men and women in States that -- unmarried men

18   and women who confront an unplanned pregnancy are going

19   to get married.

20                 And -- and elimination of Section 3 wouldn't

21   make it any less likely that unmarried men and women are

22   going to get married.        It doesn't have any effect at

23   all.    It doesn't have any connection at all.              So it's

24   not at the margins.      There's no interest at all at

25   this -- in DOMA in promoting -

 1                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Or if there's no

 2   interest -- I mean, I'm back where we were yesterday.

 3   It seems to me, forgetting your -- your preferable

 4   argument, it's a violation of equal protection

 5   everywhere.     Well, if it is, then all States have to

 6   have something like pacts.               And if they have to have

 7   something like pacts, then you say then they also have

 8   to allow marriage.

 9                  So then are you not arguing they all have to

10   allow marriage?     And then you say no.                    All right, so

11   with that point -

12                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              But our point here,

15                  Whatever the issue is, with -- whatever the

16   outcome is with respect to States and marriage, that the

17   Federal government's interest in advancing those

18   justifications through Section 3 of DOMA is so

19   attenuated that two Federal courts of appeals have seen

20   it as non-existent, and it cannot justify Section 3.

 1   please the Court:

 2                I'd like to focus on why DOMA fails even

 3   under rationality review.             Because of DOMA, many

 4   thousands of people who are legally married under the

 5   laws of nine sovereign States and the District of

 6   Columbia are being treated as unmarried by the Federal

 7   government solely because they are gay.

 8                These couples are being treated as unmarried

 9   with respect to programs that affect family stability,

10   such as the Family Leave Act, referred to by Justice

11   Ginsburg.   These couples are being treated as unmarried

12   for purposes of Federal conflict of interest rules,

13   election laws, and anti-nepotism and judicial recusal

14   statutes.

15                And my client was treated as unmarried when

16   her spouse passed away, so that she had to pay $363,000

17   in estate taxes on the property that they had

18   accumulated during their 44 years together.

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      Could I ask you the

20   same question I asked the Solicitor General?

21                Do you think there would be a problem if

22   Congress went the other way, the federalism problem?

23   Obviously, you don't think there's an equal protection

24   problem -

25                MS. KAPLAN:          Right.

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- but a federalism

 2   issue, Congress said, we're going to recognize same-sex

 3   couples -- committed same-sex couples -- even if the

 4   State doesn't, for purposes of Federal law?

 5                MS. KAPLAN:        Obviously, with respect to

 6   marriage, the Federal government has always used the

 7   State definitions.     And I think what you're --

 8   Mr. Chief Justice, what you're proposing is to extend -

 9   the Federal government extend additional benefits to gay

10   couples in States that do not allow marriage, to

11   equalize the system.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I just am asking

13   whether you think Congress has the power to interfere

14   with the -- to not adopt the State definition, if

15   they're extending benefits.             Do they have that

16   authority?

17                MS. KAPLAN:        I think the question under the

18   Equal Protection Clause is what -- is what the

19   distinction is.

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    No, no.   I know

21   that.

22                You're following the lead of the Solicitor

23   General and returning to the Equal Protection Clause

24   every time I ask a federalism question.

25                Is there any problem under federalism

 1   principles?

 2                 MS. KAPLAN:        With the Federal government -

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    With Congress

 4   passing a law saying, we are going to adopt a different

 5   definition of marriage than those States that don't

 6   recognize same-sex marriage.               We don't care whether you

 7   do as a matter of State law, when it comes to Federal

 8   benefits, same-sex marriage will be recognized.

 9                 MS. KAPLAN:        It has certainly been argued in

10   this case by others that -- whether or not that's in the

11   enumerated powers of the Federal government.                         For the

12   reasons Justice Kagan mentioned, we think the federalism

13   principles go forward a novelty question.                      I think

14   whether or not the Federal government could have its own

15   definition of marriage for all purposes would be a very

16   closely argued question.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't understand your

18   answer.    Is your answer yes or no?                    Is there a

19   federalism problem with that or isn't there a federalism

20   problem?

21                 MS. KAPLAN:        I -- I think the Federal

22   government could extend benefits to gay couples to

23   equalize things on a programmatic basis to make things

24   more equal.    Whether the Federal government can have its

25   own definition of marriage, I think, would be -- there's

 1   a -- it'd be very closely argued whether that's outside

 2   the enumerated approach.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, it's just -- all

 4   these statutes use the term "marriage," and the Federal

 5   government says in all these statutes when it says

 6   marriage, it includes same-sex couples, whether the

 7   State acknowledges them to be married or not.

 8                MS. KAPLAN:        But that -- I don't know if

 9   that would work because they wouldn't -

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:            What do you mean whether or

11   not it would work?     I don't care if it works.

12                (Laughter.)

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Does it -- does it create a

14   federalism problem?

15                MS. KAPLAN:        The power to marry people is a

16   power that rests with the States.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yes.

18                MS. KAPLAN:        The Federal government doesn't

19   issue marriage licenses.          It never has.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, it's not doing that,

21   it's just saying for purposes -- just what it's doing

22   here.   It says, for purposes of all these Federal

23   statutes, when we say marriage, we mean -- instead of

24   saying we mean heterosexual marriage, we mean, whenever

25   we use it, heterosexual and homosexual marriage.

 1                 If that's what it says, can it do that?

 2                 MS. KAPLAN:        As long as the people were

 3   validly married under State law, and met the

 4   requirements of State law to get married -

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            No, no, no, no.         It

 6   includes -

 7                 MS. KAPLAN:        I'm not sure that the Federal

 8   government -- this answers your question,

 9   Justice Scalia -- I'm not sure the Federal government

10   can create a new Federal marriage that would be some

11   kind of marriage that States don't permit.

12                 JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, let me get to the

13   question I asked Mr. Clement.                It just gets rid of the

14   word "marriage," takes it out of the U.S. Code

15   completely.    Substitutes something else, and defines it

16   as same-sex -- to include same-sex couples.                     Surely it

17   could do that.

18                 MS. KAPLAN:        Yes.        That would not be based

19   on the State's -

20                 JUSTICE ALITO:            So it's just the word

21   "marriage"?    And it's just the fact that they use this

22   term "marriage"?

23                 MS. KAPLAN:        Well, that's what the Federal

24   government has always chosen to do.                     And that's the way

25   the Federal law is structured, and it's always been

                                       99

 1   structured for 200 years based on the State police power

 2   to define who's married.            The Federal government, I

 3   presume, could decide to change that if it wanted, and

 4   somehow, it would be very strange for all 1,100 laws,

 5   but for certain programs -- you have different

 6   requirements other than marriage, and that would be

 7   constitutional or unconstitutional depending on the

 8   distinction.

 9                  JUSTICE ALITO:           But if the estate tax

10   follows State law, would not that create an equal

11   protection problem similar to the one that exists here?

12   Suppose there were a dispute about the -- the State of

13   residence of your client and her partner or spouse.                      Was

14   it New York, was it some other State where same-sex

15   marriage would not have been recognized?                   And suppose

16   there was -- the State court said the State of residence

17   is a State where it's not recognized.

18                  Would -- would you not have essentially the

19   same equal protection argument there that you have now?

20                  MS. KAPLAN:        Well, let me -- let me answer

21   that question very clearly.               Our position is only with

22   respect to the nine States -- and I think there are two

23   others that recognize these marriages.                   So if my

24   client -- if a New York couple today marries and moves

25   to North Carolina, one of which has a constitutional

                                       100

 1   amendment, a State constitutional amendment -- and one

 2   of the spouses dies, they would not -- since estate

 3   taxes determine where the person dies, they would not be

 4   entitled to the deduction.

 5                  That is not our claim here.

 6                  Moreover, Justice Alito, in connection with

 7   a whole host of Federal litigation, there has been

 8   Federal litigation for hundreds of years with respect to

 9   the residency of where people live or don't live, or

10   whether they are divorced or not divorced throughout the

11   Federal system.     And the Federal government has always

12   handled that and has never before -- and we believe this

13   is why it's unconstitutional -- separated out a class of

14   married gay couples solely because they were gay.

15                  JUSTICE ALITO:           Just -- if I could follow up

16   with one -- one question.             What if the -- the

17   hypothetical surviving spouse, partner in North

18   Carolina, brought an equal protection argument, saying

19   that there is no -- it is unconstitutional to treat me

20   differently because I am a resident of North Carolina

21   rather than a resident of New York.                      What would be -

22   would that be discrimination on the basis of sexual

23   orientation?     What would be the level of scrutiny?

24   Would it survive?

25                  MS. KAPLAN:        That would be certainly a

                                       101

 1   different case.    It'd be more similar to the case I

 2   think you heard yesterday than the case that we have

 3   today.   We certainly believe that sexual-orientation

 4   discrimination should get heightened scrutiny.               If it

 5   doesn't get heightened scrutiny, obviously, it'd be

 6   rational basis, and the question would be what the State

 7   interests were in not allowing couples, for example, in

 8   North Carolina who are gay to get married.

 9                No one has identified in this case, and I

10   don't think we've heard it in the argument from my

11   friend, any legitimate difference between married gay

12   couples on the one hand and straight married couples on

13   the other that can possibly explain the sweeping,

14   undifferentiated, and categorical discrimination of

15   DOMA, Section 3 of DOMA.

16                And no one has identified any legitimate

17   Federal interest that is being served by Congress's

18   decision, for the first time in our nation's history to

19   undermine the determinations of the sovereign States

20   with respect to eligibility for marriage.               I would

21   respectfully contend that this is because there is none.

22                Rather, as the title of the statute makes

23   clear, DOMA was enacted to defend against the marriages

24   of gay people.    This discriminatory purpose was rooted

25   in moral disapproval as Justice Kagan pointed out.

 1                  JUSTICE BREYER:            What -- what do you think

 2   of his -- the argument that I heard was, to put the

 3   other side, at least one part of it as I understand it

 4   said, look, the Federal government needs a uniform rule.

 5   There has been this uniform one man, one woman rule for

 6   several hundred years or whatever, and there's a

 7   revolution going on in the States.                       We either adopt the

 8   resolution -- the revolution or push it along a little,

 9   or we stay out of it.         And I think Mr. Clement was

10   saying, well, we've decided to stay out of it.

11                  MS. KAPLAN:        I don't -

12                  JUSTICE BREYER:            And the way to stay out of

13   it is to go with the traditional thing.                       I mean, that -

14   that's an argument.       So your answer to that argument is

15   what?

16                  MS. KAPLAN:        I think it's an incorrect

17   argument, Justice Breyer, for the -

18                  JUSTICE BREYER:            I understand you do, I'd

19   like to know the reason.

20                  (Laughter.)

21                  MS. KAPLAN:        Of course.              Congress did not

22   stay out of it.     Section 3 of DOMA is not staying out of

23   it.     Section 3 of DOMA is stopping the recognition by

24   the Federal government of couples who are already

25   married, solely based on their sexual orientation, and

                                       103

 1   what it's doing is undermining, as you can see in the

 2   briefs of the States of New York and others, it's

 3   undermining the policy decisions made by those States

 4   that have permitted gay couples to marry.

 5                  States that have already resolved the

 6   cultural, the political, the moral -- whatever other

 7   controversies, they're resolved in those States.                      And by

 8   fencing those couples off, couples who are already

 9   married, and treating them as unmarried for purposes of

10   Federal law, you're not -- you're not taking it one step

11   at a time, you're not promoting caution, you're putting

12   a stop button on it, and you're having discrimination

13   for the first time in our country's history against a

14   class of married couples.

15                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Is the -

16                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Now, the -- the

17   discriminations are not the sexual orientation, but on a

18   class of marriage, is that what you're -

19                  MS. KAPLAN:        It's a class of married couples

20   who are gay.

21                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So I pose the same

22   question I posed to the General to you.                      Do you think

23   there's a difference between that discrimination and

24   this -- and the discrimination of States who say

25   homosexuals can't get married?

 1               MS. KAPLAN:          I think that it's -- they're

 2   different cases.   I think when you have couples who are

 3   gay who are already married, you have to distinguish

 4   between those classes.         Again, the Federal government

 5   doesn't give marriage licenses, States do.                       And whatever

 6   the issues would be in those States would be what

 7   interest the States have, as opposed to here, what

 8   interest -- and we think there is none -- the Federal

 9   government has.

10               There is little doubt that the answer to the

11   question of why Congress singled out gay people's

12   marriages for disrespect through DOMA.                       The answer can't

13   be uniformity as we've discussed.                       It can't be cost

14   savings because you still have to explain then why the

15   cost savings is being wrought at the expense of married

16   couples who are gay.       And it can't be any of the State

17   interests that weren't discussed, but questions of

18   family law in parenting and marriage are done by the

19   States, not by the Federal government.

20               The only -- the only conclusion that can be

21   drawn is what was in the House Report, which is moral

22   disapproval of gay people, which the Congress thought

23   was permissible in 1996 because it relied on the Court's

24   Bowers decision, which this Court has said was wrong,

25   not only at the time it was overruled in Lawrence, but

                                      105

 1   was wrong when it was decided.

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                       So 84 Senators -

 3   it's the same question I asked before.                       84 Senators

 4   based their vote on moral disapproval of gay people?

 5               MS. KAPLAN:           No, I think -- I think what is

 6   true, Mr. Chief Justice, is that times can blind, and

 7   that back in 1996 people did not have the understanding

 8   that they have today.         That there is no distinction,

 9   there is no constitutionally permissible distinction -

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                       Well, does that

11   mean -- times can blind.            Does that mean they did not

12   base their votes on moral disapproval?

13               MS. KAPLAN:           No, some clearly did.              I think

14   it was based on an understanding that gay -- an

15   incorrect understanding that gay couples were

16   fundamentally different than straight couples, an

17   understanding that I don't think exists today.                       And

18   that's the sense I'm using that times can blind.                       I

19   think there was -- we all can understand that people

20   have moved on this, and now understand that there is no

21   such distinction.     So I'm not saying it was animus or

22   bigotry, I think it was based on a misunderstanding on

23   gay people and their -

 1   many States permit gay -- gay couples to marry?

 2               MS. KAPLAN:           Today?          Nine, Your Honor.

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Nine.          And -- and so there

 4   has been this sea change between now and 1996.

 5               MS. KAPLAN:           I think with respect to the

 6   understanding of gay people and their relationships

 7   there has been a sea change, Your Honor.

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:                 How many States have

 9   civil unions now?

10               MS. KAPLAN:           I believe -- that was discussed

11   in the arguments, eight or nine, I believe.

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:                 And how many had it in

13   1996?

14               MS. KAPLAN:           I -- yes, it was much, much

15   fewer at the time.      I don't have that number, Justice

16   Ginsburg, I apologize.

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                       I suppose the sea

18   change has a lot to do with the political force and

19   effectiveness of people representing, supporting your

20   side of the case?

21               MS. KAPLAN:           I disagree with that,

22   Mr. Chief Justice, I think the sea change has to do,

23   just as discussed was Bowers and Lawrence, was an

24   understanding that there is no difference -- there was

25   fundamental difference that could justify this kind of

                                       107

 1   -- categorical discrimination between gay couples and

 2   straight couples.

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                        You don't doubt that

 4   the lobby supporting the enactment of same sex-marriage

 5   laws in different States is politically powerful, do

 6   you?

 7               MS. KAPLAN:           With respect to that category,

 8   that categorization of the term for purposes of

 9   heightened scrutiny, I would, Your Honor.                           I don't -

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                        Really?

11               MS. KAPLAN:           Yes.

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                        As far as I can

13   tell, political figures are falling over themselves to

14   endorse your side of the case.

15               MS. KAPLAN:           The fact of the matter is,

16   Mr. Chief Justice, is that no other group in recent

17   history has been subjected to popular referenda to take

18   away rights that have already been given or exclude

19   those rights, the way gay people have.                        And only two of

20   those referenda have ever lost.                   One was in Arizona, it

21   then passed a couple years later.                        One was in Minnesota

22   where they already have a statute on the books that

23   prohibits marriages between gay people.

24               So I don't think -- and until 1990 gay

25   people were not allowed to enter this country.                          So I

                                       108

 1   don't think that the political power of gay people today

 2   could possibly be seen within that framework, and

 3   certainly is analogous -- I think gay people are far

 4   weaker than the women were at the time of Frontiero.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, but you just

 6   referred to a sea change in people's understandings and

 7   values from 1996, when DOMA was enacted.                    And I'm just

 8   trying to see where that comes from, if not from the

 9   political effectiveness of -- of groups on your side of

10   the case.

11               MS. KAPLAN:        To flip the language of the

12   House Report, Mr. Chief Justice, I think it comes from a

13   moral understanding today that gay people are no

14   different, and that gay married couples' relationships

15   are not significantly different from the relationships

16   of straight married couples.             I don't think -

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I understand that.

18   I am just trying to see how -- where that that moral

19   understanding came from, if not the political

20   effectiveness of a particular group.

21               MS. KAPLAN:        I -- I think it came -- is,

22   again is very similar to the, what you saw between

23   Bowers and Lawrence.     I think it came to a societal

24   understanding.

25               I don't believe that societal understanding

                                    109

 1   came strictly through political power.                      And I don't

 2   think that gay people today have political power as that

 3   -- this Court has used that term with -- in connection

 4   with the heightened scrutiny analysis.

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you,

 6   Ms. Kaplan.

 7                 Mr. Clement, you have 3 minutes remaining.

 8             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 9         ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT BIPARTISAN LEGAL

10             ADVISORY GROUP OF THE UNITED STATES

11                 MR. CLEMENT:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

12   just three points in rebuttal.

13                 First of all, I was not surprised to hear

14   the Solicitor General concede that there is no unique

15   federalism problem with DOMA because in the Gill

16   litigation in the First Circuit, the State of

17   Massachusetts -- the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

18   invoked the Tenth Amendment, and on that issue the

19   United States continued to defend DOMA because there is

20   no unique federalism problem with it, as the Chief

21   Justice's question suggested.                If 10 years from now

22   there are only 9 States left and Congress wants to adopt

23   a uniform Federal law solely for Federal law purposes to

24   going the other way, it is fully entitled to do that.

25   It has the power to do that.

                                      110

 1                I would say also the Federal government has

 2   conceded in this litigation that there is a rational

 3   basis for this statute, something else to keep in mind.

 4                I would also say that this provision is not

 5   so unique.   The very next provision in the Dictionary

 6   Act -

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Rational basis,

 8   Mr. Clement -- is a problem in your briefing.                         You seem

 9   to say and you repeat it today that there is three

10   tiers, and if you get into rational basis, then it's

11   anything goes.   But the history of this Court is, in the

12   very first gender discrimination case, Reed v. Reed, the

13   Court did something it had never done in the history of

14   the country under rational basis.                      There was no

15   intermediate tier then.         It was rational basis.

16                MR. CLEMENT:         Well -

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And yet the Court said

18   this is rank discrimination and it failed.

19                MR. CLEMENT:         And, Justice Ginsburg,

20   applying rational basis to DOMA, I think that there are

21   many rational bases that support it.                      And the Solicitor

22   General says, well -- you know, the United States is not

23   the 51st State to be sure, but the Federal government

24   has interests in uniformity that no other entity has.

25                And we heard today that there's a problem

                                     111

 1   when somebody moves from New York to North Carolina,

 2   they can lose their benefits.                The Federal government

 3   uniquely, unlike the 50 States, can say, well, that

 4   doesn't make any sense, we are going to have the same

 5   rule.    We don't want somebody, if they are going to be

 6   transferred in the military from West Point to Fort Sill

 7   in Oklahoma, to resist the transfer because they are

 8   going to lose some benefits.

 9                 It makes sense to have a uniform Federal

10   rule for the Federal government.                   It is not so anomalous

11   that the term "marriage" is defined in the U.S. Code.

12   The very next provision of the Dictionary Act defines

13   "child."    These terms, although they are the primary

14   province of State governments, do appear in multiple

15   Federal statutes and it's a Federal role to define those

16   terms.

17                 The last point I would simply make is in

18   thinking about animus, think about the fact that

19   Congress asked the Justice Department three times about

20   the constitutionality of the statute.                   That's not what

21   you do when you are motivated by animus.                   The first two

22   times they got back the answer it was constitutional.

23   The third time, they asked again in the wake of Romer,

24   and they got the same answer, it's constitutional.

25                 Now the Solicitor General wants to say,

                                      112

 1   well, it was want of careful reflection?                     Well, where do

 2   we get careful reflection in our system?                     Generally,

 3   careful reflection comes in the democratic process.                       The

 4   democratic process requires people to persuade people.

 5                The reason there has been a sea change is a

 6   combination of political power, as defined by this

 7   Court's cases as getting the attention of lawmakers,

 8   certainly they have that.           But it's also persuasion.

 9   That's what the democratic process requires.                     You have

10   to persuade somebody you're right.                     You don't label them

11   a bigot.   You don't label them as motivated by animus.

12   You persuade them you are right.

13                That's going on across the country.

14   Colorado, the State that brought you Amendment 2, has

15   just recognized civil unions.               Maine, that was pointed

16   to in the record in this case as being evidence of the

17   persistence of discrimination because they voted down a

18   statewide referendum, the next election cycle it came

19   out the other way.

20                And the Federal Congress is not immune.

21   They repealed "Don't Ask, Don't Tell."                     Allow the

22   democratic process to continue.

23                Thank you, Your Honor.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel,

25   counsel.
