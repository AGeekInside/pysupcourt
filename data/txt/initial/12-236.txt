 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Case 12-236, Sebelius v. Cloer.

 5                  Mr. Horwich.

 6                ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH

 7                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8             MR. HORWICH:    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10                  The Vaccine Act does not provide for an

11   award of attorneys' fees on a petition that is denied as

12   untimely.     That's the best reading of the Act's text, it

13   fits best with the structure and purposes of the Act,

14   and it's the result that's consistent with the canons of

15   construction that would apply to an award of attorneys'

16   fees out of the Federal Treasury.

17                  Now, the -- the textual question here in

18   some sense begins with the statute of limitations, which

19   is in Section 16 the Act, and which provides that no

20   petition may be filed outside the applicable time

21   period.

22                  Now, that provision, like most limitations

23   provisions, doesn't itself actually say what the

24   consequences of the failure to comply with the provision

25   are.   And in some sense, just as in the -- the civil

                                         3

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   context, it's not as if the Special Master, upon finding

 2   the limitations provision hasn't been complied with, can

 3   go back in time and prevent the petition from being

 4   filed, just as a civil court can't prevent an action

 5   from being commenced, or a suit from being brought, or

 6   whatever the limitations provision proscribes.

 7               So the question really is going forward,

 8   what -- what consequences should there be once the

 9   adjudicator decides -- once he or the Special Master

10   decides -- that the limitations period has not been

11   complied with.   And textually speaking, it's the

12   correspondence between the limitations provision, which

13   says that no petition may be filed, and the attorneys'

14   fee provision, which depends on the existence of a

15   petition filed, that signals that Congress intended the

16   consequences of untimeliness to be visited through the

17   application of the attorneys' fees provision -

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Mr. Horwich -

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               There are other -- there

20   are other provisions that refer to a petition filed.

21   For example, reporting annually to Congress, publishing

22   a notice in the Federal Register, those both refer to

23   any petition filed.     And so in those sections at least,

24   petition filed would assume petition filed after the

25   running of the statute of limitations.

 1               MR. HORWICH:            Well, those provisions

 2   would -- those provisions by their terms apply at points

 3   in the proceedings where we would entirely

 4   conventionally accept the -- the claimant's

 5   representation that the petition has been filed in

 6   accordance with the time limitation.                     That's generally

 7   true, certainly in the civil context, that we accept the

 8   plaintiff's allegation.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:                 But don't you -- don't

10   you put in the Federal Register and report to Congress

11   petitions that had been filed out of time?

12               MR. HORWICH:            Well, with respect to -- with

13   respect to reporting to -- to Congress, that's actually

14   an obligation from the Court of Federal Claims, so I

15   can't necessarily speak on their behalf of what they -

16   what they've produced.          From what I've seen, it's a

17   statistical report.

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:                 Well, think about the

19   Federal Register.

20               MR. HORWICH:            The Federal -- with respect to

21   the Federal Register provision, I should first say that

22   it has very recently come to my office's attention that

23   the Department of Health and Human Services has not been

24   complying with that provision for the last few years,

25   and they are taking steps to bring themselves in -

                                         5

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              So they don't file

 2   anything in the Federal Register?

 3                MR. HORWICH:         Well, it -- they -- they have

 4   historically, and let me -- up till about 2009 -- and

 5   again, to be clear, they're taking steps to rectify that

 6   situation.   But with respect to the period up to 2009,

 7   what they would do -- and this is understandable given

 8   the -- the provision that says it's supposed to be

 9   published within -- and I believe it's 30 days, that

10   they -- the petitions that are received or that were

11   received at the Department get logged into a computer

12   database, and then a report gets printed out, and they

13   would cross-check them for accuracy against the petition

14   title and forward them to the Office of the Federal

15   Register.

16                It's not -- it doesn't -- it wouldn't make

17   sense in a provision that's supposed to be applied

18   essentially upon the filing of the petition, to go into

19   an examination of the timeliness of that -- of that

20   petition.

21                And so we think that provision, just as you

22   would -- just as you would describe in a civil context,

23   you would certainly say that an action that ultimately

24   proves to be held untimely would nonetheless commence

25   if -- for example, if you imagine a statute of

                                       6

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   limitations that says no action may be commenced, you

 2   wouldn't say the action hadn't been commenced at the

 3   time it was pending.       And -- and that's not the argument

 4   we're relying on here.

 5                 What -- rather, what we're relying on is the

 6   fact that when you get to the end of the case, which is

 7   where the attorneys' fee provision is evidently supposed

 8   to apply because -

 9                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Horwich, could you say a

10   little bit more about the reporting to Congress

11   provision because that presumably does not happen at the

12   very beginning, but happens more at the end or in the

13   middle.    So do -- does the Department subtract the

14   number of untimely petitions from the number that it

15   reports?

16                 MR. HORWICH:         I believe the -- the reporting

17   provision is a -- there's a report that the Special

18   Master is to make to the Court of Federal Claims, and

19   there's a report that the Court of Federal Claims is to

20   deliver and -- and those, from what I have seen -

21   again, the Executive Branch doesn't prepare those

22   because it's the Special Masters and the court that do,

23   but the reports that I have seen, my understanding is

24   that the report of the Special Master is delivered

25   orally to the judges, and so I don't actually know what

                                        7

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the contents of that are.          And the report that -- and

 2   the report that the Court of Federal Claims sends to

 3   Congress is a statistical report of all -- actually, of

 4   all actions filed in the Court of Federal Claims, but it

 5   sends a kind of an omnibus report in satisfaction of -

 6               JUSTICE KAGAN:            All actions filed, using

 7   "filed" in the normal sense.

 8               MR. HORWICH:         No, no.              I actually mean all

 9   actions filed meaning Vaccine Act actions and otherwise.

10   So it -- it actually doesn't even differentiate the

11   Vaccine Act -

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But is -- is the upshot of

13   your argument then that filing means different things

14   under different provisions of the Act?

15               MR. HORWICH:         Well, I think it means -

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And if that's so, it tends

17   to weaken the force of your reliance on -- on filing in

18   the statute -- on the word "filing" in the statute of

19   limitations section.

20               MR. HORWICH:         Well, I don't think it

21   means -- I don't think it means different things in the

22   Act so much as it means it -- it is to be applied with

23   the understand -- it is to be applied as the -- as a

24   fair stand at the time the provision is applied.

25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, I meant -- I meant

                                      8

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that just to supplement Justice Kagan's question.            I

 2   didn't mean to cut it off.

 3                  MR. HORWICH:         Well, let me -- let me focus

 4   for a moment then on the attorneys' fee provision,

 5   though, in terms of why -- why that is particularly good

 6   reason to think that petitions -- a petition filed is to

 7   be considered, in terms of what ought to have been done.

 8   And that's because the -- the attorneys' fee provision

 9   speaks as of -- it speaks of awards of fees at the time

10   of judgment.     And so at that time, we know that any

11   limitations issue should have been resolved by that

12   point in the case.

13                  And therefore, it is -- it is an entirely

14   natural -- it's entirely natural to expect that the

15   limitations provision might therefore have some

16   consequences at that stage.

17                  In some ways, you can think of it as an

18   application of the old maxim that equity regards as done

19   what ought to have been done.

20                  So we're saying to the Special Master, well,

21   if you've gotten to the point at the end of the case

22   where there's a judgment, and you've determined that

23   this petition was forbidden from being filed, in the

24   sense that the limitations provision forbids it, then

25   you should visit the consequences there.

 1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 That sounds like a

 2   jurisdictional argument to me.                 But I understand the

 3   government to be conceding that this statute of

 4   limitations is not jurisdictional.                      It's just a claim

 5   processing move.

 6               MR. HORWICH:           Well, if it sounds like a

 7   jurisdictional argument, then I suppose the answer would

 8   be for this Court to say that it's jurisdictional, and

 9   of course, if that's true, then our position -- our

10   position would prevail.

11               We think on balance, given this Court's

12   precedence most recently in the -- the Auburn Regional

13   Medical Center case, that these -- that this Court did

14   not interpret Congress's time limit provisions to be

15   endowed with jurisdictional significance.                      It doesn't

16   mean that it doesn't have any significance.                      It has the

17   significance of an ordinary affirmative defense, just as

18   it has the significance of the -- the timeliness

19   provision here just has the significance of an ordinary

20   affirmative defense, just as -

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      I just want to make

22   sure I heard you right.          You said if it sounds

23   jurisdictional, we should say it is, and you win.

24               MR. HORWICH:           Well, what I was saying -

25   what I was saying in response to Justice Sotomayor's

                                       10

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   question is that if -- if it seems that that argument

 2   compels you to believe that it's jurisdictional, then

 3   the Court should reach the conclusion that it's

 4   jurisdictional rather than -

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But your conclusion

 6   is that it is not jurisdictional.

 7               MR. HORWICH:         We think -- we think that it

 8   is not -- we think that it is not, even if the text of

 9   it makes it sound like it could have jurisdictional

10   significance, we think on balance, this Court's

11   precedents teach that time -- that time limits are

12   typically claim processing rules, and we don't think

13   that the text overcomes that view.

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Assume I accept -

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              So using Federal rules as

16   your model, and Federal rules list statute of

17   limitations as an affirmative defense.                    Ordinarily,

18   that's what it is.     But is it an affirmative -- well,

19   certainly it's an affirmative defense to any award of

20   compensation under the Vaccine Act.

21               But what makes it an affirmative defense to

22   the award of fees?

23               MR. HORWICH:         Well, it seems to -- there is

24   not anything in the compensation provision that says

25   that it's an affirmative defense any more than -- in any

                                     11

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   way that's more explicit than what we're relying on to

 2   say that it's an affirmative defense to attorneys' fees.

 3   It's not as if Congress said there -- in another section

 4   there shall be no award of future medical expenses when

 5   the statute of limitations is not complied with, and it

 6   left that out of the attorneys' fees.

 7               That's not how the statute is structured.

 8   So we're in a situation where I think we ordinarily are

 9   with statutes of limitation, in trying to decide what

10   the consequences of noncompliance are -

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Yes, one of -- one of

12   your -- your argument you were making is that there -

13   since the attorneys' fees provision looks to the end of

14   the case, it should not be construed to apply to the -

15   the failure to meet the filing deadline.

16               Is -- is that true?                 I mean, the statute

17   says if the judgment does not award compensation, on a

18   petition filed under Section 300aa-11 -- if the judgment

19   does -- is there no judgment when a -- when a case is

20   dismissed for failure to meet the statute requirement?

21               MR. HORWICH:          It -- it seems to us that the

22   appropriate disposition of a case that is held to be

23   untimely is that there is a judgment denying

24   compensation.   And the reasons for that have to do with

25   something that's not really briefed, but the operation

                                      12

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   of the appellate provisions of the Act -

 2                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Wait, so -

 3                  MR. HORWICH:         -- become confusing if you

 4   treat a dismissal as something different.

 5                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Other than the judgment.

 6   Okay.    So then -- then your argument that -- that this

 7   fee provision looks to the end of the case simply

 8   doesn't fly.     It looks to the beginning as well, if

 9   indeed dismissal for failure to comply with the time

10   limit is a judgment.

11                  MR. HORWICH:         Well, we think -- we agree

12   that it's a judgment, but it -- but it has to be a

13   judgment, I'm looking here at page 26A of the appendix

14   to the government's brief, refers to the judgment of the

16   such a petition refers back to a petition filed -

17                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well -

18                  MR. HORWICH:         -- and so that's -

19                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay.          That's just

20   repeating your -- your first argument.

21                  MR. HORWICH:         Well -- I -- but I do think

22   that -

23                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            That petition means -

24   means a petition properly filed, but I don't see that

25   the -- that the statutory scheme, the provision that's

 1   at issue here, the provision for the award of attorneys'

 2   fees looks to the end of the case and not to the

 3   beginning.   It looks to the judgment.                   And if it's a

 4   judgment that dismisses because of a failure to comply

 5   with the statute, it's still a judgment.

 6                MR. HORWICH:         It's still a judgment, but it

 7   is -- it is not a judgment in connection with a petition

 8   that should be regarded as having been filed timely -

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's your first argument.

10   I understand.

11                MR. HORWICH:         -- that is our first argument.

12   But let me say, it is also -- the -- the situation here

13   is not one in which we think that it's incumbent on the

14   government to -- to demonstrate clearly how Congress

15   wanted to withhold attorneys' fees.                    The canons of

16   construction here all caution the Court to be -- to be

17   extremely reluctant to extend or -- or find that

18   Congress is willing to pays attorneys' fees in -- in

19   this context.   And that's for -- and that's for several

20   reasons.

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, wait.         Congress has

22   waived sovereign immunity.             It's absolutely clear that

23   there's a waiver of sovereign immunity here.

24                MR. HORWICH:         It's clear that there's a

25   waiver, but it's -

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:            And once we find that, I

 2   don't think we nitpick the following language to

 3   unrealistically narrow it as much as possible.            I mean,

 4   the initial question of whether Congress has agreed to

 5   be sued is, yes, we -- we assume it hasn't and -- and -

 6   but -- but once it's clear that it has agreed to be

 7   sued, I think we just interpret the language reasonable.

 8               MR. HORWICH:         Well, Your Honor, I -- I -- I

 9   think this Court's decision certainly most recently in

10   the Cooper case, from a term or two ago, says that -

11   that this Court considers not only the existence but the

12   extent of the waiver of sovereign immunity to be

13   controlled by -- by canons that -- that counsel against

14   extending that -- extending that waiver.

15               But that's not the only issue here.            Because

16   the consequences of -- of Respondent's rule are ones

17   that -- that are entirely out of place both with fee

18   proceedings in general and with this compensation

19   program in particular.

20               JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Horwich, before you go

21   to the consequences argument, just to keep on with the

22   text a little bit, is this understanding that you have

23   of what it means to be filed, does it have any

24   consequences other than with respect to attorneys' fees,

25   or is that the only thing that -- that depends on

                                     15

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   viewing the word "filed" in this way?

 2               MR. HORWICH:         Well, I think viewing the word

 3   "filed" in this way also explains mechanically why the

 4   limitations issue becomes an affirmative defense on the

 5   merits as well because Section 13 says compensation has

 6   to be awarded on a record, and the record is defined as

 7   the record on a petition filed.                So similarly, if you

 8   get to the end of the case or you get to the point of

 9   limitations determination, the court says, well, there

10   shouldn't -- there shouldn't be -- there should not have

11   been a petition here, and so regarding -- regarding is

12   done what should have been done, we'll say there is

13   no -- there is no record available on that petition, so

14   we should deny compensation.

15               So I agree it's a little -- which I concede

16   is -- is not how we ordinarily think about statutes of

17   limitation, but it -- but it certainly is that -- it is

18   exactly the same textual logic in the -

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I totally lost that

20   answer.

21               MR. HORWICH:         Sure.         I'm happy to step

22   through it in the statute itself.

23               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Could you -- could you

24   go back and talk to me again about what you mean about

25   not having a record?

                                     16

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               MR. HORWICH:         Sure.         So Section 13 of the

 2   Act, which starts on page 19A of the government's brief

 3   says that compensation is awarded "if the Special Master

 4   report finds on the record" various matters.

 5               But then it goes on, and this is on page 21A

 6   in Section 13(c), to define the record as the -- as the

 7   record established on a petition filed.                 And so in the

 8   same sense that if the Special Master determines that

 9   the limitations provision says, well, there shouldn't

10   have been a petition filed, the consequence is there is

11   not a basis for attorneys' fees.                 They're similarly in

12   this definitional provision not a basis for the record

13   on which compensation is to be awarded on the merits.

14   And that produces the result that we would expect, which

15   is that -

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I'm totally confused.

17   Are you suggesting that the record shouldn't be filed in

18   that case or that the record supports the conclusion

19   that it was untimely?      Or neither?

20               MR. HORWICH:         What I'm -- what I'm

21   suggesting is -- what I'm suggesting is that when the

22   limitation -- when it's determined that the limitations

23   provision applies and should have prevented the filing

24   of the petition, and the Special Master has to decide,

25   well, what are the consequences of that.                 Because,

                                     17

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   again, the Special Master can't go back and actually

 2   prevent the whole thing from having happened, but the

 3   Special Master can say, well, if this direct -- if this

 4   directed that there shouldn't have been a petition

 5   filed, then one of the consequences is there's no -

 6   there's no record on which we should be able to decide

 7   compensation.

 8                 JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, as to the

 9   consequences, let me give you these two cases.              The

10   first is the case in which the petition is timely filed

11   and -- as you see it, but the claimant does not prevail

12   because the claimant is unable to prove that the injury

13   was caused by the vaccine, but there was a reasonable

14   basis for the argument and the argument was made in good

15   faith, so there would be eligibility for attorneys'

16   fees.

17                 The second is a case in which there is a

18   question about when the statute of limitations begins to

19   run.    And one of the points at which it can begin to run

20   is when there is the onset of significant aggravation of

21   an injury, which seems like a question about which there

22   could be a factual dispute.              And in that situation as

23   well, the claimant does not prevail on the statute of

24   limitations argument, but there was a reasonable basis

25   for thinking that the petition was submitted within the

                                       18

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   period after the -- the onset of this significant

 2   aggravation.

 3                  Why would Congress want to draw a line

 4   between -- a distinction between those two situations

 5   for the purpose of attorneys' fees?

 6                  MR. HORWICH:         Well, there's several reasons.

 7   The first -- the first one is that in your -- in your

 8   first example where there's been a determination on the

 9   merits, the Special Master is in a perfect situation to

10   decide whether there was a reasonable basis on the

11   merits.    And this is how -- this is how the program has

12   worked since its existence because to be clear, until

13   the decision below, there was no practice of awarding

14   attorneys' fees on untimely petitions in the -- in the

15   program.

16                  And so what you would get would be

17   situations like your first example, Justice Alito, where

18   the Special Master would issue a -- a written decision

19   on entitlement and these are -- these are 10, 15, 20,

20   25 pages long in my experience, dealing in considerable

21   detail with the medical evidence, the scientific

22   evidence, the expert testimony, the review of

23   literature, the different theories of causation, and

24   getting to the end, and obviously, if a decision is that

25   compensation is to be awarded, then attorneys' fees

                                        19

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   follow as a matter of right, but if compensation is

 2   denied, the Special Master can and typically does add,

 3   literally as an afterthought, that -- but having been

 4   through all of this and having discussed all of this, I

 5   think there was a reasonable basis for what was being

 6   argued here.

 7                  Now, in your second example where the

 8   Special Master has only determined this essentially

 9   diagnostic question of when was the first symptom of

10   this particular claimant's particular injury, the

11   Special Master hasn't looked at any materials about

12   whether the vaccine can cause that injury.                   So let me

13   give as a -- as a paradigm example maybe the -- what we

14   give in our brief as the -- the Smith case, which had to

15   do with the claim of whether certain childhood vaccines

16   caused the claimant's Type 1 diabetes.

17                  And the Special Master's decision focuses on

18   the question of whether the first symptom of the

19   diabetes was a blood glucose reading that sent the

20   claimant to the hospital, and then -

21                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Excuse me.   Could you -

22   could you -- there seems to be a confusion in this

23   consequence conversation.             You seem to be assuming that

24   the attorneys' fee award on good faith basis has to do

25   with the ultimate merits, did the vaccine cause this

                                        20

 1   injury.    I would have assumed that the award of

 2   attorneys' fees has to do with whether the petition was

 3   brought in good faith; i.e., was there a reasonable

 4   basis to believe that the petition was timely.                   And on

 5   that issue, before the Court can adjudicate the

 6   timeliness question, it has to know all of the facts

 7   that made the Petitioner believe it was timely.

 8                 And so I'm a little bit confused as to what

 9   additional factfinding the Court has to do.                   It has to

10   be told by a lawyer, your cases say because reasonable

11   basis has to be in fact and law.                   The law says first

12   symptom.    She experienced X, Y, and Z, and we thought

13   the latter was the starting point of the statute, not

14   the former.    What more does the Special Master need to

15   know to adjudicate whether that's in good faith, that

16   belief is in good faith?

17                 MR. HORWICH:         Well, the question under the

18   attorneys' fee provision, and this is on 26(a) of the

19   government's brief, is a determination that the petition

20   was brought in good faith and there was a reasonable

21   basis for the claim for which the petition was brought.

22   The question isn't was there a reasonable basis to

23   believe it was timely, the question is -- and -- and I

24   think my friend agrees with me on this -

25                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Now, I understand.

                                       21

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:            But now, look, still, the

 2   worst thing, the obvious question -- I mean, as a

 3   textual matter, but I don't know how you reconcile your

 4   position with the -- with the first words in 3300aa-11,

 5   which is talking about a petition starts this whole

 6   proceeding and you want to interpret that word

 7   "petition" meaning a timely petition.                   You mean an

 8   untimely petition doesn't start the proceeding?                   I mean,

 9   that's the technical linguistic thing, but if you get to

10   your -- to your basic worrying you, what is worrying you

11   is this proceeding, okay?            That's what's worrying you, I

12   think, the shadow trial.

13                 MR. HORWICH:         Yes, it is.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Now, on that, Justice

15   Sotomayor said, you only get into this problem when the

16   attorney has filed this timeliness matter with a good

17   reason to think his petition is timely, otherwise forget

18   it.   Okay?

19                 So you look at the complaint.                 You see a

20   complaint there.    He had a good reason for thinking it's

21   timely.   It looks, on the face of the complaint, as if

22   his client has a good claim, a plausible one.                   Now, if

23   the government wants to say, we want to present some

24   evidence, let them do it.            And if they don't, the worst

25   that happens is this person who thought she had a good

                                       22

 1   claim, and who was reasonable in her timeliness will get

 2   some attorneys' fees paid.

 3                Why is that -- why is that so terrible?                 Why

 4   is that putting such a burden on the government that

 5   they have to go through hoops, I think, to try to get

 6   these words in the statute, too?

 7                MR. HORWICH:           What -- what we're worried

 8   about here is -- is not the fact that some fees may be

 9   paid.   What -- what we're worried about here, as you

10   said, are the shadow trials, and -- and to an extent

11   also the question of whether additional cases would be

12   attractive to the program.

13                JUSTICE BREYER:              But that's in your control,

14   the shadow trials.

15                MR. HORWICH:           Well -

16                JUSTICE BREYER:              You don't have to have a

17   shadow trial if you don't want one.

18                MR. HORWICH:           Well, but -- but -- but, Your

19   Honor, I think where we're coming -- where we're coming

20   at this from is -- is saying what did Congress envision

21   here.   And as this Court said in Hensley and in Pierce,

22   Congress doesn't want attorneys' fees to be a second

23   major litigation.     So it seems exceedingly odd to think

24   it would have set up a scheme in which the case would

25   end on the merits and yet, the question on which

                                        23

 1   attorneys' fees are to be decided -- the availability of

 2   attorneys' fees is to be decided is going to require

 3   some further proceedings that have not -

 4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Why not -

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             The shadow trial brings up

 6   the answer that you were giving to the second part of

 7   Justice Alito's question, which you never got to finish.

 8                 MR. HORWICH:         Yes.

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And you were saying -- you

10   were giving the example, suppose this were a question of

11   timeliness.

12                 MR. HORWICH:         Yes.

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And when did the fact of

14   the vaccine first -- or the symptoms first become

15   manifest, and you were -- and you said that this should

16   not be tried because -- and this is finishing off

17   Justice -

18                 MR. HORWICH:         Right.

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             -- Justice Alito's

20   dichotomy.

21                 MR. HORWICH:         Yes.        Maybe if I finish giving

22   the example I was giving in response to the -- the

23   second part of Justice Alito's dichotomy in that Smith

24   case.   So the timeliness question the Special Master

25   resolved was, okay, was it the blood glucose reading

                                       24

 1   that was within the limitations period that was the

 2   first symptom or was it the excessive thirst and

 3   frequent urination that fell outside the limitations

 4   period.

 5               Now, the Special Master, having resolved

 6   that, which is something that I think perhaps even some

 7   of us in the room could recognize that one of those was

 8   the symptom -- was likely the first symptom or not, the

 9   Special Master then has to decide, was there a

10   reasonable basis for the claim that childhood vaccines

11   cause Type 1 diabetes?         And that's simply not something

12   that that timeliness determination is going to be any

13   good for the Special Master in deciding.

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:                But there's a lot of

15   information just in 11 -- what is it -- (c), tells what

16   has to be put in the petition.                 And there's -

17   couldn't -- couldn't a Special Master make the

18   determination based on that?

19               MR. HORWICH:           Well, I think part of the

20   problem is that we would be asking the Special Master to

21   spend the Special Master's time reviewing that material,

22   assuming that it's even in the petition, which is not

23   always the case.   We'd be asking the Special Master to

24   spend -- spend her time evaluating that material in a

25   proceeding that can't result in compensation to any

                                       25

 1   injured person, which is, of course, the point of the

 2   program, instead of spending her time on -- on other

 3   petitions, and it's that diversion of resources that's

 4   so concerning to us and we think would have been so

 5   peculiar to Congress.

 6               If I could reserve my -

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                       Thank you, counsel.

 8               Mr. Fishman?

 9              ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT T. FISHMAN

10                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

11               MR. FISHMAN:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

12   please the Court:

13               My friend started with Section 16.                       I'd like

14   to start very briefly with our reading of the fee

15   provision itself.     Section 15(e)(1), which says, "Any

16   petition filed under Section 11 is eligible for award of

17   attorneys' fees, even if it's denied, provided that two

18   conditions are satisfied.             It has to be filed in good

19   faith and with a reasonable basis."

20               15(e) itself and by its terms says nothing

21   about compliance with the statute of limitations.                       The

22   filing provisions of Section 11, which are Section

23   11(a)(1) similarly say nothing about compliance with the

24   statute of limitations.           Our position, therefore, is the

25   most direct and sensible reading of 15(e)(1), is you can

                                        26

 1   get an award of fees on a petition that has been denied

 2   regardless of the reason why, and there is no textual

 3   basis for saying that that provision carves out an

 4   exception for one class of denied cases, those denied on

 5   limitations grounds.

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So if -- if you're

 7   preparing one of these filings, and you're all set to

 8   go, and on the day before your filing you say, oh, gosh,

 9   it doesn't look like we're going to be on time.                    You

10   should still go ahead and file because you might be able

11   to apply for attorneys' fees.              While if you file it the

12   day that it's due and you find out the day after, oh, my

13   gosh, we weren't on time, then there's no question that

14   you could apply for attorneys' fees.

15               MR. FISHMAN:         Right.          And if I understand

16   that comment correctly, I think that's right, and -- and

17   you see actually many Special Master decisions that

18   ultimately deny a petition for failure typically to

19   prove causation; and when they turn to the reasonable

20   basis standard, they will say literally, your contact -

21   your client contacted you two days before the statute of

22   limitations was going to run.

23               You ran to the courthouse and filed.                    You

24   had a basis, we believe, for filing your claim.                    Further

25   investigation, examination of the medical -- medical

                                     27

 1   records made you question that judgment, and you

 2   abandoned the case.     And -- and there can be fee awards

 3   in -- in that scenario.

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    My hypothetical was

 5   not that you had two days and you made it in time, but

 6   that before the -- the time -- after the time expired or

 7   you were ready to file on time, but then you decided on

 8   further research, oh, this isn't going to look like

 9   we're going to comply.        We thought we had the time, but

10   we don't.   You should still go ahead and file, right, so

11   that you might be able to get the fees?

12                MR. FISHMAN:         I think that would depend -

13   if -- if you're late, you're late.                     I think the -- the

14   judgment your hypothetical would call on the attorney to

15   make is, why did we miss it, and maybe does that provide

16   grounds for equitable tolling or do we have a reasonable

17   and good faith argument as to timeliness?

18                If the lawyer says, I blew it, whether by a

19   day or a month or a year, I think that attorney's going

20   to have a very difficult time showing a good faith

21   reasonable basis for filing a claim that I think in your

22   hypothetical would be by the attorney's own account,

23   clearly time barred without justification.

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              So are you saying that

25   the good faith and the reasonableness go to two things:

                                      28

 1   One, the claim on the merits, and also the timeliness.

 2                 MR. FISHMAN:         That is what we're saying.

 3   That's also what the Federal circuit said.                 I think the

 4   word "claim," as it's used in the statute, encompasses

 5   the entire case.    Causation, evidence that you actually

 6   received a vaccine, the timeliness of your petition,

 7   damages, the -- everything you would need to

 8   establish -

 9                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So how do you answer the

10   argument about a shadow trial?

11                 MR. FISHMAN:         There's a number of arguments

12   about -- about that subject.               And I think the starting

13   point because it may have been lost a little bit in the

14   briefs, is the government does not cite a single case

15   where there has ever even been a hearing held on a fee

16   petition, ever.    And collectively are -

17                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               How were the records

18   accumulated and when?

19                 MR. FISHMAN:         I'm sorry?

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               How were the records

21   accumulated and when?

22                 MR. FISHMAN:         They are accumulated -- the

23   system that's established is one of front-loading.

24   You -- 11(c) requires an enormous amount of medical

25   documentation that is to be filed with the petition when

                                       29

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   it's filed.    If they are incomplete, you're required to

 2   submit an affidavit explaining what's missing and why.

 3                 The very first thing substantively that

 4   happens with these things, Vaccine Act Rule 4(a) says

 5   within 30 days of filing a petition, the secretary must

 6   review the medical records, and if she thinks they are

 7   deficient, she has to immediately notify the Petitioner,

 8   and that is the very first thing that is hashed out in

 9   these cases, complete medical records.

10                 Section -- Vaccine Act Rule 2(c)(2) says if

11   you're not going to rely solely on medical records in

12   support of your petition -- medical records will often

13   contain evidence of causation.                 If the records

14   themselves don't and you're going to go outside the

15   records, Vaccine Act Rule 2(c) -- 2(b)(2) is the actual

16   rule, says you're going to rely on observations or

17   testimony of every witness -- any witness, you have to

18   submit a detailed affidavit of the proposed testimony

19   that supports every allegation in the petition.

20                 So the answer is, a lot of it's there right

21   at the front end, which is not to say that as these

22   cases get litigated and the areas of contention get

23   refined.   Additional information can also be submitted,

24   but it is front loaded.

25                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So is your bottom line

                                       30

 1   that the record is already there for the shadow

 2   determination?

 3               MR. FISHMAN:         Sure.         And that's the reason

 4   why we point out in our brief, routinely these cases are

 5   decided -- fee determinations are made based on the

 6   written materials without a hearing, without any

 7   additional evidence.     And again there are no cases -- we

 8   are not aware of a single instance going to the

 9   inception of this program where there has ever been an

10   evidentiary hearing.

11               JUSTICE ALITO:            And if there is a hearing,

12   would the claimant's attorney get -- potentially get

13   attorneys' fees for the representation at the hearing

14   about attorneys' fees?

15               MR. FISHMAN:         Yes, the law is pretty clear

16   that fees are available for time incurred on seeking

17   fees.

18               JUSTICE KAGAN:            Do you think it would be

19   within the discretion of the court or Special Master to

20   look at a case and say, for whatever strange reason,

21   this is a case where it's going to require some lengthy

22   mini-trial in order to figure out fees and that's a bad

23   use of everybody's time, so I'm not going to grant

24   attorneys' fees here?      In other words -- you know, this

25   is a "may" provision; would it be a sufficient reason

                                     31

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that this is just going to take too long, it's too

 2   involved, so I'm going to deny attorneys' fees in this

 3   case?

 4               MR. FISHMAN:         I think that might well be

 5   within a Special Master's discretion, if it really is

 6   going -- if a fee determination really will require the

 7   sort of parade of horribles that the government sees.

 8   It's not our case, but I think it could be possible and

 9   -- and within their discretion in a subsequent case.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              You think the Special

11   Master "may" award -- so it "may" award is

12   discretionary.

13               MR. FISHMAN:         Correct.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, that's a tough

15   position, isn't it?    I mean, if you have got a difficult

16   and tough and complicated case, well, you get no fees;

17   but if you've got an easy one, well, then you get fees.

18               MR. FISHMAN:         I don't know -- the -- no

19   court and the parties have not briefed or addressed in

20   this case the -- the extent to which the "may"

21   discretion can be exercised in a procedural way that

22   Justice Kagan's hypothetical proposes.                    I'm just saying,

23   I can't stand here and give you a hard and fast rule

24   that says that will never be appropriate.

25               Maybe if that case comes before a court and

                                     32

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   a Special Master has done that, the argument will be

 2   it's an abuse of discretion.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I thought you

 4   were -- I thought you were giving us that argument when

 5   you said under the fees all you need is reasonable and

 6   good faith.

 7                 MR. FISHMAN:         Those are the requirements to

 8   be eligible for an award of fees, the statutory

 9   requirements for eligibility.                But just because you meet

10   good faith and reasonable basis does not necessarily

11   mean you get fees for the -- for the reasons just

12   discussed.    It is discretionary.

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So is one reason

14   that should affect the exercise of discretion is that

15   you didn't comply with the statute of limitations?

16                 MR. FISHMAN:         I think it might be.             There -

17   the law is not -- this is not the issue in our case, so

18   it's -- it's -- it's difficult to know the precise

19   contours of the exercise of discretion in a case where

20   nobody's contended that the discretion couldn't properly

21   be exercised.

22                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Well, let's take -- let's

23   take this case.    What would you put in to show that you

24   have been reasonable, in good faith and reasonable, one,

25   as to the claim; and two, as to the attorneys' fees?

                                       33

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   What -- what would the Special Master have to look at to

 2   make those determinations in this case?

 3               MR. FISHMAN:         I will take the second part

 4   first, reasonableness of statute of limitations.              The

 5   Federal Circuit has already ruled that we were

 6   reasonable to bring this case in terms of timeliness

 7   because of the case law as it existed at the time the

 8   petition was filed, the fact that we actually prevailed

 9   on the timeliness question before the three-judge panel.

10   So the Federal -- I think on that question the Federal

11   Circuit has resolved it.

12               But if you want to go beyond that, I think

13   you would look at our briefs and the laws that existed

14   and the analysis of the various courts that have looked

15   at this and said -- and say, that was a close call, you

16   actually prevailed for a couple years on this question.

17   That's reasonable, and that's good faith.

18               As to the merits, it is all the material

19   that accompanied our petition, which is principally

20   medical records, also some medical studies linking the

21   Hepatitis B vaccine to MS, and then a number of

22   affidavits that were filed subsequently.              And I think

23   that is all you would need to look at, and -- that is

24   the only thing in the record.              Because the government

25   has introduced no evidence in this case at any stage

                                     34

 1   contesting the merits of our underlying claim.

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               They are arguing that

 3   they don't need to, and why should be -- why should they

 4   be put to the burden of doing that.

 5                MR. FISHMAN:         The reason is you have to

 6   remember this is not ordinary civil litigation; it's a

 7   streamlined front-loaded process.                      So the way the

 8   Vaccine Act works is you file a petition with medical

 9   records, as I mentioned before.                 You have 30 days for

10   the government to object to the completeness of the

11   record.   The very next thing that happens under the

12   rules, and it's Rule 4(c), is the Secretary has 90 days

13   to set out all of her objections to the case.

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But the very fact that

15   it's streamlined indicates to me that we should be very

16   careful to enforce the policy of the rule which is to

17   deter the filing of stale claims.                      And your -- your rule

18   certainly undermines that.

19                MR. FISHMAN:         I think that you have to back

20   up and -- and acknowledge, as a starting point, that

21   there's no question that Congress intended this program

22   to award fees on petitions that have been denied.                       And

23   as we point out in our brief, petitions are routinely

24   denied on procedural grounds where there has been no

25   examination of the underlying merits, just as the

                                      35

 1   government contends is the case with statute of

 2   limitations.

 3                  We disagree with that.                    We think actually to

 4   resolve a statute of limitations question, a Special

 5   Master is going to have a more complete understanding of

 6   the underlying merits of a case than in many other

 7   procedural settings.        So we know that Congress has

 8   already said, sure, it's a streamlined process, but

 9   we're not going to pursue that objective at the expense

10   of compensating attorneys who bring good faith claims,

11   but lose.

12                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Is the -- what's the

13   relationship between your position and equitable

14   tolling?    I mean, your case, I think, is unusual in that

15   there was a fair amount of confusion about when the

16   statute of limitations might run or that's your

17   position.    I would think a lot of the cases where the

18   attorney doesn't meet the limitations deadline will

19   involve things like -- you know, I was delayed by

20   Hurricane Sandy or -- or whatever, or we were trying to

21   file, it got lost in the mail.

22                  Are those things that -- I mean, should that

23   be considered under the rubric of equitable tolling, or

24   under -- under your idea where you don't have to file on

25   time anyway?

 1                MR. FISHMAN:         The -- the -- I think that the

 2   best answer to that question is to look at the Federal

 3   Circuit -- Circuit's en banc ruling in Cloer I.                     We

 4   actually argued -- we didn't argue snowstorm.                     What our

 5   argument was is there was an extraordinary circumstance

 6   that prevented us from filing within 36 months of the

 7   first symptom.   And that circumstance was there was no

 8   scientific evidence of a link between the vaccine -

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I understand that,

10   but I would assume the more typical case is when you

11   miss a filing deadline is because the lawyer, whether

12   for good reasons or bad, missed the filing deadline.

13   And I'm just curious if you would -- if it's not

14   sufficient to support equitable tolling, whether it is,

15   therefore, unreasonable when it comes to attorneys'

16   fees?

17                MR. FISHMAN:         I think that would be a

18   case-by-case determination as to whether the particular

19   facts relied upon supported good faith and a reasonable

20   basis.   I think in Your Honor's hypothetical, you would

21   be -- a lawyer would be skating on thin ice there, too,

22   because the Federal Circuit made clear in Cloer I that

23   fraud and duress are the grounds for equitable tolling.

24   So I think if you are going to bring a claim that you

25   know is late and your only excuse is a snowstorm, you

 1   have to look at Cloer I and think, I don't have a very

 2   strong or maybe any equitable tolling argument.

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             It does seem to me, I did

 4   not have the opportunity to ask the government this

 5   question, that the equitable tolling argument undercuts

 6   the government's position that no petition may be filed,

 7   as being an absolute.      Because we all know, I take it

 8   the government concedes, that there is equitable

 9   tolling.

10               MR. FISHMAN:         They -- well, they fought the

11   issue.

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Or there can be equitable

13   tolling in some cases.

14               MR. FISHMAN:         Sure.         That's the law.   They

15   fought the issue below and lost, and in fairness, in

16   their briefs to this Court, they say, we don't agree

17   with the ruling just because we didn't seek this Court's

18   review for reasons that are not identified.

19               That is the law.             That's correct.     And it

20   is, frankly, one in a long list of inconsistencies with

21   their conception of what it means to file under the Act.

22               JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Fishman, this may be a

23   hard question for you to answer, but is your sense of

24   why it is that petitions are untimely filed that they

25   usually have to do with things like -- you know,

                                     38

 1   snowstorms and lawyer error, or that they usually have

 2   to do with questions about the manifestation of

 3   symptoms?

 4                  Or something else, if something else is -

 5   just the range of cases out there, what are we talking

 6   about?     Why are these cases untimely filed?

 7                  MR. FISHMAN:         My understanding from reading

 8   the case law is it's the latter.                    It's not snowstorms.

 9   It is here is a disease.            I have a child that has been

10   sick her whole life.        When is the first symptom of this

11   disease?     She coughed 40 months ago.                  She had a -- some

12   other symptom 42, and the experts often battle that out,

13   and -- and oftentimes the Special Master said, sorry, it

14   was the cough at 40 months that is the first symptom of

15   the disease, not the symptom you've pointed to.

16                  JUSTICE ALITO:            This may be a question that

17   the government is in a better position to answer, but

18   do -- do you have any sense of how often claims are

19   rejected on the ground of timeliness, what we're dealing

20   with?

21                  I mean, you mentioned in a footnote that the

22   fund out of which the -- the claims and the attorneys'

23   fees are paid has a positive balance of $3.5 billion.

24   Maybe the only government fund that has a positive

25   balance, but -

 1                 (Laughter.)

 2                 JUSTICE ALITO:            Is this going to bankrupt

 3   the -- the system?

 4                 MR. FISHMAN:         I -- I can't imagine how it

 5   would even really put much of a dent in that government

 6   obligation.

 7                 JUSTICE ALITO:            Do you know how many cases

 8   we might be dealing with?

 9                 MR. FISHMAN:         I -- I don't.           I know that

10   there are not a huge number of published cases by

11   Special -- unpublished decisions by Special Masters on

12   the statute of limitations question.                    I tend to think

13   that those numbers will actually go down moving forward,

14   even under the rule we're proposing because of the law

15   on when the statute of limitations runs is so much

16   clearer now than it was in 2005 when we brought this

17   case.

18                 The other point, of course, is you're always

19   going to have to show good faith and a reasonable basis.

20   So the government seems to suggest that the rule we're

21   advocating and the one that the Federal Circuit adopted

22   is going to result in a flood of frivolous litigation.

23   I think that's just not supported because of the

24   requirements you'd have to establish.

25                 I think there's also no reason to think that

                                       40

 1   that will be the case empirically, and I say that for

 2   this reason:     The -- the program for 25 years has

 3   authorized the payment of fees to losers.                       It has paid

 4   out $2.4 billion in compensation to individuals injured

 5   by vaccines in that 25 years and just about $160 million

 6   in fees for winners and losers.                   It is just over

 7   6 percent.     And one would think that if this unusual

 8   system of paying losers really encouraged the filing of

 9   frivolous lawsuits so lawyers could be paid, you'd think

10   the number would be substantially higher than 6 percent.

11                  JUSTICE ALITO:            Who pays for the Special

12   Masters?     Is that paid out of the fund?

13                  MR. FISHMAN:         It is.

14                  I do want to answer a couple of the

15   questions that were presented during my friend's

16   presentation.     The -- I was not aware of the fact that

17   the Secretary no longer discharges her obligation to

18   publish in the Federal Register, but as we noted in our

19   brief, our petition was published.                       And her obligation

20   to publish it was triggered by the statute's requirement

21   that a petition has, quote, "been filed under Section

22   11."   Ours -- ours, in fact, was published.

23                  The question that -- that you raised,

24   Justice Kagan, is there any other situation where this

25   reading results in a petition that has been filed.                       The

                                        41

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   answer is yes, the government argues that a petition

 2   filed under Section 11, even if it's untimely, is

 3   sufficient to commence proceedings and confer

 4   jurisdiction, which if that's true, it goes to your

 5   question, Justice Sotomayor.              How do you get here if the

 6   statute -- if the statute of limitations is not

 7   jurisdictional?   How do you get from one place to the

 8   next?   I -- I think there's not a good answer for that.

 9                Another question that has arisen, I think,

10   Justice Scalia, your comments are correct, that -- that

11   a filing, a judgment can occur at any time in a case.                         I

12   think it's also important to remember that the Secretary

13   is not bound to defend a case on the merits and then

14   contest a fee award for the same reason.                      So there are

15   cases pending before the Special Masters right now that

16   for reasons I suspect are that the Secretary wanted to

17   establish a precedent, that there is no causation

18   between vaccine A and injury X, we want to litigate that

19   on the merits, and they have won.                      But it wasn't a slam

20   dunk.   There was a lot of evidence and a lot of science

21   to contradict that, which was rejected.

22                Those lawyers now come before the Special

23   Master and seek fees in those cases, and the Secretary

24   is arguing no fees because these are time-barred.                      And

25   in that case, you are going to have a judgment, by the

                                      42

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   government's account, entered on the merits and then

 2   they're going to come back and defend a fee award

 3   saying, there is no judgment because there's never been

 4   a case filed, and you can't get fees.                 And it is just a

 5   fundamental and glaring inconsistency with their

 6   position.

 7               I want to address a couple additional points

 8   on the shadow trial argument because these were raised

 9   in the government's reply brief.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Could I -- I have been

11   thinking about your last point.                Couldn't that last

12   point easily be remedied by -- by simply our holding

13   that -- you know, you -- you can't ride both horses;

14   that if, in fact, you've litigated it through to a -- to

15   a merits judgment in your favor, which presumably has

16   stare decisis effect, you then cannot come back and say

17   the suit never occurred because the filing was too late.

18   I mean, we -- I think we're able to hold that, don't you

19   think?

20               MR. FISHMAN:         I -

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I mean, I agree with you

22   it's a terrible -- it's a terrible, outrageous thing for

23   the government to do, to win the case and get -- get

24   stare decisis effect, and then to say you can't get

25   lawyers' fees because there's never been a case, right?

                                     43

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1                  MR. FISHMAN:         Right.          I mean, I think

 2   that -- yes, and I think that, in terms of authority,

 3   power, I think that -

 4                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            We could make that up,

 5   couldn't we?

 6                  MR. FISHMAN:         I think that you probably

 7   could.

 8                  (Laughter.)

 9                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Sure.

10                  MR. FISHMAN:         I think you probably could,

11   but I think that the problem is you would then be, in

12   essence, adopting a procedural rule though that endorses

13   the inconsistency in the position.                       A petition is filed

14   for some purposes but not for others, even though

15   Congress only referred to petitions filed in -- in the

16   generic sense.     It didn't distinguish between the time

17   at which it's entered or the basis on which it's

18   entered.   And it could have easily done these things.

19                  The -- the government is proposing this

20   legal fiction.     Well, they say, sure, I mean, it can be

21   tendered and accepted and you can litigate it for years

22   and there can be all sorts of rulings, but as soon as

23   the Special Master enters a ruling on timeliness, the

24   phrase is they're bound to, quote, "refuse to recognize"

25   that it has ever been filed.

                                        44

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1                 They could have established that -- Congress

 2   could have established that legal fiction.                It could

 3   have said no petition shall be deemed to be filed if it

 4   is brought after the statute of limitations has run.

 5                 Or Congress could have achieved this same

 6   consequence that the government is attributing to

 7   Section 16 by enacting a rule like this Court's Rule

 8   13-2; the court will not -- will not file a cert

 9   petition that is untimely.

10                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:              You were going to address

11   the shadow trial?

12                 MR. FISHMAN:          Yeah, a couple -- a couple

13   quick points.    We cited 11 cases in the discussion of

14   our -- in our discussion of shadow trials for the point

15   that these petition -- petitions are denied on

16   procedural grounds all the time, and Special Masters

17   resolve subsequent fee requests routinely and without a

18   hearing.

19                 The government -

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Procedural grounds because

21   the affidavits aren't sufficient or -

22                 MR. FISHMAN:          Inadequate records is one

23   reason.    Sometimes, a petitioner dies, and their family

24   or estate does not want to pursue this, so it's

25   abandoned.    There's cases where there's just a failure

                                        45

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to prosecute, it's not clear why; the lawyers lost touch

 2   with a client or I don't know the reason why, it's just

 3   a failure to prosecute.

 4                There are also cases where somebody is

 5   arguing for causation, but as their case is going

 6   through the system, other cases are being decided that

 7   reject their view, particularly paradigm cases.                 And the

 8   petitioners fold, they give up, but the lawyers, having

 9   fought the cases for years, come in and argue.                 So those

10   are all, incidentally, examples of procedural denials

11   that are reflected in the 11 cases we cited.

12                The point I wanted to make is the government

13   doesn't say which of those cases it's referring to when

14   it makes the claim that our cases reflect circumstances

15   where the Secretary has determined the program's

16   resources would be best conserved by, I think the phrase

17   is "acquiescing" to a modest request for fees.

18                They don't identify what cases they're

19   talking about, but in 10 of the 11 cases we cited, on

20   their face, fee awards were contested.                 And they're

21   litigated.   And you read the opinions, and the Special

22   Masters are resolving the challenges that the Secretary

23   made, and they are doing it without a hearing.

24                There also is this argument about -- I think

25   we've already gone over the fact that a statute of

                                      46

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   limitations determination is not identical to a

 2   causation determination.         The additional argument that

 3   the Secretary made in their brief is that, unlike many

 4   other matters that must be supported at the outset -

 5   the key question in most of these cases, causation, you

 6   don't have to furnish evidence or make allegations of

 7   causation -- is not correct.

 8               Under Section 11(c), if you're bringing a

 9   non-table case, you have to allege cause and effect.

10   And if the medical records don't support causation, you

11   need an affidavit from an expert.                     So that is

12   front-loaded as well.

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Are there regulations or

14   rules establishing hourly rates?

15               MR. FISHMAN:         There are not.

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Do you have any idea

17   from the cases what the ranges are?

18               MR. FISHMAN:         For rates?

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               For rates.

20               MR. FISHMAN:         It varies region by region.        I

21   think the Special Masters look to see what the rates in

22   Denver are as opposed to the rates in New York or Los

23   Angeles -

24               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I know that civil rights

25   rates, for example, are far below market rates for most

                                     47

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   law firms.    Is that the same for this, or is it market

 2   rates generally?

 3                 MR. FISHMAN:         Right.          I think it's less.

 4   And it's not -

 5                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Market rates for general

 6   litigation.

 7                 MR. FISHMAN:         Right.          And it's not CJA

 8   rates -

 9                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Right.

10                 MR. FISHMAN:         -- but very often, it's not

11   the rates that attorneys are actually paid.                      It ends up

12   being a problem -- as an aside -- with expert witnesses

13   sometimes because the Special Masters don't pay what

14   experts in these cases want.

15                 If there are no further questions, I will

16   relinquish the remainder of my time.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

22   important -

 1   because it hasn't until recently been an issue for cases

 2   dismissed -- but for other cases, particularly those

 3   dismissed on -- other procedural grounds.

 4                MR. HORWICH:           Well, no, we don't.   And

 5   actually, that's the point I wanted to start with

 6   is that -- is that the Federal Circuit's decision below

 7   puts the program into this unchartered territory, where

 8   we don't really know what this is going to look like.

 9                The cases that -- that my friend cites in

10   his brief are ones that either the petition is so

11   facially defective that, of course, fees can't be

12   awarded on it, but there's no reason to think that's

13   going to be the typical case.

14                And then there's other cases where the

15   application of the reasonable basis standard is so lax

16   as to essentially just turn on -- on the claimant's

17   personal say-so, that, oh, I think the vaccine caused my

18   injury.   That's like -- that's the Hamrick case, for

19   example; it's cited in there.

20                And that -- that can't be the standard for

21   reasonable basis.

22                And -- and so I think the Court needs to

23   keep in mind that, for example, when my friend says

24   there's -- the government doesn't cite a case where

25   there's been any shadow trial, the reason is because

                                        49

 1   there haven't been fees available on untimely petitions,

 2   which is exactly the set-up that would cause you to have

 3   a shadow trial.

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 But there have been

 5   dismissals on other procedural grounds.

 6                MR. HORWICH:           Well, there aren't -- there

 7   are not really other procedural grounds.                  There may be

 8   situations where a petition is voluntarily withdrawn,

 9   and I think there is a problem there about there not

10   actually being a judgment when somebody voluntarily

11   withdraws.

12                But even in those, the Special Masters

13   should have, in our view, examined whether there was a

14   reasonable basis.     I don't think it's right to say that

15   an attorney can come in, file the petition and then the

16   claimant decides, well, I would like to withdraw, and

17   then the attorney essentially gets paid as of right.

18                So our -- it's unsurprising that there's no

19   examples of these hearings.               It's also unsurprising that

20   my friend says, well, there -- for the petitions, when

21   it comes time to determine fees, the record is complete.

22   Of course the record is complete because the case has

23   been decided on the merits.               And that's the paradigm

24   situation under which the program has been operated.

25                What we are talking about here is entering

                                        50

 1   this unchartered territory, where -- where the program

 2   has not been before, and where you wouldn't think

 3   Congress would want to send it.                 And this is our central

 4   concern with this case.         The government's concern

 5   here -- and the reason we've petitioned for certiorari

 6   is not because of the dollar amount involved in paying

 7   these claims.   The concern is about where the program's

 8   resources are being directed.

 9                The question is -- the question is about

10   where the finite number of Special Masters, the finite

11   number of government attorneys, can put their time in

12   responding to these petitions for -- to deliver the

13   compensation to the very few, but very deserving people

14   who Congress wanted to award compensation to.

15                And our concern here is -

16                JUSTICE BREYER:            So your view here it's the

17   same.   No attorneys' fees when the client dies, or they

18   decide to withdraw the petition when it's dismissed

19   early on for a procedural ground, when the record is

20   inadequate, et cetera.

21                You think that in none of those cases

22   Congress would have wanted attorneys' fees.

23                Or is it -

24                MR. HORWICH:         Well, in the case of -

25                JUSTICE BREYER:            -- do you think in some but

                                      51

 1   not others?

 2                 MR. HORWICH:         Well, no.             In the case where

 3   the claimant dies, the statute has provisions for that,

 4   and you can obtain compensation in that situation.                      So

 5   there's no reason an attorney can't go on there -

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:            No, no, no, no.

 7                 MR. HORWICH:         -- if they want to -- if they

 8   want to withdraw the petition, I guess it depends on

 9   exactly the circumstances under which -

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:            No, but my question is what

11   is your view?    It's the same problem.                    He's listed, you

12   heard, he listed six or seven different instances -

13   four or five anyway; he's found 11 cases, apparently.

14   And so what is your view?

15                 MR. HORWICH:         Well, my view -- my view is

16   the view that I think we would take under any other fee

17   shifting provision, which is that if a claimant wants to

18   withdraw his or her case, I don't think that he can then

19   claim the benefit of the attorneys' fee provision,

20   absent some circumstances that -- that would warrant the

21   finding of reasonable basis.               I think that is an

22   unexceptional result.

23                 Thank you.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

25                 The case is submitted.
