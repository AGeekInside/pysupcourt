 5   States.

 7             ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. McCOLGIN

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9              MR. McCOLGIN:            Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10   and may it please the Court:

11              FBI agents delayed presenting Mr. Corley to

12   a Federal magistrate judge in order to obtain his two

13   confessions.    The admissibility of these two confessions

14   depends on an issue of statutory interpretation:                   The

15   interpretation of 3501(c), together with the

16   McNabb-Mallory rule and the right of prompt presentment.

17              Now, there's two critical issues I would

18   like to address.    The first is that 3501(c) as it's

19   written by Congress leaves the McNabb-Mallory rule in

20   place outside the six-hour time limitation.                 And the

21   second is that the Government's interpretation, under

22   which 3501(c) is merely a voluntariness safe harbor, is

23   unfaithful to the text and the structure of the statute.

24              Turning to the first point, subsection (c)

25   modifies McNabb-Mallory, but does not eliminate it.                      The


                                         3

 1   exact text of the statute here is crucial.                  And for the

 2   Court's convenience, on page 7 of the yellow brief the

 3   operative language of the text of the statute is set

 4   out.

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Before we -- before we

 6   get to the statute, McNabb-Mallory are exercises of this

 7   Court's supervisory authority over the lower courts?

 8                 MR. McCOLGIN:         That's correct, Your Honor.

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And they were both

10   pre-Miranda decisions, when now the defendant is told of

11   his right to remain silent.              Whatever Congress put in

12   1301 -- 3501, this Court could say, well, McNabb-Mallory

13   are no longer viable cases in light of Miranda.

14                 MR. McCOLGIN:         This Court could, but for

15   several prudential reasons this Court should not,

16   overturn McNabb and Mallory and should not find them to

17   be no longer valid considerations.                  First of all -- or

18   no longer valid precedents.

19                 First of all, the Solicitor General's Office

20   has not asked that McNabb and Mallory be overturned.

21                 Second of all, the parties have not briefed

22   that issue.    It has been briefed instead as a statutory

23   interpretation issue.

24                 Thirdly, Congress through 3501(c) structured

25   the statute on the existing precedent of McNabb and


                                         4

 1   Mallory, and at this point for the Court to pull McNabb

 2   and Mallory out from underneath that structure would

 3   cause that structure to basically collapse.             It depends,

 4   the six-hour time limitation, depends on the existence

 5   of McNabb-Mallory outside that six-hour time period.

 6              Congress can revisit this issue at any time.

 7   Their hands are not tied.         Congress could choose to

 8   change 3501(c) so that it no longer provides for McNabb-

 9   Mallory outside the six-hour time period.              But that's a

10   decision for Congress and this Court, I would suggest

11   respectfully, should respect the prerogatives and the

12   policy choice that Congress has already made.

13              JUSTICE ALITO:          Are you arguing that the

14   language in subsection (c) codifies the McNabb-Mallory

15   rule?

16              MR. McCOLGIN:          I am arguing that the exact

17   language, whether it is "codification" or "leaves

18   intact," doesn't matter.        What it does is --

19              JUSTICE ALITO:          There is a very big

20   difference, isn't there, between saying we are codifying

21   this rule, we're making it a statutory requirement, and

22   saying, assuming that this supervisory rule that was

23   adopted by the Supreme Court remains in place, we are

24   creating an exception to it?           Which of those two things

25   does subsection (c) do?


                                       5

 1               MR. McCOLGIN:          Your Honor, it does the

 2   latter.   It leaves McNabb-Mallory in place.                   However,

 3   the language of the statute uses the phrase "time

 4   limitation" in the proviso.             "Time limitation" implies

 5   more than we're just not just touching McNabb-Mallory

 6   for the time being.     It depends -- the statute depends

 7   on McNabb-Mallory to create the time limitation, because

 8   without McNabb-Mallory there is no limitation.                    After

 9   the six hours nothing else happens unless McNabb-Mallory

10   --

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, it would be

12   consistent with the second purpose that you gave to say

13   that there's a six-hour safe harbor, whatever term you

14   want to call it, and beyond six hours the Court is free

15   to reexamine its supervisory rule in light of what

16   Congress has provided in (a) and (b) of the statute.

17               MR. McCOLGIN:          Well, but again, the language

18   of the statute is "time limitation."                    That's strong

19   language for Congress to use and it indicates that

20   Congress intended to limit the taking of confessions to

21   those first six hours.       There is no limitation without

22   McNabb-Mallory in effect.

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It is a little bit odd to

24   say that Congress has built a statute around a

25   supervisory rule, but taken away the authority of this


                                        6

 1   Court to reexamine the supervisory rule.

 2              MR. McCOLGIN:           I am not actually saying that

 3   Congress has taken away the authority of the Court.             I

 4   am saying as a prudential manner, since Congress can

 5   address this on its own and since it structured the

 6   statute on the foundation of McNabb-Mallory, it would be

 7   best for this Court to leave up to Congress that policy

 8   choice.

 9              Congress chose in 1968 to leave of

10   McNabb-Mallory protection against presentment delay in

11   place after six hours.       It was a compromise, and it was

12   the appropriate compromise, because what it did was it

13   cut out the first six hours during which there had been

14   the most problems with the application of

15   McNabb-Mallory.   The six-hour time limitation

16   effectively lowers the social cost of this rule of this

17   rule of inadmissibility while maintaining the deterrent

18   effect of McNabb-Mallory outside the six hours.

19              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, you were trying to

20   get to page 7 of your yellow brief?

21              MR. McCOLGIN:           Yes, Your Honor.     On page 7 I

22   set out the operative language of the statute.             And what

23   the statute actually provides is that a confession shall

24   not be inadmissible solely because of delay if such

25   confession is found by the trial judge to have been made


                                        7

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   voluntarily and made within six hours of arrest.                    Now,

 2   the phrase "inadmissible solely because of delay" is

 3   clearly a reference to the McNabb-Mallory rule because

 4   that is exactly what McNabb-Mallory does.                    It renders

 5   the confession inadmissible solely because of delay if

 6   the delay in presentment was unreasonable.

 7                So what the statute is providing on its face

 8   is that a confession shall not be subject to the

 9   McNabb-Mallory rule if it is voluntarily given and made

10   within six hours.    The six-hour provision means that

11   McNabb-Mallory is in effect outside of the six hours.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Or it may just mean

13   that the confessions beyond six hours may be excluded

14   solely because of delay.          In other words, if the judge

15   says, look, I don't want to hear about all this other

16   stuff, it's just too long, he can't do that beyond the

17   six hours, but he can within the six hours.

18                MR. McCOLGIN:          Within the six hours he

19   cannot exclude solely because of delay, even a voluntary

20   statement.   That is the McNabb-Mallory principle,

21   inadmissible solely because of delay.                    So what it's

22   saying is that McNabb-Mallory does not apply within the

23   six hours.

24                Now the government's interpretation is that

25   this is simply a voluntariness safe harbor, and what


                                         8

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   they do is they read the word "inadmissible" as being

 2   synonymous with the word "involuntary."                     But the text of

 3   the statute shows that those two terms are not

 4   synonymous, because the text of the statute says that in

 5   order for a confession to be admissible it must be

 6   voluntary and made within six hours.

 7                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, they have that textual

 8   problem, but you have at least an equally big textual

 9   problem, because you want to read the first sentence of

10   subsection (a) completely out of the statute based on

11   some supposition about what Congress was intending to

12   do.     So really, if you live by the text you die by the

13   text.     I don't see how you are going to succeed with a

14   subsection (c) textual analysis if you're going to

15   disregard the text of subsection (a).

16                 MR. McCOLGIN:          Your Honor, we don't

17   disregard the text of subsection (a).                     Instead, we just

18   apply the principle that a general provision, if it

19   conflicts with a specific provision, the specific

20   controls over the general.            What we have in subsection

21   (a) is a general statement that voluntary statements are

22   admissible.     But if we read that the way the government

23   does, as making admissible every voluntary statement,

24   then that would make subsection (c) completely

25   superfluous.


                                          9

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                JUSTICE ALITO:          And if you read subsection

 2   (c) the way you do, it makes subsection (a) mean

 3   something quite different from what it says literally.

 4                MR. McCOLGIN:          No, it simply establishes an

 5   exception in the area of delay.               This is the way

 6   statutes work.    When there is a conflict between a

 7   general provision and a specific one, the specific must

 8   control over the general.           If it worked the other way

 9   around, it would render the specific superfluous.                 So

10   this has happened in statutes in numerous case.                 In 1983

11   versus 2254, it was held that 2254 as a specific

12   provision controls over 1983.              So this is an accepted

13   principle of statutory interpretation.

14                JUSTICE ALITO:          What you're -- you are not

15   arguing that there is a specific provision that controls

16   a general provision.       You are arguing that an arguable

17   negative inference from an arguably more specific

18   provision reads new language into the text of a specific

19   provision.   That's what you are arguing, isn't it?

20                MR. McCOLGIN:          With respect, no, Your Honor.

21   We are not making the negative inference argument that

22   the government suggests we are making in the first part

23   of their brief.   Instead, we are making the argument

24   that subsection (c) was constructed on the existing

25   precedent of McNabb and Mallory, which already


                                        10
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   established a rule of inadmissibility.                    Subsection (c)

 2   then just carves out the first six hours from that.                    So

 3   it's not creating a rule of inadmissibility by negative

 4   inference.     Rather it's just recognizing that a rule of

 5   inadmissibility already exists in the case law and the

 6   purpose of this statute was to simply carve out from the

 7   first six hours the McNabb-Mallory rule.

 8                 The government --

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why can't you argue that

10   what happens when you are not within the safe harbor is

11   simply that the time period cannot alone govern, all

12   right, but it can still be part of the list of things

13   that can be taken into account in determining

14   voluntariness under (b).           Why doesn't that reconcile the

15   two provisions?

16                 MR. McCOLGIN:          That, again, is the

17   government's interpretation.              But it requires a

18   rewriting.     It requires reading "inadmissible" as

19   "involuntary" to interpret all of subsection(c) as a

20   voluntariness safe harbor.            But Congress used the word

21   inadmissible deliberately.            That's a reference to the

22   McNabb-Mallory rule.        McNabb-Mallory did not render

23   confessions voluntary or involuntary based on delay.                   It

24   rendered them inadmissible.              So that language is

25   crucial.     This cannot be read as a voluntariness safe

 1   harbor.

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:             But admissibility is

 3   defined in 3501 itself.         (A) says that it shall be

 4   admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given; and

 5   (b) says what factors will be taken into account in

 6   determining whether it's voluntarily given.

 7               MR. McCOLGIN:           Yes, Your Honor.        And (c)

 8   makes clear that, at least for purposes of subsection

 9   (c), voluntariness is not enough for admissibility,

10   because it says on its face that in order --

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I agree with that.      It is

12   not alone enough.

13               MR. McCOLGIN:           So the two terms --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:             So if you are outside of

15   that safe harbor you cannot rely upon the time alone.

16   But why can't you rely on the time plus the other

17   factors?

18               MR. McCOLGIN:           Your Honor, because the

19   effect is again to allow for a confession to be

20   inadmissible solely based on delay if it's outside of

21   the six hours.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:             It's not being admissible

23   solely on the basis -- I'm sorry.                 Delay is not the only

24   factor being considered in making the inadmissibility

 1   safe harbor delay can't be taken into account at all.

 2              MR. McCOLGIN:           Well, what the Congress said

 3   was that delay alone cannot be a basis for

 4   inadmissibility within six hours.

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Right.

 6              MR. McCOLGIN:           That leaves in place

 7   McNabb-Mallory, under which delay alone is a basis for

 8   inadmissibility.

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:             No.     It -- it leaves it in

10   effect only if you ignore (a) and (b). (A) says that

11   it's admissible if it's voluntary --

12              MR. McCOLGIN:           But that --

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:             -- and (b) says it's

14   voluntary if you take into account the five factors, one

15   of which is the period of time before arraignment.

16              MR. McCOLGIN:           Your Honor, that depends.

17   The premise of that depends on the argument that

18   "inadmissibility" is synonymous with "involuntariness"

19   for purposes of subsection (c), and "admissibility" is

20   synonymous with "voluntariness," but they are not

21   synonymous as used in subsection (c).

22              JUSTICE SCALIA:             But they are synonymous as

23   used in (a).

24              MR. McCOLGIN:           Well, subsection -- as used

25   in subsection --

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:            (A) says that if it's --

 2   it's admissible if it's voluntary.

 3               MR. McCOLGIN:          Yes, Your Honor.     However, as

 4   used in subsection (c), that should control, because the

 5   word "inadmissibility" is being used in that very same

 6   sentence.   Since the very same sentence makes clear that

 7   voluntariness is not enough for admissibility, it's

 8   clear that those two terms are not synonymous.

 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, is it your position

10   that the McNabb-Mallory rule serves purposes other than

11   to ensure the voluntariness of the statement?

12               MR. McCOLGIN:          Yes, it protects --

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And that's what you're

14   trying to reach here?

15               MR. McCOLGIN:          Yes, Your Honor.     It protects

16   --

17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But if that's true, then

18   why is it that we would suppress the confession if it's

19   completely voluntary?      I mean, what's the link between

20   some other end that's being served by McNabb-Mallory --

21               MR. McCOLGIN:          It's protecting --

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- something other than

23   voluntariness and suppressing the confession?

24               MR. McCOLGIN:          It's protecting the right of

25   prompt presentment.     McNabb-Mallory was meant to prevent

 1   the exploitation of delay in presentment as a means of

 2   obtaining a confession.

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But why do we want to

 4   avoid delay in presentment?            What reason do we give?

 5   And I assume there are reasons that -- to contact family

 6   and so forth -- other than voluntariness.

 7                MR. McCOLGIN:         Well, voluntariness is

 8   certainly a part of it.        But it's in addition, because

 9   there's rights that attach at presentment that allow a

10   defendant to make a much more informed decision as to

11   whether --

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What do those rights have

13   to do with a confession that is conceded, for our

14   analytic purposes, to be voluntary?

15                MR. McCOLGIN:         Because the confession itself

16   was obtained through exploitation of the delay.             During

17   a period of custody -- before presentment the defendant

18   was just in the hands of the zealous police officers who

19   have actually arrested him.            It's a fundamental

20   principle of our justice system that that period should

21   be as short as reasonably possible because during that

22   period, as time goes on, the effect of the delay is to

23   increase the inherently coercive power of that uncertain

24   --

 1   principles when you have got Rule 5 of the Rules of

 2   Criminal Procedure?      Don't they say that an arrestee

 3   shall be taken before a magistrate without unreasonable

 4   delay?

 5                MR. McCOLGIN:          Exactly, Your Honor.       It's

 6   the right under 5(a) to prompt presentment that is being

 7   protected.

 8                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But all you are doing is

 9   trying to have an enforcement mechanism for this by the

10   wholly unrelated remedy of suppressing the confession if

11   it's voluntary.    If it's not voluntary, of course, it's

12   related.

13                MR. McCOLGIN:          Well, the purpose of

14   McNabb-Mallory was actually to cut the line a bit short

15   of having to actually make a voluntariness

16   determination.    It's a recognition that, even if the

17   statement is voluntary, that still there are inherent

18   coercive pressures that develop during a period of

19   presentment -- of presentment delay, and that that

20   period of time should be as short as possible so that

21   that coercive nature, the coercive nature of the

22   interrogation, doesn't cause the person to --

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So you are saying a

24   confession can be coercive and still voluntary?

25                MR. McCOLGIN:          It's -- yes, Your Honor.      Not

 1   in the sense that it's a coerced confession.                   I'm not

 2   arguing that this was involuntary.                   Instead, I'm arguing

 3   that McNabb-Mallory intends to avoid the voluntariness

 4   requirement by establishing a prophylactic rule, so that

 5   a presentment needs to be made as soon as reasonably

 6   possible after the arrest so that that delay cannot be

 7   exploited as a means of obtaining a confession.                   It both

 8   protects the right to prompt presentment and it also --

 9                JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I ask you this:       What

10   other remedy, other than suppression of the confession

11   made after six hours, is there available to the

12   defendants to enforce the interest in prompt

13   presentment?

14                MR. McCOLGIN:           There is no other remedy

15   available.     In fact, the message that an affirmance in

16   this case would send to law enforcement is that delay

17   for the purpose of interrogation is permissible and that

18   the right of prompt presentment is unenforceable.

19   Without McNabb-Mallory, this becomes an empty right.

20   There is no other remedy.            And that's why particularly

21   where the delay is purposeful, as we have in this case

22   --

23                JUSTICE ALITO:           Why would that be the case?

24   The confession could still be suppressed on grounds of

25   involuntariness?

 1                MR. McCOLGIN:          Yes, Your Honor.

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:          Your argument is you don't

 3   trust district judges to make accurate determinations as

 4   to whether the confession is voluntary or not.           You need

 5   -- you need a rule that takes that out of their hands.

 6                MR. McCOLGIN:          It's not that we don't trust

 7   them.    It's that delay for the purpose of interrogation

 8   should not be pushed to that limit; that delay for the

 9   purpose of interrogation should not be permitted.           The

10   delay, particularly where it's for that express purpose,

11   even if the defendant cannot show that it rose to the

12   level of involuntariness, still it's exploitation of

13   delay.   It's a violation of the right to prompt

14   presentment, and that violation of the right to prompt

15   presentment under McNabb-Mallory renders that confession

16   --

17                JUSTICE ALITO:          What's the purpose of the

18   requirement of prompt presentment?

19                MR. McCOLGIN:          The purpose of the right of

20   prompt presentment is several-fold.

21                First of all, it's because there are

22   inherent coercive characteristics that develop during a

23   period of custody, and a person, once arrested, should

24   be presented to a neutral magistrate so that the neutral

25   magistrate can both assign counsel, give an opportunity


                                        18

 1   for consultation with counsel, and can also inform the

 2   person of his rights, address bail, and issues such as

 3   that.   So the right of prompt presentment is considered

 4   fundamental.   It's considered a basic right, a basic

 5   statutory right in our system.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Mr. McColgin, what do you

 7   do with the problem that the proviso only makes a delay

 8   longer than six hours nondestructive of the

 9   admissibility of the confession if the delay beyond six

10   hours "is found by the trial judge to be reasonable

11   considering the means of transportation and the distance

12   to be traveled to the nearest available magistrate judge

13   or other officer."

14               I can think of a lot of reasons why you

15   can't do it within six hours other than the means of

16   transportation and the distance to be traveled.

17               MR. McCOLGIN:            We have to remember, Your

18   Honor --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:              You see, if you take the

20   government's position that it really doesn't matter, it

21   gets thrown back into (b), and you can take all those

22   factors into account, and the ultimate question is

23   whether the confession was reasonable.

24               But if you take your position, the defendant

25   automatically walks, or at least his confession is


                                         19

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   automatically thrown out, and the only exception made is

 2   if the means of transportation and the distance to be

 3   traveled made six hours impracticable.

 4                MR. McCOLGIN:         No, Your Honor, that's not

 5   our position.   Our position is that the first question

 6   is did the confession fall within that six-hour time

 7   period?

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Right.

 9                MR. McCOLGIN:         Or longer, depending on

10   transportation, means of transportation.                For that

11   determination of whether it falls within the exclusion

12   period, only means of transportation or distance is

13   considered, but once the confession is outside that

14   period, then McNabb-Mallory applies and the confession

15   may still be admissible if the delay was necessary.                And

16   for those purposes, once we are determining whether

17   McNabb-Mallory requires inadmissibility, the court can

18   consider, for example, emergency hospital treatment or

19   unavailability of the magistrate.                So all of those

20   factors can and do get considered once we get into the

21   determination of whether McNabb-Mallory requires

22   exclusion.

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, that certainly is a

24   very back-door way of doing it, isn't it?

25                MR. McCOLGIN:         Not at all, Your Honor,


                                       20

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   because once we look at the structure of the statute

 2   what it's doing is carving out the first six hours from

 3   McNabb-Mallory.   So the determination of whether we are

 4   in that carve-out period is limited to transportation

 5   and distance, but once we are outside of it, we just

 6   apply McNabb-Mallory, and that's McNabb-Mallory as it

 7   has developed in the case law, which includes all of

 8   these other considerations.

 9              JUSTICE SOUTER:             But why -- why was it

10   appropriate to have a special rule for transportation?

11   In other words, everything that is covered by the

12   transportation proviso would, on your theory would on

13   your theory have been subject to consideration under

14   McNabb-Mallory anyway.       So why did they simply have a

15   six-hour rule and leave any exceptions, transportation,

16   unavailability of magistrate, medical emergency,

17   whatever, to -- to the leeway that McNabb-Mallory

18   allows?

19              MR. McCOLGIN:           Because the first question,

20   again, is just whether to exclude the confession

21   altogether from the McNabb-Mallory determination.              And

22   for those purposes, they -- some Senators from larger

23   States where there's greater distances to travel wanted

24   to make sure that there was an exception for

25   transportation and distance.

 1               JUSTICE SOUTER:            So basically -- I don't

 2   mean this disparagingly, but basically the answer is

 3   politics.   Somebody from a State thought of it and

 4   nobody else said, well, gee, let's pile on some other

 5   provisos.   It's as simple as that in your view?

 6               MR. McCOLGIN:          Exactly, Your Honor.     There

 7   was very little comment on it added at the -- at the

 8   last minute.   The Scott Amendment had just included the

 9   six-hour provision, but then the proviso was added on

10   the floor at the very last minute.

11               JUSTICE SOUTER:            I see.

12               MR. McCOLGIN:          Your Honor, the government

13   also relies on 402 as a basis for arguing that

14   McNabb-Mallory has been basically overturned by

15   Congress.   Rule 402, however, clearly does not apply

16   here.   The advisory notes -- the advisory committee

17   notes make clear that Rule 402 was never intended to

18   overturn McNabb-Mallory.         In fact, the advisory

19   committee identified McNabb-Mallory as a rule of

20   inadmissibility that was meant to stay in place even

21   after the implementation of Rule 402.

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             At least one time limit

23   that has been complied with -- and that's the Fourth

24   Amendment, how long you can keep somebody seized without

25   taking them before a magistrate -- there is no violation


                                       22
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   of that time period, is there?

 2               MR. McCOLGIN:          That's correct, Your Honor,

 3   the McLaughlin principle that less than 48 hours is

 4   presumptively reasonable.          However, Congress in -- in

 5   3501(c) chose to set a six-hour time period for the

 6   taking of confessions and to leave McNabb-Mallory in

 7   place outside that time period.

 8               I would suggest that Congress struck an

 9   appropriate balance at that time, keeping McNabb-Mallory

10   in place for the more extreme types of delay, but

11   eliminating it from the shorter periods of delay.                 And,

12   in doing so, Congress struck an appropriate balance, and

13   I would suggest that this Court should respect the

14   balance that Congress has struck.                Unless there is any

15   further questions, I would ask that --

16               JUSTICE STEVENS:            I just have one question.

17   Do you think the -- that the D.C. Circuit -- the statute

18   pertaining to the District of Columbia is relevant?

19               MR. McCOLGIN:          As legislative history, yes,

20   Your Honor, because the 3501(c) was modeled on the D.C.

21   legislation, which established clearly a three-hour time

22   period.   And the legislative history for that was very

23   clear that they intended to leave McNabb-Mallory in

24   effect outside that time period.

 4               ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 5                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 6               MR. DREEBEN:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 7   please the Court:

 8               It's important in this case to go back and

 9   look at the original Rule of Exclusion that this Court

10   developed in the McNabb case in 1943 and then reiterated

11   in the Mallory case in 1957.             Both of those cases

12   considered a pre-Miranda regime in which there was no

13   constitutional law that required that a suspect be

14   advised of his rights.

15               Under Rule 5 of the Federal Rules of

16   Criminal Procedure and under statutes that preceded it

17   that were in effect at the time of McNabb, the only way

18   to ensure that a suspect was informed of his rights to

19   silence and counsel was to bring him before a

20   magistrate, and the magistrate would advise him of those

21   rights.   This Court in McNabb and Mallory thus fashioned

22   a judicial rule of evidence, an exclusionary rule under

23   the Court's supervisory power not as an effectuation of

24   something that Congress specifically intended but of its

 1                In the government's view, two acts that came

 2   subsequently to McNabb and Mallory, section 3501 and

 3   Rule 402 of the Federal Rules --

 4                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Let me just ask before you

 5   get to those, Mr. Dreeben:          Other than the McNabb-

 6   Mallory Rule, what was available as a sanction for

 7   violations of the rule of prompt presentment?

 8                MR. DREEBEN:        Justice Stevens, I am not sure

 9   that there is any evidentiary sanction.

10                JUSTICE STEVENS:           No, not -- apart from an

11   evidentiary sanction.

12                MR. DREEBEN:        None has risen in the case law

13   that I can point Your Honor to.              I think the primary

14   safeguard of the enforcement of Rule 5 is the obligation

15   that is placed on the government and on government

16   agents to comply with rules of criminal procedure that

17   are valid.

18                JUSTICE STEVENS:           So at the time that

19   Mallory and McNabb were decided the Court thought that

20   an extra rule was necessary to give the government an

21   incentive to comply with prompt-presentment

22   requirements.   The very same factors are still at work

23   today, aren't they?

24                MR. DREEBEN:        No, I don't think that they

25   are, Justice Stevens, because the -- the critical thing


                                       25

 1   that the Court was doing in Mallory and McNabb was

 2   trying to come up with a way to ensure that suspects

 3   were advised of their rights to protect against abuses

 4   in the interrogation process.               And the Court's ultimate

 5   constitutional solution to that lay years in the future.

 6   It came in the form of Miranda.

 7                JUSTICE STEVENS:             No, but I am not -- we are

 8   not talking about a constitutional problem but a rule

 9   problem encouraging compliance with the -- the -- with

10   the rule that requires prompt presentment.

11                MR. DREEBEN:          I think that what the Court

12   was after-

13                JUSTICE STEVENS:             I say that to the extent

14   -- to the extent that was a motivating factor in McNabb,

15   it seems to me that it would be precisely the same

16   motivating factor in McNabb.

17                MR. DREEBEN:          Well, I think that it was not

18   the sole motivating factor in McNabb.

19                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Not the sole, but it was a

20   motivating factor.      And it would have equal strength

21   today as then.

22                MR. DREEBEN:          No, I would not agree that it

23   would have equal strength.

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Mr. Dreeben, wouldn't --

25   wouldn't you still have this disincentive which --


                                         26

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   wouldn't you still have this disincentive, which is

 2   considerable?    If you -- if you exceed the time limit,

 3   it may be taken into account in determining that the

 4   confession was involuntary.

 5              MR. DREEBEN:           Well, certainly, Justice --

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Isn't that enough of a

 7   disincentive?    If you delay too long, that delay is one

 8   of the factors to be taken into account in deciding

 9   whether the confession was voluntary.

10              MR. DREEBEN:           Yes, excessive delay can be a

11   -- it is by statute a factor that will be taken into

12   account in determining --

13              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Well, what about Rule 5?

14   And Rule 5 doesn't say a word about voluntary.                    It says

15   unnecessary delay -- shall be brought before a

16   magistrate without unnecessary delay.                    So whatever the

17   balancing there may be in 3501, I think what you're

18   saying is that Rule 5(a), which just says bring

19   theoretically before a magistrate without unreasonable

20   delay, that that has no teeth; that that is effectively

21   unenforceable.

22              MR. DREEBEN:           I think it is unenforceable by

23   the exclusion of a confession that results from what a

24   court concludes is unnecessary delay.                    And I think that

25   that is true for two reasons, by virtue of congressional


                                        27

 1   action and rulemaking action.              And I think that as an

 2   additional actor this Court, which struck that

 3   supervisory powered balance in a pre-Miranda era, would

 4   do well to consider whether the factors that motivated

 5   it to suppress confessions in McNabb and Mallory should

 6   still be evaluated the same way today.

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           But isn't your -- I'm

 8   sorry.

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Rule 5 is about

10   unnecessary delay, and here we have a case, if I

11   remember the facts right, where the officer said, yes,

12   the reason we didn't bring him before a magistrate

13   sooner is because we wanted to get a confession from

14   him.

15                 MR. DREEBEN:        Justice Ginsburg, what

16   happened in this case is that the suspect was given his

17   Miranda rights and waived them and agreed to give a

18   confession.    There are three circuits and the D.C. local

19   court which all have concluded that a waiver of Miranda

20   rights waives the right to prompt presentment.               So the

21   question of whether there was in fact unnecessary delay

22   that would constitute a violation of Rule 5 has not been

23   litigated in this case.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I must be losing the thread

25   of the argument.    It seems to me that McNabb and Mallory


                                        28
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   only provide punishment for excessive delay where there

 2   has been a confession.      Isn't that right?

 3              MR. DREEBEN:         That's correct.

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:            And so long as the length

 5   of the -- the delay can still be considered as one of

 6   the elements in determining that the confession -- that

 7   the confession is involuntary, there is still a degree

 8   of incentive based upon only the confession.           Now, it --

 9   it may not be as high a degree -- that it is

10   automatically excluded -- but the police are going to

11   have to consider that any confession they may get within

12   that period of excessive delay may be challengeable.

13              MR. DREEBEN:         It is certainly challengeable

14   on voluntariness grounds.         Now, the Court's motive-

15              JUSTICE STEVENS:            It is still true they have

16   everything to gain and nothing to lose by continuing to

17   interrogate.

18              MR. DREEBEN:         Well, they do have something

19   --

20              JUSTICE STEVENS:            If they don't get the

21   confession within six hours, they haven't got it.              So if

22   they continue on, their only purpose is to try to get a

23   voluntary confession.

24              MR. DREEBEN:         Well, Justice Stevens, to the

25   extent that it is correct that a waiver of Miranda


                                      29
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   rights waives the prompt presentment right and prevents

 2   an objection based on whatever survives of

 3   McNabb-Mallory, the officers are doing nothing wrong if

 4   they obtain a valid Miranda waiver; and this was just

 5   not a factor that the Court had on the horizon when it

 6   decided McNabb and Mallory.

 7              JUSTICE SOUTER:              But isn't there a -- a new

 8   factor now that the Court has decided Miranda?             And

 9   you've argued that we should regard this in the

10   post-Miranda light, but I think there is at least one

11   way of doing that that cuts against the government's

12   argument and I would like your response to that.

13              That is that in the post-Miranda world in

14   practical terms, if a -- if a court in considering a

15   suppression motion finds that the Miranda warnings were

16   given and that after they were given this individual

17   said, okay, I'll talk, that is in practical terms the

18   end of the issue.    The notion that there is a -- an

19   independent voluntariness concern is pretty much theory,

20   not practice.

21              Given what I think is the, kind of the

22   real-world effect of Miranda -- say the magic words, get

23   the defendant to say, I'll talk, that's it -- doesn't it

24   make sense to have a further safeguard in something like

25   the six-hour rule understood as preserving

 1   McNabb-Mallory after the six hours?

 2                 MR. DREEBEN:        Well, Justice Souter, I think

 3   that is purely a question of policy of whether there

 4   should be such a strong exclusionary rule that mandates

 5   the barring from admission into evidence of a purely

 6   voluntary confession where there's no dispute about its

 7   voluntariness because the officers delayed beyond six

 8   hours.

 9                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, I agree with you; it

10   is an issue of policy.        But I thought your whole

11   argument for considering this as a post-Miranda case was

12   in effect a -- a policy context in which you wanted us

13   to decide this.

14                 MR. DREEBEN:        It's a policy context that I

15   think Congress has decided in two different enactments,

16   and I think that if this Court were to reach it as a

17   matter of policy, it should revisit the balance that it

18   reached in McNabb-Mallory because of the changed legal

19   context.   But this is a case about section 3501 and

20   about Federal Rule of Evidence 402.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I knew you were going to

22   get to 3501 eventually.

23                 MR. DREEBEN:        I am glad that I have finally

24   reached it.

25                 (Laughter)

 1                 MR. DREEBEN:        Section 3501 on its face says

 2   nothing about excluding any evidence.                    What it says is

 3   that in section (a) voluntary confessions are

 4   admissible.    In section (b) it says that in determining

 5   voluntariness, a court will consider a variety of

 6   factors under the totality of the circumstances,

 7   including prearraignment delay.               Then in subsection (c),

 8   it attacks more directly the McNabb-Mallory rule.                    And

 9   as originally formulated it would have wiped out

10   McNabb-Mallory altogether; there is no dispute about

11   that.   After the bill was introduced there was a

12   modification of it on the floor of the Senate in which a

13   six-hour limitation was put in.

14                 Now, the effect of that six hours is to say

15   that within six hours after the arrest delay by itself

16   can never be an exclusive grounds for suppression; it

17   just can't.    And to that extent it overrules

18   McNabb-Mallory to the extent that McNabb-Mallory would

19   have allowed less than six hours of delay to serve as a

20   basis for suppressing evidence.               Outside of six hours,

21   it does not say that evidence is suppressed.                   It simply

22   leaves that determination to other sources of law.

23                 In the government's view, the primary source

24   of law that controls the answer to that question is

25   subsection (a), which says that voluntary confessions


                                        32
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   are admissible, and I believe that, as Justice --

 2              JUSTICE SOUTER:            If that is the answer, why

 3   do we need (c) -- I mean, why did Congress need (c) at

 4   all?

 5              MR. DREEBEN:         Congress never needed (c); (c)

 6   in the government's view was always superfluous, even at

 7   the time when it directly said delays shall never be the

 8   grounds for suppressing a confession.                  There was already

 9   a provision in (a) that said voluntary confessions are

10   admissible and it was well understood that

11   McNabb-Mallory -- and this Court was very explicit on

12   the point -- excluded totally voluntary confessions.

13              So if this Court has nothing before it but

14   the text of the statute, subsection (a) makes voluntary

15   confessions admissible, and the only way that Petitioner

16   can get around that is to say that section 3501(c)

17   carved something out of subsection (a).

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:            But if it doesn't, Mr.

19   Dreeben, what do the words "time limitation" mean in the

20   proviso?

21              MR. DREEBEN:         That's the limitation on a --

22   the period during which a court cannot rely exclusively

23   on delay within the meaning of the statute.                 It simply

24   -- it carves out six hours from McNabb-Mallory plus

25   reasonable transportation delays, and it leaves the


                                      33
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   six-hour -- after the six-hour period to other sources

 2   of law.

 3              Now, one source of law -- and this is where

 4   Petitioner looks -- would be McNabb-Mallory.             But

 5   McNabb-Mallory is not a constitutional rule of decision.

 6   This Court has been clear, most recently in the

 7   Sanchez-Llamas decision, that it is a rule of

 8   supervisory power created by this Court.

 9              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              You are really asking the

10   Court to overrule McNabb-Mallory, because you say

11   Congress provided six hours, no McNabb-Mallory, but

12   after six hours the test is voluntariness -- only

13   voluntariness.   So there's nothing left under the

14   government's view of McNabb-Mallory.

15              MR. DREEBEN:          That's correct, but the

16   modification, Justice Ginsburg, is that I think Congress

17   has displaced McNabb-Mallory.             It obviously cannot

18   overrule a decision of this Court, but it can prescribe

19   a rule of law that takes precedence over a decision of

20   this Court that rests on its supervisory power.

21              Petitioner does not contend that

22   McNabb-Mallory was an interpretation of Rule 5 of the

23   Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and I don't think

24   that he could do that.       This Court was explicit that the

25   predecessor statute that existed before Rule 5 and


                                       34

 1   provided the prompt presentment requirement did not

 2   address the issue of remedy.

 3               And it's notable I think that in the

 4   preliminary draft of the Rules of Criminal Procedure a

 5   rule of exclusion was explicitly provided.                   The rule

 6   would have said:     "No statement made by a defendant in

 7   response to interrogation by an officer or agent of the

 8   government shall be admissible in evidence against him

 9   if the interrogation occurs while the defendant was held

10   in custody in violation of this rule."

11               JUSTICE BREYER:              What is the -- what if the

12   other reasons apply?        I take it the words

13   "self-incriminating statement" in (e) means any adverse

14   evidence?

15               MR. DREEBEN:           I think that's right,

16   Justice Breyer.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:              Okay.       Now, there are a lot

18   of reasons we exclude evidence.                You know, I mean -- it

19   might, for example, might not in the circumstance be

20   worth the confusion.        It might not in the circumstance

21   be worth the time.      It might violate -- I don't know,

22   there is like a whole -- there are many reasons.

23               So in your opinion, does section (a) mean to

24   set aside all the reasons?            In other words, if for some

25   other reason this particular piece of self-incriminating


                                         35

 1   evidence, adverse evidence obtained after 30 hours,

 2   violated the admission, violated some totally different

 3   rule of evidence, as your opinion does (a) mean, judge,

 4   it doesn't matter if it's triple hearsay or it doesn't

 5   matter if it violates some authentication requirement,

 6   it doesn't matter if it violates, you know, it has to be

 7   relevant, pertinent, not a waste of time -- it doesn't

 8   matter; admit it?

 9                MR. DREEBEN:         No, Justice Breyer.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:            No, of course it doesn't

11   mean that.

12                MR. DREEBEN:         If the --

13                JUSTICE BREYER:            So if it doesn't mean that,

14   then why does it mean that we should ignore this other

15   rule of evidence contained in Rule 5 of the Federal

16   Rules of Civil Procedure?

17                MR. DREEBEN:         Well, that's precisely my

18   point, Justice Breyer.        The other rules that might

19   permit exclusion of a voluntary confession in the Rules

20   of Evidence are explicit, or they are there because the

21   courts interpreted that rule to require it.              That's not

22   what happened in McNabb-Mallory, and I don't think

23   that --

24                JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, there are -- there

 1   things that can happen when you hold a person, let's say

 2   for 40 hours for 29.      I mean, one thing that happens is

 3   he doesn't learn how he gets out on bail.                  Another thing

 4   he happens, he doesn't learn exactly what the charge is

 5   against him.   Another thing -- they are all listed in,

 6   in Rule 5.

 7                And -- and when you have an exclusionary

 8   rule, you enforce not only what you are talking about,

 9   which I understand, which is the voluntariness part, but

10   you also enforce all these other things that happen when

11   you bring a person before a magistrate and don't keep

12   him for 70 hours or something.

13                So why should we interpret (a) as setting

14   those other things aside and requiring us to overturn

15   McNabb and Mallory?

16                MR. DREEBEN:        Well, McNabb and Mallory are

17   not constitutional decisions of this Court.

18                JUSTICE BREYER:           No, of course not.

19                MR. DREEBEN:        They were attempts to

20   effectuate a particular policy choice.                  That policy

21   choice was one that Congress was free to revisit, and I

22   submit it did revisit in two different provisions, one

23   in 3501(a) and the other in Federal Rule of Evidence

24   402.

25                JUSTICE BREYER:           Did it say anything in the

 1   legislative history, which interests me, that the

 2   purpose of (a) is to overturn Mallory and McNabb?

 3                MR. DREEBEN:          No, Justice Breyer, and I will

 4   concede to you the legislative history on the point that

 5   section (a) was considered to overrule Miranda and

 6   subsection (c) was addressed to McNabb-Mallory.

 7                JUSTICE ALITO:           Mr. Dreeben, Justice Breyer

 8   suggested that there are rules of evidence other than

 9   those based on the Constitution or McNabb-Mallory that

10   might result in the exclusion of a confession.                      Maybe

11   there are such rules, but I'm trying to think of them.

12   I can't think of what they might be.                      Certainly it's not

13   hearsay.    Is it ever going to be ruled to be irrelevant?

14   Is it common for a confession to be excluded under Rule

15   403?   Are there rules that would --

16                MR. DREEBEN:          I think in theory Rule 403 is

17   such a rule. Rule 16, which requires discovery

18   obligations, contains its own authorization for an

19   exclusionary rule.      And my answer to Justice Breyer on

20   those rules is that they are explicitly provided by

21   Congress.   The difference in a Rule 5 --

22                JUSTICE ALITO:           Are you familiar with cases

23   in which a defendant's confession has been excluded

24   under -- under 403?

25                MR. DREEBEN:          No, Justice Alito.

 1              JUSTICE BREYER:               I wasn't focusing on the

 2   word "confession."      I was focusing on the words in (e),

 3   which were "any self-incriminating statement."              And

 4   that's why I asked you if you interpreted that to

 5   include anything that the individual said after, say,

 6   29 hours that might turn out to be adverse to that

 7   defendant's interests.         And your answer to that was yes.

 8              MR. DREEBEN:            Yes.

 9              JUSTICE BREYER:               And I think you are right.

10   I think we agree on that.

11              So, if the defendant said, if you look under

12   the rock you will find the writing such-and-such, it

13   might not be authenticated for that particular writing.

14   There are many reasons.          It might be triple hearsay,

15   what he says.   I mean, you know, there are a variety of

16   things, aren't there?        Maybe I am wrong.

17              MR. DREEBEN:            I think the general principle

18   is what the Court ought to be focused on here.              And the

19   general principle is, yes, if there is some specific

20   provision that should be together with subsection (a) --

21              JUSTICE BREYER:               The reason I brought that

22   up is not to be technical.            The reason I brought it up

23   is to point out that there are many, many words that a

24   person could utter in confinement under 30 hours, which

25   in a variety of ways could stab him in the back without

 1   it having anything to do with Miranda, without it having

 2   anything to do with coerced confession.

 3                And similarly, there are many reasons for

 4   bringing him forward that have nothing to do with

 5   either.    And therefore, I wonder if all those reasons

 6   could support retaining McNabb-Mallory, a matter about

 7   which Congress said nothing.

 8                MR. DREEBEN:         I think it would be quite

 9   extraordinary for the Court to decide to revive its

10   supervisory power decisions in McNabb and Mallory.                     They

11   clearly were aimed at the problem of incommunicado

12   detention with a suspect who did not know his Miranda

13   rights.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Dreeben, I tend to

15   think that what we should be focusing on is the language

16   of 3501.   Can I bring you back to that?                    What I do not

17   understand about your argument is the following:                     The

18   six -- the six-hour safe harbor applies only when the

19   confession is made voluntarily, right?

20                I would think that the proviso likewise

21   assumes voluntariness.        That is, the time limitation

22   contained in this subsection, it's a time limitation

23   applicable to voluntary confessions.                     And it says that

24   time limitation shall not apply in any case in which the

25   delay in bringing the person is beyond six hours is

 1   found by the trial judge to be reasonable.

 2                I think you have already voluntariness

 3   assumed in the proviso, but you want us to go back and

 4   re --   reconsider voluntariness under (a).                I just don't

 5   think that's -- that's a fair way to read it.

 6                MR. DREEBEN:         I think the statute, as we

 7   read it, contains some overlap in voluntariness

 8   requirement, and we interpret the voluntariness

 9   reference in subsection (c) to really mean otherwise

10   voluntary; in other words, not to be deemed involuntary

11   solely on the basis of delay, but otherwise voluntary.

12                And in that sense section 3501(c) does

13   contain --

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, I am reading it that

15   way, too.    Otherwise voluntary is in the safe harbor.

16                MR. DREEBEN:         Right.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Then when you have a

18   proviso, which refers to the time limitation contained

19   in this subsection, it's a time limitation upon

20   voluntary confessions.

21                MR. DREEBEN:         It's a -- it's a limitation on

22   the time during which a judge may not rely on delay

23   alone to find a confession inadmissible.                 That's all

24   subsection (c) does.       It says, judge, you may not find

25   the confession to be inadmissible solely because of

 1   delay if it's within six hours plus reasonable

 2   transportation delays.

 3                 And our interpretation of that language is

 4   that the inadmissibility as you mentioned,

 5   Justice Scalia, refers back to subsection (a), which

 6   speaks about confessions that are admissible if they are

 7   voluntarily given.

 8                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Then why didn't the statute

 9   say, instead of saying inadmissible, shall not be found

10   involuntary solely by reasons of delay.                   Because it

11   seems to me that your argument twain the two.

12                 MR. DREEBEN:         It is, and I think the reason

13   that it was written that way, Justice Souter, is it was

14   a direct attempt to make clear that McNabb-Mallory shall

15   not operate in the six-hour period after arrests and

16   before presentment.

17                 It was an attempt to displace McNabb-Mallory

18   explicitly.    Originally it was to displace it

19   altogether.    As it ended up being written, it displaced

20   it for six hours.     And our submission is that you read

21   the rest of the statute to determine what happens to

22   confessions that are taken outside of six hours.                   And I

23   would recognize that this makes subsection (c) in

24   certain respects unnecessary to achieve the result that

25   voluntariness controls.

 1               But the most that Petitioner argues and he

 2   made it very clear today, the most that he argues is

 3   that section 3501(c) leaves McNabb-Mallory to live

 4   another day for confessions outside of six hours.                    And

 5   if that is true, then the government's position is that

 6   Congress, in 1975 in Rule 402 of the Federal Rules of

 7   Evidence provided the bases on which relevant evidence

 8   can be excluded.   And it listed four sources and they

 9   are the Constitution, an act of Congress, a rule of

10   evidence, or -- and this is the relevant one -- other

11   rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to

12   statutory authority.

13               And what Congress meant by that were rules

14   that this Court promulgates pursuant to Rules Enabling

15   Act authority.   It did not --

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That's Rule 5.

17               MR. DREEBEN:         No.      Rule 5 it certainly

18   prescribed pursuant to Rules Enabling Act authority,

19   although it was originally enacted by Congress.                    But

20   Rule 5 contains no exclusionary rule.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And as you have said

22   without the exclusionary rule, Rule 5(a) has no teeth at

23   all.   And I agree with that.           It says -- it's a straight

24   out command, no unnecessary delay.                 And isn't the reason

25   for 5(a) exactly what happened here?                    This was a case

 1   where the police officers were trying to admit that the

 2   sole reason that they didn't bring Corley before a

 3   magistrate properly was to extract a confession.

 4              MR. DREEBEN:          Justice Ginsburg --

 5              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              That's exactly what

 6   McNabb-Mallory was trying to --

 7              MR. DREEBEN:          There is a crucial difference

 8   between this Court deciding that there is a command in

 9   the Rules of Criminal Procedure and we as a court are

10   going to back it up by an enforcement mechanism, which

11   is the supervisory power route, and Congress saying what

12   we intend is that a violation of this rule produced

13   inadmissibility of a confession.               Congress has never

14   said the latter.   This Court, in promulgating rules of

15   evidence, have never said the latter.

16              And what that leaves the Court with is the

17   option of persisting in McNabb-Mallory as a supervisory

18   powers decision or following the text of Rule 402 of the

19   Federal Rules of Evidence, which says that there isn't

20   any authority to say that relevant evidence is out of

21   the case simply because of the Court's views on

22   supervisory powers --

23              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Mr. Dreeben, do you think

24   the Rule 402 argument is strong enough to prevail even

25   section -- the statute that has never been enacted?

 1                 MR. DREEBEN:        Yes, I do, Justice Stevens.

 2                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           The statute was really

 3   unnecessary to overrule McNabb-Mallory, in your view?

 4                 MR. DREEBEN:        Well, Congress focused on the

 5   problem of confessions in section 3501 and it dealt with

 6   McNabb-Mallory in section 3501(c).                  We submit that the

 7   text of the statute provides an answer to McNabb-Mallory

 8   in section 3501(a).

 9                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           But it is superfluous and

10   unnecessary answer if your interpretation of the rules

11   is correct?

12                 MR. DREEBEN:        It came many years before,

13   Justice Stevens.    In 1968 when Congress reacted to this

14   Court's Miranda decision and to McNabb-Mallory, it

15   passed section 3501.       Rule 402 is a very general rule

16   that says the policy of the federal courts is that we

17   are not going to have evidence rules made any more by

18   case-by-case decision by the Supreme Court.                 We are

19   going to have them promulgated in a code of Federal

20   rules, and if the Court wants to change them, it can do

21   that through the revisory committee process, and it

22   would be open to Congress at any point, which has

23   superior ability to gather facts and to survey the

24   impact of whether there is a pattern of violations of

25   rule 5 that warrants the very strong --

 1               JUSTICE STEVENS:            We could never acknowledge

 2   or recognize a new privilege, then, for example --

 3               MR. DREEBEN:         No.

 4               JUSTICE STEVENS:            -- psychiatrists or

 5   something like that?

 6               MR. DREEBEN:         No, I think the Court did that

 7   and quite properly did it, Justice Stevens, because rule

 8   502 of the Federal Rules of Evidence -- 501 or 502 says

 9   that principles of privilege shall be developed in light

10   of reason and experience, and so it was a specific grant

11   to this Court of the authority to do that.

12               But beyond that Congress did not intend that

13   the Court use supervisory powers to exclude relevant

14   evidence.   There is a rulemaking process; if the bench

15   and bar want to get together and conclude as they did

16   not conclude in 1943 -- this is the point I was trying

17   to make to Justice Breyer -- in 1943 after this Court's

18   decision in McNabb, there was explicit consideration of

19   an exclusionary rule provision in rule 5; it engendered

20   enormous controversy; it was rejected; it was taken out

21   of the rule and it was never promulgated.

22               So McNabb-Mallory exists not by virtue of

23   the rulemaking process but by virtue of a supervisory

24   decision of this Court more than half a century ago in

25   an entirely different legal climate, in a climate where

 1   the costs of excluding a reliable, probative confession

 2   were not balanced against the benefits, if any, to be

 3   achieved by enforcing of a prompt present requirement

 4   through exclusion.

 5              Since that time this Court's Miranda

 6   jurisprudence has made it far more inappropriate for the

 7   Court to conclude that the enforcement of a rule-based

 8   mechanism which serves as a prophylactic to protect

 9   voluntariness should now result in exclusion of a

10   confession when rule 501 says voluntary confessions come

11   in and section -- and rule 402 says that relevant

12   evidence comes in unless excluded by four sources --

13   not-

14              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Is there any indication

15   of the rules advisory committee, any of their notes,

16   that 402 was meant to overturn McNabb-Mallory?

17              MR. DREEBEN:            No, I -- Justice Ginsburg, the

18   rules advisory committee notes I think reflect an

19   expectation that McNabb-Mallory was the law.               Our

20   submission is that the text of 402 is simply

21   inconsistent with that, because it is quite explicit in

22   limiting the sources of rules that can bar the admission

23   of admissible evidence; and the phrase that is in 402,

24   which is on page 29 of our brief, is "rules prescribed

25   by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority."

 1                 Now the advisory committee drafters may have

 2   thought that that subsumed rule 5, but I think that is a

 3   legal question for this Court, and the correct answer to

 4   that is McNabb-Mallory is a rule of supervisory power,

 5   not a rule promulgated by this Court.

14                Rule 402 as it was enacted clearly was not

15   intended to overturn existing rules of inadmissibility

16   such as McNabb-Mallory.          We know that because the

18   rule of inadmissibility that would survive after rule

19   402.   It was --

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, it may not

21   have been intended to do that but doesn't its language

22   on its face cover that?

23                MR. McCOLGIN:           Not at all, because it was

24   statutorily based and it was viewed as being statutorily

25   based, because it was it was based on the existing

 1   statutes at the time of McNabb which were seen as

 2   precluding presentment delay.              And then after the

 3   enactment of -- of rule 5, it was seen as based on that

 4   as well.

 5               After -- in 1968 Mallory was also seen as

 6   being incorporated into 3501(c) which is clear from the

 7   citation in the advisory note to both Mallory and

 8   3501(c).   So it was viewed when it was enacted as

 9   leaving in place McNabb-Mallory, because McNabb-Mallory

10   was viewed as being pursuant to statutory authority --

11   pursuant to statutory authority because it was enforcing

12   statutory rights.

13               So rule 402 clearly does not in any way

14   overturn McNabb-Mallory.

15               I would like to address very quickly the

16   Miranda issue and note that you know, certainly,

17   although Miranda came into effect after McNabb-Mallory,

18   Miranda itself in rule 32 notes that the existence of

19   the Miranda warnings should not be seen as a basis for

20   disregarding the rights under McNabb and Mallory and the

21   importance of that exclusionary rule.                    So Miranda itself

22   recognized that it was still important to have a

23   protection against presentment delay, and I think the

24   facts of this case illustrate that very well.

25               We have in this case a flagrant and

 1   deliberate violation of the right of prompt presentment,

 2   where the agents admitted freely that they delayed the

 3   presentment in order to obtain the confession.                If --

 4   again, if the Third Circuit were to be affirmed in this

 5   case, it would be telling law enforcement around the

 6   country that that sort of flagrant conduct is

 7   permissible.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, but that --

 9   that sort of flagrant conduct would not be an issue if

10   it had been done within six hours, right?                Assuming it

11   was a voluntary confession?

12               MR. McCOLGIN:         That's correct.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                The purpose of the

14   law enforcement officers, if it's voluntary, is

15   irrelevant under six hours.

16               MR. McCOLGIN:         As long as it is under six

17   hours, that's correct, there is no problem; and that's

18   because within six hours there is no delay.                Congress

19   has determined that anything less than six hours is not

20   within --

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, doesn't it

22   seem odd that the focus on flagrant conduct at 6:01 as

23   being as important as you are emphasizing, but not --

24   but totally irrelevant at 5:59?

25               MR. McCOLGIN:         There has to be line-drawing

 1   in this sort of case, so when you get close to the line,

 2   you may have results that are dramatically different.

 3   In this case we are far outside the line.                  The second

 4   confession was 26 and a half hours after the arrest; and

 5   as I have noted and as this Court has noted, it was a

 6   deliberate delay for the purpose of obtaining the

 7   confessions.

 8                 Where we have such purposeful delay,

 9   Congress left McNabb-Mallory in place to address

10   precisely such flagrant conduct.

11                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Can you waive the right, the

12   5(a) right?

13                 MR. McCOLGIN:         Yes, Your Honor, as long as

14   it is waived within the six-hour time period, and as

15   long as it is an expressed waiver of a right to prompt

16   presentment, it can be waived.               In this case, of course,

17   there was no waiver; there wasn't even a Miranda waiver

18   until well -- well after the six hours.

19                 If there is no further questions, thank you,

20   Your Honor.

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

22   The case is submitted.

24   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
