 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   We will hear

 4   argument next in case 07-751, Pearson v. Callahan.

 5              Mr. Stirba.

 6                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER STIRBA,

 7                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 8              MR. STIRBA:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10              At the time of the arrest in this case there

11   were three different Federal circuits and two State

12   courts that established it was Constitutionally

13   permissible for police officers to enter a home without

14   a warrant as a follow-up entry to effectuate arrest

15   after an illegal drug transaction when a government

16   agent had occurred and probable cause had been

17   established.

18              Although the rule has become known as the

19   doctrine of consent once removed, and the lower courts

20   have banned various rationales in support of the rule,

21   the name or label is not important.                      What is important

22   is that the rule is predicated upon well recognized

23   Fourth Amendment principles, and that at the time of the

24   arrest the consent doctrine was well established in the

25   lower courts as settled Fourth Amendment law.


                                         3

 1              Thus, irrespective of how this Court rules

 2   on the constitutionality of the rule itself, the

 3   Petitioner officers could have reasonably believed that

 4   what they were doing was lawful.

 5              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, because the

 6   Fourth Amendment principle of consent was well

 7   established?   In other words, if a police officer goes

 8   to the door and says "May I come in," that is -- that is

 9   perfectly acceptable.      Is that -- that the level of

10   generality that you think we ought to analyze this issue

11   at?

12              MR. STIRBA:         No, certainly we think that the

13   generality of just pure consent is not the level at

14   which it should be determined.              In fact, that was the

15   problem with the Tenth Circuit case.                    But it has to

16   be -- the right has to be defined in a specific clear

17   way, and it has to be -- the contours of the right have

18   to be sufficiently clear that police officers know that

19   when they engage in the conduct, they know what they

20   they're doing is unlawful.

21              In this case, Mr. Chief Justice, all of the

22   law that was in existing at the time of the entry was

23   supportive of exactly what the police officers did.

24              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Well, it seems to me that

25   misses the point of the case.             I mean, the point of the


                                        4

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   case is that consent to the police was established,

 2   consent to police informants was not, and that when I

 3   consent I am not consenting to the -- to the whole

 4   world.     If I am consenting to somebody who is not a

 5   police officer, that is not equivalent to consenting to

 6   a police officer.     That's the point of the case; and as

 7   I understand it, there was -- there was only one case at

 8   the time that this occurred which equated the

 9   confidential informant for the police with the police;

10   and that was the Seventh Circuit case; isn't that

11   correct?

12                 MR. STIRBA:        Justice Souter, we are not --

13   we are not contending this is an implied consent case,

14   although that has been a theory that has been advanced

15   in the lower courts.        We believe that the way that this

16   was constitutionally lawful -- this is really a Lewis

17   case, and that is once you engage in some illegal

18   conduct with a government agent in your home, you have

19   waived any expectation of privacy.

20                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             No, but that -- that

21   equates -- in terms of existing law, that equates the

22   government agent, which in this case is not a police

23   officer, but a confidential informant, with a police

24   officer.    And it seems to me that is the nub of the

25   case:    Is that person equivalent, so that consent to one


                                          5

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   in effect is consent to as many police as want to come

 2   in, or is it not the case?           And it seems to me what you

 3   have got to argue here is that the confidential

 4   informant and the police officer for Fourth Amendment

 5   purposes should be treated as identical.

 6                 MR. STIRBA:       Absolutely.              And we do -- and

 7   we think --

 8                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            And there is no clear law

 9   on that.   That's why we are here.                There's one -- at the

10   time that this search was made, as I understand it,

11   there was only one case which held there was such an

12   equivalence, is that correct?

13                 MR. STIRBA:       There are two points,

14   Justice Souter.    First of all, with respect to the

15   lawfulness of the confidential --

16                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, first -- I want to

17   hear what you say, but tell me, is it correct that at

18   that time there was one case that held the equivalence?

19                 MR. STIRBA:       No, Your Honor.             There actually

20   -- there were actually three out of the Seventh Circuit,

21   the Pollard case out of the Sixth Circuit, which

22   involved a police officer and a confidential informant

23   --

24                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Which was not a circuit

25   case, right?


                                         6

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              MR. STIRBA:         That is a circuit case.


 2              JUSTICE SOUTER:              District case?


 3              MR. STIRBA:         That was a circuit court case,


 4   U.S. v. Pollard.

 5              JUSTICE SOUTER:              So there were three circuit

 6   court holdings that the confidential informant was

 7   equivalent to a police officer?

 8              MR. STIRBA:         There were three out of the

 9   Seventh Circuit.   Paul, Diaz, and I think it's Aziano

10   were all confidential information cases where the courts

11   ruled squarely that there was no difference between a

12   confidential informant and a police officer.

13              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Okay, did you -- now, do

14   you have other circuits that held that?

15              MR. STIRBA:         Yes, Your Honor.         The Pollard

16   case involved a confidential informant --

17              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Where is Pollard from?

18              MR. STIRBA:         Sixth Circuit.

19              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Sixth.

20              MR. STIRBA:         And they cited in support the

21   confidential informant cases from the Seventh Circuit.

22   We also read Gramble -- this is a 2000 -- I'm sorry, a

23   995 Ninth Circuit case which talked about a government

24   agent, it did not draw a distinction between a

25   confidential informant and a police officer -- as

 1   supportive as well.       That's exactly what Judge Kelly

 2   determined in the dissenting opinion in the Tenth

 3   Circuit.

 4              JUSTICE SOUTER:                Okay.      Now why -- why are

 5   they correct?     Why should the confidential informant be

 6   treated as equivalent to a police officer?

 7              MR. STIRBA:           Well, fundamentally -- and of

 8   course the test for Fourth Amendments purposes is the

 9   Skinner test -- that once you are a government agent or

10   a government actor, there really is no material

11   difference in terms what the confidential informant

12   would do or the undercover police officer would do.

13              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Oh, but there is an

14   enormous difference between the training and the

15   character of a police officer and, as this very case

16   illustrates, the confidential informants are often very

17   shady characters who can't be counted on to be

18   truth-tellers, and have a powerful incentive to get

19   someone for the police, because in most cases they are

20   seeking to have their own case dealt with

21   sympathetically.    So, how can you equate a police

22   officer with a confidential informer, who is usually

23   someone who knows where the drug house is because he's a

24   dealer himself?

25              MR. STIRBA:           Two points.              In our reply

 1   brief, pages 6 and 7, we point out the wide variety of

 2   confidential informants.           They come in many different

 3   shapes and sizes.

 4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How about this one?

 5   Wasn't this one that fits my description, the one in

 6   this case?

 7                 MR. STIRBA:        This one clearly had a drug

 8   problem.     This one also attended college.               This one also

 9   was a star athlete in high school, and this one also was

10   reliable in a previous drug transaction.                  Moreover --

11                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             He was trying -- and he was

12   trying to make a deal to get leniency with the police.

13                 MR. STIRBA:        Well, there is no question

14   about that.    But once again, he is a government actor.

15   For purposes of Fourth Amendment liability it doesn't

16   matter whether it's a police officer or a confidential

17   informant, as long as he is an agent of the government,

18   which clearly he was.        He was a government actor --

19                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             But you -- you certainly

20   cannot argue -- maybe you are, but I don't see how can

21   you argue in response to Justice Ginsburg that the

22   integrity to be expected from a confidential informant,

23   taking that as a category of law including all sorts of

24   informants, is the integrity that we would expect in a

25   police officer.

 1                 MR. STIRBA:       Well, as a general proposition,

 2   Justice Souter, you can't make that kind of

 3   determination.    We point out --

 4                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Why can't I?

 5                 MR. STIRBA:       Because sometimes confidential

 6   informants are retired police officers; sometimes

 7   confidential informants are police cadets.                 Sometimes

 8   confidential informants --

 9                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Then if that -- if that is

10   true, as it clearly is, they run the gamut from the good

11   to the bad.    You can't make -- adopt the proposition

12   categorically that confidential informants should be

13   regarded as having the same integrity as a police

14   officer.

15                 MR. STIRBA:       I wouldn't want to make that

16   statement.    I don't know that it's material, though, to

17   the analysis under the Fourth Amendment and whether or

18   not, once you are a government agent or a government

19   actor, there really is no legal significance that flows

20   from that to draw a distinction between one who is

21   actually employed by the police, taking a paycheck from

22   the police, and one who is not.

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            There's one feature of

24   this is that I think is really puzzling:                 What this case

25   is about is the Fourth Amendment, that requires, with


                                        10

 1   certain exceptions, the main rule is to get a warrant.

 2   And here you have a confidential informer going to the

 3   place to make sure that they really do have the goods.

 4   Then he goes back to the police.                He spends two hours.

 5   He's being wired and whatever else.                      Why didn't somebody

 6   pick up the phone and get a warrant at that point?                        The

 7   confidential informer could say:                "I was there and I saw

 8   the drugs."    What -- the whole purpose of these rules is

 9   to have the police get a warrant when they can.                      And how

10   do you explain that two hours lapse between when they

11   had probable cause and when the -- when the informant

12   returns for the second time?

13                 MR. STIRBA:       Well, Justice Ginsburg, the

14   officers testified why they didn't get a warrant,

15   244-245 in the joint appendix, and 256 and 257.                     Two

16   problems:   One, they weren't sure the drugs were going

17   to be there.    These are small amounts of drugs in a

18   rural area; they dissipate very quickly.

19                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           We're talking about

20   probable cause.    If they got a warrant within an hour or

21   two of the time that that informant says he saw them

22   there, do you seriously question whether there would be

23   probable cause?

24                 MR. STIRBA:       I am only going on the record

25   and what these informed officers testified to.

 1                JUSTICE SOUTER:            But we're asking for the

 2   basis.   You're asking for a rule and our questions go to

 3   the reason for having that rule.                And the officers may

 4   have said -- and I will assume they said -- in this

 5   case:    Oh, gee, we weren't sure the drugs would still be

 6   there.   But in terms of probable cause law, that's just

 7   not a serious answer, is it?

 8                MR. STIRBA:        Well, it is.             In essence we are

 9   talking about an anticipatory warrant, and under U.S. v.

10   Grubbs you not only need probable cause to believe that

11   the drugs will be there --

12                JUSTICE SOUTER:            They don't even need an

13   anticipatory warrant.       They need a warrant to go in and

14   search that place on the grounds that there are probably

15   drugs there, and if they saw drugs there a couple of

16   hours beforehand and they had no affirmative evidence

17   which they should bring forward under the Frank standard

18   to indicate that the drugs were being taken out, is

19   there any serious question that probable cause would be

20   found?

21                MR. STIRBA:        Justice -- Justice Souter, I

22   don't believe at the time, approximately 9 o'clock in

23   the evening, the police had probable cause to believe

24   the drugs were there.

 1   and said there were drugs there and they don't have

 2   probable cause?

 3              MR. STIRBA:           At the time of 9 o'clock, I

 4   don't think it was established that there were drugs --

 5              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Why not?

 6              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                I thought it was

 7   established not only that there were drugs, but that he

 8   actually tasted some.

 9              MR. STIRBA:           He never told the police that.

10   And the purpose --

11              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                But --

12              MR. STIRBA:           The purpose of the operation,

13   of course, was to establish that there was in fact drugs

14   in the house.   The transaction would occur and that

15   would conclusively establish probable cause.              I don't

16   think we should fault the police for essentially being

17   careful before they entered the home to make sure that

18   in fact they had probable cause.

19              JUSTICE SOUTER:               The reason the police are

20   being faulted is that they didn't get a warrant.               And

21   the warrant requirement is a generally good starting

22   place for a Fourth Amendment argument.

23              Justice Ginsburg's point is that if they had

24   an informant who had seen drugs in the place within two

25   hours, they had, if they'd been before a magistrate, the


                                         13

 1   basis in probable cause to get a warrant.                 And I still

 2   haven't heard why in fact they couldn't have got one or

 3   why they didn't have the probable cause.

 4                 MR. STIRBA:        Well, as I -- as I explained

 5   before, they believed the drugs in --

 6                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            I'm not interested in what

 7   they personally believed.            We're talking about objective

 8   Fourth Amendment standards.              Did they or did they not

 9   have a basis to establish probable cause at that point?

10                 MR. STIRBA:        We don't believe they did, Your

11   Honor.     And we don't believe they could have gotten a --

12                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            That is --

13                 MR. STIRBA:        -- an anticipatory warrant.

14                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            I will admit that is the

15   most astonishing view of probable cause I have heard in

16   this courtroom.     Of course they had.

17                 MR. STIRBA:        Well, the record evidence

18   doesn't substantiate that, or they would have gotten --

19                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Why doesn't it?

20                 MR. STIRBA:        Or they would have gotten a

21   warrant.

22                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Why doesn't it?    As I

23   understand, the record evidence is that their informant

24   was in that guy's home, and within two hours of the

25   point that we went through, the second entry, he had


                                         14

 1   seen drugs.    Why wasn't there probable cause within that

 2   two-hour period?

 3                 MR. STIRBA:       Because the police did not

 4   believe that at the time that they could have gotten a

 5   warrant, that the drugs would not have been dissipated.

 6   And they -- as they testified --

 7                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Is that a reasonable

 8   belief?

 9                 MR. STIRBA:       Pardon me?

10                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           I mean, we're talking about

11   probable cause, not an establishment of mathematical

12   certainty.

13                 MR. STIRBA:       Here's another point.          That is

14   just an option, Justice Souter, the police -- if you

15   believed the police could get a warrant.                 They didn't

16   have to get a warrant.        They obviously were engaged in a

17   buy/bust operation, which eventually led to them to the

18   particular position where they clearly established

19   probable cause.

20                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           They clearly would have

21   been if they had sent a police officer in.                 You're

22   asking us to extend the police officer rule to include a

23   confidential informant rule.             One reason for doing so

24   is, or would be, that in practical terms there is a need

25   for it.   Justice Ginsburg's question was, why is there a

 1   need for it, when they could have gotten a warrant?                     And

 2   we still haven't heard an answer.

 3                 MR. STIRBA:       In rural Utah -- and this is

 4   page 47 of the joint appendix -- the officers testified

 5   that one of the reasons why they need to use

 6   confidential informants is because the police are all

 7   known.   And, therefore, if they're going to engage in

 8   any drug --

 9                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Then why didn't they use

10   the confidential informant to get a warrant?

11                 MR. STIRBA:       Well, I don't know how I can

12   answer the question any more than I have,

13   Justice Souter.

14                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           That doesn't --

15                 MR. STIRBA:       They -- they chose not to, for

16   reasons they didn't believe they had probable cause and

17   they were concerned that the drugs had been dissipated.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, in every --

19   given the posture of the ultimate issue in this case on

20   the underlying constitutional question, you do not have

21   to prove that you are right; isn't that correct?                  You

22   have to establish that the contrary principle is not

23   clearly established?

24                 MR. STIRBA:       That's correct.           And the law at

25   the time that these officers engaged in this operation,


                                        16

 1   entered the home -- and once again, it was based upon

 2   probable cause -- supported in fact constitutionally

 3   what they did, and that it was indeed permissible.                    And

 4   that was the basis upon which we believe, irrespective

 5   of how the Court views whether they should or should not

 6   have gotten a warrant and the constitutional

 7   implications of that, that the law was clearly not

 8   established sufficiently such that these officers were

 9   entitled to qualified immunity.               That was one of the

10   problems with the Tenth Circuit case.                    They --

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            May I just establish one

12   thing?    Tell me if I am wrong.             That this argument about

13   consent once removed was not presented in the lower

14   courts.    That is, in the trial court you argued exigent

15   circumstances, and then on appeal the inevitable

16   discovery rule.    So there was -- in the courts below,

17   this was not given as the reason, the consent once

18   removed was not alleged as the basis, as the

19   justification for this search?

20                 MR. STIRBA:       That's true.             On the criminal

21   appeal, the State did not argue Lewis, did not argue

22   consent once removed.       And that is part of the problem

23   with a number of cases that have been cited by the

24   Respondent.    They are exigent circumstances cases where

25   the consent once removed doctrine of Lewis isn't even

 2              Unless the justices have any other

 3   questions, I'll reserve the rest of my time.

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

 5              MR. STIRBA:          Thank you.

 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

 8               ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 9                          AS AMICUS CURIAE,

10                 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

11              MR. STEWART:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

12   please the Court:

13              The police entry in this case was

14   constitutional and, in any event, did not infringe any

15   constitutional right that was clearly established at the

16   time the officers acted.          The mandatory order of

17   decision for qualified immunity cases announced in

18   Saucier v. Katz should be overruled.

19              I did want to begin by clarifying the answer

20   to your question, Justice Ginsburg, because I'm not sure

21   if it was entirely clear.           There were really two cases

22   here, one of which was the criminal prosecution of Mr.

23   Callahan, the Respondent in this Court.                   And the

24   individual officers were not parties as to that case.

25   That was handled by the State of Utah.                   And you're


                                        18

 1   correct that in the criminal proceeding the consent once

 2   removed argument was not made.               And that led to the

 3   motion to suppress ultimately being granted and

 4   consequently Mr. Callahan was not subject to criminal

 5   proceedings.

 6               Mr. Callahan did file a civil suit against

 7   the individual officers who were involved in effecting

 8   the arrest, and in that civil proceeding the consent

 9   once removed argument was made all the way up.                It was

10   made in the district court, and it was made in the court

11   of appeals as well.

12               JUSTICE ALITO:           Mr. Stewart, could I follow

13   up on one other thing that came up during the preceding

14   argument?   Isn't the issue whether there was or was not

15   probable cause quite separate from the consent once

16   removed doctrine?     What -- assuming that there was

17   probable cause here, there may be many instances in

18   which the consent once removed doctrine would be

19   applied, if it's a valid doctrine, where there wasn't

20   previously probable cause.

21               MR. STEWART:          That's correct.        I think the

22   consent once removed doctrine would have its greatest

23   utility in cases where the police suspect but don't have

24   probable cause to believe that a particular individual

25   is engaged in criminal activity, and so they send an

 1   informant or an undercover police officer in to try to

 2   either confirm or dispel their suspicions.                 They

 3   wouldn't be able to get a warrant at the outset because

 4   they would not have probable cause at that time of

 5   ongoing criminal conduct.

 6                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           But if our question is

 7   should consent once removed be recognized as a doctrine

 8   that covers the confidential informant in this case, one

 9   question that we may sensibly ask is, is there a need to

10   recognize that broad a consent doctrine?                 And one

11   question that would bear on that would be, in these

12   cases, is there difficulty or impossibility of getting a

13   warrant under normal probable cause standards?                 And I

14   think that was the point of Justice Ginsburg's question.

15   Do you doubt that they could have gotten a warrant

16   within the two-hour period?

17                 MR. STEWART:        We certainly think that they

18   had probable cause.      There was testimony from police

19   officers to the effect that magistrates in Utah would be

20   reluctant to grant warrants based on these circumstances

21   because of the possibility that the drugs would be

22   dissipated.    I am not in a position to second-guess

23   their empirical experience as to the circumstances under

24   which Utah magistrates will and will not grant warrants.

25   But we think as a legal matter that there was probable


                                        20
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   cause, and that a warrant should have been issued.                   But

 2   certainly there are -- there are plenty of

 3   circumstances --

 4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That's -- it's not just

 5   this case.     Maybe you can tell me.                I thought because

 6   they were dealing with a confidential informant rather

 7   than a police officer, they sent him in to do the dry

 8   run.     I mean the -- in the police officer cases usually

 9   the -- the undercover police officer goes in.                   The other

10   police officers are there ready to come in when he gives

11   them the signal.     But the police officers don't

12   ordinarily go through this dry run that they had here

13   with the confidential informer.

14                 MR. STEWART:         Well, I -- I would think that

15   with either police officers or with informants you could

16   have some situations in which the undercover operative

17   has very recently attempted to confirm the presence of

18   drugs.    And you can have other cases in which the

19   undercover operative, again either an informant or a

20   police officer, could hear rumors on the street that a

21   particular individual was engaged in drug-dealing, might

22   not have probable cause, and they might decide that the

23   best way to set up the operation was to send this person

24   in to attempt to make a buy at a time when probable

25   cause was lacking.      But they would want to arrange the


                                         21
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   operation in such a way that if the operative's

 2   experience confirmed their suspicions and gave them

 3   probable cause to arrest, they would be able to go in

 4   immediately.

 5              And our principal contention is not that the

 6   consent to the entry of Bartholomew was implicit consent

 7   to the later entry of the police officers.              It was that

 8   once a person has, even unknowingly, admitted a

 9   government agent into his home, his expectation of

10   privacy is sharply reduced and the entry of the officers

11   works an insubstantial incremental invasion of privacy.

12              And I would like to return to the point that

13   Mr. Stirba was making.       It's true that the informant

14   here lacked the training and skills that -- and

15   integrity, for that matter, that you would expect a

16   police officer to have.        But he was for Fourth Amendment

17   purposes a government agent a State actor.              If his

18   handlers had instructed him to look for an opportunity

19   to rummage through the drawers --

20              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Mr. Stewart, could I

21   interrupt you, because there is something that hasn't

22   been reached.   Do you think that we should answer the

23   constitutional question first or the immunity question

24   first?

25              MR. STEWART:          We think that this Court in


                                       22
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   this case should address the constitutional question

 2   first because it is the subject of the square circuit

 3   conflict, it's been briefed and argued, it's a question

 4   that independently warrants resolution.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:           It is quite difficult.   I

 6   mean there -- we don't know quite a lot about whether

 7   they would have gotten a warrant, how -- how dangerous

 8   it was, whether the drugs were likely to be hidden.              And

 9   I was thinking of it, and that's why I am saying this,

10   is that it's a perfect reason since constitutional

11   questions in this area are -- are like the stars in the

12   sky.   There are so many.         Rather than having the judges

13   answer each one and getting everything mixed up, why not

14   just have them take whatever is the easier path?             As a

15   judge I like to take what is the easier path.

16                 MR. STEWART:        Well --

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:           And if it's easier to deal

18   with the qualified immunity, deal with it and forget the

19   rest of it.

20                 MR. STEWART:        I guess the first thing I

21   would say in response to that is we think that the --

22   the balance or the way in which discretion will

23   ordinarily be exercised will typically be different in

24   the case of the lower courts than in the case of this

25   Court, because the principal role of the lower Federal

 1   courts is to decide individual cases before them usually

 2   in the most expeditious and noncontroversial way where

 3   they --

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:            I see that, but unless we

 5   do that here, they are never going to get the right

 6   message.   And so what we will have is 1,000 judges

 7   trying in an average in a year 50 or 60 cases each with

 8   multiple facts, and we will have approximately over a

 9   10-year period hundreds of thousands.                   I've exaggerated,

10   but there will be many, many -- many, many conflicts,

11   many, many confusions.       And unless we say, no, we are

12   not doing it ourselves, how will they ever get the

13   message?

14               MR. STEWART:         Well, I think they will get

15   the message --

16               JUSTICE BREYER:            We don't always have to do

17   it, but I mean once.

18               MR. STEWART:         I think they will get the

19   message if the Court tells them that the mandatory rule

20   of Saucier is no longer in effect, that courts have

21   discretion to decide based on their sound judgment

22   whether it is --

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Why isn't it -- why

24   isn't it an advisory opinion, if we do not have to

25   decide -- to decide the ultimate question whether this

 1   is constitutional or not, but simply whether or not it

 2   was clearly established whether it was unconstitutional?

 3   Why isn't it purely an advisory opinion to say whether

 4   it's constitutional or not?

 5               MR. STEWART:         I mean, in one sense it's an

 6   advisory opinion, but in another sense there are --

 7   there are often cases in which two alternative grounds

 8   for a decision are proffered, either one of which, if

 9   accepted, would compel a judgment in one litigant's

10   favor.   And the fact that it would theoretically -- if

11   the court concludes there is only --

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No, no.     Those are

13   different grounds, it seems to me.                 Those are two

14   independent, as you said.          Here it's kind of a -- it's a

15   progression.   You first ask, either, under somebody's

16   view, I guess, Saucier, whether or not it's

17   constitutional or not and then whether it's clearly

18   established.

19               I just don't know why the first question

20   isn't purely advisory, because you don't have to know

21   whether it's constitutional or not.

22               MR. STEWART:         Well, it's true that if the

23   Court announced that this search was constitutional,

24   that it would necessarily be saying:                    And there was no

25   clearly established constitutional law to the contrary

 1   at the time the officers acted.                But the Court --

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:             -- to the question.        I

 3   mean, look, if I have to answer the constitutional

 4   question -- and what bothers me is this consent at one

 5   remove.    What?   You are saying a drug seller who lets in

 6   a disguised policeman in order to sell him a drug

 7   because he thinks he's a druggie is suddenly consenting

 8   to the entire LAPD coming into his house?                    I would think

 9   that is the last thing he would have thought about

10   wanting, not the first.

11                MR. STEWART:          But that -- that would be

12   equally true in the case of the undercover police

13   officer.

14                JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, maybe they both

15   should be the same.       I --

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             That's what I wanted to

17   know, and it gets back to the merits and not Saucier.

18   We are going through two different things here.

19                Assume this is an undercover officer, not an

20   -- not a -- not an informant.               Now, the undercover

21   officer sees a crime being committed, and he is ready to

22   make the arrest.    Can he automatically ask for police

23   assistance and -- and other policemen?                    Are the police

24   then entitled to come into the home in your view, or do

25   there have to be some exigent circumstances?

 1                 MR. STEWART:        No.      We think he could

 2   automatically ask for the police to come into the home

 3   because the incremental intrusion on privacy by having

 4   several police officers rather than one to make the

 5   arrest would be insubstantial.

 6                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           But isn't the reason it's

 7   insubstantial is that we have a rule for independent

 8   reasons having nothing necessarily to do with this kind

 9   of situation in which one officer's knowledge is

10   regarded as another officer's knowledge.                 The police are

11   regarded as a group, so that we have a rule ready, in

12   place, saying:    You show one, you have shown the whole

13   department.

14                 We don't, however, have any such rule with

15   respect to agents generally.

16                 MR. STEWART:        I think you don't have that

17   precise rule, but it is nevertheless the case that the

18   undercover operative here, the informant, was a State

19   actor.   Had he been instructed to look in private places

20   without consent, his conduct would have constituted a

21   Fourth Amendment violation because he would have been

22   regarded for that purpose as -- as an agent of the

23   State, and he should, therefore, be regarded as a State

24   agent for these purposes.

25                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Just -- just to be clear,

 1   if -- if I may, I know your red light is on:                Your

 2   position is if an undercover officer is in the premises

 3   and sees a crime being committed, he automatically can

 4   invite police in to assist him in making an arrest

 5   without exigent circumstances?

 6              MR. STEWART:         That's correct.

 7              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What's -- what do I read?

 8   What authority do you cite me for that proposition?

 9              MR. STEWART:         I don't think this -- this

10   Court has ever squarely so held.              I believe that the

11   Respondents concede that because they don't take issue

12   with the fact that consent once removed is applicable

13   when the person already inside is an undercover police

14   officer.

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

20   and may it please the Court:

21              This is a case about consent.                 By consenting

22   to the entry of a confidential informant, that Mr.

24              The answer is no, and no reasonable officer

25   could have believed otherwise.

 1               This Court has long held that it is

 2   presumptively unreasonable for police to enter a home

 3   without consent or exigent circumstances or a warrant.

 4   Here there were no exigent circumstances; there was no

 5   warrant, nor was there any consent.

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   YOU -- was Mr.

 7   Stewart correct that you concede that if this person

 8   entering the house were in fact a police officer, that

 9   this would have been okay?

10               MR. METZLER:           No, Your Honor.         We think it's

11   a closer case, but if it is a -- if this confidential

12   informant had been a police officer, it would be the

13   same analysis.   There is no exigent circumstance here;

14   there is no consent.        And -- and the consent to be

15   competent to the police officer in your case would not

16   extend to the police officer in your case would not

17   extend to the --

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, you would agree he

19   could make the -- the arrest by himself.                  Assuming he

20   was a police officer --

21               MR. METZLER:           Yes.

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              -- he could make the

23   arrest by himself.

24               MR. METZLER:           -- he could make the arrest by

25   himself.   But --

 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But -- and -- but you are

 2   saying he can't ask for assistance to make that arrest

 3   effective in all cases.        There has to be some exigent

 4   circumstance.

 5                MR. METZLER:        Correct.          If -- if there are

 6   some sort of exigent circumstances, in this case they

 7   would plan that in advance; and police are not allowed

 8   to create their own exigency to get around the Fourth

 9   Amendment.

10                JUSTICE ALITO:         You are advocating a rule

11   that is going to get police officers killed, aren't they

12   -- aren't you?   If an undercover police officer is in a

13   house making drug buy, and you want to say that the

14   single officer who is there in an undercover capacity

15   can say, "You guys are all under arrest," he can't

16   signal for other police officers to come in and help him

17   effect the arrest without anybody being killed?

18                MR. METZLER:        Of course, the safest thing

19   for him would be to simply withdraw, get on the

20   telephone, and get a warrant to come back in, or during

21   the two hours that they were planning this entry he

22   could have gotten a warrant then or an anticipatory

23   warrant.   There are plenty of stated options.

24                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, it seems to me that

25   in the case that Justice Alito put, that there are


                                       30
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   exigent circumstances.

 2               MR. METZLER:          Well, to the extent they

 3   planned it in advance, and the basis of their entry --

 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, that -- that's a

 5   different point and I have some question about that.              It

 6   seems to me the police are never quite sure exactly

 7   what's going to happen.

 8               MR. METZLER:          Well, if they -- if they

 9   planned on an exigent circumstance as being the reason

10   that they are allowed to go in, under this Court's

11   decision -- the long line of decisions in Payton and

12   Steagald saying exigent circumstances or consent are the

13   way to get in without a warrant, then it would not be

14   permissible.   If --

15               JUSTICE BREYER:             Imagining -- you are

16   imagining different cases.           We can imagine a spectrum of

17   cases.   In some cases the policeman or the confidential

18   informant will be there, and he really couldn't have

19   gotten a -- a thing in advance -- a warrant in advance.

20   It wasn't certain, and they are in there and they see a

21   lot of drug behavior going on, and the drugs are going

22   to be hidden, go, disappear the second he leaves; and if

23   he tries to arrest them, everybody is going to jump on

24   him and kill him.    Okay?

25               So there are a lot of cases just like this


                                        31

 1   one, but with a few changes, which are -- he needs to

 2   call the police, and there will be others where he

 3   doesn't.

 4               So that's why I am so uncertain about what

 5   it is we are deciding here on the merits.                     We would have

 6   to say on the merits this is a case where there are no

 7   exigent circumstances.         Can we say that?              I -- would not

 8   want to "never are there."

 9               MR. METZLER:           I think certainly in this case

10   there were not exigent circumstances.                     The informant was

11   on his way out the door.           He -- he wasn't attempting to

12   make an arrest.   No one thought that the -- that Mr.

13   Callahan would destroy the drugs or that anyone would

14   leave.   In fact, the Petitioners abandoned exigent

15   circumstances in the court of appeal.                     So I think you

16   can decide this case on the merits, as there were no

17   exigent circumstances.         And then ask, is it reasonable

18   to think that because there was an informant inside and

19   because he sent out a signal that there was probable

20   cause, a drug transaction had happened inside the house,

21   does that make any difference whatsoever as to whether

22   there was consent?

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   That's a tough -- at

24   least I find it a very difficult question.                     I do not

25   find it necessarily a terribly difficult question

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   whether that -- whatever the answer is -- whether it was

 2   clearly established, precisely because I find the

 3   underlying questions difficult.                So you have a handful

 4   Court of Appeals decisions, you have got a factual

 5   variation; the issue is whether to extend the police

 6   coming in to a confidential informant, all of those

 7   questions are very difficult; but precisely because they

 8   are, it doesn't seem that the rule, whichever rule is

 9   adopted, is clearly established.

10               Why don't -- and yet if I were on the lower

11   court of appeals, you would say -- or Saucier would say,

12   I have got to decide that very difficult constitutional

13   question and then decide what's a very easy qualified

14   immunity question.      Does that -- why does that make

15   sense?

16               MR. METZLER:           With respect,

17   Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think it's a difficult

18   question.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, I know you

20   don't because you are arguing one side of it.

21               (Laughter.)

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   But concede for

23   purposes of argument that it is a difficult question.

24   Why don't we just tell the lower courts -- we do it, we

25   go right ahead to the qualified immunity question by not

 1   granting cert on one.      Why shouldn't the lower courts

 2   have the same luxury?

 3               MR. METZLER:         Well, with regard to the

 4   Saucier question, we think the Court should keep the

 5   Saucier question, and particularly in this case where

 6   there is a circuit split, the court should decide the

 7   constitutional question and not move on to the clearly

 8   established question --

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Why, because we need

10   to provide guidance on that question?

11               MR. METZLER:         Yes.

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, do you think

13   it can't come up any other way?

14               MR. METZLER:         It certainly could come up --

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Yes.

16               MR. METZLER:         -- in a criminal case.

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Or a -- or a suit

18   against the political subdivision, right?                    You could

19   have sued some other political entity other than the

20   officers individually, right?

21               MR. METZLER:         Certainly.             Mr. Callahan did

22   sue the county in this case.            But --

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It seems to me that this

24   is an area where the police do need guidance, and I need

25   guidance.   I find this -- I find this very difficult.

 1   It seems to me that we could have learned a lot if the

 2   -- if the courts of appeals had addressed this question.

 3                 MR. METZLER:        Well, this Court in Payton and

 4   Steagald --

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Which is what they do in

 6   Saucier.

 7                 MR. METZLER:        I didn't hear the Justice's

 8   questions.

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Which is what they would

10   do under Saucier.

11                 MR. METZLER:        Right.        Well, I mean, it's

12   important to understand the constitutional question

13   first in this case and in other cases in order to make

14   sure that the -- that the law continues to elaborate

15   that potentially meritorious constitutional

16   rights are --

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, but that was

18   my question.    There are other ways for the law to

19   develop.   The issue can come up on merits in the suit

20   against the municipality which doesn't raise the

21   qualified immunity question.             If you come up -- if you

22   have a search where a person sues to get whatever was

23   seized back.    You know, if there's a -- and also the

24   option is, if the question of which order want to

25   proceed is optional, the law can develop if the courts

 1   for good and sufficient reason decide to reach the

 2   constitutional question first.

 3              I -- I'm just wondering what benefit there

 4   is in an absolute rigid rule that courts of appeals -- I

 5   had a few of these cases in courts of appeals; I thought

 6   it was very odd that I had to go and decide a difficult

 7   constitutional issue and then not worry about it because

 8   in one sentence you say well, but the issue is not

 9   clearly established and so it's qualified immunity.

10              MR. METZLER:          Well, that would take us to

11   back before Saucier, the Court -- it's a recent decision

12   that hasn't been proven to be workable.                 And in fact --

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, but my point

14   though is that at least in my experience it was

15   unworkable, or at least frustrating, in that we had to

16   decide not just a factual question but a constitutional

17   question in a context where it wasn't necessary.

18              MR. METZLER:          Well, it depends on your view

19   of necessity.   In some cases certainly, it won't really

20   come up in other contexts and the law is not established

21   in section 1983; it may never be established.                 But here

22   we are talking about a question where there is a circuit

23   split and the Court definitely should provide guidance

24   to the lower courts.      I don't think that --

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Doesn't the fact

 1   that there is a circuit split almost by definition mean

 2   that it's not clearly established?

 3               MR. METZLER:          Well, this Court has looked to

 4   controlling -- its own precedents and controlling

 5   circuit law to decide what is -- what law is clearly

 6   established, and here, Payton and Steagald the courts

 7   held that there is a bright-line rule that's very simple

 8   for police officers, it's easy for them to understand.

 9               If they would like to enter without a

10   warrant and they don't have exigent circumstances and

11   they don't have consent, then it is presumptively

12   unconstitutional.    And it's a good rule and an easy rule

13   and it's also why this is not a difficult constitutional

14   question.   There are no exigent circumstances in this

15   case, and no reasonable officer could conclude that the

16   presence of a confidential informant in the house means

17   there is consent to the police officer.

18               JUSTICE ALITO:           What if -- what if the

19   officers in this case had read the Seventh Circuit

20   decision, and they said these are judges on the United

21   States Court of Appeals, and they think this is

22   consistent with the Fourth Amendment?                    And what's more,

23   one of these is written -- one of these opinions is

24   written by Judge Posner, and he's the smartest man in

25   the world --

 1               (Laughter.)

 2               JUSTICE ALITO:          He knows everything there is

 3   to know about law and economics and jurisprudence and

 4   literature and many other subjects.

 5               (Laughter).

 6               JUSTICE ALITO:          Is it unreasonable for them

 7   to follow that?

 8               MR. METZLER:         Well, I think the officers in

 9   the Tenth Circuit need to be aware the way that our

10   Federal court system works, and the Seventh Circuit

11   decision isn't binding on the Tenth Circuit.                 And with

12   all due respect to Judge Posner, he dropped ball on this

13   one.   He says this -- this is a the case where -- it's

14   the United States v Paul -- there are no exigent

15   circumstances; the officers there could have gotten a

16   warrant and in fact should have gotten a warrant but he

17   said it was justified by consent.                He's saying that

18   consent to one person is consent to many.                 And this

19   Court's cases have said that consent is based on

20   ordinary social expectation.            When you let one person

21   into your house, you just don't let in the whole world.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 If the Tenth Circuit

23   says this is not allowed, and every other circuit since

24   the Tenth Circuit's decision has held that it is, is

25   that clearly established that it's not allowed in the

 1   Tenth Circuit?

 2                 MR. METZLER:        Yes.       I think certainly an

 3   officer in the Tenth Circuit would be bound to follow

 4   the Tenth Circuit rule.         I mean, it's not irrelevant

 5   that other -- that other courts have decided it

 6   differently, but to the extent that there is controlling

 7   law in the circuit, I think that --

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Then it is

 9   irrelevant.    Then it is irrelevant that ten other

10   circuits have decided it differently.

11                 MR. METZLER:        Well, that very well might

12   wind up in this Court if --

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, right, but do

14   the police officers get to decide that?                  Do they get to

15   decide that not only Judge Posner thinks this, but ten

16   other circuits think this, and it has been five years

17   since the Tenth Circuit.          I mean, do they have to go

18   through that type of analysis?

19                 MR. METZLER:        Well, we don't expect officers

20   to survey the entire case law and come up with a law

21   professor's view of whether this is reasonable or not.

22   We expect them to follow the clearly -- the bright lines

23   that this Court has set down and that are set down in

24   their home jurisdictions.           And if their home

25   jurisdiction says it's unconstitutional it's not


                                        39
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   reasonable for them to follow some out-of-circuit

 2   decision.   If, for instance, the Seventh Circuit had

 3   said that a warrantless home entry is okay so long as

 4   the officer had breakfast in the last half-hour, that's

 5   an unreasonable rule, and it wouldn't be reasonable for

 6   any officer to follow that.            And the facts here are

 7   about as relevant to consent as to whether there was --

 8   the officer had breakfast that morning.

 9               So the officers here are not entitled to

10   qualify -- nor can they rely on the Seventh Circuit.

11   The Petitioners have not given you any reason to adopt a

12   new exception here.     They say this is based on a waiver

13   theory or that it's a private search or that it is

14   incident to arrest.     But all of those ignore the

15   substantial interest in the sanctity of the home.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Do any of the other

17   cases involve -- the other circuit cases involve

18   confidential informants as opposed to police officers?

19               MR. METZLER:         Other than the Seventh

20   Circuit?

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Yes.

22               MR. METZLER:         The -- one case in the Sixth

23   Circuit there was both a confidential informant and a

24   police officer were admitted.             And then there's a later

25   case in the Sixth Circuit that did say this is okay for

 1   it, which came after this case.

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So at the time every

 3   circuit other than the -- you know, if there is a police

 4   officer and a confidential informant, I think that could

 5   be considered a police officer because he is going to

 6   call the police in -- every court of appeals decision

 7   involving a confidential informant said it was okay.

 8              MR. METZLER:          Actually we have cited three

 9   circuits where these same facts happened.                     In the Eighth

10   Circuit, the First Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit.

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  And in those

12   circuits, did the court focus on the distinction between

13   the police officer and the confidential informant?

14              MR. METZLER:          Well, no.              The court looked to

15   whether there were exigent circumstances or consent.

16   The courts followed this Court's decision in Payton and

17   Bramble and that line of cases.

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Do you believe

19   that -- what is the appropriate level of generality to

20   look at in addressing this question, a case involving a

21   confidential informant?

22              MR. METZLER:          I think the appropriate level

23   of generality is that the facts under the court -- the

24   court has covered the field when it comes to warrantless

25   home entries.   If you have a warrant, you are okay.                    If


                                       41
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   you have exigent circumstances, you are okay.                And if

 2   you have consent, you are okay.             Everything else is

 3   presumptively unconstitutional.

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Why is that?

 5              MR. METZLER:         That's a good question.

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Why isn't it that

 7   the issue hasn't come up, this question of a

 8   confidential informant is one that hasn't come up?                Why

 9   would we say that is presumptively unconstitutional?

10              MR. METZLER:         Well, the Court's language is

11   presumptively unconstitutional has said that many times.

12              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You are talking about the

13   main role of police is get a warrant, except -- and I

14   think the Court has said a number of times to make this

15   search reasonable, the police have to get a warrant if

16   you want to interject the judicial between police and

17   the person in jeopardy.       So the main rule is warrant

18   unless -- and then you have exceptions, but I think your

19   point is that there is a main rule.

20              MR. METZLER:         Yes.

21              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             This Court has gotten

22   from the Constitution?

23              MR. METZLER:         Yes.

24              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Get a warrant if you can.

25              JUSTICE ALITO:          Isn't your argument that in

 1   a situation where the exigent circumstances are the

 2   creation of the scenario that the police have set up,

 3   the police cannot -- and you have a police officer who

 4   is being the undercover operative who has the power to

 5   make an arrest, that police officer cannot signal for

 6   other officers to come in and assist with the arrest?

 7                 MR. METZLER:         Well, our position is that

 8   would be -- the additional officer entry would violate

 9   the Constitution --

10                 JUSTICE ALITO:          The additional officers

11   would -- that would violate the Fourth Amendment?

12                 MR. METZLER:         Yes.

13                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Even if there is an officer

14   safety problem there?

15                 MR. METZLER:         Well, to the extent that they

16   have created an officer safety problem, obviously the

17   officers are going to go in to help him, no one is going

18   to get hurt.     But the additional officer's entry can

19   violate the Fourth Amendment.

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So the police say, you

21   know, we made a mistake.           We should have had a warrant,

22   but we have our man in there now, we have got to do

23   something.     The police cannot send assistance?

24                 MR. METZLER:         No, of course, they can send

25   assistance.     And they probably --


                                         43

 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             No.      You say they have

 2   created the exigent circumstances.

 3                MR. METZLER:          Yes, they have, which is why

 4   the additional officer's entry would violate the Fourth

 5   Amendment.   Now, there might be limited --

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             So -- so my first

 7   statement was correct.         It's illegal for the police to

 8   send their assistance, the other officers in?

 9                MR. METZLER:          Yes, my answer was as a

10   practical matter no -- no police officer is going to

11   leave, even if --

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  No, but then he is

13   going to get sued.

14                MR. METZLER:          He very well may get sued and

15   there are questions of fact as to --

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And you say as a practical

17   matter we have to say that under the Constitution we can

18   endanger -- we must endanger the officer?

19                MR. METZLER:          Well, I disagree that the

20   officer could be in danger --

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             No, no.         The hypothetical

22   is that they have to send people in to assist him.                     But

23   the hypothetical also is they should have anticipated

24   this, and therefore, in your words, they created exigent

25   circumstances.

 1              MR. METZLER:         They did create the exigent

 2   circumstance --

 3              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It seems to me that

 4   dilemma and that paradox casts considerable doubt on

 5   your proposition that if the police create the exigent

 6   circumstances, they cannot rely on it.                  I seriously

 7   question that proposition.

 8              MR. METZLER:         Even if -- even if you

 9   disagree with me on that, it shouldn't make any

10   difference in this case where there was no exigent

11   circumstances.

12              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            No, no.         I want to talk

13   about the general rule.

14              MR. METZLER:         Okay.       Well, the general --

15   never mind --

16              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You want us to write an

17   opinion saying that any time police create the exigent

18   circumstances, they can't rely on them if they had had

19   the time to get a warrant.         And I find that a dangerous

20   rule.

21              MR. METZLER:         I don't think you would need

22   to to write the opinion that would say that, because

23   exigent circumstances are not in this case.

24              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Mr. Metzler, what do you

25   say to this line of reasoning, we have in prior cases


                                      45

 1   adopted the positions that for purposes of establishing

 2   probable cause, the knowledge of one police officer is

 3   also the knowledge of all police officers, at least

 4   within a department or working on a particular problem.

 5   So that if in a case in which there is a search without

 6   a warrant, if you add up everything that individual

 7   officers knew and that amounts to probable cause, then

 8   the search is good.

 9               Why don't we apply, in effect, the same rule

10   in the hypothetical case that you have been given, which

11   is a police officer who was admitted by consent and

12   there are other police officers outside.               At the point

13   at which the police officer who has been admitted has

14   the knowledge necessary for an arrest and has that

15   knowledge as a result of the invitation and the waiver

16   of privacy as to him, why don't we regard that on sort

17   of general doctrinal grounds as a waiver of privacy with

18   respect to the police in general, just as we regard

19   police knowledge as being imputed to all police

20   officers?

21               That way you don't have the problem that,

22   for example, Justice Kennedy's hypo raises, even in the

23   case of exigent circumstances.             But it doesn't open the

24   door to what you were objecting to here.               Why isn't that

25   a proper solution or proper answer to this hypo?

 1                MR. METZLER:         Well, if you are to adopt that

 2   sort of -- I think you certainly could adopt that

 3   rationale.   But I don't think the way to get there is

 4   through a waiver, because real there's nothing that the

 5   person -- the suspect has done that he knows about that

 6   would mean that he waived the expectation that

 7   additional people would come in.                There might be --

 8                JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, you are absolutely

 9   right in terms of his psychological process, the only

10   person he has invited in is the one person.                      The reason

11   for coming up with the answer I suggested is a broader

12   doctrinal reason.    That is the reason that we have for

13   probable cause purposes regarded the police -- or the

14   knowledge of one police officer as the knowledge for

15   all.

16                Why don't we, for the same reasons, since it

17   is privacy that is at stake in all of these cases,

18   regard the invitation of one police officer as the

19   invitation of all, or to all?

20                MR. METZLER:         Again, I don't think that the

21   way to get there is through consent.                     If you want it to

22   balance and say, well, the government has an agent in

23   there who is making the arrest and there is safety

24   concerns and other reasons why we would want to do that,

25   that might be one way to get there.                      I don't think it's

 2                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            It would be consent to one

 3   officer plus a doctrinal basis to construe that consent

 4   for Fourth Amendment purposes as a broader consent.

 5                 MR. METZLER:         Yes.

 6                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            That's what we would be

 7   doing.   We wouldn't be doing it because the individual

 8   in the trailer says I am inviting in the whole L.A.

 9   police department.      We are doing it because he invites

10   one L.A. police officer in, and we have doctrinal basis

11   for regarding the police, as it were, collectively

12   rather than individually for probable cause purposes

13   when privacy is at stake.

14                 MR. METZLER:         That would be -- that would

15   certainly be a basis to allow for police officers.

16                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Would it not open the door

17   to, I guess, to what you are objecting to?

18                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Why would probable cause

19   solve the problem at all?            There is clearly probable

20   cause here.    They are listening to what goes on.            So

21   they're -- do you dispute that when they hear that the

22   drug transaction is taking place, that they lack

23   probable cause?

24                 MR. METZLER:         No, I think they do have

25   probable cause.    But in Payton, the Court said that

 1   police officers who are outside who have probable cause

 2   need more than probable cause to get inside.                    They need

 3   a warrant, exigent circumstances.

 4              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Right.           I think I may have

 5   created this problem for you and -- and maybe I -- I

 6   should get you out of it.

 7              (Laughter.)

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:            I'm not suggesting that the

 9   probable cause rule is what is operative here.                    I'm

10   saying that for probable cause purposes we regard the

11   police collectively, and why, since our privacy is at

12   stake there and is at stake here -- why shouldn't we

13   have a collective consent rule, too?

14              MR. METZLER:         You certainly could --

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:            That -- that's my proposal.

16              MR. METZLER:         You certainly could adopt that

17   rule, and that would be a -- an additional reason for

18   police to enter beyond what has been thus far

19   established by this Court.

20              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 How do you decide

21   whether the confidential informant should be considered

22   an employee of the police?         Let's say this is the tenth

23   undercover operation he has engaged in.                   They give him

24   $100 after every undercover operation.                   I mean, is he an

25   employee of the police department?

 1                 MR. METZLER:         I don't think his employment

 2   status is -- is what is at issue.                  The question is

 3   whether he is an agent of the state for the purpose that

 4   he is inside -- for the purposes of making an arrest of

 5   the person inside the home.

 6                 Here the confidential informant, all he is

 7   really doing is acting as a surveillance device.                     He is

 8   telling the officers outside what is happening inside.

 9   And he gives them probable cause.

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Why doesn't -- that

11   doesn't make him an agent of the police?

12                 MR. METZLER:         No, I don't think so.          He

13   might be an agent for some purposes but he is not an

14   agent for purposes of making an arrest inside, which is

15   what they want to do.

16                 JUSTICE ALITO:          What is it there is a State

17   statute that says that confidential informants may be

18   designated by the police department to assist in making

19   arrests?

20                 MR. METZLER:         If there was some assist to

21   making an arrest -- of the government, then assuming we

22   are following Justice Souter's few exceptions, then I

23   think that they would fall into that exception.                   But

24   here, of course, the confidential informant is no such

25   thing.     This confidential informant was not active

 1   politically.    He wasn't making an arrest.                There was

 2   no --

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 He wasn't acting on

 4   his own.    He was acting for the police.                He didn't

 5   decide I'm going to do this and -- because you know, I

 6   want to do it, and it just so happens the police are

 7   involved as well.

 8                MR. METZLER:         Well, that's true.          He was

 9   acting with the police but he wasn't acting for the

10   police.    And nothing that the -- that the confidential

11   informant did inside, even if attributed to the police,

12   would give police the right to cross that threshold.                   If

13   this confidential informant were a police officer, I

14   think you would have to base it on the power of the

15   police to make the arrest inside, the power of the State

16   to make that --

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Even if there is such a

18   thing as citizen's arrest, I think it was part of this

19   record that -- that they do not want confidential

20   informers to go making arrests, so that the police

21   distinguish the confidential informer.

22                MR. METZLER:         That's correct,

23   Justice Ginsburg.    Both the Solicitor General and the

24   Petitioners agree that confidential informants should

25   not and would not be making these arrests.                 So the


                                        51
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   function of the confidential informant is really as I

 2   said, just a surveillance device; and what is important

 3   is not what he is doing but what the police are doing

 4   who are outside.

 5              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But going back to why

 6   should we decide this question, particularly in Fourth

 7   Amendment cases when these issues will come up on

 8   suppression motions, so there isn't a need to decide

 9   them in the -- in the civil context.

10              MR. METZLER:          But I think in general we are

11   talking about a very small category of cases like this

12   one where their -- the criminal defendant won on the

13   Fourth Amendment and then the police bring up some new

14   argument on a qualified immunity defense because there

15   would already be some law on the questions that were

16   decided in the -- in the criminal case.

17              So in those limited circumstances it seems

18   to put too much of a thumb on the scale on the side of

19   police that says well, you can come up with a new theory

20   and you don't even have to show that it applies; all you

21   have to show is that nobody has ever rejected your

22   theory and then it is not fairly established.             I don't

23   think in that small number of cases that the balance

24   should really tilt that far towards police.             And here,

25   here it's certainly not, where the Solicitor General and


                                       52

 1   the Petitioners both agree that the Court should decide

 2   both questions.

 3                 The constitutional question here is not very

 4   difficult.    It boils down to, in the absence of exigent

 5   circumstances, could any reasonable officer have

 6   believed that the two circumstances they would like to

 7   see in previous cases -- that is, that a confidential

 8   informant is inside, and that he sends a signal out that

 9   there is probable cause -- do those make any difference

10   whatsoever to the calculation of whether there are

11   exigent circumstances or consent?                 The answer is no and

12   no reasonable officer could have believed otherwise.                  If

13   there are no further questions.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

15                Mr. Stirba, you have three minutes

16   remaining.

17                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY PETER STIRBA,

18                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

19                MR. STIRBA:        The colloquy about the safety

20   concerns when the officer or the confidential informer

21   are in the home I think highlight why the distinction

22   between a confidential informant and the officer really

23   doesn't make much meaningful headway in terms of the

24   Fourth Amendment.    Obviously if the police officer was

25   acting under cover in this particular situation he would


                                        53
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   not have announced -- there were three arrestees who

 2   were actually in the premises at the time of the

 3   follow-up entry.     He would not have said after the drug

 4   transaction occurred "oh, by the way, I'm a police

 5   officer, I'm here to arrest you," for obvious reasons

 6   connoting safety and other issues which would have been

 7   attendant to them.

 8              Similarly the confidential informant isn't

 9   going to do that, either, for the same particular

10   problem, even if the confidential informant had arrested

11   powers under State law.          The issue is the police officer

12   can call up for backup and assistance to effectuate

13   arrest, which is specifically what occurred here.

14   Similarly, there is no really distinction to be drawn

15   between a confidential informant as a government actor

16   allowing for the additional entry or follow-up entry of

17   additional officers for backup and assistance to make

18   sure the arrest is safe and secure than if you have a

19   police officer.

20              The second point I would like to make is the

21   first time any Federal circuit drew this distinction

22   between a confidential informant and a police officer

23   was the Tenth Circuit decision.                They adopted consent

24   once removed.     They just limited it to a police officer.

25   Obviously the police officers involved in this case


                                         54
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   could not reasonably be expected to anticipate such a

 2   distinction being drawn, especially given the fact that

 3   there was at least a Seventh Circuit body of law, the

 4   Sixth Circuit body of law, and as we argue, which we

 5   think is a fair reading of Gramble -- because they cite

 6   the Seventh Circuit body of law that includes the

 7   confidential informant -- there were at least three

 8   circuits that rejected that distinction, and you in 2000

 9   confirmed that in the Sixth Circuit there is no

10   distinction as a matter of this particular doctrine

11   between a confidential informant and a police officer.

12              And finally with respect to the exigent

13   circumstances cases, and you can look at any one that

14   was cited by the Respondent, there is no mention of

15   Lewis, there is no mention of consent once removed,

16   there is no mention of any abrogation of privacy.      Those

17   issues were not raised, just like the issues were not

18   raised in the criminal appeal of Mr. Callahan's

19   conviction; and so therefore they are really not

20   relevant, they are not probative, and we are not

21   suggesting this is an exigent circumstances case, nor

22   are we suggest relying on for purposes of the Fourth

23   Amendment issue any implied consent.

24              We have rested our -- the justification for

25   the Fourth Amendment issue on search incident and also
