 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 We'll hear argument

 4   next in Case 08-214, Atlantic Sounding v. Townsend.

 5              Mr. McCreadie.

 6             ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. McCREADIE

 7                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 8              MR. McCREADIE:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 9   it please the Court:

10              Mr. Townsend is a Jones Act seaman who seeks

11   punitive damages for the willful failure to pay

12   maintenance and cure.

13              Like the unseaworthiness claim in Miles, Mr.

14   Townsend's maintenance and cure claim is a general

15   maritime law cause of action.            Mr. Townsend cannot

16   recover punitive damages under his general maritime law

17   cause of action because those damages are unavailable

18   under the Jones Act FELA, and to a lesser extent DOHSA.

19              This Court's decision in Miles requires

20   uniformity between the damages that a seaman can recover

21   under general maritime law and the damages that a seaman

22   can recover under the guiding statutes.

23              Those guiding statutes again are the Jones

24   Act, the FELA, and the DOHSA.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. McCreadie, in this

 2   case, why is it necessary to get into that, whether they

 3   are punitive damages under FELA and the Jones Act?                If

 4   we accept, as I think we must, Townsend's allegations to

 5   be true, he has said that Atlantic, as a matter of

 6   routine, puts in a boilerplate complaint for declaratory

 7   relief, reciting all the reasons why somebody could not

 8   get maintenance and cure, even though that is patently

 9   false, the allegation for example that he deserted his

10   post.   He says it's false.         He said the allegation that

11   he falsified his application for employment is false.

12               Accepting the -- that to be true at this

13   stage, isn't there some kind of punitive measure to be

14   taken against a litigant who abuses the court process in

15   that way?

16               MR. McCREADIE:          First, Justice Ginsburg,

17   those are just allegations.             There's no evidence --

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Yes, but -- but now we're

19   at the pretrial stage, and we're supposed to assume the

20   truth of the allegations in Townsend's complaint.                We're

21   assuming -- they may well turn out to be false; but at

22   the threshold under 12(b)6 we accept those allegations

23   as true and then determine whether a claim is stated.

24               MR. McCREADIE:          Well, if -- if those

25   allegations are true, there's no distinction between the


                                        4

 1   willful wanton misconduct that traditionally has been

 2   the subject of the dispute about maintenance and cure

 3   and punitive damages as opposed to those allegations.

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But let's take this out

 5   of the maintenance and cure spot altogether.                Litigation

 6   generally, if a court determines that a litigant is

 7   abusing the court's process by filing false pleadings,

 8   is there a remedy; and if so, what is it?

 9                MR. McCREADIE:          Yes, Justice Ginsburg, there

10   is a remedy.    And that's what Vaughan v. Atkinson

11   provides.   In that case this Court looked at abuse of

12   the litigation process and determined that the plaintiff

13   in that case was entitled to attorneys' fees.

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought that all that

15   was at stake there was whether the employer wrongfully

16   withheld maintenance and cure that was owing.                The

17   allegations made by Townsend go far beyond that they

18   just unreasonably denied him maintenance and cure.                 They

19   suggest that this litigant, as a matter practice,

20   standard operating procedure, makes false claims before

21   a court.    And my question to you is, isn't across the

22   board there a sanction, wholly apart from the particular

23   claim, for a litigant who abuses the court's processes?

24                MR. McCREADIE:          I think there's a -- there's

25   a number of potential sanctions.                I mean, there is Rule

 1   11.   There's the natural discretion of the court.

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Is any of them called

 3   punitive damages?     Do you know of any case in which a

 4   court has --

 5                 MR. McCREADIE:          No, I do not.

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             And punitive damages, of

 7   course, requires that you first find the guilty person

 8   to lose the case.     So what if a person makes these

 9   terrible allegations, but ends up winning the case

10   anyway, and -- and -- well, you couldn't impose punitive

11   damages.

12                 MR. McCREADIE:          I agree with --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             We've got to call it

14   something else, don't we?

15                 MR. McCREADIE:          I agree with your position

16   there.     And what I was trying to answer the question is

17   if someone does abuse the litigation process, that is

18   what Vaughan v. Atkinson addressed.                       And it -- it

19   awarded attorneys' fees, which -- which are unusual.                      It

20   is an exception to the American rule.                       And it is a

21   deterrent for anyone to try to play fast and loose

22   with --

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How many --

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But do you read Vaughan v.

25   Atkinson as necessarily implying punitive damages would

 1   be inappropriate?      I can't quite find the negative that

 2   you want me to find, I think, in Atkinson.                        True, they

 3   didn't talk about punitive damages.                        They said damages

 4   are appropriate, and attorneys' fees in this case, which

 5   is what the district court gave, we are going to affirm

 6   it.     But there's nothing there that said punitive

 7   damages are inappropriate.

 8                 MR. McCREADIE:           No.      The dissent mentioned

 9   that.     But you can not speak for the majority opinion.

10   But up until Vaughan v. Atkinson, in the history of the

11   United States there was never a holding where punitive

12   damages were awarded to a Jones Act seaman for the

13   failure to pay maintenance and cure.

14                 It was only after Vaughan v. Atkinson, after

15   the dissent mentioned that concept, that the issue ever

16   arose in the history of Supreme Court precedent, circuit

17   precedent, in this country.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:              Whose dissent was that?         I

19   have forgotten that.         Whose dissent was it?                Do you

20   recall?    Stewart?

21                 MR. McCREADIE:           I do -- I do not believe --

22   it is coming Justice Harlan, but I just -- I just cannot

23   say off the top of my head who wrote the dissent.

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              You said never in the

25   history.    I mean, there -- there are examples like the

 1   ancient Nancy case, where the damages, where they were

 2   called exemplary -- but when you say never has there

 3   been before or after punitive awards.                     But there is

 4   precedent, the Nancy case in this Court, cases in lower

 5   courts, there have been punitive damages awards in -- in

 6   maintenance and cure cases.

 7              MR. McCREADIE:            Justice Ginsburg, I made the

 8   distinction between there's no case in the history of

 9   the United States before Vaughan v. Atkinson awarding

10   punitive damages to a seaman, a Jones Act seaman, for

11   the failure to pay maintenance and cure.

12              The case that you refer to, the Amiable

13   Nancy, and other cases, they apply to general maritime

14   law with respect to collisions, now with respect to

15   pollution, and that's a broader context.                     But if we look

16   at the history of general maritime law, if we look at,

17   for example, Calhoun, there's the critical distinction

18   between non-seafarers and seafarers.                     If we look at

19   Latsis, there's the critical distinction between seaman

20   and longshoremen.    In those status, they define the

21   class of persons that we're looking at to see whether

22   they can recover punitive damages.

23              And this case involves a Jones Act seaman.

24   And because it involves a Jones Act seaman, that's the

25   class of claimant that we're looking at.                     And when we

 1   have a Jones Act seaman the primary statute that we look

 2   at is the Jones Act.       Of course, the Jones Act

 3   incorporates FELA by reference.               And the DOHSA, as Miles

 4   points out, also has an impact on the -- on the case.

 5              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Did this Court ever hold

 6   that under FELA or under the Jones Act there are no

 7   punitive damages?    Do we have any holding to that

 8   effect?

 9              MR. McCREADIE:            No, there is no specific

10   holding, and I would point out that if there was, that

11   would answer our question today and we wouldn't be here.

12              But that we do have is Miles, which is very

13   clear and specific about what damages are available to a

14   seaman; and those damages are compensatory damages.

15   Miles is clear that the seaman can be compensated for

16   pecuniary loss, the seaman can be compensated for his

17   pre-death pain and suffering.              Because punitive damages

18   are not compensatory damages, because punitive damages

19   do not compensate for pecuniary loss, and because

20   punitive damages do not compensate for pre-death pain

21   and suffering, they are not available to a Jones Act

22   seaman.

23              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But that -- but that was a

24   common law wrongful death action, correct, Miles?

25              MR. McCREADIE:            Miles was --


                                         9

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It was not admiralty

 2   maintenance and cure.

 3                MR. McCREADIE:         Justice Kennedy, Miles was a

 4   wrongful death action.       But when we look at Miles and we

 5   question, well, that is a wrongful death action, it is

 6   very clear, should Miles apply in a personal injury

 7   action, then we need to -- we -- first we know -- we

 8   look at the cases that have addressed that point.

 9                And first off, Miles does not say that the

10   uniformity principle applies only to wrongful death

11   actions.

12                Secondly, Cortes, Supreme Court precedent,

13   tells us that the rules are the same for personal injury

14   and death actions for maintenance and cure under the

15   Jones Act.

16                In Cortes, the opposite argument was made:

17   That the maintenance and cure claim could proceed for

18   personal injury but not for a death action.             Here, the

19   Respondent is making the argument --

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Excuse me, that the

21   maintenance and cure claim could proceed or that the

22   punitive damages claim could be made?

23                MR. McCREADIE:         You're absolutely correct.

24   Here they are making the argument that the punitive

25   damages claim could -- can proceed under the personal


                                       10

 1   injury side of the case but not the death side.               And

 2   Cortes has already addressed that issue.

 3              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. McCreadie, there's a

 4   question about this case, a troublesome feature of it.

 5              That is, you are saying because there are no

 6   punitive damages available under FELA and under the

 7   Jones Act, then there certainly should not be any under

 8   maintenance and cure.     But if we have to answer those

 9   questions, whether there are punitive damages available

10   under FELA and the Jones Act, in the context of a

11   maintenance and cure claim, then we're deciding a much

12   larger question than are punitive damages available for

13   willful refusal to pay maintenance and cure.               We're

14   deciding a question under the Jones Act, a question

15   under the FELA, and there are a lot of people who would

16   be interested -- and the seamen are a sizable group that

17   the law cares about particularly.               But there would be a

18   larger interest, a larger interest in the answer in the

19   Jones Act context and FELA.           And to decide those

20   questions in a case that doesn't present any claim under

21   FELA or any claim under the Jones Act is troublesome.

22              MR. McCREADIE:          I certainly agree with you,

23   Justice Ginsburg, that the answer to this case answers

24   the question of what damages are available under the

25   Jones Act and -- and FELA.

 1               But, again, if you look at Miles, which

 2   analyzing both FELA cases, Vreeland for example, and

 3   Kraft, which is a railroad case, it -- it has already

 4   specifically stated what compensatory -- that

 5   compensatory damages alone are available under the death

 6   side, admittedly, and that the compensation for a seaman

 7   and, therefore, for a FELA employee is limited to

 8   compensation for pecuniary loss and for pre-death pain

 9   and suffering.

10               Also, if we look at another string of

11   Supreme Court precedent, it's not as clear as Miles, but

12   if we look at the other string, it -- this Court has

13   stated over and over that compensatory damages are what

14   is available under the Jones Act; compensatory damages

15   are available under the FELA; and compensatory damages

16   are available under DOHSA.          For example, Zicherman is a

17   post-Miles case, and it's written and states the

18   principles very clearly:         The Jones Act provides,

19   permits, I should say, compensation only for pecuniary

20   losses.   And then it discusses Vreeland, which is a FELA

21   case, and it says that the FELA permits compensation

22   only for pecuniary losses.

23               And so, again, if we look at the history on

24   the death side, which Miles summarizes, but if we look

25   on the personal injury side, at the Osceola, the


                                       12

 1   Iroquois -- Peterson mentions compensatory damages nine

 2   times in expressing what remedies are available to

 3   seamen.   And so those railroad cases, those Jones Act

 4   cases, have been decided and have been a part of our

 5   precedent for 60, 70, 80 years.

 6               And, of course, it is important to note that

 7   the Congress has amended the Jones Act in 1982, with no

 8   tampering with this history.            It has amended the Jones

 9   Act in 2006 with no tampering with the history, and it

10   has amended the Jones Act in 2008 without any change.

11   And that's in light of Guevara, decided in 1995; that's

12   in light of Roy Al, decided in 1995, and 10 years plus

13   for the cases to percolate and for Congress to decide

14   whether they agree with those policy determinations.

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            As I read your reply

16   brief -- and please correct me if it's a

17   misimpression -- you didn't dispute the fact that

18   punitive damages were available historically for the

19   shipowner's wrongful refusal to provide maintenance and

20   cure, or am I wrong about that?

21               MR. McCREADIE:          I -- that must have been the

22   Respondent's brief, because our position is -- hopefully

23   was clearer than that, that punitive damages have never

24   been awarded in the history of the United States for the

25   willful failure to pay maintenance and cure until

 1   after -- until after Vaughan v. Atkinson.

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And what about English

 3   admiralty, under the English precedents?

 4                 MR. McCREADIE:         The English precedents we

 5   did not analyze.    We took Miles when it analyzes Lord

 6   Campbell's Act, and then that was analyzed in Vreeland,

 7   and from that point forward, Miles took that, that line

 8   of cases --

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Of course, in Miles --

10   again, we're coming back -- was wrongful death, not

11   maintenance and cure.

12                 MR. McCREADIE:         Miles was a wrongful death

13   case that analyzed an unseaworthiness cause of action,

14   which is brought under general maritime law.                      We are

15   looking at maintenance and cure, which is a claim

16   brought under general maritime law.                      Both existed before

17   the Jones Act, unseaworthiness and maintenance and cure,

18   and again both are general maritime law claims.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Of course, your

20   friend on the other side distinguishes that argument by

21   noting that death is different.               As he puts it, we're

22   all going to die, so --

23                 MR. McCREADIE:         In that case --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- you have

25   different considerations under the maintenance and cure.

 1                MR. McCREADIE:         Mr. Chief Justice, that take

 2   us back again to Cortes, which this Court has already

 3   decided and analyzed.      Should we distinguish between a

 4   death action, maintenance and cure action under the

 5   Jones Act, from a personal injury action?                  And the

 6   unequivocal answer from this Court is no, that you

 7   should not treat them differently.                 There's no logic for

 8   treating them differently.          We also need to remember

 9   that one of the anomalies that was -- that was cured by

10   Moragne -- the first anomaly cured by Moragne was an

11   anomaly where the unseaworthiness action would exist in

12   State territorial waters but not in -- I'm sorry, it

13   would exist in State territorial waters, but not on the

14   high seas.   And that troubled the Moragne Court, that

15   you would have a discrepancy between personal injury and

16   death, and that's one of issues that they tried to --

17   tried to reconcile.

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I thought there was -- it

19   was on the high seas.      They had DOHSA.              At the time of

20   Moragne, there was DOHSA, but then it was when you

21   weren't on the high seas that was the gap.                  Wasn't that

22   the case?

23                MR. McCREADIE:         That's correct.          My point is

24   there was a difference of what right you had under -- in

25   territorial waters under unseaworthiness that Moragne


                                       15

 1   described as one of the anomalies.                   And the anomaly was

 2   that if the person was injured, they could get an

 3   unseaworthiness claim; if they died, they could not.

 4   And Moragne was clear that distinguishing between death

 5   and personal injury, it made no sense.

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But that's what the

 7   common law was.     That's why we had Lord Campbell's Act.

 8   That was if you die, too bad; if you're injured, you

 9   collect.

10                 That was fixed by statute on the high seas,

11   DOHSA.     Because there was the gap, there was no Lord

12   Campbell's Act, the Court effectively made one up,

13   right?     That's what it did in Moragne.

14                 MR. McCREADIE:          Moragne did create some law,

15   yes.     Let me try to answer the question in a different

16   way --

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But I just -- and you can

18   go ahead and answer that question without my

19   interrupting.     But my assumption from reading the amicus

20   briefs in this case is that punitive damages were

21   awarded in some maintenance and cure cases (a) as simply

22   part of the overall award -- they weren't separated out,

23   but it was part of the measure -- and (b) that some

24   American courts, American judges, including noted

25   admiralty judges, awarded in some cases punitive damages

 1   in maintenance and cure before the modern cases Moragne

 2   and so forth -- and Miles -- that you're talking about.

 3   Is that incorrect?

 4              MR. McCREADIE:             That is incorrect.       If you

 5   read the cases cited, and they have their roots in some

 6   law review articles that are critical of Miles, that

 7   don't like the Miles decision, but if you read those

 8   cases --

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               I'm talking pre-Miles.

10   I'm talking pre-Miles.

11              MR. McCREADIE:             And I'm saying the cases

12   that are cited in those law review articles -- the

13   purpose of the articles is to criticize Miles.                 Those

14   cases do not stand for the proposition that they're

15   presented for in the law review article and they do not

16   stand for the propositions that they have been presented

17   to this Court.    They are not holding -- they are not

18   giving an award of punitive damages for maintenance and

19   cure in any of those cases.

20              JUSTICE BREYER:               Is -- how many -- how many

21   would you say there are in a typical year, maintenance

22   and cure cases?     About, roughly?              I mean, say in the

23   late twentieth century, 18 -- 1980, 1990.                 Have you have

24   any guess at all?

25              MR. McCREADIE:             Justice Breyer, because

 1   maintenance and cure is so often linked to the Jones Act

 2   and the unseaworthy cause of action, and because of the

 3   leverage that seems to be brought with punitive damages,

 4   they are virtually included in every seaman's case --

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.

 6                 MR. McCREADIE:          -- from the get-go.

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:            So how many would you

 8   guess?

 9                 MR. McCREADIE:          And -- and I would have to

10   estimate, just extrapolating from my own experience,

11   thousands of Jones Act cases are filed in the country

12   every year.

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Uh-huh.          And they usually

14   have maintenance and cure aspects.

15                 MR. McCREADIE:          Necessarily they do.

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Can you get punitives under

17   the Jones Act or not?

18                 MR. McCREADIE:          You cannot recover punitive

19   damages under the --

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:            What about unseaworthiness?

21                 MR. McCREADIE:          You cannot recover punitive

22   damages under unseaworthiness because that's the same

23   rule that Miles already decided.                 Miles decided in

24   unseaworthiness --

 1   cases -- no, I had, actually, to be honest, I thought we

 2   found about 12 in the period around 1980 - 2000 where

 3   they do give some punitive damages.

 4               MR. McCREADIE:            And -- and -- and I hope I

 5   was clear that the can of worms was opened by Vaughn.

 6   No one awarded it.      No one thought about it, until after

 7   Vaughn.

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:              All right.       Then I found

 9   about 10 cases in the period before the Jones Act where

10   there was something given -- punitive damages being

11   given for something, and there was something sort of

12   like maintenance and cure in there.

13               MR. McCREADIE:            There -- there are some

14   pre-Jones Act cases, like the Amiable Nancy, that --

15   that talk about punitive damages; and there are some

16   cases where some seamen have not been treated very well.

17   But a specific look at the cases reveals that there is

18   no pre-Jones Act case awarding punitive damages --

19               JUSTICE BREYER:              Over here, there is one

20   called -- Unica v U.S.         The master should have put the

21   -- into the hospital.        Given him $1,500.            It was partly

22   punitive.   Considering -- De Troupe -- I mean, I found

23   some that are sort of -- sort of -- I don't know what to

24   say.   I don't know who to make of it.

25               MR. McCREADIE:            The Troupe is on the list.

 1   It is a case that we have looked at, and it is -- and

 2   again, it is a case that I can say that if you look at

 3   all of them -- it is a very tedious process; there are a

 4   lot of cases, and wading through each one, none of them

 5   hold or award punitive damages for the failure to pay

 6   maintenance and cure.     And --

 7              JUSTICE BREYER:            The Troop gave them $4,000.

 8   Considering all the circumstances of the aggravation.

 9   Gross neglect, mistreatment.           "It is useless to parade

10   more of the sickening details."

11              MR. McCREADIE:          And our position is that

12   even if there is -- and there is not; let me be clear --

13   but even if there was one rogue case, one individual

14   case, that does not create general maritime law.

15   Something more is needed.         For example, a decision from

16   this Court would create general maritime law.

17              The Wilburn Boat case is an insurance case.

18   There's an example where there are some cases on the

19   subject of marine insurance, but there's not enough for

20   the court to conclude that there is a general maritime

21   law on that subject.

22              And so returning again to this -- this

23   pocket of cases, they do not stand for the

24   proposition -- even if they did, if you'll notice, two

25   of them, it's the same district court judge who is


                                      20

 1   making the noise that he would have done this or he

 2   might have done this.       And -- and our position is that

 3   one district court judge does not create general

 4   maritime law by mentioning the possibility of punitive

 5   damages in one case.

 6                We're much more comfortable relying on this

 7   Court's precedents, the line of cases that builds from

 8   Moragne to Higgingbotham and culminates in Miles, we're

 9   much more comfortable looking at the history of the

10   damages awarded by this Court to seamen, where it uses

11   the term compensatory damages -- compensation for --

12   over and over and over without any mention whatsoever of

13   punitive damages.

14                The punitive damages problem did not crop up

15   until Vaughn, even though now everyone seems to agree

16   Vaughn did not hold that punitive damages were

17   available.

18                I would also just like to mention all the

19   circuit court cases addressing this issue hold that

20   Jones Act precludes punitive damages, and any circuit

21   court that has addressed this issue since Miles likewise

22   specifically holds punitive damages are not available

23   for the willful failure to pay maintenance and cure.

24                I'd like to reserve my remaining time.

 2           ORAL ARGUMENT OF G.J. ROD SULLIVAN, JR.

 3                 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 4              MR. SULLIVAN:            Mr. Chief Justice, may it

 5   please the Court:

 6              I would like to start by answering the

 7   question that was raised by Justice Ginsburg.                  This

 8   Court does not need to reach the question of whether or

 9   not punitive damages are available under the Jones Act

10   or under the FELA in order to decide this issue, because

11   maintenance and cure is different.                  It precedes the

12   Jones Act by centuries, perhaps even a thousand years,

13   and it deals with a distinctly different problem.

14              Maintenance and cure deals with a situation

15   as what do we do with an injured seaman to get him back

16   to health and get him into the workforce?                  And the law

17   has provided since Catherine of Aragon went to Greece in

18   the 1200s that the ship owner has a responsibility, in

19   its capacity as a ship owner, to provide that seaman

20   with medical care and to provide that seaman with a

21   living allowance so that he can get better and get back

22   into the work force.

23              Now in 1920, Senator Jones intended to make

24   the United States merchant marine the world's greatest

25   merchant marine.    He was dealing in a factual scenario

 1   where 12 years earlier, on April 12 of 1912, the Titanic

 2   had sunk; 1,900 people had died.

 3               Virtually every member of the Senate and

 4   Congress knew somebody who was on the Titanic, and

 5   during the intervening eight years, certain points of

 6   law became obvious.       First of all, the people who died

 7   on the Titanic could not recover for anything other

 8   except their lost baggage.            They could not recover for

 9   the fact that their loved ones had passed away because

10   there was no cause of action.

11               Secondly, because the Titanic hit an iceberg

12   and was not unseaworthy, there was no cause of action

13   for negligence.   So Senator Jones set around to correct

14   these two anomalies in the law, and said what we are

15   going to do is we're going to create a new class of

16   beneficiaries, who are dependents of people who die at

17   sea, and we are going to give them the right to recover

18   pecuniary damages.      That's the only place where

19   pecuniary damages are mentioned in the law.               And then it

20   said, and as to seamen, we're going to give them an

21   additional right, a cumulative right on top of

22   unseaworthiness, and that's going to be negligence.

23               It never sought out to touch maintenance and

24   cure.   Maintenance and cure has been something that's

25   been monitored by the courts ever since its inception,

 1   and it is a self-regulating system.                     Before Guevara,

 2   ship owners regularly provided their employees with

 3   medical care without asking the question.                     If there was

 4   a close call, they provided the medical care without

 5   running to the court.      They provided maintenance.

 6              Then came Guevara, and Guevara decided for

 7   the first there were no punitive damages, and now you

 8   have a growing problem in this country.                     You have a

 9   problem with ship owners providing less and less medical

10   care without resort to the courts.

11              Now our position here is that a seaman

12   should be not ever have to come before a court to seek

13   maintenance and cure, and the court should never, ever

14   have to award punitive damages.

15              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, surely there will be

16   some incidents in which the employer in good faith

17   thinks there's no illness, that there's no basis for

18   maintenance and cure.      MR. SULLIVAN:                And as --

23   when an employer comes to the court in good faith and

24   says there's no entitlement to maintenance and cure, and

25   there -- the court finds that -- or the factfinder finds

 1   in good faith, there's no basis for punitive damages.

 2   Then you merely have a dispute.              But the situation --

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, of course there are

 4   going to be disputes, and the question is whether or

 5   not, just from the standpoint of filling professional

 6   responsibility, in almost any maintenance and cure

 7   action where the counsel for the plaintiff thinks

 8   that -- for the seaman thinks that the employer has been

 9   remiss, he doesn't add the punitive damages complaint if

10   we agree with your position, which changes completely

11   the settlement and the bargaining aspect.               But you can

12   address -- you can address that.

13               MR. SULLIVAN:          Well -- and I agree, Your

14   Honor, that is a prospect and a possibility, something

15   which I personally abhor doing.              I mean, you should only

16   plead punitive damages when you have a good faith basis

17   for doing it; you believe you will survive a directed

18   verdict.   It should not be thrown in to every single

19   complaint, and I'm not denying that some counsel will do

20   that.

21               But what I'm saying is that today, in 2009,

22   in 2006, there are actually ship owners who are, as a

23   regular practice, denying their seamen medical care.                  I

24   don't know why that is.        Perhaps it's because it is

25   expensive now, more expensive than it has ever been.

 1   Perhaps it is because there are safety nets that will

 2   allow the seamen to seek Medicaid, and so the taxpayer

 3   will pay for it.    Whatever the motivations are, it is a

 4   growing trend that we are seeing.

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            How many of these seamen

 6   who seek maintenance and cure are represented?                  I mean,

 7   what is the incidence of representation for maintenance

 8   and cure claims as distinguished from Jones Act

 9   negligence type claims with the -- the possibility of

10   large recoveries for pain and suffering?

11                 MR. SULLIVAN:         Judge, I'd be picking a

12   number out of the air, but I can give you anecdotal

13   evidence of this.    In the Fifth Circuit attorneys who

14   regularly do maritime personal injury work tell each

15   other -- we talk about the fact that you can't afford to

16   represent somebody who's got a maintenance and cure case

17   that's not combined with a Jones Act case.                  And there

18   are a number of practical reasons for that.

19                 You have to pay all of the experts, and it

20   is very expensive to bring these cases.                  You have to

21   hire the orthopedic surgeons, the -- the radiologists.

22   You have to pay for the tests, and then, as an attorney,

23   these are never recoverable as costs.

24                 And then you are working on a contingent

25   hourly fee.    If you win your case and you prove that


                                        26
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   they were willful, wanton, and callous in -- in denying

 2   maintenance and cure, then you might get a portion of

 3   your attorneys' fees back.

 4               Now, you may do that as a pro bono matter on

 5   occasion.   But you cannot rely upon the fact that

 6   attorneys will take these cases.

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, why -- why does

 8   joining it to a Jones Act case help?

 9               MR. SULLIVAN:          Well, because when you join

10   it to a Jones Act case, you have the substantial

11   possibility of getting either a settlement or a verdict

12   at the end of the case which is going to compensate the

13   attorneys for taking on the maintenance and cure case as

14   a portion of it.

15               And so, consequently, if somebody has a

16   serious accident, it falls under the Jones Act and there

17   is a maintenance and cure count, the attorney will

18   handle all of those together and feel adequately

19   compensated.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, the -- the point

21   you are making is that the recovery under the Jones Act

22   can be very large, and the attorney on a contingent

23   basis would get a piece of that.

24               MR. SULLIVAN:          Exactly, Your Honor.

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Because it would be

 1   swelled by the pain and suffering damages which are not

 2   available in maintenance and cure.

 3              MR. SULLIVAN:           That's correct, Your Honor.

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  What is the

 5   pre-Vaughan case that awarded punitive damages --

 6   awarded punitive damages in a maintenance and cure case?

 7              MR. SULLIVAN:           Judge, first of all, I would

 8   cite to you two cases:       The Rolf case, which is a 1924

 9   Ninth Circuit case --

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I am -- what --

11   which --any case from this Court?

12              MR. SULLIVAN:           No.      No.         This issue did not

13   come before this Court.

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  All right.

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              It hasn't come before

16   this Court under FELA or the Jones Act, either, the

17   punitive damage question?

18              MR. SULLIVAN:           It hasn't -- it has not, Your

19   Honor.

20              JUSTICE BREYER:             Rolf was not a -- Rolf was

21   maintenance and cure and personal injury and

22   unseaworthiness.   So we don't know which aspect of the

23   case led to the punitives.

24              MR. SULLIVAN:           We don't, but we know that

25   there was outrage on behalf of the court.                     And,

 1   unfortunately, in -- and I think, as Justice Souter

 2   pointed out --

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:            Is it the case that we

 4   can't find a single pre-Jones Act case where punitives

 5   were awarded and what was sought was maintenance and

 6   cure?   I -- I found some, but they seem ambiguous to me.

 7               MR. SULLIVAN:          Well, Judge, I would say that

 8   --

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:            What is your best?

10               MR. SULLIVAN:          Yes.      I would say that the

11   best are the Rolf and the Margharita, which were denials

12   of medical care where the damages were enhanced because

13   of outrageous conduct.       But to say that, Judge, is there

14   a case that says this is maintenance and cure, we are

15   going to award punitive damages, that's not been done.

16               JUSTICE BREYER:            So we have a history all

17   the way back to Catherine of Aragon, and what we've been

18   able to find in these pre-Jones Act cases is really two

19   or three, or maybe I found ten actually, that I couldn't

20   say -- leaning over in your direction, I could take

21   maybe three or four.      And they show a little ambiguity.

22   But give them all ten, and that's still ten out of

23   hundreds of years of history.

24               MR. SULLIVAN:          Well, let me -- let me

25   respond to that in a couple of ways.                    First of all,


                                       29

 1   punitive damages were part of the common law until taken

 2   away by Congress.

 3              And -- and it could be asserted that

 4   maintenance and cure punitive damages were not necessary

 5   because the threat was enough to -- to require

 6   shipowners to go ahead and provide this.                 And I would

 7   point out to the Court that this had not been a problem

 8   prior to Guevara.    Shipowners did self-regulate.               They

 9   didn't -- seamen didn't run to the courts every time

10   they wanted maintenance and cure; whereas, today they

11   have to.

12              The leading scholar in this whole area is

13   Professor Robertson at the University of Texas who wrote

14   the AHA brief.   And his brief on pages 7 through 11

15   catalogs the cases where he suggests punitive damages or

16   exemplary damages were awarded for outrageous conduct

17   involving failure to provide medical care.

18              And I would suggest that those show that

19   punitive damages were unexceptional before Vaughan.

20   They were part of the common law.                 They -- they were

21   before this Court in the Amiable Nancy even though it

22   didn't involve medical care.             There is no reason to

23   assume that punitive damages are accepted in maritime

24   law; as part of the common law, that they weren't also

25   accepted for the willful, wanton, and egregious failure

 1   to provide a seaman with medical care.

 2              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             If I thought that the lack

 3   of counsel in maintenance and cure cases was a pivotal

 4   point or a relevant point for our decision, other than

 5   the representations of counsel, where would I look to

 6   verify that?

 7              MR. SULLIVAN:           The existence of prior

 8   maintenance and cure cases?

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             The -- the -- that there

10   is a problem in seamen finding attorneys who will take

11   maintenance and cure cases.

12              MR. SULLIVAN:           Yes, Judge.          There is not

13   empirical evidence out there.             Nobody has done studies.

14   I'm not aware of any.      But do we really want to wait for

15   the situation where we have hundreds and hundreds of

16   seamen who are -- are, you know, living homeless or

17   living in their cars or unable to obtain medical care

18   before this Court decides that if somebody does this, it

19   is something that can be punished?

20              And -- and I think that's the situation

21   we're at today.   It is a growing problem.                 And it is a

22   growing problem because Rivera is a relatively new case,

23   and it has spread to the other circuits.

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, if -- if the

25   -- if the existence of the punitive damages and


                                       31

 1   maintenance and cure were as well established, why

 2   wasn't that mentioned in terms in the Vaughan majority?

 3   It only comes up in the Vaughan dissent.

 4                MR. SULLIVAN:           Well, it does come up in the

 5   Vaughan dissent because it was not requested by the --

 6   in the -- in the lower courts.                And this Court would not

 7   consider a claim for punitive damages for the first time

 8   on appeal.

 9                I -- I think what Justice Stewart was saying

10   is we have a question before us where somebody is

11   requesting attorneys' fees in -- in derogation of the

12   American Rule.     The majority is saying we are going to

13   find an exception to the American Rule and give

14   attorneys' fees.     And justice Stewart is saying, I don't

15   want to do that.     I think that the better --

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Do you think Stewart knew

17   more about these -- these obscure, ancient cases than we

18   do?

19                MR. SULLIVAN:           I'm sorry?             Was he more --

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Do you think he knew more

21   about these obscure, ancient cases than we do?

24   briefs by Professor Robertson and -- I think not, right?

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:             It was just sort of off the

 2   top of his head that he thought there should be punitive

 3   damages.

 4                MR. SULLIVAN:           He was quoting from McCormick

 5   on damages amend some basic treatises.                    And I think he

 6   was taking the position that punitive damages are in our

 7   quiver of weapons that we can use to deter --

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:             They -- they normally are,

 9   but the question is whether there -- whether this --

10   this is a different quiver.

11                MR. SULLIVAN:           Well, I think that he was

12   saying that this is one of the weapons we have.                   Instead

13   of creating an exception to the American Rule, let's

14   give them punitive damages to account for this egregious

15   conduct.

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And that -- that was not

17   argued by anybody.      It wasn't raised in the lower court.

18   It wasn't a punitive damages case.

19                MR. SULLIVAN:           No, it wasn't.         It wasn't.

20   The first time counsel for Mr. Vaughan raised the

21   question of punitive damages was on remand.                   And then

22   the district court said, hey, look, you didn't raise it

23   before.    Just because Justice Stewart suggested this as

24   -- as an alternative to attorneys' fees doesn't mean

25   we're going to award punitive damages now.

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:            With attorneys' fees there

 2   is a compensatory aspect.          The -- the basic obligation

 3   is to keep this seaman alive and well, and then you give

 4   him some wages if necessary, and you give him medical

 5   care.   And -- and now he's going to be out that

 6   attorneys' fees as a result of his sickness.                    So I

 7   understand that.

 8               Punitives does not compensate him for

 9   anything.   It is a policy matter for the State.                   He's a

10   beneficiary of a windfall.          And it seems a more radical

11   step to make something up out of whole cloth here with

12   punitives than it does with attorneys' fees.

13               MR. SULLIVAN:          Judge, I would like you to

14   look at how Congress treats this problem.                    If you had,

15   for example, a bridge-building project where a seaman, a

16   longshoreman and a State worker all got injured

17   identically in the same accident side by side, and the

18   shipowner failed to provide medical care for the

19   longshoreman, the shipowner could go to jail.                    If the

20   shipowner provided -- or failed to provide medical care

21   to the State worker, he could be, again, subject to

22   criminal penalties.

23               On top of the criminal penalties, Congress

24   has established these administrative agencies to assure

25   that those workers get medical care.                    On top of that, if


                                       34

 1   they don't get medical care, they lose their defense of

 2   workers' compensation immunity.              They lose the defense

 3   of assumption of risk, contributory negligence, and they

 4   are subject to personal liability, not just corporate

 5   liability.

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:           Maybe it would be a good

 7   thing.

 8                MR. SULLIVAN:         Yes.

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:           The -- the problem here is

10   it has pros and cons.      I was quite moved by the brief --

11   the citation that Professor Robertson made of all of

12   those old cases until we looked them up.                   And -- and

13   then I found they seem to stand for a little bit less

14   than I had the impression they stood for.

15                MR. SULLIVAN:         That --

16                JUSTICE BREYER:           So we'd be making this up

17   out of whole cloth, it seems to me.

18                MR. SULLIVAN:         I don't think so, Your Honor.

19   What I think he would be saying is this is part of our

20   power as a common law court.            And just because.

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:           We've abandoned that.

22                JUSTICE BREYER:           -- because Miles says don't

23   do that.

 1   admiralty causes of action we should be guided by what

 2   Congress has done in the Death on the High Seas Act and

 3   the Jones Act.

 4               Do you acknowledge that there are no

 5   punitive damages available in the event of death?

 6               MR. SULLIVAN:          Yes.

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, that -- you want to

 8   talk about what's a sensible system and what is not a

 9   sensible system.   In the days when Massachusetts used to

10   have a -- when I was in law school, they had a

11   compensation limit for wrongful death, but to limit for

12   pain and suffering, for negligence; and the line was

13   back her up again -- back her up again, Sam, she's not

14   quite dead yet.

15               (Laughter.)

16               MR. SULLIVAN:          Judge, I --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is -- is -- is this going

18   to be the same thing, where -- where the ship owner

19   says, well, you know, if -- if -- if I treat him badly

20   enough that he dies, I don't get hit with the punitive

21   damages?

22               MR. SULLIVAN:          I would hope that would not

23   be the case.

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yeah, but it is invited,

25   isn't it?

 1                 MR. SULLIVAN:         Well, I don't think it is

 2   invited, Judge.    There are reasons why that there is

 3   this anomaly that there are no punitive damages for

 4   death.    And that's because in 1920 when Congress created

 5   the Death on the high Seas Act there were no -- any kind

 6   of damages.    There was no recovery at all.

 7                 And so, Congress preempted this field of

 8   death.    And it said that death cases shall be decided

 9   under the Death on the High Seas Act.                    But Congress has

10   completely stayed away from the area of maintenance and

11   cure.    It hasn't enacted administrative remedies because

12   the Court has always been the one who has decided what's

13   appropriate.

14                 And this Court, as a matter of its -- as

15   maintaining its court docket and maintaining these

16   remedies, has the right and I think the obligation to

17   say we're going to keep these cases out of court by

18   awarding punitive damages when somebody willfully denies

19   this right, when somebody willfully withholds medical

20   care.

21                 And I think if you do that, you're going to

22   see these cases are going to disappear.                   Seamen are

23   going to start getting their medical care again.                   They

24   are not going to be coming to the court every time they

25   get injured and saying, I haven't gotten my back

 1   surgery.   I haven't gotten my rotator cuff surgery.                        It

 2   is sort of a matter of court administration to --

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   I'm not sure as

 4   sure -- I'm not sure I follow that.                       In other areas

 5   where we allow punitive damages it hasn't resulted in

 6   the cases going away.        Quite the opposite.                 It seems

 7   that it has given rise to a variety of claims on both

 8   sides.

 9               MR. SULLIVAN:            This is a very narrow area of

10   law, Your Honor.     We are talking about are you giving

11   the seaman the medical care he needs to get the maximum

12   medical improvement?        And that's all it is.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Yeah, but the normal

14   medical malpractice area has given rise to a lot of

15   punitive damage litigation.              I don't know why this would

16   anybody different.

17               MR. SULLIVAN:            I think this would be

18   different because all we're talking about is does the

19   seaman get the surgery he needs.                 If he doesn't get the

20   surgery he needs and he gets worse or continues to stay

21   ill or he continues to stay in pain, then the ship owner

22   should be punished.       But --

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:              It certainly makes these

24   maintenance and care cases a lot more attractive to the

25   plaintiffs' bar doesn't it?              I mean, one of your

 1   complaints is there's just no money in it.                The claim is

 2   not for that much.

 3               MR. SULLIVAN:            The goal here, Judge, is not

 4   money.   The goal here, I think --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Of course it shouldn't be

 6   the goal.   But we're inquiring into the question of

 7   whether granting punitive damages will increase or

 8   decrease the number of lawsuits.

 9               I -- I -- I would think it would be

10   astounding if it would decrease the number of lawsuits.

11               MR. SULLIVAN:            I think it would decrease the

12   incidence when medical care is denied.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               There -- there wouldn't

14   be any maintenance and cure claim if the system worked

15   as it was intended; that is, that if you have a sailor

16   who is injured, the ship owner pays room and board and

17   medical expenses.

18               MR. SULLIVAN:            That's all it is, Your Honor.

19   Just say if the ship owner will treat the seaman fairly,

20   will follow the doctor's recommendations, get him to a

21   doctor, give him treatment so he gets better, there's --

22   I mean, you are saying there may be more claims for

23   punitive damages, but there will be more awards of

24   punitive damages because there won't be this willful and

25   wanton, callous disregard of the seaman's rights.

 1               And so, I would suggest that, in fact, in

 2   this narrow area of the law, if you impose punitive

 3   damages, actual punitive conduct, conduct that deserves

 4   punishment will go down and it will go down rapidly.

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I wish it were as clearcut

 6   as that.   I mean, what if the seaman says, you know, I

 7   should have had this very expensive treatment?            And the

 8   ship owner's medical counsel said, no, this treatment is

 9   not necessary.

10               Is that -- is that a punitive damages claim?

11   I bet it is.

12               MR. SULLIVAN:          I don't think so, Judge.      I

13   think those kind of cases should be weeded out on

14   summary judgment by the courts -- by the district court,

15   because we're only talking about the willful, wanton and

16   callous withholding.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:            He's going to say that was

18   willful and wanton.     I obviously needed this more

19   expensive treatment.      He just didn't want to pay the

20   money.

21               MR. SULLIVAN:          And the court is going to

22   have to -- the district courts are going to have to make

23   a judgment as to the bona fides of that case.            But I

24   think that you are going to find that it is very rare

25   when somebody is going to act callously when the

 1   potential on the other side is that they are going to be

 2   awarded -- have punitive damages awarded against them.

 3                And that, therefore, this is going to be a

 4   corrective mechanism that's going to do away with the

 5   problem we currently have now and make the plaintiffs

 6   even better.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, I mean, it --

 8   whether it gives rise to more litigation or not, it is

 9   still a significant and will give rise to greater costs

10   on the part of the shipper which will be passed on, as

11   is the case in a lot of areas where you have punitive

12   damages, it will be passed on to the consumer.

13                MR. SULLIVAN:           If the punitive damages are

14   awarded.    But the hope, of course, is that --

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  No, no, even if

16   they're not.     In other words, you were saying, look, to

17   avoid punitive damages, the ship owner is going to make

18   sure that there -- that that more expensive test is

19   provided.

20                MR. SULLIVAN:           It's going to err on behalf

21   of the seaman.     Yes.

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  That doesn't mean

23   there are no costs involved in ruling in your favor.

24                MR. SULLIVAN:           That's true, Judge.         But here

25   again, we're balancing the interest of somebody who is

 1   injured and whose condition may become permanent and

 2   incurable by virtue of not getting prompt care as

 3   opposed to the limited costs to the ship owner of

 4   providing a doctor who is going to determine what the

 5   best care is.    And that's all we asking for, the best

 6   care that medical care can currently provide to get the

 7   seaman to maximum cure.

 8                 If there are no further questions --

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

10                 MR. SULLIVAN:         Thank you, Your Honor.

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Mr. McCreadie, you

12   have three minutes remaining.

13           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID W. McCREADIE

14                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

15                 MR. McCREADIE:         Justice Ginsburg, I wanted

16   to respond first to a question that you asked that I

17   think there may have been some confusion with respect to

18   the answer.

19                 There is pain and suffering available in a

20   maintenance and cure claim if the failure to pay the

21   maintenance and cure causes injury, causes hurt.                  That's

22   what we understand from reading the Osceola and Iroquois

23   as interpreted by Cortes.

24                 So, I didn't want you to be left with the

25   impression that even if a maintenance and cure claim was


                                        42

 1   brought by itself, if there's some injury, some damage

 2   beyond the failure to receive the maintenance and cure,

 3   there is a cause of action that could lead to, I think

 4   as you put it, the higher award and, hence, attorneys

 5   --

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Is that a separate cause

 7   of action?   Or is it just part of the maintenance and

 8   cure act?

 9                MR. McCREADIE:         It's -- it's maintenance and

10   cure and it can be brought either under the maintenance

11   and cure with an injury or it can be brought under the

12   Jones Act.   You can choose your cause of action.            You

13   just don't recover twice.

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Are you -- are you then

15   disputing what your colleague said about lawyers being

16   reluctant to take maintenance and cure claims that are

17   not tied with a Jones Act claim?

18                MR. McCREADIE:         Justice Ginsburg, we're

19   relying on Supreme Court precedent as opposed to

20   anecdotal information.       But to answer your question

21   specifically, that's why I'm explaining that they do

22   have the right to bring a personal injury component to a

23   maintenance and cure claim.

24                And the other point I wanted to make in the

25   Ninth and Fifth Circuits those are the circuits of


                                       43

 1   Guevara and Roy Al, where punitive damages have been

 2   clearly eliminated from a maintenance and cure claim for

 3   willful failure to pay.          Since 1995 there's no dearth of

 4   cases.   Those remain two of the most active circuits in

 5   the country for seamen's cases.                And whether they are

 6   filing as just maintenance and cure or combining with

 7   the Jones Act, the ratio would probably be the same as

 8   any other circuit.

 9               There was also a question about the Vaughan

10   and -- and what the dissent knew or didn't know; and

11   reference to McCormick on damages.                   I think, again, it

12   is a small point but it is interesting to point out that

13   McCormick on damages, the same volume that the dissent

14   referred to, specifically states that punitive damages

15   are not available under FELA -- under the FELA.                   And, of

16   course, the Jones Act incorporates FELA by reference.

17               Really the Vaughan dissent did not have the

18   benefit of Miles when it reached its decision.                   If that

19   court had had the benefit, we believe they would have

20   found punitive damages are not available.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

22   The case is submitted.

23               (Whereupon, at 12:10 p.m., the case in the

24   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
