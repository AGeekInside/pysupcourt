 7                    ORAL ARGUMENT OF CONNIE L. LENSING

 8                             ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                MS. LENSING:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                Congress clearly set out a statutory scheme

12   in which timely notice and the opportunity for

13   conciliation are required before an age discrimination

14   private suit may be brought.              While our position is that

15   reading -- the reading of ADEA Section 626(d) as a whole

16   shows that "charge" encompasses notice, even if that

17   definition is too broad and you accept only a content

18   definition of "charge," it is clear from the structure

19   of the statute that notice and an opportunity to

20   conciliate before a lawsuit commences is required.

21                JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, EEOC Form 5 is

22   labelled "Charge."      And would it be your position that

23   if an employee filled out that form and submitted it to

24   the EEOC, but the EEOC made a mistake and did not notify

25   the employer, that that would not be a charge?


                                          3

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 MS. LENSING:         We think the better rule is

 2   that it would not be a charge until notice is given,

 3   because that's the only rule that is faithful to the

 4   statute, that notice is required.                  But equitable tolling

 5   is available for such a mistake and that's the exact

 6   situation in which equitable tolling should be used, to

 7   rectify a true mistake on the EEOC's part at the time,

 8   rather than what they have been engaging in of late,

 9   which is second-guessing the decision made at the time.

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, why don't we do

11   exactly that here?      I mean, you say that the proper

12   thing to do, now a charge labelled Form 5 has been

13   filed, is to dismiss this lawsuit; and then we wait 60

14   days; and the identical lawsuit is reinstated.                      Why

15   shouldn't the court simply toll the case and say, now we

16   have a proper Form 5.        The employer didn't get a chance

17   to engage in settlement.           So we hold on to the case and

18   allow the 60 days to elapse, and then the complaint is

19   there.     Why isn't that the appropriate solution for this

20   case?

21                 MS. LENSING:         Well, Justice Ginsburg, to

22   begin with, the plaintiff never requested that the court

23   do that.     But in a broader sense, it's not the proper

24   thing to do because there's a very big difference in

25   conciliation after notification and before a lawsuit has


                                          4

 1   been filed.    There is -- the emphasis is on let's get

 2   this conciliated, if possible.

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But you said the same

 4   complaint could be filed at the end of the conciliation.

 5   What difference does it make that you have a piece of

 6   paper there?

 7                 What I don't understand is the only effect

 8   of your position -- dismiss the whole thing, 60 days,

 9   start over -- is you're making the plaintiff file an

10   additional filing fee.        The complaint has already been

11   filed.   The filing fee has been paid.

12                 Now, everything would work out just the same

13   except the plaintiff has to pay a second filing fee.                     In

14   the court there are certain inefficiencies if it's first

15   dismissed and then they have to docket it again.                  So I

16   don't see any -- it doesn't seem to make any sense to

17   me.

18                 MS. LENSING:        Well, Congress believed that

19   notice and a chance to conciliate without a lawsuit was

20   the proper way for this to be done, and there is a

21   difference in efforts to conciliate before and after a

22   lawsuit is filed.    And if --

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, I think -- I

24   think you're right about that.               I mean, once the

25   lawyer's involved and they're in litigation and all


                                         5

 1   that, they're not going to take conciliation efforts

 2   with the same light as before.

 3                But the question is whether the remedy for

 4   that, which is some unfairness to you, is to throw the

 5   suit out or try to fix it as much as possible, such as

 6   through a stay or dismissing without prejudice or

 7   something.

 8                Why should the Plaintiff -- it's not his

 9   fault that the EEOC didn't notify you.                    Why should he

10   suffer the categorical sanction of dismissal simply

11   because it's a little unfairness to you?

12                MS. LENSING:          I think it could be dismissed

13   without prejudice.      I think that that's fine, because

14   then you would have an opportunity, as in this case

15   where there is a proper charge, to have that period of

16   conciliation, and the plaintiff would not be out

17   anything other than the filing fee, which the employer

18   is out a little bit, too, because the employer never got

19   a prompt notice at the time of the first situation.

20                But the biggest reason --

21                JUSTICE SOUTER:              Why -- why should the --

22   the filing fee penalty, in effect, go to the plaintiff

23   when it wasn't the plaintiff's fault?

24                MS. LENSING:          Well, you know, I would submit

25   that perhaps it is the plaintiff's fault when the


                                          6

 1   plaintiff does not do everything a plaintiff can to be

 2   sure that a charge is filed.              This particular form, for

 3   instance, stated that it is for -- pre-charge counseling

 4   is the purpose, and that it's to determine potential

 5   charges.

 6                JUSTICE SOUTER:             May I interrupt you to this

 7   extent:    As I understand it, if -- your position, if the

 8   plaintiff had filed on Form 5 and the EEOC had done

 9   nothing and the plaintiff then brought suit, you'd be

10   making the same argument.

11                MS. LENSING:         That is true, and equitable

12   tolling is available.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:             I don't understand that.         I

14   mean, that -- that seems to me a very strange argument.

15   You say since -- since the EEOC must give notice when a

16   charge is filed, if it doesn't give notice, no charge

17   has been filed.

18                That doesn't make sense.                    I mean, it's just

19   like saying, you know, you have a civil rule, a rule of

20   civil procedure, that says, you know, after a complaint

21   has been filed there shall be an answer within 60 days.

22   And if no answer is filed, no complaint has been filed?

23                MS. LENSING:         Well, Justice -- sorry.

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:             I mean, it just doesn't

25   track.

 1              MS. LENSING:         Justice Scalia, I understand

 2   your hesitancy to accept our definition of "charge" as

 3   including notice, but the other view --

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:             So give me another one that

 5   will enable me to rule in your favor?

 6              MS. LENSING:         It is -- it is just as true

 7   and the results are just the same if you look at the

 8   statute as a whole and you uphold the sense of the

 9   statute and you understand that the requirement before

10   bringing a suit, whether or not notice is part of the

11   definition of "charge."        But there is a requirement

12   under the statute that notice and an effort to

13   conciliate be made before the suit is brought.               So

14   understanding the statute as a whole and upholding that

15   purpose, that it's a requirement, an indispensable

16   prerequisite to a lawsuit, is a different way of getting

17   to the same result.

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:             All right.      Now, does --

19   does the person who's filed a proper charge know whether

20   notice has been given or not?            Is a copy of the notice

21   always given to the filer.

22              MS. LENSING:         I don't know if it always is.

23   Certainly when it's not given, it is not.               But, yes, I

24   think the person easily can contact or find out from the

25   EEOC, what is happening with my, what she believes or


                                       8

 1   may not believe is a charge.              In this particular case,

 2   certainly she did within the time limits because she

 3   filed a charge later.

 4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             After she had a lawyer.

 5   But is it -- is it not the practice at the EEOC when

 6   you're dealing with an unrepresented person who files

 7   the intake questionnaire and if the SEC reviewer thinks

 8   that it fits within the statute, that the Form 5 will be

 9   filled out, not by the layperson, but by the EEOC

10   officer herself?

11                 MS. LENSING:         Well, I think that the, the

12   practice has been so inconsistent and that's part of the

13   problem.     Two field agents in this particular case, one

14   in '01 and one in '02, because she submitted the

15   questionnaire twice, two field agents did decide that it

16   was not a charge and did not treat it as a charge -- no

17   charge number, no notice.            They decided it was not a

18   charge.     And so no Form 5 --

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But that's not the

20   question.     The question I asked is if they decide that

21   the, what the intake -- the information on the intake

22   questionnaire fits within the statute so that the claim

23   can go forward, isn't it the practice not to ask the

24   layperson to fill out the Form 5, but for the EEOC to do

25   it itself?

 1                MS. LENSING:         I don't believe so, Your

 2   Honor.    The website says, for instance, until 2 months

 3   ago -- for 2-1/2 years the Web site, which is probably

 4   the way the agency gets out information to more people

 5   and more employees than any other way, says when the

 6   completed signed Form 5 is received back in the field

 7   office --

 8                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, it has to be

 9   signed.

10                MS. LENSING:         Well, this -- right.       Received

11   back in the field office -- in this case, for instance,

12   both the questionnaire and the charge were filled out by

13   her, by the, by the employee.

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, she filled out hers

15   after she was already in court and had a lawyer.                But I

16   thought that this statute, as all the statutes EEOC

17   administers, are designed for claims that are put forth

18   initially largely by unrepresented people.               And the

19   notion is that the agency should make it as easy as

20   possible for them to get through the legal process.

21                MS. LENSING:         It -- the form does say, the

22   form that she filled out, the intake questionnaire, does

23   say that someone will talk with you after you fill this

24   out.   It does not say that they will fill out the

25   charge.   In our experience the charge is very often


                                        10
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   filled out by the employee.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:           It said it wasn't a charge,

 3   didn't it?   Didn't it say that it's not a charge?

 4                MS. LENSING:        Yes, it did.              Well, it did not

 5   say that this is not a charge, which I think would be a

 6   better practice if it did say that in the future.                      But

 7   it said the purpose of this is for precharge

 8   counseling --

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Precharge counseling.

10                MS. LENSING:        -- and for determination

11   whether we have jurisdiction over potential charges.                     So

12   we think the plain language of the form --

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Do we know --

14   perhaps this is a question your friend on the other side

15   will be able to answer better than you.                     But do we know

16   where she got the form, why she filled it out?                     I

17   couldn't find in the record whether this was given to

18   her by someone at the EEOC or whether she downloaded it

19   from the website or what.

20                MS. LENSING:        We do not know, or I do not

21   know.   It is not in the record.             You're correct.

22                The problem is, is that the practice at EEOC

23   has been so inconsistent, both the, what they call a

24   charge, what they recognize as a charge, and their

25   treatment of documents as a charge.                     Again, the Web site


                                       11

 1   clearly says a Form 5 that is signed and completed and

 2   received back in the field office is a charge.                 That is

 3   when your charge is filed.          And yet we have two memos

 4   that went out, one after the Edelman case and one after

 5   the opening brief in this case, to field agents that

 6   say, no, you're supposed to use this manifest intent

 7   test.

 8              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I agree completely

 9   with everything you said.          I just don't understand your

10   leap from government incompetence to saying the

11   plaintiff loses.

12              MS. LENSING:          The plaintiff does not lose.

13   And that is the difference in this situation and the

14   Logan case, which the government, I think, and also the

15   Respondent have cited.       The plaintiff does not lose,

16   because equitable tolling is available.                 Now, in our

17   case --

18              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              What happens -- what

19   happens if -- in this case it's not a problem, but I can

20   imagine it would be in many cases -- - if you have a

21   300-day or a 180-day problem, you withdraw the

22   complaint, and then you're out there and the clock keeps

23   ticking, and you get past the 300 days and you are

24   totally out.   That's why it's important not to follow --

25   to say, well, it's, it doesn't make any difference, if

 1   we dismiss this complaint, she comes back in 60 days.

 2   Well, but 60 days may be 360 days.

 3              MS. LENSING:            Yes, Your Honor.           That's where

 4   equitable tolling comes in.              That's the purpose of

 5   equitable tolling.

 6              If the situation is that you have missed the

 7   time to file the charge, either the 180 or the 300 days,

 8   equitable tolling saves from you that.                    In other words,

 9   you can now file the charge.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Do you think

11   Ms. Kennedy is entitled to equitable tolling in this

12   case?

13              MS. LENSING:            Ms. Kennedy didn't need

14   equitable tolling, because in this case she caught the

15   situation before the time ran and she filed a charge.

16   The problem in this case is that she chose not to file a

17   lawsuit based on that charge, and she decided to do that

18   for quite some time.        She did finally get -- you know,

19   once the charge was filed, the EEOC recognized it as a

20   charge, they gave notice to us, the employer.                   They

21   began the time --

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I guess she,

23   reasonably or otherwise, thought there already was a

24   lawsuit.

25              MS. LENSING:            Well, not after the lawsuit

 1   was dismissed, Your Honor.          I mean after the lawsuit was

 2   dismissed, she got the right to sue letter and she still

 3   did not bring a lawsuit.         She had 90 days from the right

 4   to sue letter and she still did not bring a lawsuit.

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Wasn't she appealing?

 6                MS. LENSING:        Pardon me?

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Wasn't she appealing the

 8   dismissal?

 9                MS. LENSING:        Yes, Your Honor.

10                But, you know, the equitable tolling is not

11   needed where you file within the 180 or 300 days.                        All

12   you have to do is file a --

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Did you undertake

14   conciliation efforts after her formal, her filing of the

15   Form 5 charge?

16                MS. LENSING:        We were in a lawsuit, Your

17   Honor, and so that sort of changes everything.                     We

18   can't, we can't talk to her.            We can't -- you know, the

19   discovery process is what you then would use to

20   investigate, rather than an informal investigation.                        And

21   that never occurred and that's part of the problem here,

22   because we spent a long, long time on the motion to

23   dismiss.   It was finally dismissed.                    Then it was on

24   appeal, and it's still on appeal.                So we haven't had

25   that opportunity, although she is a current employee;


                                       14

 1   that this has been in litigation, and that changes the

 2   face of conciliation completely.

 3                JUSTICE ALITO:           If the employee files an

 4   intake questionnaire but not a Form 5, would you say

 5   that there would be equitable tolling, or would you say

 6   that the employee wouldn't be entitled to equitable

 7   tolling because the employee didn't file the right form?

 8                MS. LENSING:          I think that unless she was

 9   relying on the EEOC, and there have been cases like that

10   in which the EEOC says, the field agent says, that's all

11   you need to do, this is a charge and notice is going to

12   issue.   If that were -- if there were some evidence of

13   that in the record, which of course this record is

14   completely silent.      The plaintiff chose to put no

15   information in about whether she believed, didn't

16   believe or what she was relying on.                       But in a situation

17   where the EEOC misleads her, yes.                  I would certainly say

18   no in a situation where the form clearly says that it's

19   precharge.

20                JUSTICE ALITO:           I don't see much difference

21   between the substance of these two forms, other than the

22   fact that the Form 5, I think, requires a listing of the

23   number of employees that the employer has.                       What -- they

24   basically cover the same ground.

25                MS. LENSING:          There is very little

 1   difference, you're exactly right, in the information

 2   requested.     The difference is that one is an intake

 3   questionnaire and not a charge, and the other is a

 4   charge.   And the EEOC, which we think is a good idea,

 5   has had a multistep process, so that lay people that

 6   come in and say, you know, I have this charge of

 7   discrimination, it happened to me when I was working in

 8   France, they can go through those and say that's not,

 9   that's not a charge, and they can read through them and

10   not have to process everything as a charge.                      That's the

11   reason for the intake questionnaire.                      But it is simply

12   giving the information to the EEOC and not a charge, and

13   must be treated, must be treated differently.

14                You know, going back, Justice Ginsburg,

15   because I don't think I ever finished the answer to your

16   question some time ago.          One of the problems with

17   staying the lawsuit is if that were the answer, then we

18   would be doing away with presuit notice, because anybody

19   could go in on an intake questionnaire a year later

20   because, remember, nothing is happening to --

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Well, I don't understand

22   that, because EEOC is a responsible agency.                      Congress

23   has told it:    You weed out the people complaining about

24   something that happened in Paris, and then you give

25   notice.   But the notice obligation -- and I understand


                                         16
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   it is EEOC's, not the complainant's.                    So we would not

 2   expect this agency -- yes, it messed up in this case --

 3   routinely not to give notice, routinely not to engage

 4   the employer in conciliation efforts.

 5                MS. LENSING:        But that is the problem.             If

 6   you -- they are routinely not giving notice of intake

 7   questionnaires, and they are not supposed to.                    We agree

 8   with them.   And twice this happened.                   And only 5 years

 9   later after it got to this Court did the EEOC write a

10   memo and say, oh, those field agents were wrong.                   But we

11   need to take the opinion of the EEOC at the time.                   And

12   of course this was a very reliable, very justified

13   opinion of the field agents because it clearly said on

14   the form it was precharge.

15                But if you -- if you just say the lawsuit,

16   that means that anybody that files an intake

17   questionnaire can come in 2 years later because it's not

18   being processed, so no notice to sue letter will ever go

19   out, and so there is no end to the statute.

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What about the new form,

21   the EEOC's new form -- I suppose responsive to this case

22   and others like it -- that says if you don't file any

23   other administrative complaint, we'll count the intake

24   questionnaire as the charge?

25                MS. LENSING:        Well, that's -- that's an


                                       17

 1   interesting form because that means it you come in the

 2   day after the act of discrimination, that form is filled

 3   out; it is neither a complaint nor a charge.               Who knows

 4   what it is until 300 days run.               So at the end of 300

 5   days, if the -- if the complainant has not filed another

 6   writing, then there -- there can be no prompt notice.

 7   Then it is -- has morphed into a charge; then there can

 8   be no prompt notice to the employer.

 9              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               If the EEOC treats it as

10   a charge, then the EEOC is obliged to give notice.

11              MS. LENSING:           But they won't know if it's a

12   charge until the entire time runs, to know if it's the

13   only timely filed document, because it says it's only a

14   charge if you don't file anything else on time.              You

15   have 300 days to do that.

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Where -- where does it

17   say if you don't file it's only --

18              MS. LENSING:           If it's the only timely

19   document filed --

20              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Yes.

21              MS. LENSING:           -- means that no other

22   document within the time period, which is 300 days.

23              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               That's the new form.

24              MS. LENSING:           In deferral stage.      Yes.

25   That's the form, yes, Your Honor, the form in footnote

 1   3, I believe, of the EEOC's brief.

 2              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               And where in the form

 3   that --

 4              MS. LENSING:           I'm sorry.             Footnote 2, I

 5   think, on page 3.

 6              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               The new form does say

 7   that, that if no other paper is filed, this can be

 8   treated as a charge?

 9              MS. LENSING:           This will be a charge, if no

10   other timely allegation of discrimination is -- is

11   filed.

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Doesn't that eliminate the

13   whole purpose of the -- of the preliminary document, to

14   weed out those charges that relate to employment in

15   France?

16              MS. LENSING:           It does.          It does completely.

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:              It will -- it will be a

18   charge even if it's in France?

19              MS. LENSING:           Right.        It should be.      Now, I

20   think the practical matter is, Justice Scalia, that if

21   nobody does anything ever -- you don't file suit, you

22   don't try to rely on it -- they don't give notice and

23   they don't --

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:              I think that's right.            I

25   think what it boils down to is it'll be a charge if we

 1   decide to give notice, and it won't be a charge if we

 2   don't decide to give notice.

 3                 MS. LENSING:         Exactly.

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Which is very nice for the

 5   EEOC, but not --

 6                 MS. LENSING:         Which can only happen at the

 7   end of a long period of time, which means that the

 8   notice will not be prompt.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel, the

10   Government relied in its brief very heavily on the

11   Chevron case, saying we should defer to the agency's

12   regulations, and on the Auer case, saying we defer to

13   the agency to tell us what its regulations mean.                    And

14   you didn't cite either of those cases in your reply

15   brief.    So I wonder what your answer is to that

16   argument.

17                 MS. LENSING:         Well, the -- the regulations

18   are certainly entitled to deference, and taken as a

19   whole, the regulations, just as the statutes, require

20   notice.     But what the EEOC's position is, is the

21   regulations that describe what a charge is are not

22   enough, and the entire definition is not embodied in the

23   regulations.     You have to go to -- to memos we wrote and

24   to a compliance manual, which is not in the record and

25   is not attached to the brief and is not available to

 1   employees or most lawyers, readily.

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:           But if they do that why

 3   can't -- and you don't -- if they don't give you the

 4   notice, well, then you can complain, they didn't give us

 5   the notice.

 6                 MS. LENSING:        Well --

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:           But if you're not hurt by

 8   it, what difference does it make?

 9                 MS. LENSING:        Well, I agree if we get the

10   notice, we cannot complain.

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:           And if you don't get it,

12   you can't complain, if you actually knew about it.

13                 MS. LENSING:        I -- I --

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:           If you didn't know about

15   it, then -- then you have a complaint.

16                 MS. LENSING:        Justice Breyer, I agree.     If,

17   for instance, a plaintiff gave us the notice and the

18   EEOC didn't -- didn't file it, I agree, because notice

19   is the important thing; but that's not what happened.

20   That is just simply not what happened.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Well -- well, then you'd

22   have the complaint if you didn't, et cetera, but so

23   what?   In other words, if the EEOC wants to have a very

24   broad definition that turns 90 percent of its --

 1   forgotten the name, sorry.            What's the name of this

 2   document?   The intake questionnaire.

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Intake questionnaire.

 4               MS. LENSING:           Intake questionnaire.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:              Yes.      If it has a broad

 6   definition that says this counts as a charge, so what?

 7   Let it do it.     Who's hurt?

 8               MS. LENSING:           If they treat it as a charge

 9   and give notice, I have no problem.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:              And if they don't, you

11   complain about that.

12               MS. LENSING:           Well, where do you -- the

13   problem is that there no place to complain.                   You didn't

14   get notice; you didn't get a chance to conciliate; the

15   entire --

16               JUSTICE BREYER:              You complain just as you're

17   doing now, in court.        You just the same words, but

18   instead of using the words as against the word "charge,"

19   you use those same words you've all said in your

20   excellent arguments, except you attack the fact you

21   didn't get the notice, and there you're really hurt.                     Or

22   if you're not, it doesn't matter.

23               MS. LENSING:           Exactly.          If you're not, it

 1   wrong with that?

 2              MS. LENSING:          Well it's -- it's the

 3   situation where you are hurt that's the problem.                 The

 4   problem is that we need a better rule that's faithful to

 5   the statute, where notice is given.                     And --

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  And you're only --

 7   when you say you're hurt, the only prejudice that you

 8   rely on is the fact that you didn't have an opportunity

 9   to go through prelitigation conciliation.

10              MS. LENSING:          We didn't have prompt notice.

11   We could not investigate --

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But -- but my point

13   is, you're not alleging prejudice from the lack of

14   prompt notice.   In other words, it's not a situation

15   where you'd say if we had notice we would have done

16   this, and that would have prevented everything.

17              MS. LENSING:          Well, we don't --

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Your only prejudice

19   is the lack of conciliation period.

20              MS. LENSING:          Well, I don't think that's the

21   only prejudice, and this is what somewhat speculatory

22   because it did not happen; but generally if you have

23   prompt notice, particularly without a lawsuit, you can

24   investigate; and if you don't have prompt notice,

25   sometimes you have destroyed documents in the regular

 1   course of your business that are helpful to you.                   That

 2   has happened to us.       You have employees who are

 3   witnesses who are gone; you don't know where they are.

 4   You have all sorts of things that --

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Do we know whether that's

 6   true in this case?

 7                 MS. LENSING:         Do I believe that's true in

 8   this case?

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Do we know whether -- I

10   mean the difference -- what you are suggesting would be

11   perfectly fine is once the charge was filed, and this is

12   a lawsuit, and then you would investigate or whatever,

13   but you would be under exactly the same disadvantage if

14   the time lapse has meant that employees have left, that

15   you have -- you have removed evidence as old and

16   disposable.    It wouldn't -- you would -- on your

17   scenario of what would be the right way to do this

18   lawsuit, you would be -- you would suffer the same

19   disabilities in terms of documents and witnesses.

20                 MS. LENSING:         That is true.          Had -- had

21   this -- well, the charge, the only timely charge we did

22   get notice of, and so if there had not been a lawsuit we

23   could have investigated, and you're a little bit

24   estopped from the investigation when a lawsuit is

25   pending because you've got rules of discovery and that

 1   sort of thing.   And --

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Excuse me.       I thought you

 3   said you were deprived of something else.                I mean, the

 4   statute provides for a conciliation process in which you

 5   can talk to the employee and say, you know, what

 6   happened?   And you may well be able to satisfy the

 7   employee with -- before -- before she lawyers up.

 8               I think it's a big disadvantage to -- to

 9   have no contact with the employee until there's a lawyer

10   on the other side, and you can't talk to her

11   confidentially; you can't make a conciliation notice.                   I

12   think that's a considerable disadvantage, and it's --

13   it's a situation that the statute did not envision.

14               MS. LENSING:         And I agree, Justice Scalia.

15   I think they did -- the statute did envision it because

16   it does require prompt notice.              That's -- that's exactly

17   where I was going next, is it's notice for investigation

18   and the opportunity to conciliate without a lawsuit

19   pending.

20               And particularly in this suit and in many

21   others now, when you have the piggyback situation, a

22   plaintiff is in a lawsuit and others are attempting to

23   piggyback off of her charge, she may not at that point

24   feel that she can conciliate just for her -- herself;

25   but before suit, that is a very good situation.

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, as a practical

 2   matter, you can't conciliate after suit anyway.                 You can

 3   negotiate with the lawyer --

 4               MS. LENSING:           Right.

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:              -- on the other side.

 6               MS. LENSING:           That's absolutely right.

 7               Mr. Chief Justice, I didn't finish the

 8   question you had asked me about deference in the Auer

 9   case.   The Auer case is an interpretation of a

10   regulation, and in this case the regulation says nothing

11   about manifest intent, and that is just a wholly new

12   situation that --

13               JUSTICE SOUTER:              How is it -- how is it new?

14   I thought that you argued for that test in the court of

15   appeals.

16               MS. LENSING:           Well, in the court of appeals,

17   as the test had been administered by other courts which

18   required evidence --

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Well, didn't -- didn't your

20   brief say that was the appropriate test?

21               MS. LENSING:           Because in that court we were

22   bound by precedent and that was the test, but we said --

23               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Well, you -- I know you're

24   bound by precedent, but if you think it's wrong, you can

25   say it's wrong.     And, as I understand, you did not say


                                         26

 1   it was wrong; you adopted it.

 2              MS. LENSING:            Well, we -- the manifest

 3   intent test that we talked about was the one the courts

 4   have used, which is the situation we were talking about,

 5   where equitable tolling should occur.                       And that is where

 6   you have, in the record, reliance on the EEOC that

 7   you've done everything you need to do and this is a

 8   charge.

 9              That is not the case under the Second

10   Circuit's ruling, where they just say:                       Just look at the

11   document and if you think that she wanted you to file a

12   charge, that's enough.         That's a very different intent

13   test than the other courts accept.

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Well, what is your test?

15   When is it a charge?

16              MS. LENSING:            When notice --

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:               And don't tell me when

18   notice is given.

19              MS. LENSING:            Yes, sir.              Yes, Your Honor.

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:               My goodness.           It's like

21   saying there's no complaint until an answer is filed.

22              MS. LENSING:            Well -- I'm not -- and that's

23   what I'm saying --

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:               It's just not true.

25              MS. LENSING:            But -- but notice is required

 1   for the suit.   So, while a charge may be a charge before

 2   notice is given, and I understand your reluctance to

 3   accept that definition, but --

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes, only because I'm sane.

 5                (Laughter.)

 6                MS. LENSING:        A point well taken.

 7                We still -- we still get to the same place

 8   if you -- if you accept the position that notice is

 9   required in the statute and suit can't be brought.

10   Maybe there is a minimal charge, but suit cannot be

11   brought on that minimal charge until notice is given, is

12   a more sane way to put it.

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            If she had the obligation

14   to give notice, you would have a much stronger argument,

15   but the statute places that burden on the EEOC, not on

16   the lay complainant.

17                MS. LENSING:        The burden is on the EEOC, and

18   that is why there's equitable tolling.                  But the

19   plaintiff needs to demonstrate in the record she's done

20   everything she can.

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:           But there can't be

22   equitable tolling unless she has really filed a charge.

23   So sooner or later -- you cannot run away from it --

24   you're going to have to give us a definition of what a

25   charge is.

 1                MS. LENSING:         A charge --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:            You're only going to give

 3   her equitable tolling if in fact she's, she's filed a

 4   charge.    And you don't give me any -- unless you want to

 5   fall back on the manifest destiny rule or --

 6                (Laughter.)

 7                MS. LENSING:         No.      A charge needs to clearly

 8   delineate that it's a charge.              And I think the EEOC

 9   could do that if they knew they had to live by that, and

10   then we're perfectly happy with the EEOC defining

11   "charge" as long as they consistently define it and give

12   us notice.

13                Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the rest of

14   my time if there are no more questions.

19                       ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

20                MR. ROSE:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

21   please the Court:

22                I'd like to make two points initially.                  And

23   I'll make them briefly, and I'll try not to re-cover the

24   ground that's been covered by a number of the questions.

25                The first major point is that the statute


                                        29
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   and the -- well, this has been made sort of -- the

 2   statute and the regulations state that, after a charge

 3   has been filed, the responsibility for sending the

 4   notice and docketing the case is upon the commission.

 5   It's not on the aggrieved individual.                     The argument that

 6   a petitioner has -- the charging party, excuse me, or

 7   aggrieved individual has a duty to provide notice is

 8   just absolutely flatly inconsistent with the statute, as

 9   Justice Scalia was just stating.

10               I want to make a second point which ha also

11   been alluded to by, I think, Justice Breyer and others.

12   The Petitioner suffered no harm from the fact Ms.

13   Kennedy filed a Form 283 rather than a Form 5, which is

14   entitled "Charge," because EEOC did not give prompt

15   notice to the defendant Federal Express, the Petitioner

16   here, on May 30th.      EEOC did not send the notice of the

17   filing of the charge until sometime after August 20th,

18   2002.   That is, it was more than 60 days.                   So that even

19   though the charge was filed and -- EEOC did absolutely

20   nothing with it.     No notice.           And it's in the appendix,

21   if you look at Joint Appendix 294-296.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Is this after the real

23   charge was filed or what everybody concedes --

24               MR. ROSE:        Form 5.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:              The charge form.


                                         30

 1                MR. ROSE:     The charge Form 5 was file on --

 2   well, she signed it on the 30th.               It may have been filed

 3   a couple of days later.        But whatever it was, that was

 4   submitted.   I sent it to the EEOC by, I think, FedEx.

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:           But suit was pending at

 6   that time.

 7                (Laughter.)

 8                MR. ROSE:     Well, I used FedEx --

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:           That's pretty risky.

10                MR. ROSE:     I used FedEx for a record because

11   I can use their tracking.          Some of the tracking

12   documents are in the joint appendix.                    I dealt with -- I

13   dealt with FedEx in the Bost case.                 I call it Bost.        I'm

14   not sure whether it's "BOSST" or "BOEST."                    He calls

15   himself Tony, so I don't know.

16                In any event --

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Answer my question.          Was

18   suit already filed at that point?

19                MR. ROSE:     Yes, sir.           Suit had been filed

20   earlier.

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes.

22                MR. ROSE:     All right, let me address your

23   question, if I may.      There is a period for conciliation.

24   We have records from the EEOC which we sent copies of to

25   opposing counsel by e-mail yesterday, and perhaps we


                                       31

 1   should have done it earlier, that show that something

 2   like 240 -- I may have the wrong number -- over 200

 3   cases that were filed -- charges, excuse me, by EEO --

 4   filed by employees of FedEx with the EEOC.                  Not one had

 5   been conciliated from 1997 through 2005.                  Not one.

 6   Zero.

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Wait.       I'm sorry.   247

 8   during that whole period?

 9              MR. ROSE:        Yes.

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:              That's the only number of

11   mistakes they have made; is that what you're saying?

12              MR. ROSE:        No.      That's the only mistakes

13   that we know that EEOC made with respect to -- I'm not

14   saying that all of them should have been served or

15   anything like that, but there were --

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:              I'm astounded if that's the

17   only number of mistakes they made, from 19 --

18              MR. ROSE:        No, no.           This is only with

19   respect to FedEx.

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Oh, with respect to FedEx.

21              MR. ROSE:        And it's age claims.

24   it, but it is public, and I checked again yesterday with

 1   today.

 2                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           But are you telling us

 3   stuff that's not in the record at all?                   Why is that

 4   relevant to the argument here?

 5                 MR. ROSE:     Well, it's relevant because this

 6   is a complaint that was dismissed before any evidence

 7   was taken, and therefore any set of facts that's alleged

 8   in the complaint is assumed to be true for purposes of

 9   its trial B motion.       So there was no discovery.              We

10   didn't have a chance to do any discovery.                  The district

11   court threw us out on a motion to dismiss.                  Now, it was

12   morphed into a summary judgment motion functionally, but

13   on the very limited topic of what there was.

14                 JUSTICE ALITO:         What is the point of these

15   statistics?    To show that conciliation wouldn't have

16   done any good?    Is that what you --

17                 MR. ROSE:     Yes.        And, furthermore, I cite to

18   you the fact that since --

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But I thought conciliation

20   was an important policy of the EEOC.

21                 MR. ROSE:     EEOC does very little within 2

22   months, Your Honor, of anything, of receipt of the

23   charge.

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But you want us to write

25   an opinion saying, we're not concerned with

 1   conciliation?     We just --

 2                MR. ROSE:       No.      I think conciliation is

 3   important.   I think what -- if this is treated as the

 4   charge, as I think it should be, under the definition in

 5   the regulation, it's -- it's in 16 --29 CFR 1626.                        It's

 6   in 3.6 and 8(b) of that regulation.                       The original

 7   document is a charge because it identified the

 8   Respondent, identified the kind of discrimination, and

 9   the person signed it.        That's all that's needed under

10   the regulation.    That regulation is lawful.

11                JUSTICE ALITO:           What if the person fills out

12   an intake form, checks the box that says "I do not

13   consent to have my employer notified"?

14                MR. ROSE:       I think that's a question that's

15   not presented here, and I think that's a question that

16   is best -- best left to EEOC.               The -- that form says on

17   it that we don't -- you don't need to let us notify.

18   There's a footnote or something.                 We don't -- you don't

19   need to let us -- you don't need to agree at this stage

20   --

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:             What's -- what's wrong with

22   this?   Why don't I -- I mean, I do believe that the

23   thing either is a charge or isn't a charge before the

24   EEOC decides whether it's going to give notice or not.

25   It either is or isn't.

 1               Now, what about this:                It is a charge if it

 2   reasonably appears to be a charge, or if you want to say

 3   "manifest intent," that's okay, too.

 4               Now, if you signed a document which -- which

 5   says that it is a prefiling document and the purpose is

 6   to discuss a future charge, it seems to me you know, or

 7   ought to know, that this is not a charge.

 8               And we can't run the system for people who

 9   are either illiterate or don't even have friends who are

10   literate.   We can't run a system that way.                So I look at

11   this, and I say this is not a charge.

12               MR. ROSE:      Right.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Now, if the EEOC chooses to

14   give notice, then I guess you could say one that's close

15   to the boundary line becomes a charge retroactively, and

16   there is -- there is no harm done.                 You can have the

17   counseling, and so forth.

18               But when you come in with something that

19   doesn't look like a charge, it seems to me if there is

20   no notice given and you get into the situation that is

21   here where the company has been deprived of the

22   conciliation opportunity, deprived of the opportunity to

23   preserve evidence and whatnot, it seems to me the fault

24   should lie on your client, because she filed something

25   that any reasonable person should know is not a charge.

 1               MR. ROSE:      Your Honor, I differ on this.            I

 2   think many reasonable persons don't know what a charge

 3   is, particularly if, like Miss Kennedy, she had never

 4   filed a charge before.       And just let me complete it if I

 5   may.

 6               She had never filed a charge before.              She

 7   had never complained.      She had tried to complain

 8   internally, but she had never filed a charge before.

 9   She didn't know what it was.            I --

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Whatever it was, this thing

11   says it's a precharge document.

12               MR. ROSE:      Your Honor, it says -- if you

13   look at the two-part form, it's very small writing.

14   It's at the bottom.     It doesn't say it's a precharge

15   form.   It says the purpose of this questionnaire is to

16   solicit information to enable the Commission to avoid

17   mistakes.

18               And then it says routine uses, and it says

19   potential charges, complaints or allegations, and to

20   provide counseling --

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             This is where -- you're

22   reading from where?

23               MR. ROSE:      It's two -- I'm sorry.          It's 265,

24   I believe, (J) 265, it's the two-page printout.              And the

25   handwriting is her handwriting on the top.              That's a

 1   Xerox of her handwriting.

 2              Justice Scalia, I would further add that I

 3   -- she was not my client when she filled this out, as

 4   this document makes clear, because she checked the box

 5   "not represented."

 6      By the time I asked her if she had filed a charge,

 7   and she said, oh, yes, I went and got the document from

 8   the EEOC, and I sent it in.

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Is that in the record?

10              MR. ROSE:         No.      But -- but it is, Your Honor

11   -- this is in the complaint, the facts that are supposed

12   to be alleged.   As we said in the complaint, that the

13   parties had given notice to EEOC of the overall system.

14              Incidentally, there is another Respondent

15   named Robertson, who did have a live charge and a right

16   to sue letter which was running out, which is why we

17   filed this in May rather than in June or July.

18              I also -- I think I said that EEOC did not,

19   in fact, give notice to EEOC -- to FedEx until sometime

20   after August 20th, which was much more than 60 days from

21   the filing of the charge.            So --

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Mr. Rose, I'm having

23   trouble figuring out -- she not only filed this intake

24   questionnaire; she also filed a lengthy affidavit.

25              MR. ROSE:         Yes, sir.

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Where did all this

 2   stuff come from?

 3                 MR. ROSE:      She had friends who had filed

 4   charges before.     She had met with them.                Much of this I

 5   can --

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Did these friends

 7   file charges on intake questionnaires?

 8                 MR. ROSE:      They had all filled out intake

 9   questionnaires.     Many of them had filed charges

10   thereafter.

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 On Form 5.

12                 MR. ROSE:      Yes.        I mean, there's a whole --

13   she is from the same station -- she was from the same

14   station as Mr. Freeman, who filed a suit way back in

15   1999 with a group of other people.                   So this language was

16   around, and the couriers were friends, some of them at

17   least, and they discussed the matter with each other.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Do you know why she

19   signed the intake questionnaire on two different dates?

20                 MR. ROSE:      Yes, Your Honor.             Because I spoke

21   to her in January, and I believe it was -- this is not

22   on the record, but it's compatible with my allegations

23   in the complaint.     This is not on the record, but she --

24   I -- I never had seen her in person, and I spoke to her,

25   and she said she had been to EEOC, and she filed it.

 1                And then I called her in January and said --

 2   late January, I think -- did EEOC give you a number?                      I

 3   didn't know the difference then between a complaint --

 4   between a Form 5 and a Form 283.

 5                It was not something -- I had been

 6   practicing mostly Title VII work, but I had had some age

 7   cases before then.      And I didn't know the difference in

 8   the forms.

 9                And I had a form on my computer that I had

10   people fill out which says "charge," but -- so she -- I

11   said they must have lost it.              Why don't you go down

12   and -- she said, well, I'll file it again.                      I said fine.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  You were

14   representing her at that point?

15                MR. ROSE:       By February, I -- I don't think

16   we had the retainer, but I had talked to her, and I --

17   and she signed the retainer either in late January or

18   early February.

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why do you think -- why do

20   you think they must have lost it?                  Why did you think

21   they must have lost it:          Because she hadn't been given a

22   number?

23                MR. ROSE:       Yes.        Because it hadn't been

24   docketed.    It's like a clerk.             They -- you -- it's

25   similar to what the courts -- the courts do.                      They get a

 1   new thing, and they docket it.               The problem with EEOC

 2   is, when they get a new thing that's not a Form 5, they

 3   don't docket it.    This didn't get docketed.

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Even if they treat it as a

 5   charge, they don't docket it?

 6                 MR. ROSE:     I don't know when they docketed

 7   the form, the Form 5, that she filed.                    But the timing

 8   suggests they did not docket it until August, sometime

 9   after August.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I really think the problem

11   here is the EEOC, rather than anybody else.

12                 MR. ROSE:     I think that's exactly right,

13   Your Honor.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It does, indeed, have this

15   form which says -- which says that its purpose --

16   information provided on this form will be used by

17   Commission employees to determine the existence of the

18   facts relevant to a decision as to whether the

19   Commission has jurisdiction and to provide such

20   precharge filing counseling, blah, blah, blah.

21                 All of that, however, is contained as part

22   of the Privacy Act statement.

23                 MR. ROSE:     Exactly.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           And if the filer is not

25   interested in keeping any of it confidential, I wouldn't

 1   even read the Privacy Act.

 2               MR. ROSE:      Well, she probably didn't, Your

 3   Honor.

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, what kind of an

 5   agency is this?

 6               (Laughter.)

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:            Suppose they made a mistake

 8   here.

 9               MR. ROSE:      I'm sorry, Your Honor?

10               JUSTICE BREYER:            What I think Miss Lensing,

11   one of her more basic points is this:                   There is a

12   statute.   And the statute says the EEOC shall send

13   prompt notice in part to the conciliation.                   And she

14   adds, if we get the notice, we also start getting

15   evidence and preserving it and talking to people.                      There

16   are a lot of things they would like to do with that

17   notice.

18               MR. ROSE:      Sure.

19               JUSTICE BREYER:            Now, I replied to that,

20   well, okay, they complain about the lack of notice.                     But

21   her response is, sure, they sometimes don't give notice

22   when they file a charge.         That's just a mistake.              But if

23   you start calling these documents charges, well, they

24   never give notice, so they will never do it.                   It will be

25   a big problem, so, therefore, don't call them charges.

 1                 Now, I want to know what your answer is to

 2   the first part of what I said.                My -- I was assuming

 3   that if the employer is really hurt, there is a statute

 4   and a rule and the statute and the rules say you have to

 5   give notice and if they are hurt by that, they can

 6   complain about it.

 7                 MR. ROSE:      Right.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:            But they must make mistakes

 9   in their history when they file charges and didn't give

10   notice.    So what does the law tell us?                  If you found it

11   any case ever where the EEOC didn't give the notice, now

12   the complainant files a lawsuit and it's not the

13   complainant's fault, her response is work out some kind

14   of equitable tolling.        But there must be law on this,

15   because this couldn't -- this is a big agency and they

16   must have sometimes in the past forgotten to give

17   notice.

18                 MR. ROSE:      Oh, it's --

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:            What does the law say

20   happens when they don't give notice?

21                 MR. ROSE:      I think the law says that it

22   could be a defense but it's an affirmative defense and

23   it's not --

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, it wouldn't be a

25   defense.    I mean, it's not this complainant's fault.

 1   It's the --

 2                 MR. ROSE:     Right.

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:           You'd have to work out some

 4   kind of equitable tolling or something.                    I think she's

 5   right about that.    There is no law to your knowledge or

 6   what is there?

 7                 MR. ROSE:     Well, I'd say the law is, Your

 8   Honor, what the regulation says.                The regulation was

 9   adopted in 1983 after notice published in the 1981

10   regulation says that any document that has, identifies

11   the employer, essentially respondent, and identifies the

12   nature, general nature of the charge and is signed is a

13   document.   By the way?

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Where does that appear?

15   Where does that appear?

16                 MR. ROSE:     It's in all the, it's in the

17   joint appendix, Your Honor.             It's toward the end of the

18   joint appendix.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                351?

20                 MR. ROSE:     That sounds right.              Yes.   It's

21   351 if you look on the 351, three, it says in the middle

22   there, in the middle of that dense paragraph, it says

23   that most clearly in six which is on 351.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           In its very definition of a

25   "charge," it says a charge shall be in writing and shall

 1   name the prospective respondent and shall generally --

 2   shall generally allege the discriminatory acts.                   That's

 3   what it must contain.

 4                 MR. ROSE:      Yes.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            It doesn't say that

 6   anything that contains that is a charge.

 7                 MR. ROSE:      Oh, I think it does.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I could write out something

 9   that contains all three of those things.                   Would that be

10   a charge?

11                 MR. ROSE:      Well, let me -- let me refer you

12   to the next page, then, Your Honor, which is --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            All right.       Let's try

14   something else.

15                 MR. ROSE:      -- which is (a) and (b).

16   "Notwithstanding the provisions of (a) of 8 above of

17   this section, a charge is sufficient when the Commission

18   receives from the person making the charge either a

19   written statement or information reduced to writing by

20   the Commission that conforms to the requirements of

21   1626," which I just read on page 351.

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I like my cite

23   better.     If you look at 1626.3 on page 351, it says:

24   'Charge' shall mean a statement filed with the

 1   which alleges that the main prospective defendant has

 2   engaged in, or is about to engage in, actions in

 3   violation" --

 4               MR. ROSE:      I like that one, too, Your Honor.

 5               (Laughter.)

 6               MR. ROSE:      It's the same thing.

 7               JUSTICE ALITO:          But if an employee files

 8   something like that and says I don't consent to

 9   notification of the employer, can that be a charge?

10               MR. ROSE:      I think that it -- it really

11   depends whether the employee has put on top of it -- I

12   think you need -- I think there is a -- we take the

13   position that if it meets the definition of 1626.3, or

14   the other parts of 1626, it is a charge.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, then, all intake

16   questionnaires are a charge, because they all contain

17   that.   I mean that definition is simply inconsistent

18   with the -- with the agency's assertion that it has

19   something called an intake questionnaire which does not

20   constitute a charge unless -- I don't know -- unless

21   there's manifest whatever it is.

22               That's inconsistent because all of those

23   intake questionnaires contain all of that information --

24               MR. ROSE:      Well, I think --

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- set forth in 26.3.

 1                MR. ROSE:     I think the last question was

 2   whether if -- if she checked the other box, it would be;

 3   and I think that there is no consistency on what EEOC

 4   has done in that situation.

 5                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, there may be none,

 6   but if the -- if the employee indicates by the box

 7   checked that the employee does not want the company to

 8   know that the employee is making whatever this is, this

 9   statement --

10                MR. ROSE:     Right.

11                JUSTICE SOUTER:           -- how can it be regarded

12   as a charge against the employer which sets in effect a

13   litigation process?

14                MR. ROSE:     Well, I think that's why the

15   better reading probably, as Your Honor suggests, is that

16   it's not a charge if that's all the form is, and she

17   checks only --

18                JUSTICE SOUTER:           But you're okay because on

19   that criterion your -- your client said, yes, you can

20   tell them?

21                MR. ROSE:     Absolutely.

22                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Okay.

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, Mr. Rose.

 1              ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

 2                         AS AMICUS CURIAE

 3                 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 4              MR. HEYTENS:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 5   please the Court:

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Mr. Heytens, let me tell

 7   you going in that my -- my main concern in this case,

 8   however the decision comes out, is to do something that

 9   will require the EEOC to get its act in order, because

10   this is nonsense:     These regulations that are

11   contradicted by forms; this failure to give notice, but

12   it's okay because it's a charge anyway.

13              This whole situation can be traceable back

14   to the agency, and I -- whoever ends up bearing the

15   burden of it, it's the agency's fault, and this scheme

16   has to be revised.

17              MR. HEYTENS:            The agency absolutely agrees

18   with that, Your Honor, and the agency has taken a number

19   of concrete steps, some of which we illustrate in our

20   brief, to deal with what in reality is a very serious

21   problem.

22              I think it is important to point out,

23   therefore, right at the start, that the problems that

24   arose in this case are in some measure -- not

25   exclusively but in some measure -- a reflection of when


                                         47

 1   it arose.

 2                 Ms.   Kennedy submitted her form in December

 3   of 2001.     That was before the Edelman litigation; and,

 4   most importantly, it was before the February 21st, 2002,

 5   memo that was issued in response to the Edelman

 6   litigation.

 7                 Now, some members of the Court may recall

 8   that one of the problems that surfaced at the time of

 9   Edelman was that the agency, or at least some of the

10   field offices of the agency, had a practice of not

11   serving notice until after they received a verified Form

12   5.   And the February 21st memo was to say that needs to

13   stop right now because our statutory obligations require

14   us to serve notice within 10 days of the charge.

15                 So that happened immediately following the

16   Edelman litigation, which was, regrettably, after this

17   case arose.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Excuse me.

19                 MR. HEYTENS:         Sure.

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's within 10 days of

21   the charge, but that assumes, it seems to me, what's to

22   be proven.    I mean what is the charge?

23                 MR. HEYTENS:         That's correct.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            If -- if the prefiling, the

25   intake thing, is not a charge, there is no problem.

 1              MR. HEYTENS:          That's correct, as well,

 2   Justice Scalia, and it's important that --

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Can you not make that not a

 4   charge by saying in bold letters on the top:            This is

 5   not a charge.   If you want a charge, ask for Form 5?

 6              MR. HEYTENS:          Two responses to that, Justice

 7   Scalia:

 8              First of all I think it's important to

 9   understand that, from our perspective, the test is an

10   objective intent test that looks to the intent of the

11   employee, not the intent of the EEOC in promulgating a

12   form.

13              And the reason that's important --

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why do the courts have to

15   struggle with this when the agency could put in bold

16   letters at the top:     This is a charge or this is not a

17   charge?

18              Why do Federal district judges have to

19   inquire into manifest intent from now until doomsday?

20              MR. HEYTENS:          The fundamental source of the

21   problem, Justice Scalia, is, as this Court has

22   recognized, the vast majority of people who initiate

23   EEOC proceedings are lay people who aren't familiar with

24   the statute.

25              And the other dilemma is that a great many

 1   of the initial contacts with the EEOC -- the EEOC, as we

 2   set forth in our brief, got 176,000 initial contacts in

 3   fiscal year 2006.     Of those, 32,000 of them came in by

 4   mail -- mail from lay people who have no --

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:            And the practical problem:

 6   I want to know where do I read what the definition of a

 7   "charge" is in the EEOC rules.                The three criteria that

 8   it has certain information in it can't be the rule.                      It

 9   can't be the rule because we already know that it isn't

10   a charge if the person says I don't want it to become

11   public.

12                 So, where do I read the rule that you just

13   said?     That it -- an intake questionnaire that satisfies

14   these three conditions becomes a charge if it reflects

15   the manifest intent of the person who files it that it

16   be a charge.

17                 You said that.          That's a pretty modestly

18   clear rule, except it isn't totally.                      And they qualify

19   -- where do I read that?

20                 MR. HEYTENS:         Certainly, Justice Breyer.

21   The definition of "charge" is the one the Chief Justice

22   cited.    It is in 1626.3 of the regulations, and that's

23   --

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:            We use the word there

25   "manifest intent"?

 1               MR. HEYTENS:           The word "manifest intent" is

 2   not set forth expressly there.

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:              Ah.     Well, I read those

 4   regs, and those regs had a definition that can't

 5   possibly be right as applied to "intake questionnaire,"

 6   because they make it a charge when the person says I

 7   don't want notice.      So we know that isn't the thing.

 8               I also know what you just said does sound

 9   like a rule.   I just want to know where to read it,

10   because I don't think you'd refer to a rule of an

11   agency, though normally we do -- but you don't refer to

12   a rule that doesn't exist; you don't refer to a rule

13   that nowhere can be found; you don't refer to a rule

14   that is internally inconsistent.                 So, before I defer, I

15   would just like to know where the clear rule that you

16   stated can be found.

17               MR. HEYTENS:           Just as a point of

18   clarification, Justice Breyer, the three requirements

19   that I believe you just referred to are in 1626.6, which

20   is the provision of the regulations labeled "Form of

21   Charges."

22               We are saying that it's in construction of

23   1626.3, the definition of "charge."                       Now, I concede that

24   the --

25               JUSTICE BREYER:              No, I just want to read it

 1   somewhere.

 2                MR. HEYTENS:         Sure.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:            So that if I were not here

 4   having you in front of me, as many people don't have you

 5   in front of them, where I would go to read just what you

 6   said.

 7                MR. HEYTENS:         Four places, Justice Breyer:

 8                First of all, you could go to the final rule

 9   as it was promulgated in 1983.               There was an issue that

10   came up when the agency promulgated the final rule that

11   the definition of "charge" versus the definition of

12   "complaint," both of which are defined terms in 1626.3,

13   was ambiguous and unclear.

14                And in the final rule at Volume 48 of the

15   Federal Register, page 138, the EEOC stated that one of

16   the distinctions between a charge and a complaint is

17   that a complaint is a way for the EEOC to receive

18   information about allegations of discrimination where

19   "the party providing the information does not wish to

20   file a charge."

21                That was in the final --

22                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Is a complaint different

23   from an intake questionnaire?

24                MR. HEYTENS:         In our view, yes, Justice

25   Ginsburg.    The complaint would include, in a typical


                                        52
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   case, an intake questionnaire, but a complaint is

 2   broader.   A complaint refers under the regulations to

 3   any way that the EEOC receives information about

 4   discrimination.

 5               The reason that's contained in the Age Act

 6   regulations is because, unlike Title VII, the EEOC

 7   doesn't need a formal charge in order to initiate its

 8   own proceedings.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Why should we defer

10   to an agency regulation when people in the agency hardly

11   ever follow it?

12               MR. HEYTENS:          Mr. Chief Justice, I think

13   it's not fair to say that people in the agency very

14   rarely follow it.     We would agree that in certain --

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, you didn't --

16   in this case you didn't treat it as a charge, because

17   you didn't give notice.

18               MR. HEYTENS:          It's true that in this case

19   the document was not docketed as a charge, and that's

20   true; we know that.      The problem is, because it arose

21   before Edelman and because it arose before the February

22   21st, 2002, memo, we simply don't know why it wasn't

23   treated as a charge.

24               JUSTICE BREYER:             But you said there were

25   going to be four places.          I want to write them down.

 1              MR. HEYTENS:         Yes.

 2              JUSTICE BREYER:            One is 48 Fed.       Reg.     148?

 3              MR. HEYTENS:         48 Federal Register 138,

 4   Justice Breyer.

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:            138.      Now, the other three.

 6              MR. HEYTENS:         Yes, Justice Breyer.

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Where is that in CFR?

 8              MR. HEYTENS:         It is not codified in the CFR.

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Oh, okay.

10              MR. HEYTENS:         The second place it is in

11   section 2.2 (b) of the compliance manual.                That language

12   has been contained since at least 1988, if not sooner,

13   and it's quoted on page 16 of our brief.                The third

14   place you would look is the February 21st, 2002 memo

15   which is on the EEOC's Web site.              And it's also in the

16   appendix to our brief, which directs use of the

17   compliance manual; and it's also the August 13th, 2007

18   memo, which is also attached to our brief, and what is

19   also contained on the agency's Web site.                So this is not

20   something --

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Do we give Chevron

22   deference to things like your internal compliance manual

23   and these other memos?

24              MR. HEYTENS:         We certainly do not assert,

25   Mr. Chief Justice, that the compliance manual gets


                                      54
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Chevron deference.      In our view, the compliance manual

 2   represents the agency's considered judgment about the

 3   proper interpretation of its regulations, and is thus

 4   entitled to deference under Auer.                  The Petitioners don't

 5   allege that our regulations don't get Chevron deference.

 6   The EEOC has clearly been given the authority to issue

 7   regulations dealing with this topic.

 8              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Under the --

 9              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Mr. Heytens, is it true

10   that the Form 5 for somebody who's not represented by

11   counsel is usually done by EEOC itself?                   Is it that

12   true?

13              MR. HEYTENS:            In situations where the Form 5

14   is filled out in the office, Justice Ginsburg, yes,

15   that's correct.    Sometimes people mail in modified Form

16   5, but official issues where it's done during the office

17   visit, my understanding is that the typical practice

18   it's filled out by the EEOC office.

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Mr. Heytens, what's your

20   solution for the situation where the EEOC treats it as a

21   charge, but doesn't give notice, which is what has

22   happened here?    How do you think that should play out?

23              MR. HEYTENS:            In situations where the

24   employer does not receive notice, Justice Scalia?

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:               That's right.

 1                MR. HEYTENS:        The first thing we think -- at

 2   that point, Justice Scalia, I think that task is to try

 3   to recreate as well as possible the situation that

 4   should have existed, and the Commission agrees notice

 5   should have been given.        So the first thing, as we say

 6   in our brief, the employer should be entitled to a stay

 7   of the litigation for up to 60 days to attempt to intent

 8   to work out, absent discovery requests, absent motions

 9   practices -- the problem -- Justice Scalia, you raised

10   the problem that at that point, the person probably has

11   a lawyer and you can't talk to him, but there's really

12   -- but I think that's conceptually a separate question,

13   for two reasons.   First, they might have had a lawyer

14   when they filed the charge, in which case the same

15   problem you discussed would arise; but the flip side is

16   it they could also be pro se after they filed a lawsuit,

17   in which case the ex parte bar wouldn't count either.

18   So I think it's conceptually, although I can see it's

19   probably related in practice, it's at least conceptually

20   different.

21                The second thing we think, and it's been

22   explored during the oral arguments so far, if the

23   employer could allege or show some concrete prejudice as

24   a result of not having received notice, then the

25   district court should take that into account.           But in


                                       56

 1   this case Federal Express has simply not alleged any

 2   concrete prejudice.

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, that's on the notice

 4   point.   Going back to the other, more important point,

 5   your words that I found quite useful are the "manifest

 6   intent," that shows a manifest -- are those words going

 7   to be in these four sources that I look up?

 8               MR. HEYTENS:         The precise words manifest?

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:            No.     I suspect not.

10               MR. HEYTENS:         Well, then --

11               JUSTICE BREYER:            Therefore -- I'm --

12               MR. HEYTENS:         Well, but I would say, Justice

13   Breyer, the word intend is in fact in the 1983 final

14   rule; it says where the person "does not intend to file"

15   --I apologize, Justice Breyer.              As I stand here, the

16   word is "wish," "does not wish to file a charge."

17               The language in the compliance manual which

18   is repeated in the memorandum is well, is it states that

19   you look at whether the submission constitutes a clear

20   request for the agency to act, which we think, though

21   not exactly the words manifest --

22               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Just to get one thing

23   perfectly clear in my mind, does that mean if the intake

24   questionnaire is checked not consent, that would not be

25   a charge?

 1                MR. HEYTENS:        Mr. Chief Justice, may I ask

 2   -- in our view that if she had checked the box saying do

 3   not disclose for identity, this would not have been a

 4   charge.   Thank you.

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

 6   Mr. Heytens.

 7                Miss Lensing, you have a minute left.

 8             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CONNIE L. LENSING,

 9                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10                MS. LENSING:        First of all, in this case the

11   affidavit attached to the intake questionnaire began --

12   and this is at Joint Appendix 266 -- with the statement,

13   "I have been assured of confidentiality by the EEOC."

14   So it is a confidentiality concern.

15                Congress determined that there must be an

16   opportunity for conciliation before a lawsuit was filed.

17   We never saw the numbers that are not in the record,

18   that were testified to today, but if 247 charges were

19   filed against FedEx, in that period of time we had 25

20   age discrimination cases.          So conciliation before a case

21   does work.   And I appreciate those numbers because it --

22   it just shows that we conciliate, we look into it, but

23   you can't do it once the lawsuit is filed.

24                The best rule obviously are the clear forms

25   that many of you have mentioned today.                  One can say it's


                                       58

 1   not a charge.     The other one can say it is a charge, and

 2   this could all be a situation where you'd have only rare

 3   occurrences where notice was not given.

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            How do we fix it?        You

 5   haven't gotten notice, you haven't had a chance to

 6   conciliate -- how do we fix it?

 7                 MS. LENSING:         Well, this particular case,

 8   she could -- may I answer?

 9                 She could have filed her lawsuit, she had a

10   charge.   She chose not to file a subsequent lawsuit 60

11   days later.     This lawsuit was properly dismissed.                    The

12   opportunity to file another lawsuit was there.                    She

13   didn't need equitable tolling because she caught it and

14   she filed a charge, indisputable, and we did get notice

15   of the charge in July.         I think it was filed the very

16   end of May; we got it in July.

17                 Thank you.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

19   Miss Lensing.

20                 The case is submitted.

21                 (Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the

22   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
