 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              We'll hear

 4   argument next in Case 08-1341, United States v. Marcus.

 6                   ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER

 7                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                  MR. MILLER:    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10                  The court of appeals erred in holding that

11   reversal of Respondent's conviction was appropriate on

12   plain error review if there was any possibility, no

13   matter how unlikely, that the jury's verdict was based

14   entirely on conduct predating the enactment of the

15   statute.

16                  Under Rule 52(b), a defendant asserting a

17   forfeited claim of error may prevail only by showing at

18   a minimum a reasonable possibility that the error

19   actually affected the outcome of the case.                In

20   particular, the fourth prong of the Olano plain error

21   test requires a defendant to show a serious effect on

22   the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial

23   proceedings.     That test calls for a case-specific,

24   fact-intensive inquiry, and the defendant cannot satisfy

25   it if there is no reasonable possibility that the error

                                       3

 1   affected the outcome.

 2               The decision of the court of appeals is

 3   inconsistent with this Court's cases applying prong four

 4   of the plain error test, Johnson, Cotton, and most

 5   recently Puckett from just last term.              Puckett

 6   established that the prong four inquiry is case-specific

 7   and fact-intensive and that a per se rule at prong four

 8   is inappropriate.     And that's exactly what the court of

 9   appeals adopted here, applying a per se rule that if

10   there's any possibility of prejudice, reversal is

11   required.

12               In addition, Johnson and Cotton made clear

13   that when the error is one that affects an issue on

14   which the evidence is overwhelming or essentially

15   uncontroverted, the defendant has not shown a serious

16   effect on the fairness, integrity, or public reputation

17   of judicial proceedings, and, indeed, reversal in that

18   context on the basis of a forfeited error that didn't

19   affect the outcome would undermine public confidence in

20   the judicial system.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Are there errors that

22   are -- that are so basic that they would call for an

23   automatic new trial?     You say this -- this is not such

24   a -- such an error.

25               MR. MILLER:       This Court has reserved the

                                       4

 1   question of whether, for example, a structural error

 2   would automatically satisfy the "affects substantial

 3   rights" component of the -- of prong three of the Olano

 4   test.

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          What do you mean by

 6   "structural"?

 7               MR. MILLER:     Well, the sort of error that,

 8   if properly preserved, would result in automatic

 9   reversal without an assessment of harmlessness.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Yes, but if you can be

11   concrete, other than a reasonable doubt charge, what

12   else would be structural?

13               MR. MILLER:     Well, I mean in Johnson, for

14   example, the Court had not yet decided Neder, and so in

15   Johnson it was unclear whether the omission of one

16   element, the failure to instruct the jury on one element

17   of the offense, was a structural error.          And in Johnson,

18   the Court said, even assuming that that's a structural

19   error and even assuming that, therefore, the defendant has

20   satisfied prong three, showing an effect on the

21   substantial rights, nonetheless the court of appeals has

22   to apply prong four and has to evaluate on the basis of

23   the record and the facts in that particular case whether

24   there was an effect on the fairness, integrity, and

25   public reputation of judicial proceedings.

                                    5

 1                And in that case, the Court said that there

 2   wasn't, because the evidence on the point that was the

 3   subject of the instructional error was overwhelming, and

 4   essentially uncontroverted.          And that's, in our view, the

 5   sort of analysis, the sort of case-specific assessment

 6   of the facts the court of appeals should have undertaken

 7   in this case.

 8                The effect of the decision below is

 9   essentially to carve out a special rule of plain error

10   review that's applicable only to a particular kind of

11   error; namely --

12                JUSTICE ALITO:         Can I ask you this?   Prong

13   three of -- of Olano looks to prejudice, right?           And

14   then it's your position that prong four also looks to

15   prejudice?   Where you have two prejudice inquiries, one

16   is more searching than the other, perhaps?

17                How do they fit together in that relation --

18   in that regard?

19                MR. MILLER:    Well, that's -- that's right.

20   We think that prong three in the case of a

21   constitutional error requires at least a reasonable

22   possibility of prejudice, and prong four I think demands

23   at least that much and, in some cases, may demand more.

24                One example of a case where a defendant

25   could satisfy prong three but not prong four would be,

                                     6

 1   for example, a Melendez-Diaz kind of error.           If you had

 2   a drug possession case where the only evidence that the

 3   substance the defendant possessed was cocaine was a

 4   laboratory certificate admitted without confrontation,

 5   that would be a plain error under Melendez-Diaz, and

 6   that would -- the defendant would be able to show an

 7   effect on his substantial rights, because if that was

 8   the only piece of evidence, he would have been entitled

 9   to a directed verdict without it.           Nonetheless --

10               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Under three.

11               MR. MILLER:     Under prong three.        But looking

12   at prong four, the Court would say -- I mean, if, for

13   example, the defendant had had an opportunity to subpoena

14   the chemist, if he hadn't controverted the accuracy of the

15   report, there would be no basis for concluding on those

16   facts that there was a serious effect on the fairness or

17   integrity or reputation of the proceedings.

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You answered Justice Alito

19   by saying there are cases in which your inquiry is more

20   searching, more demanding, under four.           It might also be

21   the other way around.     I mean, if you satisfy -- if,

22   under three, you find that it hasn't affected the

23   outcome, then I don't know where you'd go under four.

24               MR. MILLER:     If, under three, the defendant

25   fails, then you don't need to apply prong four, because

                                    7

 1   prong four -- prong four is essentially an

 2   implementation of the discretion conferred by the word --

 3                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:          Yes.

 4                  MR. MILLER:     -- "may" in Rule 52(b).          In

 5   order for the court to have any authority to correct

 6   a plain error, it must be one that affects substantial

 7   rights.    So --

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.     There -- there is an

 9   overlap.

10                 MR. MILLER:    There is some overlap in the

11   inquiries, but we think that, you know, as the Court

12   made clear in Puckett, rule four requires a

13   fact-intensive, case-specific inquiry.

14                 JUSTICE ALITO:         So under -- under three, the

15   court could conclude that the defendant has shown that

16   it isn't clear beyond a reasonable doubt, for a

17   constitutional error, that the error didn't affect the

18   outcome, so the defendant would clear prong three, but

19   in prong four, a defendant might still lose if it's

20   fairly clear, but not beyond a reasonable doubt that --

21   is that -- that how it would work?

22                 MR. MILLER:    Or if, you know, as in the --

23   my Melendez-Diaz example, or if the nature of the evidence

24   in the case shows that, you know, apart from the effect

25   on the defendant's rights of that particular error, that

                                      8

 1   error, in the context of the case, doesn't undermine

 2   public confidence in the outcome.

 3                What the court of appeals did here was to

 4   create a special rule applicable only to those errors

 5   involving the failure to instruct the jury that they may

 6   not convict solely on pre-enactment evidence.             The court

 7   didn't give any reason why those errors should be

 8   treated differently from other kinds of errors.

 9   Instead, it was simply applying a line of circuit

10   precedent that went back to cases predating Olano.

11                And there is no reason for creating a

12   special rule in that context.             To the contrary, Johnson

13   emphatically rejected the proposition that there are

14   errors that are not subject to Rule 52(b) analysis.             And

15   the Court said that even errors implicating fundamental

16   constitutional rights like the Sixth Amendment -- Sixth

17   Amendment right to trial by jury in Johnson or the Fifth

18   Amendment right to a grand jury in Cotton are also

19   subject to the application --

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:          You don't want us to do it,

21   right?   You want us to remand it so that they can do it,

22   right?   Is that --

23                MR. MILLER:      This Court's usual practice

24   when there's an issue that wasn't passed upon below is

25   to leave it to be considered on remand.             We think that's

                                       9

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   particularly appropriate because of the fact- and

 2   record-intensive nature of the argument in this case.

 3                So, if the Court does reach that issue, we

 4   would urge the Court to adopt the analysis of the

 5   concurring judges below, who said that, with respect to

 6   the forced labor conviction, Respondent's conduct in the

 7   pre-enactment and post-enactment periods were

 8   essentially identical, such that there is no basis in

 9   the record on which a rational jury could have concluded

10   that he violated the statute in the pre-enactment

11   period --

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           The point may be

13   tangential, but if both counsel were aware of the date

14   problem, that 2001 was the enactment of the statute, and

15   the jury was later properly instructed, do you think

16   that the government would find it important to introduce

17   the evidence of the pre-enactment conduct, just to set

18   forth scheme, plan, design, purpose, to tell the jury

19   the story?

20                MR. MILLER:    Indeed, it would.         In order to

21   establish a violation of the forced-labor statute, the

22   government had to show that Respondent had obtained

23   labor services by threats of serious harm or by a

24   scheme, pattern, or plan intended to cause the victim to

25   believe that she would suffer serious harm.

                                    10

                                  Official


 1               And so, in this case, there was essentially a

 2   uniform course of conduct of the Respondent obtaining

 3   labor services, making threats of harm, and, indeed,

 4   brutally carrying out those threats.             And so the

 5   pre-enactment threats and pre-enactment acts carrying

 6   out the threats would certainly be relevant to show that

 7   the post-enactment threats were indeed genuine threats

 8   and that the victim could take them seriously as

 9   threats, and that they did indeed induce her to provide

10   the labor or services.

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What about the argument

12   that was made that in the pre-enactment period the

13   Web site was created, and that's when the -- that was the

14   really hard labor, as compared to just keeping it up to

15   date?

16               MR. MILLER:     Well, there -- I mean, the

17   statute refers to "labor or services."            And creating a

18   Web site is a kind of labor or service, and maintaining a

19   Web site is also a kind of labor or service.            And

20   there's -- as the concurring judges in the court of

21   appeals noted, there's no basis on which the jury could

22   have concluded that one satisfies the statute but the

23   other does not.   They're both -- they both fall

24   comfortably within the ordinary meaning --

25               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Miller, can I ask you

                                    11

 1   this question?    We are construing Rule 52(b) here, not --

 2   as construed in Olano, which has developed the four

 3   factors.

 4                 In your view, does the character of the

 5   violation, in this case an ex post facto violation, does

 6   that ever make a difference?             Could a court ever think

 7   that one kind of constitutional violation is a little

 8   bit more serious than another, or are they all fungible?

 9                 MR. MILLER:    I think in Johnson the Court

10   quite clearly said that even very serious constitutional

11   errors are subject to the same analysis under

12   Rule 52(b).   And certainly there's --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well -- well, but the same

14   constitutional analysis includes step four, which is

15   whether it undermines confidence in the result.              And

16   don't you think that some constitutional violations more

17   undermine confidence than others?

18                 MR. MILLER:    Absolutely.          And the test that

19   would be applied would be the same, but the result of

20   that test might be different.             For example, if the --

21                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Would it not also be

22   possible that some constitutional violations undermine

23   confidence a little more than others?

24                 MR. MILLER:    Yes.         I mean, if the error were,

25   for example, a biased judge -- I mean, that would be one

                                     12

 1   that would almost invariably undermine confidence in

 2   the integrity of the proceedings.

 3                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           Then why is the Second

 4   Circuit so wrong to say:        We think ex post facto

 5   violations are perhaps a little more serious than some

 6   others.

 7                  MR. MILLER:    Well, because the error, the

 8   essential error in this case, was the failure to give

 9   the jury an instruction telling them that they could not

10   convict on the basis of pre-enactment conduct.              And that

11   is essentially analogous to the error that you had in

12   Johnson, where there was a failure to give the jury an

13   instruction telling them that they had to find

14   materiality.     And there --

15                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           Are all omissions in jury

16   instructions fungible, then?              I'm -- here we have an

17   omission in a jury instruction relating to the Ex Post

18   Facto Clause.     Does -- the fact that it relates to the

19   Ex Post Facto Clause doesn't give it any extra weight or

20   any lesser weight in the analysis?

21                  MR. MILLER:    I think in the context of an

22   error like this, there isn't any reason to attach extra

23   weight --

24                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        I suppose if the

25   instruction told the jury in a criminal case that you

 1   can find the defendant guilty if you think it more

 2   likely than not that he committed the crime, that might

 3   be different, don't you think?

 4                MR. MILLER:     Yes.        That very well might be

 5   different.   That's right.

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Do you agree that this is

 7   ex post facto, as opposed to a general due process

 8   violation?

 9                MR. MILLER:     No.        I mean -- that's right.

10   The Ex Post Facto Clause regulates the content of the

11   laws that Congress can pass, and there would be an ex

12   post facto issue in the case if Congress had tried to

13   make section 1589 retroactive, but it didn't.            And

14   everyone agrees that section 1589 applies only

15   prospectively.

16                So the constitutional violation, if there is

17   one, comes from the possibility that the defendant could

18   have been convicted on the basis of Congress -- of

19   conduct that did not violate the statute.

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, you -- you agree

21   that there is a violation?

22                MR. MILLER:     There is a violation in the

23   failure to instruct.   And we think it's the

24   Due Process Clause that is the source of the requirement

25   that the defendant not be convicted on the basis of the

                                    14

 6            ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERALD PRICE FAHRINGER

 7                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 8               MR. FAHRINGER:        Mr. Chief Justice, and if it

 9   please the Court:

10               We do believe there are errors that are so

11   basic that they require a reversal automatically.               And

12   certainly one of them is trying a person for conduct for

13   2 years that violated no law.            It's almost

14   unimaginable and it's unheard of.            There are very few

15   cases that even come close to resembling --

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, except that I think

17   most trial judges would have admitted this evidence with

18   the proper instruction to the jury, that it's background

19   evidence so you -- you can't tell the jury the story and

20   just begin in 2001, or it doesn't make much sense to

21   them.

22               MR. FAHRINGER:        That's --

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Now, I agree there was not

24   a proper instruction here, there should have been an

25   objection, and so forth.      But in an ordinary trial, this

                                    15

 1   evidence would have come in with the proper limiting

 2   instruction.

 3                  MR. FAHRINGER:       What's so important about

 4   that, if it please Your Honor, is that he couldn't have

 5   been convicted on that evidence.             The court would have

 6   instructed that this evidence was received --

 7                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Of -- of -- of course, the

 8   jury would have to be instructed very carefully.

 9                  MR. FAHRINGER:       But here, Your Honor, all

10   this evidence came in, and he could be convicted and was

11   convicted on the -- what we lend -- we think lends an

12   awful lot of force to our argument here is that the

13   government has conceded that he could have been

14   convicted exclusively on the pre-enactment conduct

15   alone.   That that was --

16                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Convicted, but not --

17   there was a possibility, but not a reasonable

18   possibility.     That is, it's conceivable, but the

19   government also is urging the reasonable

20   possibility that it is not likely, given the character of

21   the evidence in the post-enactment period.

22                  MR. FAHRINGER:       Well, Your Honor, I

23   understand that, but I certainly -- I'd like to say

24   first, in terms of the concession that was made here, you

25   are talking about 2 years of conduct that came into a

 1   trial that is really quite extraordinary and terribly

 2   dynamic.

 3                 The one -- last third of that, Your Honor, I

 4   think cannot -- even though it came post-statute, it

 5   cannot be used to legitimatize that first 2 years.

 6   And -- and the jury heard all of it, and -- and as a

 7   matter of fact, what we attach a great deal of importance

 8   to, the last question the jury asked of the judge:              We

 9   want to know what constitutes labor.

10                 And they put in their note the -- the

11   largest task of all, the building and the designing of

12   the Web site and then maintaining it.              And that was all

13   pre-enactment; the threats were all pre-enactment.

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And this was a long -- a

15   long jury deliberation.

16                 MR. FAHRINGER:        It was out for 7 days,

17   Your Honor.     Seven days the jury deliberated over this

18   case.

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Justice Kennedy suggested

20   that, even though the conduct was pre-enactment, it

21   would have come in to show pattern, scheme.              So it's one

22   -- one thing is to say the evidence, the jury would not

23   have seen that evidence, would not have heard the

24   evidence, and another to say the judge should have

25   charged them:    Now, you cannot use this evidence that

                                      17

 1   you've heard for another purpose.            You cannot use it to

 2   determine his guilt or innocence.

 3                MR. FAHRINGER:       But -- but, Your Honor, I

 4   wanted to mention to the Court, of course, Rule 403 that

 5   says that if the prejudice of the evidence outweighs the

 6   probative value.   I think if we could take ourselves

 7   back to that trial court and a lawyer stood up and said,

 8   Your Honor, we want to put in 2 years of background

 9   evidence, I -- I think there's a good likelihood that

10   it would have been excluded.            I don't think you can

11   say --

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, you can be pleased

13   that I was not the trial judge.

14                (Laughter.)

15                MR. FAHRINGER:       Sorry to hear that, Your

16   Honor.

17                But in the -- in the course of taking in

18   some evidence as background, I don't think it's ever

19   been of this magnitude in a unique case where the

20   evidence that's coming in bears directly on the

21   liability.   And I think the -- the question is terribly

22   important because, obviously, it shows the jury was

23   focused on the pre-enactment conduct, even with the

24   forced labor.

25                JUSTICE ALITO:       Does the --

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:           I assume you could make all

 2   that argument on remand, if we remand it.           But what's

 3   your argument -- apparently from what I've read in this

 4   case, the Second Circuit uses a standard of plain error

 5   that nobody else uses.

 6               MR. FAHRINGER:          Well --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:           And it says that all the other

 8   circuits say:     This is our set of standards, and we've

 9   set them forth.     And the Second Circuit says:        No, it's

10   -- you have to have a new trial if there's any

11   possibility, no matter how unlikely.

12               MR. FAHRINGER:          Well --

13               JUSTICE BREYER:           Now, nobody else uses that.

14   It seems contrary to our cases, and is there any

15   justification for their using it?

16               MR. FAHRINGER:          Yes.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:           Because unless I can hear a

18   justification, I would guess I would vote to say send it

19   back and let them use the same standard anybody else

20   does.

21               MR. FAHRINGER:          Well, one point you make,

22   Your Honor, that I --

23               JUSTICE BREYER:           What's your response to

24   that?

25               MR. FAHRINGER:          It's certainly welcome, and

 1   that is that we are seeking a retrial here.             You know,

 2   you speak in just genuine fairness that -- that the

 3   gentleman can be tried on that conduct that was

 4   post-enactment.

 5               But in response to Your Honor's question, I

 6   think, Your Honor, the -- the -- the difficulty is, in

 7   this whole case is, it all ran together in front of the

 8   jury, and they saw all of this proof with no

 9   instruction, with no demarcation, and -- and the --

10   the mere weight, the volume of the 2 years out in

11   front of that had to have a --

12               JUSTICE BREYER:           So why don't you make

13   the --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Address the test used by

15   the Second Circuit.     That's what we're concerned about.

16               MR. FAHRINGER:          Oh, I'm sorry.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:           And that's what the

18   question pertained to.       They're using a test nobody

19   else used, that does not comport with -- with our prior

20   opinions.   Why shouldn't we send it back and tell them,

21   you know, use the right test?

22               MR. FAHRINGER:          Your Honor, I think -- and I

23   choose my words carefully -- I think that this test

24   under this circumstance was justified.             When the court

25   saw the magnitude of the error here, they had to say if

                                      20

 1   there was any possibility that the jury

 2   relied exclusively --

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:        The very magnitude of

 4   the error would argue for -- you'd win on any test.

 5   I mean, why does that say you have to use a special test

 6   that is specially designed to find when there is hardly

 7   any error?   Here there's such a bigger error,

 8   according -- that you think that you would have won

 9   under any test.

10                So that -- so why -- why do you do have to

11   have this special favorable test?            That's -- that's the

12   question that I'm thinking of.            I'm not thinking of

13   whether you are right or whether you are wrong on the --

14   how much evidence there was and how awful it was.

15                MR. FAHRINGER:       I think -- to answer Your

16   Honor's question, which is a -- an incisive one, and

17   that is because, Your Honor, it's only -- the court made

18   it very clear, we're only applying this test to ex post

19   facto, and I think in this instance you are right, the

20   magnitude of the error prompted them to say that if

21   there was any possibility that this 2 years of conduct

22   -- the jury could have based their verdict

23   exclusively on that, we think we had to be granted a new

24   trial.

25                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Mr. -- may I ask this

 1   question about the -- I -- I should know this, but I

 2   don't.   To what extent has the regular test that my

 3   colleagues referred to applied in ex post facto cases in

 4   other circuits?

 5               MR. FAHRINGER:        The -- the Olano test, Your

 8               MR. FAHRINGER:        Well, the possibility test has

 9   been used in the Third Circuit in the Tykarsky case.              It

10   has also been used in several States --

11               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Were those ex post --

12               MR. FAHRINGER:        -- Georgia being one.

13               JUSTICE STEVENS:            -- ex post facto cases?

14               MR. FAHRINGER:        Yes.      Yes, Your Honor.

15   And --

16               JUSTICE STEVENS:            So that it isn't

17   necessarily a conflict between this case and all other

18   plain error cases; it's a narrow category of cases

19   involving ex post facto violations?

20               MR. FAHRINGER:        In the -- in this very

21   narrow category, Your Honor.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, you call it an ex

23   post facto violation, but I -- I -- I rather agree with

24   the government; it's a due process violation.

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:         -- what happened is

 2   improper evidence was admitted, because it concerned pre-

 3   -- pre-statute conduct.     But it might have been evidence

 4   that was -- that was irrelevant for some other reason.

 5   That would be just as much of a -- a due process violation.

 6               What is special about the fact that the

 7   reason the evidence before the jury was incorrect was

 8   that it -- the conduct occurred before the -- before the

 9   statute?

10               MR. FAHRINGER:        Your Honor, as I know, you

11   are aware of the Marks case.            They held that the ex post

12   facto concept applied to judicial precedent as well, and

13   that was repeated in the Harris case in -- as well.            But

14   I think, Your Honor, certainly the whole strength and --

15   and weight of the ex post facto law is present here.

16   The Second Circuit said that it certainly involves ex

17   post facto implications.      What you are doing is, you're

18   taking conduct that violates no law before the law is

19   passed, and you're taking --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:         And when a State court

21   allows pre-law conduct to uphold a conviction, that is an

22   ex post facto violation, and we would reverse the State

23   court judgment.   But that's not what occurred here.

24   What occurred here is that the trial court let the jury

25   consider evidence, as evidence bearing upon conviction,

                                    23

 1   which it should not have let the jury consider.

 2                And there's a lot of evidence that a court

 3   should not have let the jury consider.             I don't see

 4   anything particularly special about fact that the reason

 5   this evidence shouldn't have been before the jury was

 6   that it occurred before the statute.

 7                JUSTICE STEVENS:            But it not only allowed

 8   the evidence before the jury, but it also told the jury

 9   it was sufficient to convict.

10                MR. FAHRINGER:        Your Honor, that's right.

11   It -- it -- what is special about it is -- I think it's an

12   extremely rare and irregular case that would allow 2

13   years of conduct to come into a case --

14                JUSTICE ALITO:        What if the -- what if the

15   period -- the -- the period that was charged started 1

16   day before the statute took effect?

17                MR. FAHRINGER:        Well, if it was -- Your

18   Honor, my stand --

19                JUSTICE ALITO:        Would -- would the test

20   be different?   Now, if you have 1 day of pre-enactment

21   conduct, it's possible that the jury could convict based

22   on that -- the evidence relating to that 1 day, isn't

23   it?   And so, therefore, if the test is any possibility,

24   the result is automatic new trial in that situation.

25   Is -- is that where your argument leads?

 1                  MR. FAHRINGER:       My argument is, Your Honor,

 2   that no person in this country under our Constitution

 3   should be tried for 1 day on conduct that did not

 4   violate a law.     I -- I --

 5                  JUSTICE BREYER:        That's true.       And also no

 6   person should be convicted with a confession that was

 7   coerced.     And no person should be convicted with

 8   evidence given under torture.             And no person should be

 9   convicted with evidence unlawfully seized by the police.

10                  Now, for all those latter things, every

11   court apparently uses the normal standard.                So why would

12   we in this case use a special standard?

13                  MR. FAHRINGER:       Well, it's different, Your

14   Honor.     In all of those cases, there was a law, at least

15   giving the court jurisdiction, that was violated.                 There's

16   a very serious question here whether there was

17   jurisdiction when they came in.             Jurisdiction is derived

18   solely through statutes that are violated in the

19   criminal field.

20                  There were no statutes.             So there's a

21   serious question of whether there was even jurisdiction.

22   But -- but what's different is it seems to me if you

23   have a law, a mail fraud law, and then there is some sort

24   of a violation and a -- a suppression of evidence or

25   whatever other arguments you're going to make,

                                      25

 1   that's -- that's light years away from a situation where

 2   there's absolutely no law to -- to violate.         And the

 3   conduct --

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:        And -- and,

 5   therefore, no violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.

 6                MR. FAHRINGER:       I beg your pardon.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:        There's also no violation

 8   of the Ex Post Facto Clause, which is in Article I of

 9   the Constitution and which says no ex post facto Law

10   shall be passed.

11                MR. FAHRINGER:       But, Your Honor --

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:        You don't have -- you don't

13   have an ex post facto law that was passed here.

14                You have an incorrect jury charge.        You have

15   the judge telling the jury that you could convict on the

16   basis of this prior conduct when, in fact, you couldn't.

17   That is not an ex post facto law.

18                MR. FAHRINGER:       But, Your Honor, I -- I --

19   in all due respect, I invite your attention to your

20   case in Marks and -- and the Harris case where they have

21   said that we have extended ex post facto to obviously

22   a -- a whole host of cases now that involve judicial

23   precedent and -- and the actions of prosecutors

24   and what not.

25                This, I can't imagine in a way in terms of

                                    26

 1   the concept of ex post facto to put in 2 years of

 2   conduct that is not in violation of any law, that

 3   certainly fits within the presiding spirit of the ex

 4   post facto concept that people shouldn't -- you know, if

 5   you want to go back to our very basics, and that's what

 6   unique about this case, the entitlement to notice of

 7   what conduct is to be avoided, a statute that tells you

 8   what conduct you have to avoid, and all those --

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:           I'm looking for Marks, where

10   is that in -- is that in your brief somewhere?

11               MR. FAHRINGER:          Beg your pardon, Your Honor.

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:           You have mentioned several

13   times the Marks case.      What case is --

14               MR. FAHRINGER:          M-A-R-K-S.

16               MR. FAHRINGER:          That's in -- in our --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Is it in your brief?

18               MR. FAHRINGER:          I -- I believe it was cited

19   in our brief, Your Honor.         I will give you that in just

20   a moment, if I may.     But -- but I'm under the

21   impression, Your Honor, from our research that there

22   were a number of cases --

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:           I mean, see, I don't know

24   what that case is.    If it was a case in which we

25   reversed a State supreme court because the State supreme

 1   court upheld the State statute that -- you know, that

 2   made prior conduct unlawful, then I -- I think I could

 3   say that was an ex post facto violation through the

 4   Fourteenth Amendment.

 5                MR. FAHRINGER:       I think this comment is

 6   relevant to what you just said.           Our forefathers in --

 7   in imposing an Ex Post Facto Clause -- it's one of the

 8   few that they imposed on the States as well as the

 9   Federal Government, and I think that lends it force in a

10   sense that the States have an Ex Post Facto Clause as

11   does the Federal Government.

12                But we feel, under all those circumstances

13   here, what -- all roads lead back to one very, very

14   critical fact, and that is the enormity of the error

15   here at being a -- a constitutional error, and we

16   certainly think a structural error, structural error in

17   the sense that it ran from the beginning of the case.             The

18   grand jury should not have indicted on conduct that

19   violated no law.   He should not have been arraigned.             He

20   should not have been tried.         He should not have

21   convicted.   He should not have been considered.          All of

22   this --

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          What is your position

24   that two concurring judges said that evidence should not

25   have been -- not that it shouldn't have come in, but the

                                    28

 1   jury should have been told you can convict only on

 2   post -- whatever the date was?            But they also pointed

 3   out that one of the most severe incidents fell in the

 4   post-enactment period.       It was in April of 2001.             It

 5   was -- and that was vivid evidence properly --

 6   properly used by the jury to determine guilt or

 7   innocence.

 8                  MR. FAHRINGER:       I -- I understand that, and

 9   I think I know what you are referring to, Your Honor.

10   I find much of the evidence in this case extremely

11   distasteful, but we are operating under a land of laws

12   and Constitution.     And it seems to me his rights are as

13   important -- I know this Court appreciates that -- as

14   any other person's.

15                  And the truth of the matter is that much of

16   this very unattractive evidence came in before the law

17   was ever enacted.     And I think what happens is -- and this

18   is a reality psychologically -- it all blends together, it

19   all comes together.     And without any kind of

20   instruction.     I -- my view would be, under ex post facto

21   principles, it would have ordinarily been excluded.                    It

22   wouldn't have been brought in.

23                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Okay.        This -- this

24   evidence was improper because if the legislature had

25   made that action punishable when it occurred before the

                                      29

 1   statute was enacted, that would have been a violation of

 2   the Ex Post Facto Clause.         Now, in fact, the legislature

 3   didn't do that, and, therefore, we have no real violation

 4   of the Ex Post Facto Clause.              But we do have the

 5   admission of evidence that shouldn't have been admitted,

 6   which is no different from evidence that should have not

 7   been admitted for some other reason.

 8                  For example, where the -- where the court

 9   gives an instruction that permits evidence to be

10   considered as evidence of the crime which, in fact, is

11   irrelevant to the crime.        And the jury says you can

12   find him guilty if you find that he held two fingers up

13   in the air, when, in fact, that has nothing to do with

14   the crime.

15                  Why is this any different from that?            It's

16   just evidence that the jury should not have been allowed

17   to use for conviction.       I don't see why there is

18   anything special about the fact that the reason it

19   shouldn't be used for conviction --

20                  MR. FAHRINGER:       In all due --

21                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- is because it occurred

22   pre-statute.

23                  MR. FAHRINGER:       In all due respect, Your

24   Honor, I believe the cases and Supreme Court cases have

25   held that the ex post facto law has been extended to

                                      30

 1   judicial precedent.     And we cite those cases, Your

 2   Honor, in our brief.

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, I -- I thought

 4   what we have said that it's just a violation of due

 5   process to convict someone for conduct that was not

 6   criminal when the conduct was -- was made.                 It's --

 7   it's -- it's just a due process -- it's a due process

 8   violation.   It just -- it's a serious due process

 9   violation.

10                MR. FAHRINGER:         I think you're right, Your

11   Honor, in the sense that it's an ex post facto law being

12   applied through the Due Process Clause.                 But the impact and

13   the force of that, I think, is still just as great and

14   just as powerful.   And -- and -- and the error here

15   factually is -- is absolutely enormous.

16                And -- and what I think the very least a

17   defendant in his position is entitled to is -- he's

18   suffering under a 9-year sentence.                 I think he is

19   entitled to have another trial where he is only confronted

20   with the evidence that came after the statute.                 And if

21   they're going to put in evidence that goes before that,

22   they would have to justify that under one of a number of

23   different concepts, Rule 404(b) or one of the others.

24                And we would argue in that context -- none of

25   this was ever done in court -- under 403, if it was too

                                      31

 1   extensive, the prejudice outweighs the probative value.

 2   And I think that many judges would be sympathetic to

 3   that, for putting in a whole 2 years of conduct.              Some

 4   might come in --

 5                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Courtesy -- courtesy of

 6   Justice Kennedy, I have -- I have before me the Marks

 7   case.   And the -- the summary of the case at the

 8   beginning says:     "Petitioners were convicted of

 9   transporting obscene materials in violation of the

10   Federal statute."     "Held:      The Due Process Clause of the

11   Fifth Amendment precludes retroactive application to

12   petitioners of the Miller standards."

13                  It was a due process case.

14                  MR. FAHRINGER:       And the only thing that I would

15   think of immediately of that is, is the statute here.                He

16   was -- there's no question the -- the -- the conduct

17   was forbidden by statutes in -- in time, but was applied

18   in advance of those statutes, before --

19                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        And, therefore, the Due

20   Process Clause was violated when the court let that in.

21                  MR. FAHRINGER:       I don't have a quarrel with

22   you on that.

23                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        So you -- you have to

24   persuade us that there is something special about a

25   violation of the Due Process Clause that lets in

                                      32

 1   evidence which is pre-statute, as opposed to violations

 2   that let in other evidence that should not properly be

 3   used to convict the defendant.            And I frankly don't --

 4   don't see why it's so special.

 5               MR. FAHRINGER:          Your Honor, I'm endeavoring

 6   to pursue it, but somewhat unsuccessfully.

 7               This is not an evidentiary error.             It is in

 8   every sense a due -- an ex post facto error, but it is

 9   through the Due Process Clause.             I think that there we

10   meet on common ground.       It's through the Due Process

11   Clause that the Ex Post Facto Clause is made -- made

12   effective in trial.     But the truth of the matter is -- I

13   mean, the indictment here, which you start with, charged

14   these crimes going all the way back to January of 1999,

15   when the Act didn't come -- didn't become effective

16   until October of 2000.

17               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, what if the conduct

18   that -- we didn't have -- what if we did not

19   have pre-enactment conduct?           What if we -- if this

20   statute applies only within the United States, as I

21   assume that it does, and all of the conduct that's now

22   pre-enactment was conduct that took place outside the

23   United States?   Would that -- would the case be

24   different for these purposes?

25               MR. FAHRINGER:          If all the conduct that was

 2               JUSTICE ALITO:          Instead of having

 3   pre-enactment conduct, you have conduct in Canada,

 4   Mexico, someplace else.

 5               MR. FAHRINGER:          I -- I think it would --

 6               JUSTICE STEVENS:              And the jury was

 7   instructed that he could be convicted on the basis of

 8   what had happened in Canada.              That would be the same?

 9               MR. FAHRINGER:          Yes, that's right.       And I --

10   all I'm suggesting is, wherever the evidence comes from,

11   it shouldn't be admitted except under one of the very

12   narrow exceptions, such as Rule 404(b).              And we would

13   argue, under 403, it should be excluded, wherever the

14   evidence came from.     And a judge would -- as I

15   understand it, a judge would instruct the jury:              You

16   cannot convict Mr. Marcus on any of this evidence

17   whatsoever that is pre-enactment.

18               JUSTICE ALITO:          No, of course, but the

19   question is whether the mere possibility standard would

20   apply in that case as well, or whether you think this

21   mere possibility standard applies only in the case of

22   pre-enactment conduct?

23               MR. FAHRINGER:          I think the possibility

24   standard only applies to ex post facto statute

25   cases and pre-enactment conduct.              That's my view, Your

 1   Honor.     I think it's a very narrow holding.          And I'm

 2   not urging that this would be the standard for other --

 3   other than ex post facto cases, and I'm not urging this

 4   would be the standard in ex post facto cases where --

 5   what this does, Your Honor, if you stop and think about

 6   it, it is, in a sense, a bright-line rule.

 7                 What has gone on in the past is we have to

 8   measure.    We have to take, on the one hand, the post-

 9   enactment conduct, and we take, on the other hand, the

10   pre-enactment conduct, and we go through this, what I

11   -- I'm of a generation -- I remember Betts v. Brady before

12   Gideon came down, and it was always a constant citing in

13   that context whether a person got able representation

14   until you decided the Gideon case, Gideon v. Wainwright.

15                 Aren't we in the same position here?

16   Wouldn't it be better to have a rule that said, where

17   clearly you shouldn't be bringing in pre-enactment

18   conduct anyway, if you bring in pre-enactment conduct

19   and there is any possibility that the jury convicted on

20   that, there will be a new trial?             It seems that's going

21   to avoid all of that balancing and weighing and

22   perennial -- perennial appellate review.             That's what I

23   think is -- is commendable about the Second Circuit's

24   decision.    I think that's where there is a great deal of

25   sense behind it.

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           So your position is,

 2   essentially, plain error doesn't apply in this area;

 3   it's just error because it involved evidence

 4   pre-enactment?    That error is enough; it doesn't have to

 5   meet --

 6                 MR. FAHRINGER:       I'm sorry, Your Honor.

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           It doesn't have to meet

 8   the standard for plain error?

 9                 MR. FAHRINGER:       Yes, absolutely.         And this

10   doesn't affect that whatsoever.             I mean, I think there's

11   a misconception among some people.                We -- the Second

12   Circuit took the four Olano factors and applied

13   them, one, two, three, four.             They didn't touch them.

14   They didn't in any way alter them.

15                 What they did is, on the concept and the

16   rule governing ex post facto adjudications, that was

17   purely substantive, but the any possibility doesn't

18   apply to plain error.     Those four prongs have been left

19   intact.   And so they haven't disturbed that in any way

20   whatsoever.    They set those four prongs out in the

21   preamble of their opinion.         Obviously, what they found

22   was, when you have a case of this magnitude of

23   pre-enactment conduct of 2 years, they felt that that

24   certainly affected the fairness and the integrity of the

25   trial and the judicial reputation.

 7   conduct that violated the statute, and not on conduct

 8   that violated no law, would enhance the reputation of

 9   the courts.

10                  So applying that factor, we feel strongly

11   and powerfully that the correct disposition here is to

12   affirm the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.                 And

13   we will go back and we will have a retrial on the conduct

14   that violated the statute.

15                  If you have no other questions, I -- I thank

16   you for your attention.

17                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you,

18   Mr. Fahringer.

19                  Mr. Miller, you have 16 minutes.

20                 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER

21                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

22                  MR. MILLER:    Just very brief -- excuse me --

23   very briefly, I'd like to make two points.

24                  The first is that, essentially, the error in

25   this case was the failure to give a limiting instruction

                                      37

 1   relating to the use of pre-enactment evidence, and

 2   that's the same sort of instructional or evidentiary

 3   error that can be considered in a case-specific analysis

 4   under prong four and should have been considered

 5   through that analysis.

 6               The second is that Respondent suggested

 7   there was a lack of jurisdiction in this case.              That

 8   argument rests on an understanding of jurisdiction that

 9   this Court rejected in Cotton, and we discussed that at

10   pages 9 to 11 of our reply brief.

11               If the Court has no further questions, we

12   ask that the judgment be reversed and the case remanded.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

14               The case is submitted.

15               (Whereupon, at 11:49 a.m., the case in the

16   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
