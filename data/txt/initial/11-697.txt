 7            ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ


 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 9               MR. ROSENKRANZ:           Thank you,


10   Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

11               This case presents a stark choice between

12   two plausible definitions of the phrase, "lawfully made

13   under this title."    Our definition is the more

14   consistent with the English language, and is the only

15   definition that does not do mischief with the same use

16   of that phrase each time it's repeated.

17               Ours is the only one consistent with a

18   400-year common law history, and 65-year-old right that

19   was in the statute through 1976, and consistent with the

20   principle that Congress doesn't abolish those things

21   without being clear.

22               Ours gives the copyright owners much of what

23   they asked for when they were seeking an importation

24   provision, just not everything; whereas, Wiley's grants

25   them rights far beyond anything that anyone could have


                                      3

 1   imagined asking for back then.

 2                  Ours --

 3                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But your reading -- your

 4   reading is essentially, once a copy is sold anywhere,

 5   the copyright owner loses control of distribution

 6   everywhere.

 7                  That is essentially your argument.

 8                 MR. ROSENKRANZ:          That is correct,

 9   Your Honor.    And to put a finer point on it, ours is

10   that "lawfully made under this title" means made

11   wherever, in a way that satisfies U.S. copyright

12   standards, made in accordance with --

13                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So -- but -- so this

14   notion of sold anywhere, end of distribution rights

15   everywhere, that has been called, I think, the universal

16   exhaustion principle.

17                  MR. ROSENKRANZ:            International exhaustion.

18   Yes, Your Honor.

19                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And we are told that no

20   country has adopted that international exhaustion

21   regime, that most countries adhere to the national

22   exhaustion regime, which nobody is contesting here.

23   That is, if it's manufactured in the United States and

24   sold in the United States, that copy belongs to the

25   person who purchased it, end of case.                 But if the


                                          4

                                    Official


 1   exhaustion doctrine applies only nationally, then your

 2   argument is asking for something that runs against the

 3   regime that is accepted in most places.

 4                MR. ROSENKRANZ:           Your Honor, I have a few

 5   answers to that.   The first is it is not true that no

 6   country adopts national exhaustion.                Congress adopted

 7   national exhaustion in sections 905 and 906 6 years

 8   after the statute was passed, as to microchips.

 9                But second, Wiley is making the point that

10   there is now a norm.      They say most States -- most

11   countries, that is.      Back in 1976 Wiley is not even

12   arguing that there was any international norm, much less

13   that the drafters of the statute were focused on

14   international norms; and the truth is that there isn't

15   an international consensus around national exhaustion.

16   We know that for a fact.        In 1994 when 125 nations got

17   together, they -- they agreed to disagree on

18   international copyright exhaustion principles, and they

19   codified that disagreement, to each his own, in the

20   TRIPS agreement.

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, let's take, for

22   example, the European Union, the position in -- in those

23   countries.   Suppose we -- we just transformed --

24   transferred this case to one of those countries, the

25   exact same case; and my understanding is that they would


                                       5

 1   follow the national exhaustion.


 2                MR. ROSENKRANZ:         No, Your Honor, not to


 3   quibble; they don't follow national exhaustion.          They


 4   follow regional exhaustion.          So --

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Yes, but not -- not

 6   exhaust -- you sell a copy in -- in Thailand; then it's

 7   home free all over the world.

 8                MR. ROSENKRANZ:         Agreed, Your Honor, but it

 9   is regional, it's not national.          And -- and the point

10   here is we've got to of course read what Congress wrote.

11   What Congress wrote was "lawfully made under this

12   title," not "lawfully made in the United States," or not

13   "lawfully made under this title and made in the United

14   States."   When Congress wants to say that, Congress says

15   that very explicitly.

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Do you mean by "lawfully

17   made under this title," simply lawfully made in a manner

18   that does not violate United States copyright law?

19                MR. ROSENKRANZ:         No, Your Honor.   Just, I --

20   I would say "lawfully made under this title" means

21   lawfully made in a manner that does not violate the

22   standards articulated.

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:         The standards, okay.     So --

24   so it could be lawfully made in England, let's say; in a

25   country that has compulsory licensing, it could be


                                     6

 1   lawfully made there, but it would not be lawfully made

 2   under our -- under our copyright law, because we don't

 3   have that.

 4                  MR. ROSENKRANZ:         Yes, Your Honor.    Let me

 5   give a -- an example that actually is consistent with

 6   what --

 7                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         So -- so at least they are

 8   correct in contending that what you are arguing for is

 9   -- is not lawfully made under -- lawfully made if the

10   United States copyright law had applied where it was

11   made; is that what you are saying?

12                  MR. ROSENKRANZ:         No, Your Honor.    And the

13   reason is --

14                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         No?

15                  MR. ROSENKRANZ:         -- that that statute that

16   you just described would only do a third of the job of

17   the first-sale doctrine.        Everyone agrees the first-sale

18   doctrine applies at a minimum to products made in the

19   United States.    And if you use that counterfactual, if

20   U.S. law had applied, it would indicate that it, the

21   first-sale doctrine, does not apply in situations where

22   it was made in the United States.             So the

23   counterfactual --

24                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         I don't -- I don't follow

25   that.

 1               MR. ROSENKRANZ:          So the first-sale doctrine

 2   applies to goods made in the United States --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Right.

 4               MR. ROSENKRANZ:          -- and to goods made

 5   outside of the United States, is our argument.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Okay.

 7               MR. ROSENKRANZ:          If it applies in the United

 8   States, if we're talking about goods made in the United

 9   States, the counterfactual "if this title had applied"

10   would not work, because this title does apply to the

11   goods made in the United States, and that's the core of

12   the first-sale doctrine.

13               JUSTICE KAGAN:        So, Mr. Rosenkranz, is

14   what -- is your theory of this statute essentially that

15   this language means non-piratical copies as that is

16   defined by U.S. copyright law?

17               MR. ROSENKRANZ:          Yes, Your Honor, if I may

18   just change one word, because "piratical" is a

19   mischievous word.   Back in the day when the -- when the

20   1976 statute was passed, "piratical" meant unlawful

21   under the laws of other countries.

22               JUSTICE KAGAN:        No.

23               MR. ROSENKRANZ:          Yes.    So --

24               JUSTICE KAGAN:        I said as defined by U.S.

25   copyright law.

 1                 MR. ROSENKRANZ:         Absolutely.    And -- and the

 2   key --

 3                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       So that's, that's what the

 4   statute means.   It's -- the statute in your view is

 5   setting up a distinction between piratical, pirated,

 6   whatever the term is -- copies --

 7                 MR. ROSENKRANZ:         Counterfeit.

 8                 JUSTICE KAGAN: -- and other copies, and

 9   saying that that distinction should be measured by U.S.

10   copyright law?

11                 MR. ROSENKRANZ:         That is right.   And Your

12   Honor, the reason was -- what was driving copyright

13   owners crazy was this notion that there were lawless

14   states out there that had no significant copyright

15   protection.   And we were applying their standards to

16   products that were infiltrating the U.S. market.            And

17   one of the most important things to underscore here,

18   which I think got lost in the Costco argument, is that

19   the space -- that 602 does an enormous amount of work

20   even with 109, the first-sale doctrine, carved out of

21   it.

22                 Copyright owners wanted three things out of

23   the 1976 Act with respect to importation, and they got

24   two and a half of them.       The first was what we've just

25   been talking about, Your Honor.           It was driving them


                                      9

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   crazy that there were lawless states out there; they


 2   gave the example of Russia, which -- where an agency


 3   approved the making and distribution within Russia of


 4   classic English language works.           They got imported to


 5   the U.S. and they were competing with U.S. works, U.S.

 6   copies within our domestic market.                And they got their

 7   wish to shut that down, to use U.S. law as the standard

 8   for those works.

 9                 Secondly, they got coverage for copies that

10   were lawfully made, but stolen.           And this was the one

11   ask that the film industry had.           We see it in the

12   colloquies.   They rented films abroad.               The films --

13   that was their business model.           The films would get

14   stolen; and the U.S. market would be awash with stolen

15   films.   And so they wanted to shut down, with the

16   importation provision, those stolen goods coming into

17   the U.S. market.

18                 And the third thing that they wanted is --

19   is what's been dominating this debate.                But it's only

20   the third thing, and that was help dividing geographic

21   markets, so that they could go after the rogue

22   distributors, yes, but also go after the downstream

23   sales.   They got half of that.          They got a cause of

24   action against the rogue distributors.                They did not get

25   a cause of action that went downstream.

 1                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Mr. Rosenkranz, can I

 2   ask you, just -- it is a practical question, but I think

 3   it has a theoretical impact.             A manufacturer can choose

 4   to contract or a copyright holder choose to contract

 5   with someone here to manufacture their goods.            They

 6   could contract with someone abroad, anywhere in the

 7   world, directly.   They can choose to license their

 8   trademark and permit a distributor abroad to manufacture

 9   under their U.S. copyright; or they can permit the

10   licensee to register the copyright abroad and

11   distribute.   In your definition of "lawfully made under

12   this title," does "lawfully made under this title" apply

13   to all of those situations, i.e. --

14                 MR. ROSENKRANZ:         Yes.

15                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           -- I think clearly to

16   the manufacturer who manufactures abroad --

17                 MR. ROSENKRANZ:         Yes.

18                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           -- clearly to the

19   manufacturer who licensed a distributor to do it for it.

20   But does it also apply to the -- to the copyright owner

21   who basically gives the copyright to a foreign

22   distributor and lets the foreign distributor -- register

23   it abroad?

24                 MR. ROSENKRANZ:         Yes, Your Honor.    The only

25   question under our definition is, was the making lawful,


                                     11

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   which is to say, was it authorized, whether it's by

 2   transfer of licensing or by transfer of copyright or in

 3   any other way?   Is it lawful as measured by U.S.

 4   standards?   And -- and the --

 5                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         That is -- that is

 6   broader than I thought.      Then I'm not quite sure why you

 7   don't mean if this title applied.            Because if the --

 8                MR. ROSENKRANZ:         If --

 9                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- the manufacturer who

10   is manufacturing under the English copyright, because

11   the distributor has an English copyright, is not

12   manufacturing under the U.S. copyright, they are

13   manufacturing under the English copyright.

14                MR. ROSENKRANZ:         Right.      And, Your Honor,

15   the reason that the language works the way we've

16   described is because we are not focusing on whether the

17   making was under this title; we're focusing on whether

18   it was lawful under this title.          Does this -- would this

19   title, when you apply it to wherever it happens to be,

20   whether in the United States or abroad, would this title

21   say that this is authorized?

22                Now, let me just circle back again.             The

23   reason if this title had been applicable doesn't work is

24   because there are enormous numbers of situations,

25   probably three-quarters of them, that the First Sale

 1   Doctrine applies to where this title does apply.

 2               And so trying to say where -- you know, if

 3   this title had applied would work for foreign goods

 4   coming in, but not for U.S. goods, which is the core of

 5   the First Sale Doctrine.


 6               JUSTICE BREYER:         But you don't have to


 7   say -- you can say both, either it was manufactured


 8   directly and received an American copyright and


 9   satisfied all the conditions, or, if that wasn't the


10   case, it was manufactured in a way that satisfied the

11   conditions of the American statute, even though, for

12   technical reasons, it didn't apply.

13               MR. ROSENKRANZ:         Yes, Your Honor.   And, in

14   fact, (a)(2) --

15               JUSTICE BREYER:         That's what your argument

16   is, I take it.

17              MR. ROSENKRANZ:       Yes.     In 2008 --

18               JUSTICE BREYER:         So we are off on a kind of

19   curly cue here.

20               MR. ROSENKRANZ:         Yes, Your Honor.   But -- so

21   what Congress did was to find a much simpler, more

22   efficient way to say all of that.

23               In 2008, it figured that out and put --

24               JUSTICE BREYER:         I take it that the reason

25   they wrote -- or changed the statute was just because


                                   13

 1   they were worried about bailees or lessees or somebody

 2   under the old statutes not satisfying the first -- they

 3   were worried about that -- somebody -- a printer

 4   lawfully obtains a book, and he shouldn't have advantage

 5   of the First Sale Doctrine.

 6                  MR. ROSENKRANZ:         Well, Your --

 7                  JUSTICE BREYER:         He's in the middle of

 8   printing it.    And therefore you have to change the

 9   language.   So they changed the language to "lawfully

10   made under this title."

11                  MR. ROSENKRANZ:         Correct.

12                  JUSTICE BREYER:         Am I right; or, if I am

13   wrong, why did they change it?

14                  MR. ROSENKRANZ:         Your Honor, that is exactly

15   right.   And just not to diminish it --

16                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Is it all right?   Wasn't

17   there also the question of allowing manufacturers to

18   segment markets so we'd have the copyright by abroad,

19   governed by foreign law, copyright in the United States

20   governed by U.S. law?       Wasn't segmentation of the market

21   allowing people to do just what these people are doing?

22                  MR. ROSENKRANZ:         So, Justice Ginsburg, my

23   answer to Justice Breyer was about why the language in

24   109 was changed, that is, from "obtained possession" to

25   "lawfully made."

 1                 And that was -- what Justice Breyer pointed

 2   out was exactly why, because -- and not to minimize

 3   bailees, bailees was the movie industry problem.

 4   Bailees was stealing things from the manufacturers'

 5   loading docks or from shippers.             But, yes, Your Honor,

 6   there was also a segment of the publishing industry that

 7   wanted that third thing.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:         I couldn't find a word.       I

 9   could not find a word of that in the legislative

10   history.   Irwin Karp, who was the strongest

11   representative for the publishers, said you couldn't do

12   that ten years earlier.

13                 So is there --

14                 MR. ROSENKRANZ:         No.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:         No, but you just said yes

16   in answer to Justice Ginsburg's question.             So she'll

17   find exactly what there is there, so I would like to

18   know what it is.

19                 MR. ROSENKRANZ:         Your Honor, I -- I was

20   answering yes to was this a motivation of the

21   publishers.   And if I misunderstood the question, Your

22   Honor --

23                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       But a motivation for 109, or

24   a motivation for 602?

25                 MR. ROSENKRANZ:         A motivation for 602.

 1                  When the conversation turned to 109,

 2   Your Honor, not a word was uttered about dividing

 3   distribution or divided markets.              It was all about this

 4   problem --

 5                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       So on 602, you said that one

 6   of the things that they wanted was the segmentation of

 7   markets.   They got half of it.             They got the rogue

 8   distributors' half.

 9                  And I guess Mr. Olson makes the point, and

10   it seems a good one, it's like that's a crazy half to

11   have gotten.    That's the kind that they don't need

12   because they have a contractual remedy about -- against

13   the distributors.

14                  And then they don't get people like,

15   frankly, your client, who are rogue something elses,

16   with no contractual privity.              And what sense does that

17   make?

18                  MR. ROSENKRANZ:         Well, it makes perfect

19   sense, Your Honor.     Obviously, you know, the industry,

20   at least back in 1976, did not get everything that they

21   wanted.    What they got was a much more powerful weapon

22   than a contract.

23                  I mean, a copyright weapon gives you

24   injunctive relief, gives you multiples of damages which

25   you don't get out of a contract remedy.

 1                But to Justice Breyer's point, because I

 2   think it's an important one, when you go to the

 3   history -- and I think you are right, Your Honor, that

 4   there is exactly one spot in the drafting history where

 5   the relationship between 602 and 109 was discussed.           It

 6   was that conversation between Clark and Goldman, who was

 7   the general counsel of the copyright office.

 8                It's on pages 11 to 12 of our reply brief.

 9   It's recited in extensive detail in the amicus brief

10   that Costco submitted.     And here's what happened.        They

11   got their importation provision.           And Karp says, now,

12   wait a minute, I don't get it.          You have got this

13   importation provision, and you've got this First Sale

14   Doctrine.   They are at war with each other.          Which one

15   wins?

16                They seem to be agreeing that first sale

17   wins, but they realize that there is this problem.           And

18   what they do, the general counsel of the copyright

19   office says, we obviously haven't thought this through.

20   We need to do more work on this, says the librarian of

21   Congress.   And the next thing that happens, you see it

22   in a red line on page 13 of our reply brief, is that for

23   the first time in the drafting history, the two are

24   reconciled by making 602 subordinate to 109, in exactly

25   the way that Quality King found it to be.


                                    17

 1                So the copyright owners got half the loaf.

 2   It may not have been the half that was more important to

 3   them, but they got a lot more from the extension of the

 4   -- the importation provision.

 5                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Mr. Rosenkranz, there is


 6   that passage in Quality King, which is, I think it's


 7   fair to say, unfortunate to your position.            Is your


 8   basic view of that passage that it was simply


 9   ill-considered dicta that we should ignore?


10                MR. ROSENKRANZ:         To put it bluntly, yes.

11   That's my ultimate position.            But I do think it can be

12   reconciled with our position.

13                Let's start with the question presented in

14   Quality King is exactly the question that is presented

15   here, and the Court answered it yes, that is, do

16   imports -- is 109 applicable to imports.

17                The whole driving logic of Quality King is

18   about 109 trumping 602.      And it's only in that part IV,

19   where the court is rebutting various attacks on its

20   position, that it gets to that dictum, and that dictum

21   is in the third tier explanation to one of five

22   rebuttals.

23                I believe it can be reconciled, certainly in

24   result.   What you had there was the foreign distributor

25   who had only British rights importing directly into the


                                    18

 1   United States.    There was never a first sale.

 2                JUSTICE KAGAN:        Well, in result, but not in

 3   reasoning.   The passage specifically says this was

 4   presumably not to be lawfully made under this title.

 5                MR. ROSENKRANZ:          And I have an -- I agree

 6   with you, Your Honor.      I have an explanation.        I offer

 7   it tentatively.   I'm not sure whether it's right or not,

 8   either as to what the Court intended or under the

 9   statute.

10                My hunch is the Court was thinking about a

11   scenario where the British publisher only needs 10,000

12   copies to cover Britain; but, instead, what it does is

13   to print 100,000 copies.       Everyone would know that that

14   is not authorized, it's not lawfully made under this

15   title, because the intent is to send it over to the

16   United States.    So it's not lawfully made at that

17   moment.

18                Let me also just mention an important

19   undergirding to our position, which is that our position

20   is the only one that does not make a complete hash out

21   of every uses of the same phrase -- every use of the

22   same phrase in the rest of the statute.            Wiley's reading

23   makes almost all of them nonsensical.

24                So let me just give you an example.           Section

25   110, the classroom provision.            Wiley acknowledges this


                                     19

 1   is the result, but doesn't explain why Congress would

 2   ever have wanted it.    The result is that a teacher can

 3   go and buy a Beethoven record and play it to her class

 4   if it was made in the United States.             But if she flips

 5   one past it to the next Beethoven record that happens to

 6   have been made in Asia, she can't play that for her

 7   class.

 8                Or section 109(c), the public display, the

 9   Buffalo Cafe owner is allowed to purchase something in

10   the United States and put it up on her walls, you know,

11   say, a picture of Niagara Falls.           That is permissible,

12   if it was made in the United States.             But off the same

13   retail rack, she flips one past; if it was made in Asia,

14   it's not permissible.

15                Nor does Wiley explain why Congress would

16   adopt an exception to the First Sale Doctrine that is

17   not at all about sales, that is only about where copies

18   were made.

19                So a U.S. manufacturer who wants to sell

20   into the U.S. market has this incentive to go and send

21   jobs overseas.   It's an irresistible incentive if the

22   law is -- if this Court says the law is what Wiley says.

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Has that ever happened?

24   I mean, the Ninth Circuit cases have been around for

25   some time.   Has any manufacturer ever moved abroad?

 1                 MR. ROSENKRANZ:         Your Honor, I'm sure it


 2   has.   They haven't announced it.           Now, let me just be


 3   clear.   The Ninth Circuit came out with its opinion,


 4   this Court has intervened twice, so the law has never


 5   been settled in Wiley's favor.           The courts were split.

 6                 The moment that a manufacturer learns that

 7   this Court says you get what we've called the Holy Grail

 8   of manufacturing, endless eternal downstream control

 9   over sales and rentals, you can ruin secondary markets

10   that are competing with you, the moment that happens,

11   that will be yet another reason for manufacturers

12   silently to decide that they're headed -- that they're

13   sending their manufacturing overseas.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Of -- of those -- of those

15   courts that did hold the way your -- your opponent

16   would -- would have it, am I correct that only one of

17   them adopted the absolutist rule?

18                 MR. ROSENKRANZ:         Well, Your Honor, there are

19   only three courts of appeals that have weighed in, but

20   yes, the Second Circuit is the only one that has adopted

21   the absolutist rule, and that's yet another problem with

22   Wiley's position.    Wiley urges its position as a matter

23   of statutory interpretation, but is refusing to stand by

24   it.    The moment it gets past the language of the

25   statute, every argument it makes is an argument that is

 1   about tempering what -- you know, like a sky hook coming

 2   down from on high, tempering its interpretation in a

 3   manner that is completely inconsistent with the

 4   statutory language.

 5               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              The government argues in

 6   effect for -- what we might call it -- a common law

 7   adaptation of Bobbs-Merrill.

 8               MR. ROSENKRANZ:            Yes, Your Honor, which --

 9   which is even -- creates even more mischief.             The

10   government's position, as I understand it, is 109

11   doesn't have to do any work.              In service of giving more

12   berth, you know, greater magnitude to 602, we're going

13   to make 109 completely superfluous because Bobbs-Merrill

14   does all of the work.

15               Now, 109 Congress said -- it put into the

16   statute, it said it on every recodification to codify

17   Bobbs-Merrill, and the government is now making 109

18   completely irrelevant, but picking and choosing,

19   deciding that it wants the limitation on us from 109,

20   but borrowing from Bobbs-Merrill some reservoir of law

21   that modifies the first-sale doctrine.

22               If there are no further questions, I would

23   like --

24               JUSTICE KAGAN:          Mr. Rosenkranz, can I take

25   you back to Justice Ginsburg's opening question?               Just

 1   as a matter of copyright theory, I had always understood

 2   copyright to -- a copyright holder has a kind of a

 3   bundle of rights.   It's not one right that applies

 4   everywhere in the world.        It's you have your U.S. rights

 5   and you have your Chinese rights, you have your rights

 6   under each jurisdiction's law.

 7               And your position is essentially to say that

 8   when I sell my Chinese rights to somebody, I'm also

 9   selling my U.S. rights to that same person, because the

10   person who has the Chinese rights can just turn around

11   and import the goods.       I mean, that's the nature of your

12   position, isn't it, that your U.S. rights are always

13   attached when you sell more -- your rights under the

14   jurisdiction of another country?

15               MR. ROSENKRANZ:            Well -- so first, Your

16   Honor, back in 1976, this notion of geographic division

17   was very, very new, so it's not at all clear what

18   Congress was thinking with that -- with respect to that.

19   But secondly, no, we're not -- we're not saying that

20   when the owner sells his Chinese -- its Chinese rights

21   to the Chinese company, it is selling all rights.

22   Certainly, the Chinese company cannot sell everywhere,

23   but after that first sale, all of the manufacturer's

24   rights are cut off.

 5               ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 6                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 7                MR. OLSON:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 8   please the Court:

 9                Petitioner's commercial enterprise is

10   precisely what Section 602(a)(1) was enacted to address,

11   an international gray market in copyrighted works.               This

12   Court unanimously recognized in the Quality King case

13   that 602(a)(1) encompasses copies of books that were

14   lawfully made not under the United States' Copyright

15   Act, but under the law of some other country.

16                602(a) is broader than 6 -- 109(a), because

17   it encompasses copies not subject to the first-sale

18   doctrine, for example copies made under the law of

19   another country.    These are the words of every member of

20   this Court in the Quality King case.

21                Now, referring to it as dicta misstates what

22   was going on in the Quality King case.               The argument was

23   that if you interpret 602(a) and 109(a) as allowing a

24   defense, a first-sale defense, you emasculate Section

25   602(a), and so the Court was explaining on page 147 and

 1   148, I believe, why there were three reasons why 602(a)

 2   would have viability.     And one of those reasons had to

 3   do with direct action against someone that was engaged

 4   in pirating, and some of it had to do with bailees and

 5   lessees.   These are relatively small problems either

 6   otherwise dealt with by contract law or otherwise dealt

 7   with by the provisions of the statute.

 8                But the third reason for the Court's

 9   interpretation and its decision in that case was

10   precisely the case that we're talking about here.

11                JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, it may be important

12   dictum, but do you really want to argue it wasn't

13   dictum?

14                MR. OLSON:    I do.

15                JUSTICE ALITO:       It was the holding of the

16   case?

17                MR. OLSON:    It was the holding of the case

18   in the sense that it was necessary, the Court felt.         And

19   we could -- you know, I don't -- I don't feel I want to

20   spend a lot of time arguing what the word "dicta" means,

21   but it was a necessary ingredient to what the Court felt

22   was an explanation for why it was deciding the case that

23   it was deciding.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:         You don't need that.

25                JUSTICE KAGAN:       It wasn't necessary, was it?

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Your -- 602(a) has plenty

 2   of meaning.   I mean, an American copyright holder

 3   licenses a British company to publish the work under

 4   British copyright law.      602(a) says he can't import the

 5   books into the United States, period.

 6                 MR. OLSON:    That's --

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Now, the only -- so there's

 8   plenty of meaning there.       The question is what happens

 9   when he sells it to his bookstore and you or I go in and

10   buy it and we want to give a copy to our wife when we

11   get back to the United States.           The question is, did --

12   is that unlawful?

15   now, there are exceptions for the books that are brought

16   in --

18   once I bring back five copies and I give one to my son.

 5   covered by the various provisions of the copyright

 6   statute.    And the question is, is it covered by section

 7   2 -- 602(a)(1)?    Yes, it's an import of an acquired

 8   copy.    Do you have a defense under the first-sale

 9   doctrine?    And I go to the exact explicit language of

10   the statute.    There may be exceptions under other

11   provisions of the copyright law, but the first-sale

12   doctrine, 109(a) specifically says "lawfully made under

15   importation or the distribution in commerce.            That's an

16   argument that the government makes, but it's not

12   would say that when we talk about all the horribles that

13   might apply in cases other than this -- museums, used

14   Toyotas, books and luggage, and that sort of thing --

15   we're not talking about this case.                 And what we are

16   talking about is the language used by the statute that

 2   that's what we are asking.

 3                MR. OLSON:    And -- exactly, Justice Kennedy.

 4   And that's what you were doing in the -- in the Quality

 5   King, when we were -- we were discussing with

 6   Justice Alito whether this is dicta or not.           The Court

 7   was specifically saying what it would apply to, and

 8   it -- what -- what the Court was talking about in that

 9   case was books made not pursuant to title, but pursuant

10   to some other country's copyright law.           This copyright

11   law provisions --

13   copyright owner who contracts in England to make

14   books -- he doesn't have an English copyright, he just

15   simply chooses that place to manufacture as opposed to

16   the U.S. -- why is he making that copy under English law

17   and not under his rights of U.S. copyright?

18                MR. OLSON:    Well, if he is doing -- if he is

19   manufacturing the book in England, he's not -- because

20   the copyright law does not have extraterritorial

21   application, he is not making those copies under this

22   title.   And this Court --

 1               MR. OLSON:    But the problem is -- the


 2   statutes may not be perfect with respect to this, and


 3   there may be horribles that occur under one set of


 4   interpretations of the statute, and the other


 5   interpretation of the statute is to interpret it as --

 6   as the petitioner --

 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Mr. Olson, we know from

 8   the Karp exchange that the response was, this is

 9   something that we have to study with care, in 1976.

10               The parade of horribles is now causing the

11   Solicitor General and at least one, if not two, courts

12   of appeals to write exceptions into the language to take

13   care of what they perceive as horribles.

14               Isn't it incumbent upon us to give the

15   statute what is plainly a more rational plain meaning

16   than to try to give it a meaning and then fix it because

17   we understand that the meaning doesn't make sense?

18               MR. OLSON:    I -- there -- there is a body of

19   the government of the United States that is entitled and

20   capable of fixing this.     These parade of horribles have

21   been -- people have been arguing about these for years.

22   For 30 years, the statute has been interpreted the way

23   that we are suggesting that it should be under this

24   title, which this Court earlier this year, in another

25   case, in the Novo Nordisk case, specifically said, under


                                   32

 1   this title means pursuant to the provisions of this

 2   title.

 3               This Court said that before in -- in the

 4   Ardestani case.   The under this title occurs not only in

 5   section 109(a), but under this title occurs in 602(a)

 6   itself; and then under this section appears twice in

 7   sections 602(a) --

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Rosenkranz told us

 9   that under this title means different things in other

10   sections, and he gave a number of examples.

11               MR. OLSON:      Yes, and -- and in each case --

12   first of all, if the interpretation that my opponent is

13   arguing for was the law, that -- those are the words

14   that are in 602(b) and 602(a)(2).            So Congress could

15   have used those words that our opponents are arguing

16   for, and did use those words, one of which was written

17   on the same time in the same -- passed in the same time,

18   in 1976, that 602(a)(1) was.

19               JUSTICE KAGAN:         Well, Mr. Olson, can I just

20   take you to --

21               MR. OLSON:      With respect to those other --

22               JUSTICE KAGAN:         Please.

23               MR. OLSON:      With respect to those other

24   provisions, Justice Ginsburg, the -- the government

25   specifically goes over each one of those, but each one


                                     33

 1   of those, if you interpret the statute as under this

 2   title as pursuant to this title, each one of those

 3   provisions makes sense in the context in which that term

 4   is used there.

 5               And -- and there is only one real way to

 6   interpret under this title in the provisions in 109(a)

 7   in -- in conjunction with 602(a)(1), and that is the way

 8   the Court decided it in the Quality King case,

 9   specifically looking at this question.

10               Now the facts were slightly different in the

11   sense that that was a round trip; this isn't a round

12   trip.

13               JUSTICE KAGAN:       Can I take you back to the

14   words here, "lawfully made under this title," which you

15   say clearly means what you say it means.

16               So, I find this language a little bit

17   perplexing, and I can kind of see it both ways.      So what

18   you say is made under this title, that must mean made in

19   the United States, and "lawfully," just as this little

20   word that's -- that modifies that basic phrase, "made

21   under this title," which means made in the United

22   States.

23               But what Mr. Rosenkranz essentially says --

24   he doesn't say it in these words, but he says, "The

25   focus of this provision is on 'lawfully made.'"      That is


                                   34

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   what the focus is on.      It's on "lawfully made" as

 2   opposed to "unlawfully made."

 3                 Now, when we just say lawfully made, you

 4   know, we need something to measure, well, how do we know

 5   whether it's lawfully made?           Well, you look to the rules

 6   in the copyright law.

 7                 So if you just -- if you focus more on the

 8   lawfully word, lawfully made, and then under this title

 9   doesn't mean made in the United States, it means

10   lawfully made under the rules of this title.

11                 MR. OLSON:    Lawfully made under this title

12   is lawfully made under the copyright laws of the United

13   States.   It can't say, 'lawfully made in the United

14   States,' because then something might --

15                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, lawfully made, under

16   the rules of the United States, regardless where the

17   thing was manufactured, is what I'm saying.          That's the

18   way -- it just seems to me as though --

19                 MR. OLSON:    It --

20                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       -- you are saying made must

21   be manufactured.   But lawfully made is a lawfully made

22   copy.   How do we know if it's lawfully made?         We look to

23   this title.

24                 MR. OLSON:    I think under this title means

25   that it was made pursuant to the provisions of the


                                     35

 1   copyright law.   I can't imagine the difficulties that

 2   would ensue with litigation over whether or not

 3   something made in another country, made under another

 4   country's different laws -- and they vary enormously

 5   throughout the world -- whether that was somehow

 6   compatible with the laws of the United States.

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:         But what about litigation

 8   in this respect?   I want to bring you back to the

 9   horribles.

10                MR. OLSON:    Because the --

11                JUSTICE BREYER:         The main point is that

12   horribles haven't occurred.          Right?

14                JUSTICE BREYER:         Sometimes horribles don't

 2   Picasso without the permission of the copyright holder,

 4                What, as their lawyer, do you tell them?                Do

 5   you tell them, hey, no problem; or, do you tell them,

 6   you might become a law violator; or, do you tell them, I

 7   better litigate this?     What do you tell them?

 8                MR. OLSON:     Well, each one of those

 9   situations that you posit, Justice Breyer, has a whole

10   panoply of set of facts.

11                With respect to the museums, with respect to

12   the person bringing books into the United States, there

13   are other defenses, including fair use.              There are other

14   defenses under the copyright law.           But -- and one of the

15   things is that, to a certain extent, if you're going to

16   use the product created by someone else in a way that's

17   contemplated by the copyright laws, maybe it's required

18   that you actually comply with the copyright laws by

19   going to the owner of the copyright and saying, look,

20   here's what I propose to do, can I have a license to do

21   this?   It's a nonprofit.     It's a museum.          And I'm --

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Counsel, you said

23   there are other defenses, including fair use.              In -- in

24   the catalogue that Justice Breyer recited, are all those

25   fair uses?

 1                MR. OLSON:    No.       And some of -- but -- but

 2   they're --

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, which ones

 4   are -- I mean, I'm -- it seems unlikely to me that, if

 5   your position is right, that a court would say, it's a

 6   fair use to resell the Toyota, it's a fair use to

 7   display the Picasso.

 8                MR. OLSON:    It may be a fair use.            It may be

 9   an implied license, for example, with respect to

10   copyrighted items or trademarked items that appear in a

11   product that was licensed abroad.            The government has

12   offered another alternative interpretation of the word

13   "made," as putting it in the flow of commerce.              That

14   might deal with some of these situations.

15                But the point I guess I am making,

16   Mr. Chief Justice, is that Congress was clearly

17   intending to talk about the vast gray market problem.

18   This provision --

19                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, intending where?           I

20   mean, I -- you spend a lot of time talking about the

21   legislative history and the purposes behind 602.              But

22   the language that we're supposed to be interpreting is

23   the language in section 109.            And the language in

24   section 109, as far as I can see, there's really nothing

25   to support your argument that that language was intended


                                    38

 1   to address this gray market problem.

 2               Isn't that correct?

 3               MR. OLSON:     Well, no.       I think that section

 4   109 and 602(a) were adopted in the same statute.          They

 5   were put in the draft of the statute at the same time,

 6   in 1964.

 7               JUSTICE KAGAN:       But you know, section 109 is

 8   just a rewording of a prior provision that you would

 9   clearly lose under, where the prior wording had nothing

10   to do with where any product was manufactured.          And what

11   you're suggesting is that we should read this change in

12   wording -- which actually, there's a real theory behind

13   what the change in wording meant that has nothing to do

14   with the place of manufacture, that we should read it as

15   incorporating a place of manufacture requirement,

16   because there was a separate debate going on in section

17   602 about that question.

18               MR. OLSON:     But the -- but the two pro --

19   what I'm -- I guess what I'm trying to explain is that

20   the two were enacted at the same time.          They were out

21   there and available to the public for 12 years before

22   they were finally adopted.       These parade of horribles

23   could have been addressed by Congress in a different way

24   at the time, and the interpretation -- this is a -- 109

25   is a defense -- is offered as a defense to section -- to


                                   39

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   section 602(a)(1).

 2                  So what does it mean?          What provide -- what

 3   is the defense that's provided?            And you then have to

 4   interpret, "made under this" -- "lawfully made under

 5   this title."    What does that mean?

 6                  And you have done that in the Quality King

 7   case.   You explained in the Quality King unanimously

 8   that it makes a difference because you are exhausting --

 9   Congress intended to allow segmentation of the market.

10   It only makes sense to interpret this way if you allow

11   segmentation of the market pursuant to these provisions,

12   because it is exhausting the copyright under the laws of

13   the United States once you make a sale of a product

14   produced in the United States subject to the United

15   States' copyright laws.

16                  You are not exhausting your U.S. copyright

17   when you make something, or allow something to be made

18   abroad.   You are not exhausting that copyright.            You

19   have not done that yet.        So the first sale is not

20   something that happens abroad that uses up the copyright

21   laws -- of the protection under the copyright laws of

22   the United States.

23                  So it seems to me that this does make

24   perfect sense.    And it makes -- there is not going to be

25   a perfect solution in every case.             The Court has dealt


                                      40

 1   with that frequently with respect to copyright laws.


 2   But if you interpret it as my opponent interprets it,


 3   you are opening the door to commercial enterprises


 4   precisely like this.


 5                It's not necessary in this case to decide


 6   every single permutation of a problem that someone


 7   crosses a border with a product, but this section 602


 8   specifically contemplates products that are acquired


 9   abroad and then brought back into the United States.


10   Here, we have a commercial enterprise doing exactly what

11   is contemplated by the people who were talking about

12   602(a) and section 109 when the two were adopted at the

13   same time.

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Mr. Olson, do you have an

15   answer to the outsourcing problem and the charges that

16   if you read the statute as you are urging, then you are

17   inviting the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs?

18                MR. OLSON:    There are several answers to

19   that.   One, that's Congress's concern.          And -- and there

20   is no evidence that that would really actually happen.

21   And Congress was concerned with creating a segmentation

22   of the market.   But it's entirely speculative as to

23   whether or not people are going to start manufacturing

24   books or other items outside the United States.

25                Congress can address that if that should


                                    41

 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,


 8               FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


 9                     SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT


10                  MR. STEWART:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11   please the Court:

12                  I would like to discuss -- begin by

13   discussing our Bobbs-Merrill argument, because it's a

14   part of our brief that's different from both the

15   parties' submissions, and I do think it's very important

16   to understanding the practical implications of the

17   Court's decision.

18                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Mr. Stewart, may I ask

19   you a preliminary question?            In Quality King the

20   government took the position that the Petitioner is

21   taking here.     What led the government to change its

22   mind?    Was it just what has been called "dictum" in

23   Quality King, or is there another reason why the

24   government has switched sides?

25                  MR. STEWART:     I think there are two related


                                      42

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   reasons, and one of them is the dictum, but I'll get to

 2   that second.

 3                  I think in both cases, our overriding

 4   objective was to offer a reading of section 109(a) that

 5   would not supersede, or would not effectively negate the

 6   importation prohibition in section 602(a)(1), because

 7   from the Copyright Office's perspective, we agree with

 8   Mr. Olson that the primary reason for the enactment of

 9   602(a)(1) was to facilitate market segmentation.           And

10   the argument we made in Quality King was you can

11   accomplish that; you can prevent section 109(a) --

12                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Could you point to

13   something in the legislative history to support that?

14                  MR. STEWART:     I think the best thing I could

15   point to is a report of the Registrar of Copyrights that

16   was issued in 1965, in which the Copyright Office

17   identified as one of the circumstances that would be

18   covered by the importation ban, the situation in which,

19   quote, "the copyright owner had authorized the -- the

20   manufacture of copies in a foreign country for

21   distribution only in that country."

22                  It didn't use the phrase "market

23   segmentation," but clearly, the point was the same.            You

24   are authorizing copies to be made abroad for

25   distribution only in that place, not for redistribution

 1   here.

 2               And so --

 3               JUSTICE KAGAN:       So Mr. Stewart, if I

 4   understand your argument, both here and in Quality King

 5   you want the copyright holder to have some control over

 6   importation, but at the same time you don't want the

 7   copyright holder to have control over all downstream

 8   sales.

 9               MR. STEWART:     That's correct.

10               JUSTICE KAGAN:       And that's what your

11   Bobbs-Merrill argument is designed to do.       It's designed

12   to prevent that.

13               MR. STEWART:     That's correct.

14               JUSTICE KAGAN:       Coming back to Justice

15   Ginsburg's question, do you think that truly the way to

16   do those two things, to give the copyright holder

17   control over importation, but not over downstream sales,

18   that our problem really is, do you think in your heart

19   of hearts that we got it wrong in Quality King?

20               MR. STEWART:     Well, we lost that case 9-0,

21   and so I am not arguing too vociferously that the Court

22   should change its opinion.       But yes, we think that we

23   still would adhere to our view that section 109(a)

24   should not be read as a limitation on section 602(a)(1).

25   If the Court had gone that path, it could read "lawfully


                                   44

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   made under this title" to encompass both foreign-made


 2   and domestic-made copies, without doing damage to the


 3   copyright holder's ability to segment markets.


 4               On the other hand --

 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          So you get what you

 6   wanted anyway?   That's really the bottom line.             We undo

 7   Quality King, except that the price is that people have

 8   to ship their manufacturing abroad.

 9               MR. STEWART:      Well, we're not urging the

10   Court to take that course, but yes, that would have been

11   one way to accomplish the same objective.             And so --

12               JUSTICE KAGAN:        So you are essentially

13   saying that the appropriate way to read this statute, to

14   make sense of all of its provisions, is to give the

15   copyright holder control over the importation, to give

16   Wiley the ability to go after this importer, Mr.

17   Kirtsaeng, but to find a way to stop it there?

18               MR. STEWART:      I think that's correct, but I

19   think our Bobbs-Merrill argument does provide a very

20   principled way to stop it there without going back on

21   what the Court said in Quality King.             That is,

22   Bobbs-Merrill was a 1908 case in which the publisher

23   sold books to retailers on the proviso that they not be

24   sold at retail for less than a specified amount.             One of

25   the retailers violated that resale restriction and was


                                    45

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   sued for copyright infringement.

 2               And this Court in Bobbs-Merrill said --

 3   parsed the statutory language, which at that time gave

 4   the copyright owner the exclusive right to vend copies

 5   of the work.


 6              JUSTICE ALITO:      But you're saying


 7   Bobbs-Merrill means something beyond section 109, but


 8   when -- the 1909 Copyright Act said that it was


 9   codifying the holding in Bobbs-Merrill, and the 1976


10   statute, which is now before us, said it wasn't changing

11   the meaning of the earlier law.         So I don't know how --

12   Bobbs-Merrill wasn't a constitutional decision, it was a

13   question of statutory interpretation.

14               So how does some sliver of Bobbs-Merrill

15   still survive all of this?

16               MR. STEWART:     Maybe I can put it this way:

17   If I buy a piratical copy of a book, one that was

18   illegally made without the consent of the copyright

19   owner, and all I do is read it and put it on my shelf, I

20   can't rely on 109(a) because the copy was not lawfully

21   made under this title.    But I still couldn't be held

22   liable for copyright infringement because there is no

23   exclusive right to read the book or to own it.        I

24   wouldn't have been infringing any of the copyright

25   owner's rights.


                                   46

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1               And so in order to have a valid claim for

 2   copyright infringement, the copyright owner would have

 3   to show both that 109(a) was inapplicable, and that what

 4   the defendant was doing was a violation, an infringement

 5   of one of the exclusive rights.

 6               And Mr. Rosenkranz seems to postulate a

 7   situation in which a cagey manufacturer would locate its

 8   facilities overseas, make the copies there, import them

 9   into the United States, sell them in this country,

10   subject to conditions on resale.

11               And if the goods were resold in violation of

12   those restrictions, the copyright owner would sue for

13   infringement.   And I think the first argument the

14   defendant would make is that is exactly the conduct that

15   the Court in Bobbs-Merrill said did not infringe the

16   exclusive right to vend.

17               Now -- namely the resale in violation of

18   restrictions on resale.      How can you now say it's now an

19   infringement of the exclusive right to distribute?     And

20   it would be a particularly difficult argument for the

21   copyright owner to make because what the House Report

22   said in 1909, it didn't say exactly that it was

23   codifying the holding of Bobbs-Merrill; it said that it

24   was amending the statute in other respects, and it

25   wanted to make clear that there was no intent to enlarge


                                    47

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   the exclusive right to vend.


 2                 And so the Plaintiff, in Mr. Rosenkranz's


 3   hypothetical, would in effect be arguing that by


 4   codifying section 109(a), Congress had implicitly


 5   expanded the scope of the implicit -- of the exclusive

 6   right to vend or distribute, even though it said it was

 7   doing the various opposite.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              That's an awfully

 9   difficult maze for somebody to -- to get through.               You

10   have to start with the difficulty of the language here,

11   and then you have to proceed and put the Quality King

12   gloss over it; and, when you finally get to that point,

13   you say, well, now you've got to read Bobbs-Merrill and

14   figure out how the common law governs all that.

15                 MR. STEWART:     But I think that would be true

16   under anybody's reading.       That is, once a court in a

17   case determined for whatever reason that section 109(a)

18   was inapplicable, it didn't provide a safe harbor, the

19   next step could never be simply to proceed to judgment

20   and say that there was infringement.               The next step

21   would always have to be to look at what the defendant

22   had done --

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, it's not that

24   complicated under the Petitioner's approach.               It says

25   once you've you had a first sale, that's it.

 1                 MR. STEWART:     The other point I would make

 2   about the Petitioner's approach is that it -- it really

 3   has no grounding in the statutory text.             That is, the

 4   Petitioner is arguing that if the publisher in Thailand,

 5   if the manufacturer of the books had shipped them

 6   directly into this country, that person could have been

 7   sued for infringement for the importation and --

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Well, the word has

 9   grounding.    It is Coke upon Littleton, 1628, where it

10   says that if a man be possessed of a chattel and give or

11   sell his whole interest upon a condition, that condition

12   is no good.   And Coke says, and that's how it should be.

13                 And now that's picked up in Bobbs-Merrill;

14   it's picked up in Dr. Miles.             It's been the law.

15                 Now if, in fact, there are two ways of

16   interpreting the statute, and one is consistent with

17   that basic principle of commercial law, and the other

18   produces some of the complexities that you have just

19   mentioned, isn't it better to go with the common law and

20   simply reaffirm a principle that's been in the

21   commercial law almost forever?

22                 MR. STEWART:     I -- I give two answers for

23   that.   And the first is that Coke was saying that, in

24   most circumstances at least, a sale is sufficient in

25   order to divest the owner of his prior right to control


                                     49

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   distribution, but it doesn't say that a sale is

 2   necessary.

 3                And my point is that when Mr. Rosenkranz

 4   says the hypothetical foreign publisher who makes copies

 5   with authorization but ships it into the -- them into

 6   the United States without could be held liable for

 7   infringement, there is nothing in section 109(a) that

 8   would allow a court to draw that distinction; that is,

 9   although 109(a) is sometimes referred to as a

10   codification of the First Sale Doctrine, it doesn't

11   require an antecedent first sale.

12                So as long as the foreign publisher was the

13   owner of the books at the type -- time they were

14   manufactured, if those books were lawfully made under

15   this title, under Petitioner's reading they could be

16   imported and distributed.

17                We know also that this was not an oversight,

18   that Congress didn't intend the provision to be subject

19   to a sort of implicit first authorized sale requirement,

20   because the language was intended to cover copies that

21   were made pursuant to a compulsory license.

22                JUSTICE ALITO:       Which of the following is

23   worse:   All of the horribles that the Petitioner

24   outlines to the extent they are realistic, or the

25   frustration of market segmentation, to the extent that


                                    50

 1   would occur, if Petitioner's position were accepted?


 2                 MR. STEWART:     Well, if they actually


 3   happened, then I think the -- the horribles would be


 4   worse.   But, as I say, we -- we feel that we have


 5   offered a reading of all the statutory provisions

 6   together that would avoid both.

 7                 The other couple of things I would say as to

 8   why a first sale by itself --

 9                 JUSTICE ALITO:       If the -- if that middle

10   ground is -- were found to be not viable, which of the

11   two sets of consequences is worse from the government's

12   perspective, or can you not say?

13                 MR. STEWART:     I would say that the

14   consequence that all foreign-made goods, even if

15   imported into the United States with the authorization

16   of the U.S. copyright owner, are subject to continuing

17   licensing requirements, etc., I would say that would be

18   worse than the frustration of market segmentation that

19   would occur under Petitioner's view.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

22            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ

23                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

24                 MR. ROSENKRANZ:         Thank you,

25   Mr. Chief Justice.

 1                I just want to step back and take a look at

 2   what the government's doing here.           After eloquently

 3   arguing in Quality King in the last two pages of its

 4   brief that our position on the meaning of this language

 5   is right, it's saying our position is wrong.           And then,

 6   it's trying to come up with a middle ground that has

 7   absolutely no basis in the statute.

 8                If Bobbs-Merrill provides the content for

 9   the First Sale Doctrine, then what does section 109 do?

10   And so the government is creating a scenario in which,

11   in order to save 602 from being superfluous in the way

12   it is described, although we believe it's not

13   superfluous at all, it is making 109 superfluous.

14                Justice Kagan asked a question about

15   essentially sentence diagramming.           Our view is that

16   'under this title' modifies 'lawfully.'           You use the

17   U.S. metric of U.S. law to figure out whether it's

18   lawful.   The government's and Wiley's position is that

19   'under this title' modifies both 'made' and 'lawfully.'

20   And at least the way I learned grammar, you can't use

21   the same phrase to modify both terms.

22                I want to correct something that I said to

23   Justice Ginsburg because I said it backwards.           905 and

24   906 are examples of the United States Congress in a

25   copyright context applying national exhaustion, and that


                                    52

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   was six years after this statute was passed.

 2                 To Justice Breyer's question, the bear is

 3   there.    It is very much there.         The only reason no one

 4   has ever pursued these legal arguments is that the legal

 5   arguments that are the baseline for all of this have yet

 6   to be accepted by this Court.            But I have not heard any

 7   argument for why the vast majority of them will not

 8   necessarily obtain, and they are not in any of the

 9   briefs.   To use the Toyota example, there simply is no

10   other defense.   There is none.          Fair use doesn't apply

11   to the vast majority of the scenarios that I've just

12   described.

13                 Finally, outsourcing:          Congress did not want

14   U.S. jobs to go overseas.        Congress in the very same

15   statute in section 601 was hoarding manufacturing jobs

16   to the United States; and as the government said on the

17   last page of its Quality King, "it is highly unlikely

18   that the same Congress that hoarded jobs in the United

19   States was prepared to tolerate a situation in which

20   there was eternal downstream control" that the copyright

21   owners would be encouraged to seize by sending jobs

22   overseas.

23                 So unless there are further questions from

24   the Court -- I saw, I just realized I said the same

25   thing twice incorrectly to Justice Ginsburg.           905 and


                                     53

 1   906 are examples of international -- exhaustion.

 2               Unless there are further questions, I thank

 3   the Court and respectfully request that the Court

 4   reverse the judgment below.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel,

 6   counsel.
