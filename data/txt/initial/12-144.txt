 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    We'll hear argument

 4   this morning in Case 12-144, Hollingsworth v. Perry.

 5               Mr. Cooper?

 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES J. COOPER

 7                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 8               MR. COOPER:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 9   and may it please the Court:

10               New York's highest court, in a case similar

11   to this one, remarked that until quite recently, it was

12   an accepted truth for almost everyone who ever lived in

13   any society in which marriage existed.                    Marriage -

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Mr. Cooper, we have

15   jurisdictional and merits issues here.                    Maybe it'd be

16   best if you could begin with the standing issue.

17               MR. COOPER:         I'd be happy to,

18   Mr. Chief Justice.

19               Your Honor, the official proponents of

20   Proposition 8, the initiative, have standing to defend

21   that measure before this Court as representatives of the

22   people and the State of California to defend the

23   validity of a measure that they brought forward.

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Have we ever granted

25   standing to proponents of ballot initiatives?

                                      3

 1                 MR. COOPER:        No, Your Honor, the Court has

 2   not done that, but the Court has never had before it a

 3   clear expression from a unanimous State's high court

 4   that -

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Well, this is -- this

 6   is -- the concern is certainly, the proponents are

 7   interested in getting it on the ballot and seeing that

 8   all of the proper procedures are followed, but once it's

 9   passed, they have no proprietary interest in it.                It's

10   law for them just as it is for everyone else.                So how

11   are they distinguishable from the California citizenry

12   in general?

13                 MR. COOPER:        They're distinguishable, Your

14   Honor, because the Constitution of the State of

15   California and its election code provide, according to

16   the unanimous interpretation of the California Supreme

17   Court, that the official proponents, in addition to the

18   other official responsibilities and authorities that

19   they have in the initiative process, that those official

20   proponents also have the authority and the

21   responsibility to defend the validity of that

22   initiative -

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I guess the attorney

24   general of this State doesn't have any proprietary

25   interest either, does he?

 1                 MR. COOPER:        No, Your Honor, nor did -

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But -- but he can defend

 3   it, can't he -

 4                 MR. COOPER:        -- nor did -

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- because the law says he

 6   can defend it.

 7                 MR. COOPER:        That's right, Your Honor.      Nor

 8   did the legislative leaders in the Karcher case have -

 9                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            Could the State -

10                 MR. COOPER: -- any particular enforcement -

11                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            -- could -- could the State

12   assign to any citizen the rights to defend a judgment of

13   this kind?

14                 MR. COOPER:        Justice Kagan, that would be

15   a -- a very tough question.              It's -- it's by no means

16   the question before the Court because -- because it

17   isn't any citizen.     It's -- it is the -- it is the

18   official proponents that have a specific and -- and

19   carefully detailed -

20                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, I just -- if you would

21   on the hypothetical:       Could a State just assign to

22   anybody the ability to do this?

23                 MR. COOPER:        Your Honor, I think it very

24   well might.    It very well might be able to decide that

25   any citizen could step forward and represent the

                                        5

 1   interests of the State and the people in that State -

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Well, that would

 3   be -- I'm sorry, are you finished?

 4                MR. COOPER:        Yes, Your Honor.

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Okay.   That -- that

 6   may be true in terms of who they want to represent,

 7   but -- but a State can't authorize anyone to proceed in

 8   Federal court because that would leave the definition

 9   under Article III of the Federal Constitution as to who

10   can bring -- who has standing to bring claims up to each

11   State.   And I don't think we've ever allowed anything

12   like that.

13                MR. COOPER:        But -- but, Your Honor, I guess

14   the point I want to make is that there is no question

15   the State has standing.         The State itself has standing

16   to represent its own interests in the validity of its

17   own enactments.   And if the State's public officials

18   decline to do that, it is within the State's authority

19   surely, I would submit, to identify, if not all -- any

20   citizen or at least supporter of -- of the measure,

21   certainly those, that that very clear and identifiable

22   group of citizens -

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, the Chief -- the

24   Chief Justice and Justice Kagan have given a proper

25   hypothetical to test your theory.                      But in this case the

                                       6

 1   proponents, number one, must give their official

 2   address, they must pay money, and they must all act in

 3   unison under California law.              So these five proponents

 4   were required at all times to act in unison, so that

 5   distinguishes -- and to register and to pay money for

 6   the -- so in that sense it's different from simply

 7   saying any citizen.

 8               MR. COOPER:         But of course it is, and I

 9   think the key -

10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                But can you tell me -

11   that's a factual background with respect to their right

12   to put the ballot initiative on the ballot, but how does

13   it create an injury to them separate from that of every

14   other taxpayer to have laws enforced?

15               MR. COOPER:         Your Honor, the -- the question

16   before the Court, I would submit, is not the injury to

17   the individual proponents, it's the injury to the State.

18   The -- the legislators in the Karcher case had no

19   individual particularized injury, and yet this Court

20   recognized they were proper representatives of the

21   State's interests -- the State's injury -

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                At least one of the

23   amici have suggested that it seems counterintuitive to

24   think that the State is going to delegate to people who

25   don't have a fiduciary duty to them.                   That it's going to

                                       7

 1   delegate the responsibility of representing the State to

 2   individuals who have their own views.                     They proposed the

 3   ballot initiative because it was their individual views,

 4   not necessarily that of the State.                      So -

 5                 MR. COOPER:        Well -

 6                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               -- Justice Scalia

 7   proffered the question of the Attorney General.                     The

 8   Attorney General has no personal interest.

 9                 MR. COOPER:        True.

10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               He has a fiduciary

11   obligation.

12                 MR. COOPER:        The Attorney General, whether

13   it's a fiduciary obligation or not, is in normal

14   circumstances the representative of the State to defend

15   the validity of the State's enactments when they are

16   challenged in Federal court.               But when that officer

17   doesn't do so, the State surely has every authority and

18   I would submit the responsibility to identify

19   particularly in an initiative -- an initiative context.

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Why isn't the fiduciary

21   duty requirements before the State can designate a

22   representative important?

23                 MR. COOPER:        Your Honor, I would submit to

24   you that I don't think there's anything in Article III

25   or in any of this Court's decisions that suggest that a

                                        8

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   representative of a State must be -- have a fiduciary

 2   duty, but I would also suggest -

 3                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, generally you

 4   don't need to specify it because generally the people

 5   who get to enforce the legislation of the government are

 6   people who are in government positions elected by the

 7   people.

 8                 MR. COOPER:        And Your Honor -

 9                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Here these individuals

10   are not elected by the people or appointed by the

11   people.

12                 MR. COOPER:        And the California Supreme

13   Court specifically addressed and rejected that specific

14   argument.    They said it is in the context when the

15   public officials, the elected officials, the appointed

16   officials, have declined, have declined to defend a

17   statute.    A statute that, by the way, excuse me, in this

18   case a constitutional amendment, was brought forward by

19   the initiative process.

20                 The Court said it is essential to the

21   integrity, integrity of the initiative process in that

22   State, which is a precious right of every citizen.                   The

23   initiative process in that State, to ensure that when

24   public officials -- and after all, the initiative

25   process is designed to control those very public

                                        9

 1   officials, to take issues out of their hands.

 2               And if public officials could effectively

 3   veto an initiative by refusing to appeal it, then the

 4   initiative process would be invalidated.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:             That's -- historically, I

 6   think, 40 States, many States have what was called a

 7   public action.   A public action is an action by any

 8   citizen primarily to vindicate the interest in seeing

 9   that the law is enforced.

10               MR. COOPER:         In California -

11               JUSTICE BREYER:             Now, that's the kind of

12   action I think that this Court has interpreted the

13   Constitution of the United States, case in controversy,

14   to say that it does not lie in the Federal system.

15               And of course, if that kind of action is the

16   very kind that does not lie, well, then to say, but they

17   really feel it's important that the law be enforced,

18   they really want to vindicate the process, and these are

19   people of special interests.              They -- we found the five

20   citizens who most strongly want to vindicate the

21   interest in the law being enforced and the process for

22   making the law be enforced, well, that won't distinguish

23   it from a public action.

24               But then you say, but also they are

25   representing the State.         At this point, the Dellinger

                                      10

 1   brief which takes the other side of it is making a

 2   strong argument, well, they aren't the State.                    They are

 3   really no more than a group of five people who feel

 4   really strongly that we should vindicate this public

 5   interest and have good reason for thinking it.

 6               So you have read all these arguments that

 7   it's not really the agent and so forth.                    What do you

 8   want to say about it?

 9               MR. COOPER:        What I want to say, Your Honor,

10   is that according to the California Supreme Court, the

11   California Constitution says in terms that among the

12   responsibilities of official proponents, in addition to

13   the many other responsibilities that they step forward

14   and they assume in the initiative process, among those

15   responsibilities and authorities is to defend that

16   initiative if the public officials, which the initiative

17   process is designed to control, have refused to do it.

18   It might as well say it in those terms, Your Honor.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Counsel, if you want

20   to proceed to the merits, you should feel free to do so.

21               MR. COOPER:        Thank you very much, Your

22   Honor.

23               My -- my -- excuse me.                    As I was saying, the

24   accepted truth -- excuse me.             The accepted truth that -

25   that the New York high court observed is one that is

                                     11

 1   changing and changing rapidly in this country as people

 2   throughout the country engage in an earnest debate over

 3   whether the age-old definition of marriage should be

 4   changed to include same-sex couples.

 5               The question before this Court is whether

 6   the Constitution puts a stop to that ongoing democratic

 7   debate and answers this question for all 50 States.                 And

 8   it does so only if the Respondents are correct that no

 9   rational, thoughtful person of goodwill could possibly

10   disagree with them, in good faith, on this agonizingly

11   difficult issue.

12               The issues, the constitutional issues that

13   have been presented to the Court, are not of first

14   impression here.   In Baker v. Nelson, this Court

15   unanimously dismissed for want of a substantial Federal

16   question.

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Mr. Cooper, Baker v.

18   Nelson was 1971.   The Supreme Court hadn't even decided

19   that gender-based classifications get any kind of

20   heightened scrutiny.

21               MR. COOPER:          That is -

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:                And the same-sex intimate

23   conduct was considered criminal in many States in 1971,

24   so I don't think we can extract much in Baker v. Nelson.

25               MR. COOPER:          Well, Your Honor, certainly I

 1   acknowledge the precedential limitations of a summary

 2   dismissal.   But Baker v. Nelson also came fairly fast on

 3   the heels of the Loving decision.                      And, Your Honor, I

 4   simply make the observation that it seems implausible in

 5   the extreme, frankly, for nine justices to have -- to

 6   have seen no substantial Federal question if it is true,

 7   as the Respondents maintain, that the traditional

 8   definition of marriage, insofar as -- insofar as it does

 9   not include same-sex couples, insofar as it is a gender

10   definition, is irrational and can only be explained -

11   can only be explained, as a result of anti-gay malice

12   and a bare desire to harm.

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Do you believe this can be

14   treated as a gender-based classification?

15                MR. COOPER:        Your Honor, I -

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             It's a difficult question

17   that I've been trying to wrestle with it.

18                MR. COOPER:        Yes, Your Honor.               And we do

19   not.   We do not think it is properly viewed as a

20   gender-based classification.              Virtually every appellate

21   court, State and Federal, with one exception, Hawaii, in

22   a superseded the opinion, has agreed that it is not a

23   gender-based classification, but I guess it is gender

24   -based in the sense that marriage itself is a gendered

25   institution, a gendered term.               And so in the same way

                                      13

 1   that fatherhood is gendered or motherhood is gendered,

 2   it's gendered in that sense.

 3               But we -- we agree that to the extent that

 4   the classification impacts, as it clearly does, same-sex

 5   couples, that -- that classification can be viewed as

 6   being one of sexual orientation rather than -

 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Outside of the -

 8   outside of the marriage context, can you think of any

 9   other rational basis, reason for a State using sexual

10   orientation as a factor in denying homosexuals benefits

11   or imposing burdens on them?             Is there any other

12   rational decision-making that the government could make?

13   Denying them a job, not granting them benefits of some

14   sort, any other decision?

15               MR. COOPER:        Your Honor, I cannot.          I do not

16   have any -- anything to offer you in that regard.                  I

17   think marriage is -

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               All right.   If that -

19   if that is true, then why aren't they a class?                If

20   they're a class that makes any other discrimination

21   improper, irrational, then why aren't we treating them

22   as a class for this one thing?               Are you saying that the

23   interest of marriage is so much more compelling than any

24   other interest as they could have?

25               MR. COOPER:        No, Your Honor, we certainly

                                     14

 1   are not.     We -- we are saying the interest in marriage

 2   and the -- and the State's interest and society's

 3   interest in what we have framed as responsible pro -

 4   procreation is -- is vital, but at bottom, with respect

 5   to those interests, our submission is that same-sex

 6   couples and opposite-sex couples are simply not

 7   similarly situated.

 8                  But to come back to your precise question, I

 9   think, Justice Sotomayor, you're -- you're probing into

10   whether or not sexual orientation ought to be viewed as

11   a quasi-suspect or suspect class, and our position is

12   that it does not qualify under this Court's standard

13   and -- and traditional tests for identifying

14   suspectedness.     The -- the class itself is -- is quite

15   amorphous.     It defies consistent definition as -- as the

16   Plaintiffs' own experts were -- were quite vivid on.

17   It -- it does not -- it -- it does not qualify as an

18   accident of birth, immutability in that -- in that

19   sense.

20                  Again, the Plaintiffs -

21                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So you -- so what -- I

22   don't quite understand it.               If you're not dealing with

23   this as a class question, then why would you say that

24   the government is not free to discriminate against them?

25                  MR. COOPER:        Well, Your Honor, I would think

                                        15

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that -- that -- I think it's a -- it's a very different

 2   question whether or not the government can proceed

 3   arbitrarily and irrationally with respect to any group

 4   of people, regardless of whether or not they qualify

 5   under this Court's traditional test for suspectedness.

 6   And -- and the hypothetical I understood you to be

 7   offering, I would submit would create -- it would -

 8   unless there's something that -- that is not occurring

 9   to me immediately, an arbitrary and capricious

10   distinction among similarly situated individuals,

11   that -- that is not what we think is at the -- at the

12   root of the traditional definition of marriage.

13                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Cooper, could I just

14   understand your argument.           As -- in reading the briefs,

15   it seems as though your principal argument is that

16   same-sex and opposite -- sex couples are not similarly

17   situated because opposite-sex couples can procreate,

18   same-sex couples cannot, and the State's principal

19   interest in marriage is in regulating procreation.                Is

20   that basically correct?

21                MR. COOPER:        I -- Your Honor, that's the

22   essential thrust of our -- our position, yes.

23                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Is -- is there -- so you

24   have sort of a reason for not including same-sex

25   couples.   Is there any reason that you have for

                                      16

 1   excluding them?     In other words, you're saying, well, if

 2   we allow same-sex couples to marry, it doesn't serve the

 3   State's interest.     But do you go further and say that it

 4   harms any State interest?

 5                  MR. COOPER:        Your Honor, we -- we go further

 6   in -- in the sense that it is reasonable to be very

 7   concerned that redefining marriage to -- as a genderless

 8   institution could well lead over time to harms to that

 9   institution and to the interests that society has

10   always -- has -- has always used that institution to

11   address.   But, Your Honor, I -

12                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, could you explain that

13   a little bit to me, just because I did not pick this up

14   in your briefs.

15                  What harm you see happening and when and how

16   and -- what -- what harm to the institution of marriage

17   or to opposite-sex couples, how does this cause and

18   effect work?

19                  MR. COOPER:        Once again, I -- I would

20   reiterate that we don't believe that's the correct legal

21   question before the Court, and that the correct question

22   is whether or not redefining marriage to include

23   same-sex couples would advance the interests of marriage

24   as a -

25                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, then are -- are you

 1   conceding the point that there is no harm or denigration

 2   to traditional opposite-sex marriage couples?                So you're

 3   conceding that.

 4               MR. COOPER:           No, Your Honor, no.       I'm not

 5   conceding that.

 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:                Well, but, then it -- then

 7   it seems to me that you should have to address Justice

 8   Kagan's question.

 9               MR. COOPER:           Thank you, Justice Kennedy.         I

10   have two points to make on them.

11               The first one is this, the Plaintiffs'

12   expert acknowledged that redefining marriage will have

13   real-world consequences, and that it is impossible for

14   anyone to foresee the future accurately enough to know

15   exactly what those real-world consequences would be.

16   And among those real-world consequences, Your Honor, we

17   would suggest are adverse consequences.

18               But consider the California voter, in 2008,

19   in the ballot booth, with the question before her

20   whether or not this age-old bedrock social institution

21   should be fundamentally redefined, and knowing that

22   there's no way that she or anyone else could possibly

23   know what the long-term implications of a profound

24   redefinition of a bedrock social institution would be.

25   That is reason enough, Your Honor, that would hardly be

                                        18

 1   irrational for that voter to say, I believe that this

 2   experiment, which is now only fairly four years old,

 3   even in Massachusetts, the oldest State that is

 4   conducting it, to say, I think it better for California

 5   to hit the pause button and await additional information

 6   from the jurisdictions where this experiment is still

 7   maturing.

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Mr. Cooper, let me -- let

 9   me give you one -- one concrete thing.                  I don't know why

10   you don't mention some concrete things.                  If you redefine

11   marriage to include same-sex couples, you must -- you

12   must permit adoption by same-sex couples, and there's -

13   there's considerable disagreement among -- among

14   sociologists as to what the consequences of raising a

15   child in a -- in a single-sex family, whether that is

16   harmful to the child or not.               Some States do not -- do

17   not permit adoption by same-sex couples for that reason.

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:                California -- no,

19   California does.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:              I don't think we know the

21   answer to that.    Do you know the answer to that, whether

22   it -- whether it harms or helps the child?

23               MR. COOPER:          No, Your Honor.          And there's -

24   there's -

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:              But that's a possible

                                       19

 1   deleterious effect, isn't it?

 2                 MR. COOPER:         Your Honor, it -- it is

 3   certainly among the -

 4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:               It wouldn't be in

 5   California, Mr. Cooper, because that's not an issue, is

 6   it?   In California, you can have same-sex couples

 7   adopting a child.

 8                 MR. COOPER:         That's right, Your Honor.           That

 9   is true.   And -- but -- but, Your Honor, here's -

10   here's the point -

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             I -- it's true, but

12   irrelevant.    They're arguing for a nationwide rule which

13   applies to States other than California, that every

14   State must allow marriage by same-sex couples.                    And so

15   even though States that believe it is harmful -- and I

16   take no position on whether it's harmful or not, but it

17   is certainly true that -- that there's no scientific

18   answer to that question at this point in time.

19                 MR. COOPER:         And -- and that, Your Honor, is

20   the point I am trying to make, and it is the

21   Respondents' responsibility to prove, under rational

22   basis review, not only that -- that there clearly will

23   be no harm, but that it's beyond debate that there will

24   be no harm.

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Mr. Cooper, you are

 1   defending -- you are opposing a judgment that applies to

 2   California only, not to all of the States.

 3               MR. COOPER:          That's true, Your Honor.         And

 4   if there were a way to -- to cabin the arguments that

 5   are being presented to you to California, then the

 6   concerns about redefining marriage in -- in California

 7   could be confined to California, but they cannot, Your

 8   Honor.

 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:               I -- I think there's -

10   there's substantial -- that there's substance to the

11   point that sociological information is new.                 We have

12   five years of information to weigh against 2,000 years

13   of history or more.

14               On the other hand, there is an immediate

15   legal injury or legal -- what could be a legal injury,

16   and that's the voice of these children.                 There are some

17   40,000 children in California, according to the Red

18   Brief, that live with same-sex parents, and they want

19   their parents to have full recognition and full status.

20   The voice of those children is important in this case,

21   don't you think?

22               MR. COOPER:          Your Honor, I certainly would

23   not dispute the importance of that consideration.                 That

24   consideration especially in the political process where

25   this issue is being debated and will continue to be

 1   debated, certainly, in California.                      It's being debated

 2   elsewhere.   But on that -- on that specific question,

 3   Your Honor, there -- there simply is no data.

 4                In fact, their expert agreed there is no

 5   data, no study, even, that would examine whether or not

 6   there is any incremental beneficial effect from marriage

 7   over and above the domestic partnership laws that were

 8   enacted by the State of California to recognize,

 9   support, and honor same-sex relationships and their

10   families.    There is simply no data at all that would -

11   that would permit one to draw -- draw that conclusion.

12                I would recall, Justice Kennedy, the point

13   made in Romer, that under a rational basis of review,

14   the provision will be sustained even if it operates to

15   the disadvantage of a group, if it is -- if it otherwise

16   advances rationally a legitimate State interest.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Mr. Cooper, we will

18   afford you more time.        You shouldn't worry about losing

19   your rebuttal time, but please continue on.

20                MR. COOPER:         Oh -

21                JUSTICE BREYER:             As long as you are on that,

22   then I would like to ask you this, assume you could

23   distinguish California, suppose we accept your argument

 1   California.    What precisely is the way in which allowing

 2   gay couples to marry would interfere with the vision of

 3   marriage, as procreation of children, that allowing

 4   sterile companies -- couples of different sexes to marry

 5   would not?

 6                 I mean, there are lots of people who get

 7   married who can't have children.                   To take a State that

 8   does allow adoption and say -- there, what is the

 9   justification for saying no gay marriage?                   Certainly not

10   the one you said, is it?

11                 MR. COOPER:        You're -

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Am I not clear?

13                 Look, you said that the problem is marriage

14   as an institution that furthers procreation.

15                 MR. COOPER:        Yes, Your Honor.

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:            And the reason there was

17   adoption, but that doesn't apply to California.                   So

18   imagine I wall off California and I'm looking just

19   there, where you say that doesn't apply.                   Now, what

20   happens to your argument about the institution of

21   marriage as a tool towards procreation?                   Given the fact

22   that, in California, too, couples that aren't gay, but

23   can't have children get married all the time.

24                 MR. COOPER:        Yes, Your Honor.           The concern

25   is that redefining marriage as a genderless institution

 1   will sever its abiding connection to its historic

 2   traditional procreative purposes and it will refocus,

 3   refocus the purpose of marriage and the definition of

 4   marriage away from the raising of children and to the

 5   emotional needs and desires of adults -- of adult

 6   couples.

 7                  Suppose, in turn -

 8                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, suppose a State

 9   said -- Mr. Cooper, suppose a State said that because we

10   think that the focus of marriage really should be on

11   procreation, we are not going to give marriage licenses

12   anymore to any couple where both people are over the age

13   of 55.     Would that be constitutional?

14                  MR. COOPER:        No, Your Honor, it would not be

15   constitutional.

16                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Because that's the same

17   State interest, I would think, you know.                 If you are

18   over the age of 55, you don't help us serve the

19   government's interest in regulating procreation through

20   marriage.     So why is that different?

21                  MR. COOPER:        Your Honor, even with respect

22   to couples over the age of 55, it is very rare that both

23   couples -- both parties to the couple are infertile, and

24   the traditional -

 1                JUSTICE KAGAN:             No, really, because if the

 2   couple -- I can just assure you, if both the woman and

 3   the man are over the age of 55, there are not a lot of

 4   children coming out of that marriage.

 5                (Laughter.)

 6                MR. COOPER:         Your Honor, society's -

 7   society's interest in responsible procreation isn't just

 8   with respect to the procreative capacities of the couple

 9   itself.   The marital norm, which imposes the -- the

10   obligations of fidelity and monogamy, Your Honor,

11   advances the interests in responsible procreation by

12   making it more likely that neither party, including the

13   fertile party to that -

14                JUSTICE KAGAN:             Actually, I'm not even -

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:             I suppose we could have a

16   questionnaire at the marriage desk when people come in

17   to get the marriage -- you know, are you fertile or are

18   you not fertile?

19                (Laughter.)

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:             I suspect this Court would

21   hold that to be an unconstitutional invasion of privacy,

22   don't you think?

23                JUSTICE KAGAN:             Well, I just asked about

24   age.   I didn't ask about anything else.                That's not an

25   -- we ask about people's age all the time.

 1                MR. COOPER:        Your Honor, and even asking

 2   about age, you would have to ask if both parties are

 3   infertile.   Again -

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Strom Thurmond was -- was

 5   not the chairman of the Senate committee when Justice

 6   Kagan was confirmed.

 7                (Laughter.)

 8                MR. COOPER:        Very few men -- very few men

 9   outlive their own fertility.              So I just -

10                JUSTICE KAGAN:            A couple where both people

11   are over the age of 55 -

12                MR. COOPER:        I -

13                JUSTICE KAGAN:            A couple where both people

14   are over the age of 55.

15                MR. COOPER:        And Your Honor, again, the

16   marital norm which imposes upon that couple the

17   obligation of fidelity -

18                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I'm sorry, where is

19   that -

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I'm sorry, maybe you

21   can finish your answer to Justice Kagan.

23                MR. COOPER:        It's designed, Your Honor, to

24   make it less likely that either party to that -- to that

25   marriage will engage in irresponsible, procreative

                                      26

 1   conduct outside of that marriage.                        Outside of that

 2   marriage.     That's the marital -- that's the marital

 3   norm.   Society has an interest in seeing a 55-year-old

 4   couple that is -- just as it has an interest of seeing

 5   any heterosexual couple that intends to engage in a

 6   prolonged period of cohabitation to reserve that until

 7   they have made a marital commitment, a marital

 8   commitment.     So that, should that union produce any

 9   offspring, it would be more likely that that child or

10   children will be raised by the mother and father who

11   brought them into the world.

12                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Cooper, we said that

13   somebody who is locked up in prison and who is not going

14   to get out has a right to marry -- has a fundamental

15   right to marry, no possibility of procreation.

16                  MR. COOPER:        Your Honor is referring, I'm

17   sure, to the Turner case, and -

18                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Yes.

19                  MR. COOPER:        -- I think that, with due

20   respect, Justice Ginsburg, way over-reads -- way

21   over-reads Turner against Safley.                        That was a case in

22   which the prison at issue -- and it was decided in the

23   specific context of a particular prison -- where there

24   were both female and male inmates, many of them minimum

25   security inmates.     It was dealing with a regulation,

 3                  The Court -- the Court here emphasized that,

 4   among the incidents of marriage that are not destroyed

 5   by that -- at least that prison context, was the

 6   expectation of eventual consummation of the marriage and

17   moment or two addressing the standing question, but

 1   unequal, and not okay.

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Mr. Olson, I cut off

 3   your friend before he could get into the merits.                     So I

 4   think it's only fair -

 5                MR. OLSON:       I was trying to avoid that, Your

 6   Honor.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I know -

 8                (Laughter.)

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, I think it's

10   only fair to treat you the same.                  Perhaps you could

11   address your jurisdictional argument?

12                MR. OLSON:       Yes.        I think that our

13   jurisdictional argument is, as we set forth in the

14   brief, California cannot create Article III standing by

15   designating whoever it wants to defend the State of

16   California in connection with the ballot.

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But this is not whoever it

18   wants.   These are five proponents of -- of the measure

19   and if we were to accept your argument, it would give

20   the State a one-way ratchet.              The State could go in and

21   make a defense, maybe a half-hearted defense of the

22   statute, and -- and then when the statute is held

23   invalid, simply -- simply leave.                  On the other hand,

24   if -- if the State loses, the State can appeal.

25                So this is a one-way ratchet as it favors

                                      29

 1   the State and allows governors and other constitutional

 2   officers in different States to thwart the initiative

 3   process.

 4                 MR. OLSON:       That's the -- that's the way the

 5   California Supreme Court saw it with respect to

 6   California law.    The governor and the Attorney General

 7   of California are elected to act in the best interests

 8   of the State of California.              They made a professional

 9   judgment given their obligations as officers of the

10   State of California.

11                 The California Supreme Court has said that

12   proponents -- and by the way, only four of the five are

13   here.   Dr. Tam withdrew from the case because of some -

14   many things he said during the election -- campaign.

15                 JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, Mr. Olson, is it your

16   position that the only people who could defend a

17   ballot -- a law that's adopted in California through the

18   ballot initiative are the Attorney General and the

19   governor, so that if the Attorney General and the

20   governor don't like the ballot initiative, it will go

21   undefended?    Is that your position?

22                 MR. OLSON:       I don't -- I don't think it's

23   quite that limited.      I think one of your colleagues

24   suggested that there could be an officer appointed.

25   There could be an appointee of the State of California

 2   State of California and the citizens of California, to

 3   represent the State of California along -

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Who -- who would appoint

 5   him?   The same governor that didn't want to defend the

 6   plebiscite?

 7                 MR. OLSON:       Well, that happens all the time.

 8   As you recall in the case of -- well, let's not spend

 9   too much time on independent counsel provisions, but -

10                 (Laughter.)

11                 MR. OLSON:       The governor -- the government

12   of the State of California frequently appoints an

13   attorney where there's a perceived conflict of

14   interest -

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I suppose -

16                 MR. OLSON:       -- and that person would have a

17   responsibility for the State and might have

18   responsibility for the attorneys' fees.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I suppose there

20   might be people out there with their own personal

21   standing, someone who performs marriages and would like

22   that to remain open to everyone but would prefer not to

23   perform same-sex marriages, or other people.                      We seem to

24   be addressing the case as if the only options are the

25   proponents here or the State.                I'm not sure there aren't

                                       31

 1   other people out there with individual personalized

 2   injury that would satisfy Article III.

 3               MR. OLSON:        There might well be in -- in a

 4   different case.   I don't know about this case.               If there

 5   was, for example, this was an initiative measure that

 6   allocated certain resources of the State of California

 7   and the people -- maybe it was a binary system of people

 8   got resources and other people didn't get resources,

 9   there could be standing.          Someone would show actual

10   injury.

11               The point, I guess, at the bottom of this is

12   the Supreme Court -- this Court, decided in

13   Raines v. Byrd that Congress couldn't specify members of

14   Congress in that context even where the measure depleted

15   or diminished powers of Congress -

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Mr. Olson, I think the

17   bottom line -

18               JUSTICE ALITO:             The States are not bound by

19   the same separation of powers doctrine that underlies

20   the Federal Constitution.           You couldn't have a Federal

21   initiative, for example.          They're free of all that.

22               So start from the proposition that a State

23   has standing to defend the constitutionality of a State

24   law -- beyond dispute.        The question then is, who

25   represents the State?

                                      32

 1                 Now, in a State that has initiative, the

 2   whole process would be defeated if the only people who

 3   could defend the statute are the elected public

 4   officials.    The whole point -- you know this better than

 5   I do because you're from California -- the whole point

 6   of the initiative process was to allow the people to

 7   circumvent public officials about whom they were

 8   suspicious.

 9                 So if you reject that proposition, what is

10   left is the proposition that the State -- State law can

11   choose some other person, some other group to defend the

12   constitutionality of a State law.                       And the California

13   Supreme Court has told us that the Plaintiffs in this

14   case are precisely those people.

15                 So how do you get around that?

16                 MR. OLSON:       The only -- that's exactly what

17   the California Supreme Court thought.                       The California

18   Supreme Court thought that it could decide that the

19   proponents, whoever they were, and this could be

20   25 years after the election, it could be one of the

21   proponents, it could be four of the proponents.                       They

22   could have an interest other than the State because they

23   have no fiduciary responsibility to the State.                       They may

24   be incurring attorneys' fees on behalf of the State or

25   on behalf of themselves, but they haven't been

                                       33

 1   appointed.   They have no official responsibility to the

 2   State.

 3                And my only argument, and I know it's a

 4   close one because California thinks that this is the

 5   system.   The California Supreme Court thought that this

 6   was a system that would be a default system.                 I'm

 7   suggesting from your decisions with respect to Article

 8   III that that takes more than that under -

 9                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Mr. Olson, I think that

10   you're not answering the fundamental fear.                 And so -

11   and -- and the amici brief that sets forth this test of

12   fiduciary duty doesn't quite either.

13                The assumption is that there are not

14   executive officials who want to defend the law.                    They

15   don't like it.    No one's going to do that.               So how do

16   you get the law defended in that situation?

17                MR. OLSON:        I don't have an answer to that

18   question unless there's an appointment process either

19   built into the system where it's an officer of

20   California or -

21                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                So why -- why isn't this

22   viewed as an appointment process that the in -- the

23   ballot initiators have now become that body?

24                MR. OLSON:        And that's the argument -

25                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                That your argument -

 1                  MR. OLSON:       That's our -- that's the

 2   argument our opponents make.                But it -- but it must be

 3   said that it happens all of the time.                    That Federal

 4   officials and State officials decide not to enforce a

 5   statute, to enforce a statute in certain ways.                    We don't

 6   then come in and decide that there's someone else ought

 7   to be in court for every particular -

 8                  JUSTICE BREYER:            What the brief says is, of

 9   course, you can appoint people.                   It's not just that you

10   appoint them, it's that the State's interest when it

11   defends a law is the interest in executing the law of

12   the State.     So all you have to do is give a person that

13   interest.     But when a person has the interest of

14   defending this law, as opposed to defending the law of

15   the State of California, there can be all kinds of

16   conflicts, all kinds of situations.

17                  That's what I got out of the brief.                 So give

18   the person that interest.             And that, they say, is what's

19   missing here.     And you'll say -- I mean, that's -

20   that's here, and you say it's missing here.

21                  MR. OLSON:       Yeah, I don't -

22                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Why is it missing here?

23                  MR. OLSON:       It is -- what is missing here

24   because you're not an officer of the State of

25   California.     You don't have a fiduciary duty to the

10                MR. OLSON:         Thank you, Your Honor.               As I

11   pointed out at the -- at the outset, this is a measure

12   that walls off the institution of marriage, which is not

13   society's right.    It's an individual right that this

14   Court again and again and again has said the right to

15   get married, the right to have the relationship of

16   marriage is a personal right.                 It's a part of the right

17   of privacy, association, liberty, and the pursuit of

18   happiness.

19                In the cases in which you've described the

20   right to get married under the Constitution, you've

21   described it as marriage, procreation, family, other

22   things like that.     So the procreation aspect, the

23   responsibility or ability or interest in procreation is

24   not a part of the right to get married.                       Now, that -

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      I'm not sure,

                                        36

 1   counsel, that it makes -- I'm not sure that it's right

 2   to view this as excluding a particular group.                    When the

 3   institution of marriage developed historically, people

 4   didn't get around and say let's have this institution,

 5   but let's keep out homosexuals.                The institution

 6   developed to serve purposes that, by their nature,

 7   didn't include homosexual couples.

 8               It is -- yes, you can say that it serves

 9   some of the other interests where it makes sense to

10   include them, but not all the interests.                    And it seems

11   to me, your friend argues on the other side, if you have

12   an institution that pursues additional interests, you

13   don't have to include everybody just because some other

14   aspects of it can be applied to them.

15               MR. OLSON:       Well, there's a couple of

16   answers to that, it seems to me, Mr. Chief Justice.                     In

17   this case, that decision to exclude gays and lesbians

18   was made by the State of California.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Oh, that's only

20   because Proposition 8 came 140 days after the California

21   Supreme Court issued its decision.

22               MR. OLSON:       That's right.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    And don't you think

24   it's more reasonable to view it as a change by the

25   California Supreme Court of this institution that's been

                                     37

 1   around since time immemorial?

 2                MR. OLSON:       The California Supreme Court,

 3   like this Supreme Court, decides what the law is.                       The

 4   California Supreme Court decided that the Equal

 5   Protection and Due Process Clauses of that California

 6   Constitution did not permit excluding gays and lesbians

 7   from the right to get married -

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:            You -- you've led me right

 9   into a question I was going to ask.                    The California

10   Supreme Court decides what the law is.                    That's what we

11   decide, right?   We don't prescribe law for the future.

12   We -- we decide what the law is.                  I'm curious, when -

13   when did -- when did it become unconstitutional to

14   exclude homosexual couples from marriage?                    1791?   1868,

15   when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted?

16                Sometimes -- some time after Baker, where we

17   said it didn't even raise a substantial Federal

18   question?   When -- when -- when did the law become this?

19                MR. OLSON:       When -- may I answer this in the

20   form of a rhetorical question?                When did it become

21   unconstitutional to prohibit interracial marriages?

22   When did it become unconstitutional to assign children

23   to separate schools.

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:            It's an easy question, I

25   think, for that one.      At -- at the time that the -- the

                                      38

 1   Equal Protection Clause was adopted.                     That's absolutely

 2   true.

 3                  But don't give me a question to my question.

 4                  (Laughter.)

 5                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            When do you think it became

 6   unconstitutional?     Has it always been unconstitutional?

 7                  MR. OLSON:       When the -- when the California

 8   Supreme Court faced the decision, which it had never

 9   faced before, is -- does excluding gay and lesbian

10   citizens, who are a class based upon their status as

11   homosexuals -- is it -- is it constitutional -

12                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            That -- that's not when it

13   became unconstitutional.            That's when they acted in an

14   unconstitutional matter -- in an unconstitutional

15   manner.     When did it become unconstitutional to prohibit

16   gays from marrying?

17                  MR. OLSON:       That -- they did not assign a

18   date to it, Justice Scalia, as you know.                     What the court

19   decided was the case that came before it -

20                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            I'm not talking about the

21   California Supreme Court.             I'm talking about your

22   argument.     You say it is now unconstitutional.

23                  MR. OLSON:       Yes.

24                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Was it always

25   unconstitutional?

 1                  MR. OLSON:       It was constitutional when we -

 2   as a culture determined that sexual orientation is a

 3   characteristic of individuals that they cannot control,

 4   and that that -

 5                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            I see.          When did that

 6   happen?     When did that happen?

 7                  MR. OLSON:       There's no specific date in

 8   time.     This is an evolutionary cycle.

 9                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, how am I supposed to

10   know how to decide a case, then -

11                  MR. OLSON:       Because the case that's before

12   you -

13                  JUSTICE SCALIA: -- if you can't give me a

14   date when the Constitution changes?

15                  MR. OLSON:       -- in -- the case that's before

16   you today, California decided -- the citizens of

17   California decided, after the California Supreme Court

18   decided that individuals had a right to get married

19   irrespective of their sexual orientation in California

20   and then the Californians decided in Proposition 8, wait

21   a minute, we don't want those people to be able to get

22   married.

23                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So -- so your

24   case -- your case would be different if Proposition 8

25   was enacted into law prior to the California Supreme

 1   Court decision?

 2                  MR. OLSON:       I would make -- I would make

 3   the -- also would make the -- that distinguishes it in

 4   one respect.     But what also -- also -- I would also make

 5   the argument, Mr. Chief Justice, that we are -- this -

 6   marriage is a fundamental right and we are making a

 7   classification based upon a status of individuals, which

 8   this Court has repeatedly decided that gays and lesbians

 9   are defined by their status.                There is no question about

10   that.

11                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            So it would be

12   unconstitutional even in States that did not allow

13   civil unions?

14                  MR. OLSON:       We do, we submit that.               You

15   could write a narrower decision.

16                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay.          So I want to know

17   how long it has been unconstitutional in those -

18                  MR. OLSON:       I don't -- when -- it seems to

19   me, Justice Scalia, that -

20                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            It seems to me you ought to

21   be able to tell me when.            Otherwise, I don't know how to

22   decide the case.

23                  MR. OLSON:       I -- I submit you've never

24   required that before.         When you decided that -- that

25   individuals -- after having decided that separate but

 1   equal schools were permissible, a decision by this

 2   Court, when you decided that that was unconstitutional,

 3   when did that become unconstitutional?

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:            50 years ago, it was okay?

 5                MR. OLSON:       I -- I can't answer that

 6   question and I don't think this Court has ever phrased

 7   the question in that way.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I can't either.    That's the

 9   problem.   That's exactly the problem.

10                MR. OLSON:       But what I have before you now,

11   the case that's before you today is whether or not

12   California can take a class of individuals based upon

13   their characteristics, their distinguishing

14   characteristics, remove from them the right of privacy,

15   liberty, association, spirituality, and identity that -

16   that marriage gives them.

17                It -- it is -- it is not an answer to say

18   procreation or anything of that nature because

19   procreation is not a part of the right to get married.

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             That's really -- that's a

21   broad argument that you -- that's in this case if the

22   Court wants to reach it.          The rationale of the Ninth

23   Circuit was much more narrow.               It basically said that

24   California, which has been more generous, more open to

25   protecting same-sex couples than almost any State in the

                                      42

 1   Union, just didn't go far enough and it's being

 2   penalized for not going far enough.

 3               That's a very odd rationale on which to

 4   sustain this opinion.

 5               MR. OLSON:          This Court has always looked

 6   into the context.     In, for example, the New Orleans case

 7   involving the gambling casinos and advertising, you look

 8   at the context of what was permitted, what was not

 9   permitted, and does that rationalization for prohibiting

10   in that case the advertising, in this case prohibiting

11   the relationship of marriage, does it make any sense in

12   the context of what exists?

13               JUSTICE ALITO:               Oh seriously, Mr. Olson,

14   if California provides all the substantive benefits of

15   marriage to same-sex domestic partnerships, are you

16   seriously arguing that if California -- if the State -

17   if the case before us now were from a State that doesn't

18   provide any of those benefits to same-sex couples, this

19   case would come out differently?

20               MR. OLSON:          No, I don't think it would come

21   out differently because of the fundamental arguments

22   we're making with respect to class-based distinctions

23   with respect to a fundamental right.                     However, to the

24   extent that my opponent in the context of California,

25   talks about child-rearing or adoptions or -- or of

                                        43

 1   rights of people to live together and that sort of

 2   thing, those arguments can't be made on behalf of

 3   California because California's already made a decision

 4   that gay and lesbian individuals are perfectly suitable

 5   as parents, they're perfectly suitable to adopt, they're

 6   raising 37,000 children in California, and the expert on

 7   the other side specifically said and testified that they

 8   would be better off when their parents were allowed to

 9   get married.

10                  JUSTICE ALITO:            I don't think you can have

11   it both ways.     Either this case is the same, this would

12   be the same if this were Utah or Oklahoma or it's

13   different because it's California and California has

14   provided all these -

15                  MR. OLSON:       I -- I think that it's not that

16   we're arguing that those are inconsistent.                      If the -- if

17   the fundamental thing is that denying gays and lesbians

18   the right of marriage, which is fundamental under your

19   decisions, that is unconstitutional.                      If it is -- if the

20   State comes forth with certain arguments -- Utah might

21   come forth with certain justifications.                      California

22   might come forth with others.                 But the fact is that

23   California can't make the arguments about adoption or

24   child-rearing or people living together because they

25   have already made policy decisions.                      So that doesn't

 1   make them inconsistent.

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So it's just

 3   about -- it's just about the label in this case.

 4                MR. OLSON:       The label is like -

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Same-sex couples

 6   have every other right, it's just about the label.

 7                MR. OLSON:       The label "marriage" means

 8   something.   Even our opponents -

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Sure.   If you

10   tell -- if you tell a child that somebody has to be

11   their friend, I suppose you can force the child to say,

12   this is my friend, but it changes the definition of what

13   it means to be a friend.

14                And that's it seems to me what the -- what

15   supporters of Proposition 8 are saying here.                      You're -

16   all you're interested in is the label and you insist on

17   changing the definition of the label.

18                MR. OLSON:       It is like you were to say you

19   can vote, you can travel, but you may not be a citizen.

20   There are certain labels in this country that are very,

21   very critical.   You could have said in the Loving case,

22   what -- you can't get married, but you can have an

23   interracial union.     Everyone would know that that was

24   wrong.   That the -- marriage has a status, recognition,

25   support, and you -- if you read the test -- you know -

 1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    How do we know -

 2   how do we know that that's the reason, or a necessary

 3   part of the reason, that we've recognized marriage as a

 4   fundamental right?      That's -- you've emphasized that and

 5   you've said, well, it's because of the emotional

 6   commitment.     Maybe it is the procreative aspect that

 7   makes it a fundamental right.

 8                  MR. OLSON:       But you have said that marriage

 9   is a fundamental right with respect to procreation and

10   at the same level getting married, privacy -- you said

11   that in the Zablocki case, you said that in the Lawrence

12   case, and you said it in other cases, the Skinner case,

13   for example.

14                  Marriage is put on a pro -- equal footing

15   with procreational aspects.               And your -- this Court is

16   the one that has said over and over again that marriage

17   means something to the individual.                       The privacy,

18   intimacy, and that it is a matter of status and

19   recognition in this -

20                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Mr. Olson, the bottom

21   line that you're being asked -- and -- and it is one

22   that I'm interested in the answer, if you say that

23   marriage is a fundamental right, what State restrictions

24   could ever exist?     Meaning, what State restrictions with

25   respect to the number of people, with respect to -- that

                                        46

 1   could get married -- the incest laws, the mother and

 2   child, assuming that they are the age -- I can -- I can

 3   accept that the State has probably an overbearing

 4   interest on -- on protecting a child until they're of

 5   age to marry, but what's left?

 6               MR. OLSON:         Well, you've said -- you've said

 7   in the cases decided by this Court that the polygamy

 8   issue, multiple marriages raises questions about

 9   exploitation, abuse, patriarchy, issues with respect to

10   taxes, inheritance, child custody, it is an entirely

11   different thing.   And if you -- if a State prohibits

12   polygamy, it's prohibiting conduct.

13               If it prohibits gay and lesbian citizens

14   from getting married, it is prohibiting their exercise

15   of a right based upon their status.                     It's selecting them

16   as a class, as you described in the Romer case and as

17   you described in the Lawrence case and in other cases,

18   you're picking out a group of individuals to deny them

19   the freedom that you've said is fundamental, important,

20   and vital in this society, and it has status and

25   to California only?

 1                  MR. OLSON:       Yes, the Ninth Circuit did that.

 2   You can decide the standing case that limits it to the

 3   decision of the district court here.                     You could decide

 4   it as the Ninth Circuit did -

 5                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             The problem -- the problem

 6   with the case is that you're really asking, particularly

 7   because of the sociological evidence you cite, for us to

 8   go into uncharted waters, and you can play with that

 9   metaphor, there's a wonderful destination, it is a

10   cliff.   Whatever that was.

11                  (Laughter.)

12                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But you're -- you're doing

13   so in a -- in a case where the opinion is very narrow.

14   Basically that once the State goes halfway, it has to go

15   all the way or 70 percent of the way, and you're doing

16   so in a case where there's a substantial question on -

17   on standing.     I just wonder if -- if the case was

18   properly granted.

19                  MR. OLSON:       Oh, the case was certainly

20   properly granted, Your Honor.                 I mean, there was a full

21   trial of all of these issues.                 There was a 12-day trial.

22   The judge insisted on evidence on all of these

23   questions.     This -- this is a -

24                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But that's not the issue

25   the Ninth Circuit decided.

 1                MR. OLSON:       The issue -- yes, the Ninth

 2   Circuit looked at it and decided because of your

 3   decision on the Romer case -- this Court's decision on

 4   the Romer case, that it could be decided on the narrower

 5   issue, but it certainly was an appropriate case to

 6   grant.   And those issues that I've been describing are

 7   certainly fundamental to the case.                     And -- and I don't

 8   want to abuse the Court's indulgence, that what I -- you

 9   suggested that this is uncharted waters.                     It was

10   uncharted waters when this Court, in 1967, in the Loving

11   decision said that interracial -- prohibitions

12   on interracial marriages, which still existed in 16

13   States, were unconstitutional.

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             It was hundreds of years

15   old in the common law countries.                  This was new to the

16   United States.

17                MR. OLSON:       And -- and what we have here -

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             So -- so that's not

19   accurate.

20                MR. OLSON:       I -- I respectfully submit that

21   we've under -- we've learned to understand more about

22   sexual orientation and what it means to individuals.                        I

 9                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              Mr. Chief Justice, and

10   may it please the Court:

11                  Proposition 8 denies gay and lesbian persons

12   the equal protection of the laws -

13                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    You don't think

14   you're going to get away with not starting with the

15   jurisdictional question, do you?

16                  (Laughter.)

17                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              As an amicus, I thought I

18   might actually, Your Honor.               And -- and, of course, we

19   didn't take a position on standing.                       We didn't -- we

20   didn't brief it.     We don't have a formal position on

21   standing, but I will offer this observation based on the

22   discussion today and the briefing.

23                  We do think that, while it's certainly not

24   free of doubt, that the better argument is that there is

25   not Article III standing here because -- I don't want to

 1   go beyond just summarizing our position, but -- because

 2   we don't have a formal position.

 3               But we do think that with respect to

 4   standing, that at this point with the initiative process

 5   over, that Petitioners really have what is more in the

 6   nature of a generalized grievance and because they're

 7   not an agent of the State of California or don't have

 8   any other official tie to the State that would -- would

 9   result in any official control of their litigation, that

10   the better conclusion is that there's not Article III

11   standing here.

12               JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, tomorrow you're going

13   to be making a standing argument that some parties think

14   is rather tenuous, but today, you're -- you're very

15   strong for Article III standing?

16               GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, we said this was

17   a -- we said this was a close question, and -- and our

18   interests are, Justice Alito, in tomorrow's issues where

19   we have briefed the matter thoroughly and will be

20   prepared to discuss it with the Court tomorrow.

21               With respect to the merits, two fundamental

22   points lead to the conclusion that there's an equal

23   protection violation here.            First, every warning flag

24   that warrants exacting scrutiny is present in this case.

25   And Petitioners' defense of Proposition 8 requires the

                                     51

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Court to ignore those warning flags and instead apply

 2   highly deferential Lee Optical rational basis review as

 3   though Proposition 8 were on a par with the law of

 4   treating opticians less favorably than optometrists,

 5   when it really is the polar opposite of such a law.

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               General Verrilli, I could

 7   understand your argument if you were talking about the

 8   entire United States, but you -- your brief says it's

 9   only eight or nine States, the States that permit civil

10   unions, and that's -- brings up a question that was

11   asked before.   So a State that has made considerable

12   progress has to go all the way, but at least the

13   government's position is, if it has done -- the State

14   has done absolutely nothing at all, then it's -- it can

15   do -- do as it will.

16               GENERAL VERRILLI:               I -- that gets to my

17   second point, Your Honor, which is that I do think the

18   problem here with the arguments that Petitioners are

19   advancing is that California's own laws do cut the legs

20   out from under all of the justifications that

21   Petitioners have offered in defense of Proposition 8.

22   And I understand Your Honor's point and the point that

23   Justice Kennedy raised earlier, but I do think this

24   Court's equal protection jurisprudence requires the

25   Court to evaluate the interests that the State puts

                                      52

 1   forward, not in a vacuum, but in the context of the

 2   actual substance of California law.

 3                 And here, with respect to California law,

 4   gay and lesbian couples do have the legal rights and

 5   benefits of marriage, full equality and adoption, full

 6   access to assistive reproduction, and therefore, the

 7   argument about the State's interests that -- that

 8   Petitioners advance have to be tested against that

 9   reality, and -- and they just don't measure up.                       None of

10   the -

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, the argument -

12                 JUSTICE ALITO:             None of the -

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Justice Breyer.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:             What is the one -- look, a

15   State that does nothing for gay couples hurts them much

16   more than a State that does something.                       And, of course,

17   it's true that it does hurt their argument that they do

18   quite a lot, but which are their good arguments, in your

19   opinion?   I mean, take a State that really does nothing

20   whatsoever.

21                 They have no benefits, no nothing, no

22   nothing.   Okay?    And moreover, if -- if you're right,

23   even in California, if they have -- if they're right

24   or -- you know, if a pact is enough, they won't get

25   Federal benefits.     Those that are tied to marriage

                                        53

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   because they're not married.             So -- so a State that does

 2   nothing hurts them much more, and yet your brief seems

 3   to say it's more likely to be justified under the

 4   Constitution.

 5               I'd like to know with some specificity how

 6   that could be.

 7               GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, because you have to

 8   measure the -- under the standard of equal protection

 9   scrutiny that we think this Court's cases require.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:            I know the principle, but

11   I'm saying which are their good arguments, in your

12   opinion, that would be good enough to overcome for the

13   State that does nothing, but not good enough to overcome

14   California where they do a lot?

15               GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, we -- what we're -

16   what we're saying about that is that we're not prepared

17   to close the door to an argument in another State where

18   the State's interests haven't cut the legs out from

19   under the arguments.     And I think -- I suppose the

20   caution rationale that Mr. Cooper identified with

21   respect to the effects on children, if it came up in a

22   different case with a different record, after all here,

23   this case was litigated by Petitioners on the theory

24   that rational basis applied and they didn't need to show

25   anything and so they didn't try to show anything.

                                     54

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                  Our view is that heightened scrutiny should

 2   apply and so I don't want to -- I don't want to kid

 3   about this, we understand, that would be a very heavy

 4   burden for a State to meet.               All we're suggesting is

 5   that in a situation in which the -- the State interests

 6   aren't cut out from under it, as they -- as they are

 7   here, that that issue ought to remain open for a future

 8   case.   And I -- and I think the caution rationale would

 9   be the one place where we might leave it open.                  But you

10   can't leave it open in this case.

11                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               General, there is an

12   irony in that, which is the States that do more have

13   less rights.

14                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well -- well, I

15   understand that, Your Honor, but I do think that you

16   have to think about the claim of right on the other side

17   of the equation here.         And in this situation,

18   California -- the argument here that -- that gay and

19   lesbian couples can be denied access to marriage on the

20   ground of an interest in responsible procreation and

21   child rearing just can't stand up given that the parents

22   have full equality, the gay and lesbian parents have

23   full equality apart from -

24                  JUSTICE ALITO:            You want us to assess the

25   effects of same-sex marriage, the potential effects

 1   on -- of same-sex marriage, the potential -- the effects

 2   of Proposition 8.     But what is your response to the

 3   argument, which has already been mentioned about the

 4   need to be cautious in light of the newness of the -

 5   the concept of -- of same-sex marriage?

 6                  The one thing that the parties in this case

 7   seem to agree on is that marriage is very important.

 8   It's thought to be a fundamental building block of

 9   society and its preservation essential for the

10   preservation of society.            Traditional marriage has been

11   around for thousands of years.                  Same-sex marriage is

12   very new.     I think it was first adopted in The

13   Netherlands in 2000.        So there isn't a lot of data about

14   its effect.     And it may turn out to be a -- a good

15   thing.   It may turn out not to be a good thing, as the

16   supporters of Proposition 8 apparently believe.

17                  But you want us to step in and render a

18   decision based on an assessment of the effects of this

19   institution, which is newer than cell phones or the

20   Internet?     I mean we -- we are not -- we do not have the

21   ability to see the future.

22                  On a question like that, of such fundamental

23   importance, why should it not be left for the people,

24   either acting through initiatives and referendums or

25   through their elected public officials?

 1                GENERAL VERRILLI:              I have four points I

 2   would like to make to that in response to that,

 3   Justice Alito, and I think they are all important.

 4                First, California did not, through

 5   Proposition 8, do what my friend Mr. Cooper said and

 6   push a pause button.       They pushed a delete button.              This

 7   is a permanent ban.      It's in the Constitution.            It's

 8   supposed to take this issue out from the legislative

 9   process.   So that's the first point.

10                Second -

11                JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, just in response to

12   that, of course the Constitution could be amended,

13   and -- and I think I read that the California

14   Constitution has been amended 500 times.

15                GENERAL VERRILLI:              But the -

16                JUSTICE ALITO:            So it's not exactly like the

17   U.S. Constitution.

18                GENERAL VERRILLI:              But it does -- of course

19   not.   But it is -- but the aim of this is to take it out

20   of the normal legislative process.

21                The second point is that, with respect to

22   concerns that Your Honor has raised, California has been

23   anything but cautious.        It has given equal parenting

24   rights, equal adoption rights.                Those rights are on the

25   books in California now and so the interest of

                                      57

 1   California is -- that Petitioners are articulating, with

 2   respect to Proposition 8, has to be measured in that

 3   light.

 4                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yeah, but the rest of the

 5   country has been cautious.

 6                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              And -- and that's why -

 7                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            And we're -- and you are

 8   asking us to impose this on the whole country, not just

 9   California.

10                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              No, respectfully

11   Justice Scalia, we are not.               Our position is narrower

12   than that.     Our position -- the position we have taken,

13   is about States, it applies to States that have, like

14   California and perhaps other States, that have granted

15   these rights short of marriage, but -

16                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I don't want to -- I

17   want you to get back to Justice Alito's other points,

18   but is it the position of the United States that

19   same-sex marriage is not required throughout the

20   country?

21                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              We are not -- we are not

22   taking the position that it is required throughout the

23   country.     We think that that ought to be left open for a

24   future adjudication in other States that don't have the

25   situation California has.

 1                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            So your -- your position is

 2   only if a State allows civil unions does it become

 3   unconstitutional to forbid same-sex marriage, right?

 4                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              I -- I see my red light

 5   is on.

 6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, you can go on.

 7                  GENERAL VERRILLI:              Thank you.

 8                  Our position is -- I would just take out a

 9   red pen and take the word "only" out of that sentence.

10   When that is true, then the Equal Protection Clause

11   forbids the exclusion of same-sex marriage and it's an

12   open question otherwise.

13                  And if I could just get to the third reason,

14   which I do think is quite significant.

15                  The -- the argument here about caution is an

16   argument that, well, we need to wait.                       We understand

17   that.     We take it seriously.             But waiting is not a

18   neutral act.     Waiting imposes real costs in the here and

19   now.     It denies to the -- to the parents who want to

20   marry the ability to marry, and it denies to the

21   children, ironically, the very thing that Petitioners

22   focus on is at the heart of the marriage relationship.

23                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But you are willing

24   to wait in the rest of the country.                       You saying it's got

25   to happen right now in California, but you don't even

 1   have a position about whether it's required in the rest

 2   of the country.

 3                GENERAL VERRILLI:              It -- if, with respect to

 4   a State that allows gay couples to have children and to

 5   have families and then denies the stabilizing effect -

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So it's got to

 7   happen right away in those States where same-sex couples

 8   have every legal right that married couples do.

 9                GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, we think -

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But you can wait in

11   States where they have fewer legal rights.

12                GENERAL VERRILLI:              What I said is it's an

13   open question with respect to those States and the Court

14   should wait and see what kind of a record a State could

15   make.   But in California you can't make the record to

16   justify the exclusion.

17                And the fourth point I would make on this,

18   recognizing that these situations are not -

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               How would the record be

20   different elsewhere?

21                GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, they might try to

22   make a different record about the effects on children.

23   But there isn't a record to that effect here.

24                And the fourth point I would make, and I do

25   think this is significant, is that the principal

                                      60

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   argument in 1967, with respect to Loving and that the

 2   Commonwealth of Virginia advanced was, well, the social

 3   science is still uncertain about how biracial children

 4   will fare in this world, and so you ought to apply

 5   rational basis scrutiny and wait.                      And I think the Court

 6   recognized that there is a cost to waiting and that that

 7   has got to be part of the equal protection calculus.

 8   And so -- so I do think that's quite fundamental.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Can I ask you a

10   problem about -

11                GENERAL VERRILLI:              Sure.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     -- I -- it seems to

13   me that your position that you are supporting is

14   somewhat internally inconsistent.                      We see the argument

15   made that there is no problem with extending marriage to

16   same-sex couples because children raised by same-sex

17   couples are doing just fine and there is no evidence

18   that they are being harmed.

19                And the other argument is Proposition 8

20   harms children by not allowing same-sex couples to

21   marriage.   Which is it?

22                GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, I -- I think what

23   Proposition 8 does is deny the long-term stabilizing

24   effect that marriage brings.              That's -- that's the

25   argument for -- for marriage, that -

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But you also tell me

 2   there has been no harm shown to children of same-sex

 3   couples.

 4                GENERAL VERRILLI:              California -- there are

 5   37,000 children in same-sex families in California now.

 6   Their parents cannot marry and that has effects on them

 7   in the here and now.

 8                A stabilizing effect is not there.                    When

 9   they go to school, they have to -- you know -- they

10   don't have parents like everybody else's parents.

11   That's a real effect, a real cost in the here and now.

12                JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, the real cost right

13   now would be you're asking me to write these words, "a

14   State that has a pact has to say 'marriage,'"                     but I'm

15   not telling you about States that don't.                     Well, I would

16   guess there is a real-world effect there, too.                     That

17   States that are considering pacts will all say, we won't

18   do it, or not all, but some would.

19                And that would have a real effect right now.

20   And at the moment, I'm thinking it's much more harmful

21   to the gay couple, the latter than the former.                     But you

22   won't give me advice as the government as to how to deal

23   with that.

24                GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well, we -- we think

25   that, as I started my argument, Your Honor, that all the

 1   warning flags for exacting equal protection scrutiny are

 2   present here.    This is a group that has suffered a

 3   history of terrible discrimination.                      The Petitioners

 4   don't deny it.

 5                Petitioners said at the podium today that

 6   there is no justification for that discrimination in any

 7   realm other than the one posed in this case and the -

 8   and so when those two factors are present, those are

 9   paradigm considerations for the application of

10   heightened scrutiny, and so I don't want to suggest that

11   the States that haven't taken those steps -

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                But they are not the

13   only ones.

14                GENERAL VERRILLI:               -- that States that

15   haven't taken this step, that they are going to have an

16   easy time meeting heightened scrutiny, which I think has

17   to apply -

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Suppose -- suppose one of

19   those States repeals its civil union laws?

20                GENERAL VERRILLI:               It would be a different

21   case.   And all I'm saying is that the door ought to

22   remain open to that case, not that it would be easy for

23   the State to prevail in that case.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Thank you, General.

 2            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES J. COOPER

 3                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 4               MR. COOPER:           Thank you very much.

 5               JUSTICE KENNEDY:                And you might address why

 6   you think we should take and decide this case.

 7               MR. COOPER:           Yes, Your Honor, and that is

 8   the one thing on which I wholeheartedly agree with my

 9   friend Mr. Olson.     This case was properly -- is now

10   properly before the Court and was properly granted, even

11   if, even if, Your Honor, one could defend the -- the

12   specific judgment below for the Ninth Circuit, a defense

13   that I haven't heard offered to this Court.                  Judicial

14   redefinition of marriage even in -- even if it can be

15   limited to California, is well worthy of this Court's

16   attention, particularly, Your Honor, as it come from a

17   single district court judge in a single jurisdiction.

18               I would also like -

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  I think that begs

20   your -- Mr. Olson doesn't really focus on this.                     If the

21   issue is letting the States experiment and letting the

22   society have more time to figure out its direction, why

23   is taking a case now the answer?

24               MR. COOPER:           Because, Your Honor -

25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  We let issues perk and

                                        64

 1   so we let racial segregation perk for 50 years from 1898

 2   to 1954.

 3               MR. COOPER:         Your Honor, it is hard to -

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                And now we are only

 5   talking about, at most, four years.

 6               MR. COOPER:         It is hard to imagine a case

 7   that would be better, or more thoroughly, I should say,

 8   at least, briefed and argued to this Court.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:             It's too late for that, too

10   late for that now, isn't it?              I mean, we granted cert.

11   I mean, that's essentially asking -- you know, why did

12   we grant cert.   We should let it percolate for

13   another -- you know, we -- we have crossed that river, I

14   think.

15               MR. COOPER:         And in this particular case, to

16   not grant certiorari is to essentially bless a judicial

17   decision that there -- that at least in the State of

18   California, the people have no authority to step back,

19   hit the pause button, and allow the experiments that are

20   taking place in this country to further mature.                That in

21   fact, at least in California -- and it's impossible to

22   limit this ruling, Your Honor, even to California, even

23   the Solicitor General's argument, he says, applies to at

24   least eight States.

25               It's impossible to limit these -- these

                                      65

 1   propositions to any particular jurisdiction, so this

 2   Court would be making a very real decision with respect

 3   to same-sex marriage if it should simply decide to

 4   dismiss the writ as improvidently granted,

 5   Justice Kennedy.

 6                  And let's -- let's just step back and just

 7   consider for a moment the Solicitor General's argument.

 8   He is basically submitting to the Court that essentially

 9   the one compromise that is not available to the States

10   is the one that the State of California has undertaken.

11   That is, to go as far as the people possibly can in -

12   in honoring and recognizing the families and the

13   relationships of same-sex couples, while still

14   preserving the existence of traditional marriage as an

15   institution.     That's the one thing that's off the table.

16                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I thought he was saying

17   -- I thought he was saying, Mr. Cooper, that it's not

18   before the Court today.           And remember Loving against

19   Virginia was preceded by the McLaughlin case.                 So first

20   there was the question of no marriage, and then there

21   was marriage.

22                  So in that sense I understood the Solicitor

23   General to be telling us that case is not before the

24   Court today.

25                  MR. COOPER:        Forgive me, Justice Ginsburg.

 1   The case of -- what case isn't before the Court?

 2                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I think it was McLaughlin

 3   v. Florida.

 4                  MR. COOPER:        Yes.

 5                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              It was cohabitation of

 6   people of different races.

 7                  MR. COOPER:        Certainly.

 8                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And the Court took that

 9   case and waited to reach the marriage case.

10                  MR. COOPER:        It's -- yes, Your Honor.        And

11   well, forgive me, Your Honor.                 I'm not sure -- I'm not

12   sure I'm following the Court's question.

13                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I may -- my memory may be

14   wrong, but I think the case was that people of different

15   races were arrested and charged with the crime of

16   interracial cohabitation.             And the Court said that that

17   was invalid.

18                  MR. COOPER:        Yes.

19                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Unlawful.

20                  MR. COOPER:        Yes.        Thank you, Your Honor.

21   Forgive me.     And -- you know, I'm glad that counsel for

22   the Respondents mentioned the Loving case because what

23   this Court -- what this Court ultimately said was

24   patently obvious, is that the colors of the skin of the

25   spouses is irrelevant to any legitimate purpose, no more

                                        67

 1   so than their hair colors, any legitimate purpose of

 2   marriage, that interracial couples and same-race couples

 3   are similarly situated in every respect with respect to

 4   any legitimate purpose of marriage.

 5                That's what this question really boils down

 6   here, whether or not it can be said that for every

 7   legitimate purpose of marriage, are opposite-sex couples

 8   and same-sex couples indistinguishable?

 9   Indistinguishable.     And with all due respect to counsel

10   and to the Respondents, that is not a hard question.

11                If, in fact, it is true, as the people of

12   California believe that it still is true, that the

13   natural procreative capacity of opposite-sex couples

14   continues to pose vitally important benefits and risks

15   to society and that's why marriage itself is the

16   institution that society has always used to regulate

17   those heterosexual, procreative -- procreative

18   relationships.

19                Counsel -- the Solicitor General has said

20   that -- that the ban that the proposition erects in

21   California is permanent.          Well, it's -- certainly that

22   is not the view of the Respondents and what we read

23   every day.   This is not an issue that is now at rest in

24   the State of California, regardless -- well, unless this

25   Court essentially puts it to rest.                     That democratic
