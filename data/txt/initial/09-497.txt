 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   We'll hear

 4   argument first this morning in Case 09-497,

 5   Rent-A-Center West v. Jackson.

 6               Mr. Friedman.

 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT F. FRIEDMAN

 8                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. FRIEDMAN:            Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10   and may it please the Court:

11               The agreement between Antonio Jackson and

12   Rent-A-Center should be enforced as written.                      There is

13   no statutory impediment to the enforcement of the clear

14   and unmistakable agreement that gives the arbitrator

15   exclusive authority to decide Jackson's challenge to

16   enforceability, nor is there any language in the Federal

17   Arbitration Act that would prohibit the court from

18   making the determination -- prohibit the arbitrator from

19   making the determination of Jackson's challenge to

20   unconscionability.

21               Through frequent holdings of this Court

22   going back 50 years to the Steelworkers trilogy, this

23   Court has plainly recognized that parties may delegate

24   issues as to scope and validity to the arbitrator in the

25   first instance.     The district court and --

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But not to the

 2   question of which parties have agreed to arbitrate?

 3                 MR. FRIEDMAN:         I'm sorry, Your Honor.

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Not the question of

 5   which parties have agreed to arbitrate?

 6                 MR. FRIEDMAN:         Which parties can be

 7   potentially scope issues and which parties potentially

 8   as well.    In this case, the issue is enforceability.

 9   And through the holdings of First Options, Howsam, and

10   Bazzle, going back to previous decisions, this Court has

11   held that parties through clear and unmistakable

12   delegation can give that to the arbitrator in the first

13   instance.

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But if -- if fraud in the

15   inducement, I take it, is considered -- even if you have

16   a very broad arbitration clause, as we do here, fraud in

17   the inducement is considered a question for the court,

18   not the arbitrator; is that right?

19                 MR. FRIEDMAN:         That's correct, Justice

20   Ginsburg.

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So why should

22   unconscionability be treated differently?

23                 MR. FRIEDMAN:         Justice Ginsburg, fraud in

24   the inducement, pursuant to Prima Paint, goes to the

25   making of the agreement, and under section 4, the court


                                         4

 1   retains decisions over the making of the agreement.

 2   Unconscionability is a post-formation attack.                      It does

 3   not go to the very limited inquiry that is anticipated

 4   under section 4, of the making --

 5               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Why is it post-formation?

 6   Arguably, the -- one of the parties has such a strong

 7   hand that it forces the other party just to decide.

 8   It's almost like -- duress would certainly be for the

 9   court, would it not, if it's a formation issue like

10   Justice Ginsburg indicated?

11               MR. FRIEDMAN:            In some instances,

12   Justice Kennedy, duress could be; for example, a gun to

13   somebody's head.     But procedural unconscionability does

14   not go to the same issues of making.                      And, in fact, under

15   Nevada law and this State's laws --

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, I'm not sure what

17   procedural unconscionability, but this is -- as Justice

18   Ginsburg indicates, it's not clear to me why this isn't

19   a formation issue.

20               MR. FRIEDMAN:            Formation is a very basic

21   existential analysis.        It goes to mutual assent.                Did

22   the parties sign the agreement and indicate the desire

23   to be bound by the agreement?               Though --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:              I guess you could argue

25   that on its face the agreement is so one-sided, so


                                          5

 1   unconscionable, that one of the parties must have been

 2   coerced into signing it.         I guess you could make that

 3   argument, can't -- couldn't you?

 4                MR. FRIEDMAN:         Justice Scalia, you could

 5   make that argument --

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Has -- has that argument

 7   been made here?

 8                MR. FRIEDMAN:         There was an argument made

 9   that it was one-sided, but it was the same type of

10   argument that pertains --

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Was the argument made that

12   because it was so unconscionable, the employee must have

13   been coerced into making it?

14                MR. FRIEDMAN:         No, Justice Scalia.               That

15   argument was not --

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I didn't think it -- it had

17   been made.

18                MR. FRIEDMAN:         Getting back to

19   Justice Ginsburg's question about making --

20                JUSTICE STEVENS:           I'm a little puzzled.

21   What was the argument that was made?                    Why was it

22   unconscionable, if not for that reason?

23                MR. FRIEDMAN:         Justice Stevens, the argument

24   was that there was unequal bargaining power because

25   Mr. Jackson was the -- a putative employee and Rent-A-Center


                                        6

 1   was the employer.     He also complained about a couple of

 2   the provisions in the agreement, one pertaining to

 3   discovery, one pertaining to an alleged fee-splitting

 4   provision in the agreement.              He did not complain as to

 5   the terms that Justice Scalia just referred to.

 6                  With respect to making, it is a very limited

 7   inquiry, and section 4 is the provision in the Federal

 8   Arbitration Act that gives a court the power to

 9   enforce the arbitration agreement.                   Once the court is

10   satisfied that the making is not an issue and the making

11   is a very basic issue, the court, pursuant to the plain

12   language of section 4, must submit the dispute to

13   arbitration.

14                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             You have --

15                  MR. FRIEDMAN:         Now, in some instances, the

16   courts will make decisions as to attacks such as

17   unconscionability.      But in this sense --

18                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Counsel, is your problem

19   with unconscionability being -- as described by the Chief

20   Justice or Justice Scalia, being forced to or coerced

21   into signing something -- that's okay for the courts, but

22   this type of argument that goes to the unfairness of the

23   process, that's for the arbitrator; is that your

24   position?

25                  MR. FRIEDMAN:         That's -- that's right, Justice

 1   Sotomayor.

 2                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So why -- isn't that an

 3   unwieldy rule?     Isn't your quarrel with what the court

 4   defined as remissible unconscionability as a legal

 5   matter, as opposed to trying to parse out what

 6   unconscionability means otherwise?

 7                  MR. FRIEDMAN:         Well, Justice Sotomayor,

 8   unconscionability and fairness attacks go to

 9   post-formation issues that -- that are --

10                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             We just gave you one

11   that didn't:     If someone was forced into signing the

12   agreement in an unconscionable way.

13                  MR. FRIEDMAN:         But, Justice Sotomayor, if

14   for example it's fraud in the inducement, such as in

15   Prima Paint, that does go to the section 4.                      It does go

16   to the making of the agreement because there would not

17   be mutual assent if somebody was forced to enter into

18   the agreement.

19                  In contrast, unconscionability, and

20   certainly the allegations we've seen here against the

21   agreement, go to post-formation complaints, complaints

22   about the fairness of the agreement.                      They do not go to

23   the actual, very limited making of the agreement.

24                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But I suppose that

25   the substance of the agreement -- maybe this is just the


                                          8

 1   same question as Justice Scalia's.                  I suppose the

 2   substance of the agreement is evidence -- could be

 3   evidence on the unconscionability at formation.

 4                MR. FRIEDMAN:          Well --

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And that is for the

 6   court.

 7                MR. FRIEDMAN:          If -- if there is something

 8   in the agreement that would indicate that there was not

 9   mutual assent, as in somebody put a gun to somebody's

10   head, somebody forced them to do it, that would be for

11   the court.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No, the point is --

13   it's not that.   It would be the -- the provisions are so

14   one-sided that you may assume from that that the

15   formation was not voluntary.

16                MR. FRIEDMAN:          No, Mr. Chief Justice.

17   Attacks on the fairness and simply pointing to

18   provisions and saying, well, these are very unfair; it

19   must be an indication of it being forced -- no, that would

20   be for the arbitrator to decide, because it's simply an

21   attack on the fairness and there's speculation as to why

22   somebody entered.    And in this agreement --

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't agree with that.          I

24   mean, if -- if the argument is made -- I gather it

25   wasn't made here, but if the argument is made that this


                                         9

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   agreement was not voluntary, and the evidence of that

 2   involuntariness is how outrageously unfair it is -- now,

 3   I'm not sure that that's enough evidence.                   You may need

 4   some other stuff as well to -- to persuade a court.

 5                  But if that is the argument, that the

 6   one-sidedness is evidence that the agreement was not

 7   voluntary, I don't see how that's for the arbitrator.

 8                  MR. FRIEDMAN:         Justice Scalia, under the

 9   section 4 analysis, in the making there needs to be some

10   evidence that it was forced, the gun to the head

11   example.   Simply pointing to the language in the

12   agreement as evidence of that would not be enough.                   That

13   is an attack on the language of the agreement after it's

14   been formed.

15                  The section 4 analysis is very, very limited,

16   and it goes to these most basic elements.                   So the

17   language of the agreement, while certainly the party

18   opposing it will have the opportunity to make the

19   argument it's unconscionable, but that would be for the

20   arbitrator.

21                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           You don't think that could

22   be used along with other evidence?                   I think all you're

23   saying is that it is not in and of itself enough, that

24   every unfair agreement is not a coerced agreement.

25                  MR. FRIEDMAN:         It certainly would not in and


                                         10

 1   of itself be enough --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:           But you could use it as

 3   evidence if there's other evidence supporting that.

 4   Couldn't you?

 5                MR. FRIEDMAN:         Your Honor, you would have to

 6   look at the objective manifestation of mutual assent.

 7   For example, in this agreement --

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I think you can answer that

 9   yes or no.   Can you use that in addition to other

10   evidence to show that the agreement was not voluntary?

11                MR. FRIEDMAN:         Justice Scalia, I don't think

12   so.   I think you would have to look to what transpired

13   at the time the agreement was actually entered into and

14   was made.

15                JUSTICE STEVENS:           And that's no matter how

16   one-sided?   I mean, suppose the agreement provided that

17   the employee shall pay all the costs of arbitration no

18   matter who wins and also at the end of the arbitration

19   shall pay a penalty if he fails to -- it seems to me you

20   could have a really one-sided -- that would not be

21   admissible on the issue?

22                MR. FRIEDMAN:         Justice Stevens, if there is

23   an issue about arbitral access, as in there is a block

24   at the door, you cannot get a ticket to the show,

25   because of some impediment in getting to arbitration in


                                       11

 1   the first place, under the Court's principles announced

 2   in Randolph and in First Options, you must have access to

 3   the arbitrator.     So in your example, if there is

 4   something prohibiting access to the arbitrator, that

 5   would be a different story.

 6                  Getting back to Justice Scalia's question

 7   about the --

 8                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What about the specific

 9   examples he gave, that the -- just take that the -- that

10   the employee must bear all the costs of the arbitration,

11   win or lose, that's the provision.                   Would that provision

12   be enough to make the issue one for the court rather

13   than the arbitrator?

14                  MR. FRIEDMAN:         Justice Ginsburg, if it's

15   simply a complaint about the fairness, it would not be.

16   If the parties --

17                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But is it?      We don't need

18   the "if."     Tell me whether you think a provision saying

19   the employee under any and all circumstances pays all

20   costs -- would that provision make this question of

21   unconscionability one for the court rather than the

22   arbitrator?

23                  MR. FRIEDMAN:         It could, Justice Ginsburg.

24   It would not be a question of arbitrability if the party

25   opposing arbitration can meet the very heavy burden

 1   established in Randolph to show that the fees would

 2   be -- would prohibit them from actually getting to

 3   arbitration.   It would not be simply an attack as we saw

 4   here, with no evidence, that we think a term is unfair.

 5               The party opposing arbitration would have to

 6   meet their burden.      They would have to put evidence in.

 7   And, for example, in Randolph the Court stated that in

 8   certain instances Mrs. Randolph could have put evidence

 9   in, and had she put evidence in, which she did not, much

10   as in this case, if she had met her burden to show that

11   she could not have access to arbitration -- in other

12   words, if arbitration is an illusory remedy -- that

13   could be for the court to decide, because, after all,

14   even in the First Options decision, the anticipation is

15   you have a clear and unmistakably delegation that the

16   arbitrator will make a decision, and implicit in that

17   that there is an arbitrator to make that decision.

18               JUSTICE BREYER:              Yes, that's -- that's true.

19   The thing I was wondering in this case is there's a -- a

20   dispute that's about racial discrimination and so forth.

21   There's a clause, and the clause says this is

22   arbitrable, but that is being disputed because the

23   plaintiff in the case says that's an unconscionable

24   provision, so it doesn't really apply.                    And then you say

25   but now that dispute is referred to the arbitrator to


                                         13

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   just read the language.       But the plaintiff says that

 2   that language, too, is unconscionable, and as long as

 3   that language is unconscionable, then how is it clear

 4   and unmistakable that they, he, agreed to do it, because

 5   an unconscionable provision is not a provision?

 6               So if we apply First Options -- I mean, it's

 7   complicated because of the language; it's not

 8   complicated once you think it out, and -- I hope.            But

 9   just applying it very literally, it would seem to say

10   that you do not have clear and unmistakable evidence

11   that they agreed to submit this kind of dispute to

12   arbitration for the reason that what you point to is

13   itself according to them a product of unconscionability.

14   How do you -- how do you respond to that?

15               MR. FRIEDMAN:         Justice Breyer, under section

16   4, which is the enforcement mechanism, the court is

17   limited to make decisions about the making.            Once the

18   making issue is not an issue -- and it has never been an

19   issue in this case; there has never been an allegation

20   the making has been affected -- the court at that

21   point should enforce the agreement pursuant to its

22   terms.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, making itself

24   could be, but I think that's a harder question,

25   whether a -- certainly if the person says you see my


                                      14

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   signature there; that's not mine; that's Joe Banana's,

 2   who tries to imitate me -- there is no contract, and no

 3   matter what it says, it doesn't go to the arbitrator.

 4   All right?

 5                  Now, we can argue about whether it is or is

 6   not analogous to that when he claims it's

 7   unconscionable.     There's a very good argument it is

 8   analogous.     There's a very good argument it is like

 9   fraud in the inducement, and there are some arguments

10   the other way.

11                  But First Options I think cuts through that,

12   by saying whether that's true or not, unless it's clear

13   and unmistakable that they wanted this matter, the

14   matter of whether the arbitration clause itself is

15   unconscionable referred to the arbitrator, whether or

16   not they wanted that referred to the arbitrator has to

17   be clear and unmistakable.             And they are claiming no,

18   because the lack -- the provision that says that is

19   itself a product of unconscionability.                    That's to repeat

20   my question.     But, having repeated the question, why

21   isn't that the simplest, most direct, and four-sentence

22   ground for deciding this case?

23                  MR. FRIEDMAN:         Justice Breyer, Jackson, first

24   and foremost, did not ever complain that the arbitrability

25   provision, the clear and unmistakable delegation provision,


                                         15

 1   is unconscionable.

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:              He's not saying that this

 3   whole arbitration clause is unconscionable?

 4               MR. FRIEDMAN:            He's complaining that

 5   generally it's unconscionable --

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:              Well, all right.           So he's

 7   -- he's complaining the whole clause is unconscionable,

 8   and that's part of the clause.

 9               MR. FRIEDMAN:            Justice Breyer, this is really

10   very similar to First Options, in which the party said:

11   I'm not party to the agreement; the scope does not

12   cover --

13               JUSTICE BREYER:              Yes, and in First Options, we

14   said it wasn't clear and unmistakable.

15               MR. FRIEDMAN:            The Court said it was not,

16   but in First Options the Court set out the rule --

17               JUSTICE BREYER:              And the rules were what I

18   just described.

19               MR. FRIEDMAN:            The rule is -- in this case,

20   there is language that has never been contested, and that

21   language clearly and unmistakably says that the

22   arbitrator has exclusive authority.                       That language has

23   never been attacked.

24               And as to the issue of unconscionability,

25   pursuant to section 4, which gives the court the


                                         16

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   authority to send the arbitration to the arbitrator, the

 2   court should do exactly that.            It should send it to the

 3   arbitrator once the making issue is satisfied, and then

 4   the arbitrator can make that decision.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So your position is

 6   that the arbitrator gets to decide questions of

 7   unconscionability, but the court gets to decide whether

 8   the arbitrator can do that?

 9               MR. FRIEDMAN:         In some instances, Justice

10   Roberts -- Mr. Chief Justice, that is correct.                The court

11   must decide whether the agreement is made.               The court

12   must also decide whether there was a clear and

13   unmistakable delegation.        So under First Options and the

14   cases that interpret it and the cases before it, the

15   court must make the initial determination of whether

16   there is a clear and unmistakable delegation.

17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, do you understand --

18   and we can ask the Respondent.             But, as you understand

19   Jackson's case, is he saying that part of the clause,

20   part of the arbitration clause, is unconscionable, that

21   the whole clause is unconscionable or that the whole

22   contract is unconscionable?

23               MR. FRIEDMAN:         He has made generalized --

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Because the complaint is a

25   bare-bones complaint, and I don't know if there's


                                      17

 1   anything in the pleadings that reflects what his answer

 2   to that question would be.

 3                MR. FRIEDMAN:         Justice Kennedy, he has

 4   attacked certain provisions specifically of the

 5   agreement.   He is arguing about the discovery provision.

 6   He is arguing about the fees provision.                   And he is arguing

 7   about certain terms excluding claims, that bilaterally

 8   exclude claims.   So he has attacked about three

 9   provisions of the agreement specifically.

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But all of the

11   arbitration agreement, not the employment contract as a

12   whole.

13                MR. FRIEDMAN:         Justice Ginsburg, it is a

14   stand-alone four-page arbitration agreement.                   And --

15                JUSTICE BREYER:           So let's go back to that.

16   Maybe the other way is simpler.               You say you agree that

17   if my defense to this contract, which you are trying to

18   enforce against me or which gives me a right to sue you,

19   look at the argument, you put up this four-page

20   document, and I say:      Look, that is not my signature;

21   that is the signature of Joe Bananas.                   We agree that's

22   for the court.

23                MR. FRIEDMAN:         We agree, Justice Breyer.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay.       Now, we agree it's

25   for the court if my defense is, what he did is he got me


                                       18

 1   drunk, told me a bunch of lies, and I signed it.                     I

 2   grant it's my signature, but look at how squiggly it is.

 3   And my will was not a free one because I was under the

 4   influence of alcohol and lies.

 5               MR. FRIEDMAN:          We agree --

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay.       Same.     Okay.

 7   That's Prima Paint.

 8               MR. FRIEDMAN:          -- because that's part of

 9   the fraud issue.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay?       Now, he

11   says the reason that I did not sign this contract -- I

12   agree it's my signature; I agree it is not squiggly -- but

13   still my will was overborne.            What was it overborne by?

14   It was overborne by those very situations that lead

15   courts to label contracts unconscionable.                    The reason we

16   don't enforce unconscionable contract is because the

17   person who was the victim had no free will.                    He did not

18   sign it of his own accord.           And that doesn't -- there's

19   no other reason, and that's the basic reason, and

20   therefore assimilate it to the other two.                    What's your

21   response?

22               MR. FRIEDMAN:          No, Justice Breyer, that

23   would be a very different situation.                    That would be

24   allegations of procedural unconscionability, unequal

25   bargaining power, and in fact --

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Do you agree that a

 2   contract cannot be unconscionable unless it was coerced,

 3   that a finding of unconscionability is the same as a

 4   finding of coercion?        You don't agree with that, do you?

 5               MR. FRIEDMAN:            No, there could be other

 6   types of unconscionability.

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:              Yes, but that's what I want

 8   the answer to.     I know you don't agree with it.             What I

 9   want is a list of reasons why.

10               MR. FRIEDMAN:            With respect to procedural

11   unconscionability, issues of unequal economic bargaining

12   power, which is essentially what we have here -- those are

13   non-issues that cannot be addressed by the arbitrator.

14   And, in fact, under Nevada law, Justice Breyer, an

15   allegation of procedural unconscionability, no matter

16   how procedural --

17               JUSTICE BREYER:              But I'm not interested in

18   arbitration law.     I'm interested in contract law, and I

19   want to know why as a general matter of contract law an

20   allegation of unconscionability, defense of

21   unconscionability, is why is it not enough like the

22   coercion defense or the inducement defense or the "I was

23   in Alaska" defense?       Isn't it enough like that that they

24   should be treated alike?           And now you're going to say no,

25   and I want to know why not.

 1                 MR. FRIEDMAN:         It does not rise to the same

 2   level as something that's fraudulent or something that

 3   is forced with a gun to your head.

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I would have thought

 5   the answer to your -- the answer to your answer would be,

 6   well then, the -- you're more likely to win on that

 7   question.    Obviously, you are going to lose on the gun to

 8   the head, but if it's simply the economic inequality or

 9   whatever, under the State law you're probably going to

10   prevail, and they will say there is a valid contract.                  I

11   thought the -- your -- your whole point was simply it's

12   all or nothing.

13                 The courts get to decide is there a valid

14   contract or is there not.           And once they decide there

15   is, then everything else about unconscionability of

16   particular clauses is for the arbitrator.

17                 MR. FRIEDMAN:         Mr. Chief Justice, most

18   everything is for the arbitrator, and I want to

19   distinguish between unconscionability, as Justice Breyer

20   is referring to, and access issues and issues that go to

21   the making, because there is a very bright line.                  Making

22   issues go to the actual formation, mutual assent, and

23   there is obviously no mutual assent if you have a gun to

24   your head.

25                 But issues such as, well, this is unfair, I

 1   may have to do this, speculation is simply not enough

 2   to -- to pertain to the making of the agreement, nor is

 3   an issue about an impossibly burdensome access to the

 4   arbitration.

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Can you --

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Friedman, this

 7   contract is -- is unusual in that, as Judge Hall said,

 8   it was more employee-friendly than most.                 It had a

 9   clause -- it had a provision for back-end review with

10   the court.   The review -- at the end of the line, there

11   was to be court review, and as the parties said, it

12   should be just like review of a district court decision,

13   a much -- much more focused review than would be in the

14   case of an arbitration agreement.

15                Now, that clause comes out because of our

16   decision in Hall.    That leaves the -- the arbitration

17   agreement in -- in an imbalance.                There was court review

18   assured at the back end.          So why isn't it reasonable to

19   say the parties contemplated vigorous court review; if

20   it can't be had at the back end, it should be had at the

21   front end?

22                MR. FRIEDMAN:          Justice Ginsburg, there will

23   be court review at the end pursuant to section 10.                  As a

24   result of Hall Street, section 10 is now the exclusive

25   basis on the tail end --

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But it was very limited

 2   review.     But the parties to this agreement put in a

 3   clause that provided for the standard review, not the

 4   very limited review that the Arbitration Act calls for.

 5                 MR. FRIEDMAN:          That's correct,

 6   Justice Ginsburg.     But by operation of law and because

 7   of this Court's decision in Hall Street, now the parties

 8   will receive the section 10 review, much as they would

 9   in the First Options case.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Once again, has this

11   argument been made here?           I thought that the only basis

12   was unconscionability.         I suppose you could have made

13   the argument that the contract is void because one of

14   its essential provisions has been rendered unlawful and,

15   therefore -- and is not severable, and, therefore, the

16   whole contract fails.        I suppose you could make that

17   argument.    That hasn't been made, has it?

18                 MR. FRIEDMAN:          Justice Scalia, that's

19   absolutely correct.       There has been no argument, in

20   fact, at no time -- and it would have -- the proper

21   place would have been the district court -- was any

22   evidence ever put into the record --

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How could it be in the

24   district court?     We didn't decide Hall Street until

25   after the district court was finished in this case.

 1                MR. FRIEDMAN:          But, Justice Ginsburg, at the

 2   district court no evidence of any sort attacking any

 3   provision.    The only attacks here on the provisions are

 4   the arguments that were made by my colleague in the

 5   brief --

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought you were

 7   making, in answer to Justice Scalia, the question -- he

 8   said, well, they didn't raise it.                 They didn't raise

 9   that with this provision out, it was an essential

10   provision, so the contract was void.                     They had no reason

11   to make that in the district court because Hall Street

12   was not yet decided.

13                MR. FRIEDMAN:          Justice Ginsburg, my point

14   simply is they put in no evidence of any sort attacking

15   anything.    We're simply --

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Can they make it here now?

17   Can they make -- I mean, even if they had -- you know,

18   even if there was no reason to make it in the district

19   court, is the law --

20                MR. FRIEDMAN:          I -- I --

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- that since they didn't

22   have an opportunity to make it in the district court,

23   they can make it in the Supreme Court?

24                MR. FRIEDMAN:          Justice Scalia, they could

25   make that argument before the arbitrator, and the

 1   arbitrator could make that decision.                     Under the clear

 2   and unmistakable delegation, that issue, like other

 3   issues, should be decided by the arbitrator.

 4                Nobody is contesting -- at least certainly

 5   nobody contested prior to us getting to the Supreme

 6   Court -- both the district court and the Ninth Circuit

 7   held that the language was clear and unmistakable.

 8   There was never any contest to that issue until we got

 9   here.   And because of the clear and unmistakable language

10   and because the agreement does not implicate the making,

11   we asked the court to enforce the terms of the agreement

12   as written and pursuant to Bazzle and Howsam.                     In

13   particular, in Bazzle the Court recognized that issues as

14   to scope and issues as to validity can go to the

15   arbitrator in the first instance.

16                Here, there can be no doubt -- and certainly

17   there was no doubt at the district court level and Ninth

18   Circuit -- that the parties clearly and unmistakably gave

19   the arbitrator exclusive authority.                     And we're asking

20   the Court to give effect to that language.

21                The -- the -- the primary purpose of the

22   Federal Arbitration Act is to enforce arbitration

23   agreements pursuant to their terms.                     Here, there's no

24   real dispute about what the terms are.                     Under section 4,

25   a limited inquiry, once we have satisfied section 4 the

 1   court should proceed to send us to the arbitrator.

 2               Nobody is arguing that Mr. Jackson can't

 3   make these challenges once he gets to arbitration.                 In

 4   fact, he certainly can.         And the arbitrator will make

 5   that decision.   And the arbitrator may decide that it is

 6   unconscionable, in which case he'll set it down.                 Or

 7   he may decide -- or he or she may decide that it's not

 8   unconscionable, or he or she may decide that certain

 9   terms are problematic and to sever those.

10               At this point, if there's no other

11   questions, I'd like to reserve my remaining my time.

14              ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN E. SILVERBERG

15                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

16               MR. SILVERBERG:             Thank you,

17   Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

18               The Petitioner would have the Court adopt a

19   rule whereby agreements to arbitrate are presumed

20   enforceable before their validity has been determined by

21   a court under section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act.

22   They would have people like Mr. Jackson waive their

23   right to go to court through the use of a clause

24   delegating this judicial function to the arbitrator.

 1   us what is unconscionable about this contract?                     What is

 2   your claim of unconscionability?                 He says it's not

 3   arbitration per se; it's just certain of the provisions

 4   here; if you change the provisions, I'm happy with

 5   arbitration.

 6                  Is that your position?

 7                  MR. SILVERBERG:           Yes, Your Honor, that --

 8   that what is unconscionable about this is it's unusually

 9   one-sided in that the issues that are most important to

10   Mr. Jackson, such as his racial discrimination case, he

11   is required to arbitrate, but those issues that might be

12   most important to the Petitioner, such as trade secrets

13   and unfair competition, they are not bound to arbitrate.

14   So --

15                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I would have thought

16   the issue would be -- it's odd to say, I think, that if

17   you have 10 provisions, some are unconscionable and

18   some are not.     The issue would be whether there is

19   unconscionability in the making of the whole contract.

20   In other words, it's the same question I asked your

21   friend:     Why isn't it all or nothing?                  If it was -- if

22   there was no unconscionability in the making, then the

23   arbitrator decides.       If there was unconscionability in

24   the making, then -- then the arbitrator doesn't decide

25   anything.     Questions 1 through 10, not simply, you know,

 1   1, 8, and 9.

 2               MR. SILVERBERG:           If I understand Your

 3   Honor's question, the -- the threshold determination

 4   must first be made by the court under section 2 as to

 5   whether there is unconscionability either of the entire

 6   agreement or any of the provisions.                    It would then,

 7   assuming that were found, that some provisions were in

 8   fact unconscionable, it would be on State law to

 9   determine whether or not the entire agreement gets

10   thrown out --

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, my point is that

12   once you get past that gateway question of whether the

13   formation of the contract was not unconscionable, then

14   claims that particular provisions were unconscionable

15   are by definition for the arbitrator to decide.

16               MR. SILVERBERG:           No, we would disagree with

17   that, and here's why, Your Honor, and I think this goes

18   to something that Justice Sotomayor asked, which is it

19   creates a very difficult rule to deal with.                    The

20   Petitioners here, one, they have made a huge concession,

21   we believe, in their reply brief by saying that if there's

22   an illusory remedy, that that is a section of

23   unconscionability that the court can hear and must hear.

24   But all these other --

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Why is that -- why is


                                      28

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that a big concession, because I thought, as the First

 2   Circuit said, if argument is the -- the contract is

 3   illusory, that goes to the court, but here the only

 4   claim is unconscionability.            That's a question of

 5   fairness.   It doesn't go to the court.

 6               MR. SILVERBERG:            The -- the reason it's a

 7   concession is because that's not their original position

 8   and that's not the question that they presented to this

 9   Court.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But if they -- if they

11   made that concession, so what, under the First Circuit's

12   reading?

13               MR. SILVERBERG:            The First Circuit, Your

14   Honor, we believe did not interpret this correctly.

15   They have, we believe, carved out a section of

16   unconscionability law at the exclusion of all other

17   unconscionability law.

18               We know that States and Federal courts have

19   routinely applied State unconscionability law, and they

20   would have a rule whereby all this jurisprudence of the

21   States delineating unconscionability law would in

22   essence be preempted.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is that -- is that right?

24   Is the arbitrator free to decide unconscionability in a

25   vacuum without taking into account State law at all?

 1   And doesn't he get reviewed afterwards by the State

 2   court on the basis of a much more lenient standard

 3   than -- than if the court decided it de novo.                   But can

 4   he really disregard State law regarding

 5   unconscionability?

 6               MR. SILVERBERG:              Well, the problem is, Your

 7   Honor, and if I understand Your Honor's question

 8   correctly, that determination must of course be made by

 9   the court, because the arbitrator doesn't have any

10   authority to do anything until the requirements of

11   section 2 are met.      And I hope I'm understanding Your

12   Honor's question.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:              No -- I mean, you -- I

14   thought you were saying that if we allow this to go to

15   the arbitrator, the arbitrator can simply disregard the

16   question of unconscionability.

17               MR. SILVERBERG:              That -- in essence, yes.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:              And that's not my

19   understanding.   My understanding is that he's -- he is

20   obliged to take account of State law regarding

21   unconscionability, but it's going to be his call, as it

22   would be the district judge's call if this had gone to

23   court, whether in fact this is unconscionable.

24   Afterwards, there will be court review.                   And if he has

25   totally disregarded all State law regarding

 1   unconscionability, wouldn't -- wouldn't you have a basis

 2   to set aside the -- the arbitration?

 3               MR. SILVERBERG:           Respectfully, I -- I

 4   disagree with that, and here's why, Your Honor:                  The

 5   back-end review -- presumably it would be, I believe,

 6   under section 10(a)(4) that he exceeded his authority.

 7   And once the arbitrator is empanelled under the

 8   Federal -- under section 2, once he is authorized to

 9   make any decisions at all, including the issue that the

10   Petitioner would have him decide of unconscionability

11   and arbitrability, it would be impossible for anyone to

12   say he has exceeded his authority.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:           That doesn't mean -- does

14   that mean he can disregard -- let's assume the contract

15   is a contract to maim.      I mean, it -- you know, it's --

16   it's like -- it's a Shylock contract, okay?                  He's going

17   to be able to exact a pound of flesh.                  Now, there are

18   State laws which invalidate contracts to maim.                  Do you

19   think that the arbitrator can ignore that, and say,

20   well, you know, I don't really think it's so bad; a

21   pound of flesh sounds reasonable to me?

22               MR. SILVERBERG:           I think the concern is,

23   Your Honor, and it's hard to draw the line --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Can he ignore the State

25   law?

 1                  MR. SILVERBERG:           I think there's no

 2   adequate review if he chooses to without the court's

 3   review of --

 4                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Is that right?      You don't

 5   think a State court would in the blink of an eye set

 6   aside an arbitration that allowed a -- a pound of flesh?

 7                  MR. SILVERBERG:           Your Honor, I would hope

 8   they would, but I -- in reading the narrow review of

 9   section 9, 10, and 11, I don't think we have that

10   guarantee.

11                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           I think you have a

12   misunderstanding of the law, then, if that's what you

13   believe.     I -- I think there's no doubt what would

14   happen in that case.

15                  JUSTICE BREYER:           What is -- what I'm not sure

16   about what you are arguing now is my -- as I came into

17   this, I thought there were three situations.                  Situation

18   1 is common in labor arbitration.                  It's an arbitration

19   agreement that says wages, hours, and working conditions

20   disputes will be arbitrated, and we have a question

21   about whether a particular dispute is or is not full

22   within the definition.

23                  MR. SILVERBERG:           Right.

24                  JUSTICE BREYER:           As to that one, we assume

25   that the parties intended the question of arbitrability


                                         32

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   to be arbitrated; we assume it.               Normally, that's the

 2   rule.   It's the scope of the arbitration agreement.

 3   That's a little hard to distinguish, but sometimes

 4   that's not the argument.         The argument could be:             Well,

 5   there are four different provisions in the arbitration

 6   section, and we think one of them is void because it's,

 7   say, unconscionable, but the others are okay.                    Now, that

 8   one, I mean, normally, you could if it's clear enough

 9   say I want that one to go to arbitration.

10               And the third one is that you have a

11   contract, and it's an arbitration contract, and it's on

12   four separate pieces of paper, and what you're saying

13   is, I was in Alaska, or the equivalent, and maybe

14   unconscionability is the equivalent.                    On that one I'm

15   with you.

16               I don't see how you can submit -- agree to

17   submit that to the arbitrator, because there's no

18   agreement, or at least no valid one, at least no valid

19   one under State law.

20               But what are you arguing?                   That this is that

21   case or this is the other case I just mentioned, that

22   middle case where you have 10 provisions and you're

23   saying that this one over here is unconscionable but

24   that one isn't; and -- but I did sign a valid

25   arbitration agreement. I agree with that.                    It's just that


                                       33

 1   certain provisions of it are invalid because they're

 2   unfair.   What are you arguing in this case?

 3                 MR. SILVERBERG:            That -- Your Honor, it

 4   would be the second one.           That there are issues --

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, the second one -- I

 6   don't see how you get there, because if it's the second,

 7   one you concede that there is an arbitration agreement

 8   that's valid.    And if you concede that there is a valid

 9   arbitration agreement between you and your client, and

10   you're arguing over the scope of different provisions

11   or whether certain provisions within it are valid or

12   invalid, why can't you submit that to an arbitrator if

13   it's clear enough?

14                 MR. SILVERBERG:            But we don't concede that,

15   Your Honor.     That's the whole point, is that the court

16   must make that threshold determination.

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:            As to each provision?    As

18   to each bit of -- why?

19                 MR. SILVERBERG:            Because that's the mandate

20   of section 2.    The arbitrator derives his authority --

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:            But suppose you and your --

22   your client -- rather, your client and the other side have

23   absolutely agreed, clear as could be, under the

24   arbitration agreement:         We want arbitrated too whether

25   the provision that these words are contained in is

 1   unconscionable.   Can't they agree to that?

 2                MR. SILVERBERG:        Your Honor, the parties are

 3   -- don't necessarily have to take every issue to court,

 4   but should a party challenge that issue as

 5   unconscionable, that door should remain open.

 6                This case is not so much -- it is about our

 7   case here, but there's a bigger picture here.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:        Okay.      Let me say it more

 9   easily.   We have agreement number one, four pages, and

10   within it is a question of -- which just looks like this

11   one.   Agreement number two:        The two parties agree that

12   if any dispute should arise as to whether any words in

13   agreement number one are unconscionable, they will go to

14   the arbitrator.   Agreement number two is concededly

15   valid.    Now do you want to say that agreement number

16   one -- those words have to be decided by the court?

17                MR. SILVERBERG:        Your Honor, it is our

18   position that -- that the threshold determination as to

19   the validity of the contract --

20                JUSTICE BREYER:        Right, but if you're going

21   to say yes --

22                MR. SILVERBERG:        -- would go the court.

23                JUSTICE BREYER:        -- then I think if you're going

24   to say yes to that, then it's contrary to First Options, I think.

25   I'm not sure, but I don't see why not.

 1                  MR. SILVERBERG:           Well, Your Honor, I think

 2   that what Your Honor is describing is the first part of

 3   First Options that looked -- and that's what the

 4   Petitioner would like to rely on, is objective contract

 5   language.     But then the Court adds the entire other

 6   section which says we don't presume that parties intend

 7   to arbitrate certain matters and -- because we're not

 8   yet at that scope -- but we want clear and unmistakable

 9   language, not just objective language in the contract.

10                  And there's an important reason for that,

11   because it's impossible to draw the line.                    You're

12   carving out certain issues of unconscionability --

13                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           After this --

14                  MR. SILVERBERG:           -- saying both --

15                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           After this suit was filed

16   and both parties are going up the steps to the court,

17   could the attorneys and the parties stop and say let's

18   arbitrate this issue of unconscionability and pick an

19   arbitrator?     Could they do that?

20                  MR. SILVERBERG:           They -- I think the answer

21   there would be yes, but the door needs to be open in

22   case there is a challenge, Your Honor.                    Certainly,

23   nobody is --

24                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           No, then -- then the --

25                  MR. SILVERBERG:           -- required to go to court.

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Then the employee loses.

 2   He says:    Oh, you have to have an open door; this was --

 3   this was not properly before the arbitrator.

 4                 MR. SILVERBERG:           I think if Your Honor is

 5   asking --

 6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Because, you see, if

 7   you say yes, that they can arbitrate this, then the

 8   question is why can't they do it when the contract's

 9   signed?

10                 MR. SILVERBERG:           Again, Your Honor --

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Let's assume that the

12   answer to my question is yes, they can put that to an

13   arbitrator.    If that's so, how can you prevail in this

14   case if the agreement clearly comprehends submission of

15   this issue to the arbitrator?

16                 MR. SILVERBERG:           Well, we don't concede that

17   it clearly does that.       We -- what our position is --

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I'm -- I'm asking, assume

19   you do?

20                 MR. SILVERBERG:           I don't think that gets us

21   around the requirements of section 2, Your Honor, that

22   says the court and the doors to the court must always

23   remain open for that.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I thought your --

25                 MR. SILVERBERG:           I hope I'm understanding your

 1   question.

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Silverberg, the

 3   section 2 on which you place much emphasis just says

 4   that agreements are enforceable save on such grounds as

 5   exist in law or equity for revocation of a contract.

 6   But the section 2 doesn't say any -- anything about who

 7   decides that question.

 8               MR. SILVERBERG:           That's true, Your Honor,

 9   the -- but the logical reading of that statute would

10   indicate that these three elements -- a writing, in

11   interstate commerce, and not revocable at law and

12   equity -- would have to be met before the arbitrator has

13   any authority to do anything.

14               And as Your Honor mentioned in the -- in the

15   Doctor's Associates case, there are certain issues that

16   are certainly involved, and unconscionability is one of

17   those issues that can be presented to the court without

18   violating section 2, as well as fraud and duress, I

19   believe, were the other ones that the Court had -- had

20   delineated in that case.

21               JUSTICE BREYER:           I read your -- I promise

22   you I'll go back to First Options, which I thought was

23   of gem-like clarity --

25               JUSTICE BREYER:           And I am apparently the

 1   only one in the world --

 2                 MR. SILVERBERG:           That's because it was well

 3   argued.

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:           -- the only one in the

 5   world who thinks that.        And I'll go back to --

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           You wrote that, didn't you?

 7   Didn't you write that opinion?

 8                 (Laughter.)

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I'll go back to that and

10   look at it.    But the -- the --

11                 (Laughter.)

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Looking at your response to

13   their motion to arbitrate --

14                 MR. SILVERBERG:           Yes.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           -- it seemed to me you

16   said here that -- that because of your -- your position,

17   your client's position, that the whole thing is

18   unconscionable.    You didn't say that?

19                 MR. SILVERBERG:           Well, we said that -- it

20   was certainly my position that the entire agreement was

21   unconscionable based on Nevada law --

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes.

23                 MR. SILVERBERG:           And that it was so

24   incredibly one-sided, and also the limited discovery

25   provisions, and also because, frankly, we are not


                                        39

 1   looking to treat this anything other than like we would

 2   ordinary contract law that also strikes one-sided

 3   provisions in -- for example, in Nevada, the Fick case,

 4   which would strike down a one-sided prenuptial

 5   agreement, or lease agreements that have one-sided

 6   attorney fee provisions are routinely struck down as

 7   one-sided.    So their position --

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But which is the stronger

 9   case for arbitration?       Case one, you attack the

10   arbitration clause only, part of the arbitration

11   contract only, as being unconscionable.                  Case two, you

12   attack the whole agreement as being unconscionable.                  Do

13   those both stand on the same footing, or is one a

14   stronger case for submission to the court than the

15   other?

16                 MR. SILVERBERG:           I think this Court has made

17   clear in the severability cases that challenges to the

18   contract as a whole would go to the arbitrator to

19   decide.    We have here, as Petitioner admits to --

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I find that somewhat

21   paradoxical, but I -- I agree that that -- that that's

22   the law.

23                 MR. SILVERBERG:           So the stronger one would

24   be an -- as this case, which we believe is very

25   strong, an attack --

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              So if you do go to the

 2   State court, suppose the State court says:                  I can't

 3   really decide this question about the one clause unless

 4   I determine the conscionability or the unconscionability

 5   of the entire contract, and I now proceed to do that.

 6               Do you have to wait and say:                  Stop, you

 7   can't do that?

 8               MR. SILVERBERG:              I think that's what

 9   sections 3 and 4 contemplate, is for -- and they have

10   been in existence since the passage of the Act -- for

11   parties to come in and make their case as to whether or

12   not the FAA would apply or not apply.

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But suppose the State

14   court judge says that he has to look at the whole

15   contract.   Do you say:        Oh, I'm sorry to bother you; we

16   have to go back to the arbitrator now?

17               MR. SILVERBERG:              That's not the situation in

18   this case, but assuming it were --

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              What's your -- no, it's a

20   hypothetical case.

21               MR. SILVERBERG:              I understand.

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              What would your position

23   be in the hypothetical case, representing your client?

24               MR. SILVERBERG:              Representing my client, who

25   is Mr. Jackson, I would want the court to look at the


                                         41

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   whole thing, but if I were in the Petitioner's shoes I

 2   think I would have an argument that, based on this

 3   Court's precedent --

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And what do you think the

 5   judge should decide as between those two possibilities?

 6                MR. SILVERBERG:           If it's an attack on the

 7   contract as a whole, it should go to the arbitrator.                 I

 8   think that's clear from many of the Court's cases;

 9   whereas, if the attack is to the arbitration clause

10   itself, that is something for the court to decide and

11   determine.

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Counsel, I think I heard

13   Justice Kennedy's question to be -- let's not confuse

14   the contract as a whole.         There's only one contract

15   here.

16                MR. SILVERBERG:           Correct.

17                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             It's an agreement to

18   arbitrate.

19                MR. SILVERBERG:           Yes, Your Honor.

20                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So an attack on the --

21   as I think Justice Breyer noted, you -- an argument that

22   it's one-sided goes to the entire arbitration agreement.

23   I don't want to arbitrate because that's not what I

24   chose to do freely.     Correct?

25                MR. SILVERBERG:           Correct.

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              That, you say, is for

 2   the court.

 3                MR. SILVERBERG:            Yes, Your Honor.

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              The difference here is

 5   that there are provisions within how the arbitration is

 6   going to be held that, standing alone, you think are

 7   unconscionable, even though the agreement to arbitrate

 8   is not.   Am I correct in understanding your allegation?

 9                MR. SILVERBERG:            No, Your Honor.

10   Respectfully, it's our position that both are present.

11   There are certain elements of the arbitration agreement

12   that are unconscionable and, under Nevada law, which

13   would render the entire arbitration agreement

14   unconscionable.

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              You see, that's what I'm

16   confused by, because when I first asked you this

17   question, you said:      I would be happy to arbitrate if

18   the court struck the discovery provision and, I guess,

19   the fees provision.      Which answer are you giving me?

20                MR. SILVERBERG:            I'm giving you the one I

21   just gave you, I think, Your Honor, which is we've got

22   both certain provisions that are unconscionable, that

23   under Nevada law render the entire agreement

24   unconscionable --

25                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Okay.       Let's assume --


                                        43

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                MR. SILVERBERG: -- and that's what the Court

 2   is to rely on.

 3                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Okay.          That -- now I

 4   understand that part of your argument.                    But let's assume

 5   that that wasn't Nevada law, that Nevada law would say

 6   severability works, and there is an agreement to arbitrate,

 7   and all we have to or could do is strike the unfair provisions.

 8                Let's assume that situation.                   Who decides

 9   whether to strike the unfair provisions?

10                MR. SILVERBERG:        That would be the court

11   under our position, Your Honor, and that --

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             No, that can't be

13   right.   The -- how can you say there's no problem

14   agreeing to arbitrate, no imbalance in bargaining

15   authority whatever, but then say, oh, but these

16   procedures are unconscionable?

17                It seems to me that the procedures are

18   there, and the party, the employee, whatever, can look

19   at those.   And if he says, well, that's unconscionable,

20   you don't sign the agreement as a whole.                    But once you

21   are -- in for a penny, in for a pound.                    If you agree to

22   arbitrate, then it's at least for the arbitrator to

23   decide particular provisions, whether they're

24   unconscionable.

25                MR. SILVERBERG:        Well --

 1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   I know you're

 2   arguing in the alternative.                 But the one argument that

 3   we get to pick out the provisions we don't like and say

 4   those are unconscionable, but the agreement as a whole

 5   is not -- that seems to me illogical.

 6                  MR. SILVERBERG:              Your Honor, that is our

 7   position.     I hope I am understanding your question.                     But

 8   this is a matter of State law as to which provisions

 9   would render the entire agreement unconscionable.                       And I

10   think that body of unconscionability law is not so

11   varied that we would have unwieldy results.                      I think

12   State --

13                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, it's a matter

14   -- it may be a matter of State law, but the open

15   question is who gets to decide it.

16                  MR. SILVERBERG:              Right, and our --

17                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Arbitrators decide

18   matters of State law all the time.

19                  MR. SILVERBERG:              Certainly, they do.

20   Certainly, they do.          But before they have that authority

21   to even do that, the requirements, again, of section 2

22   have to be met.     And that is our position in this

23   matter.     That's --

24                  JUSTICE SCALIA:              Let's assume Nevada law

25   says you cannot -- you cannot fire somebody for coming


                                            45

                              Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   in late to work any fewer than 10 times, all right?

 2   And an individual is fired.             He goes to arbitration, or

 3   at least the company tries to take him to arbitration on

 4   it.    And he says, no, because I was fired in violation

 5   of Nevada law.

 6                 Now, is it your position that that -- that

 7   that case would have to go immediately to court and

 8   could not submit to the arbitrator the issue of whether

 9   indeed he was fired for coming less than 10 times, and

10   indeed whether if he was coming in less than 10 times,

11   that would be an invalid basis for a dismissal?

12                 MR. SILVERBERG:           No, Your Honor, and here's

13   why:   I think Your Honor has described a situation

14   similar to -- I believe that was the Green Tree

15   situation, where there was an allegation that the entire

16   contract was illegal, the usurious contract.             But there

17   was no question as to the making of the agreement to

18   arbitrate.

19                 So, in Your Honor's hypothetical, if there is

20   no dispute as to the arbitration agreement being subject

21   to a ground of revocation at law or at equity as

22   defined in section 2, then I would -- I would concede

23   that that was something that would go to the arbitrator,

24   Your Honor.

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, your -- your position


                                        46

 1   seems to be that unconscionability is the same as

 2   coercion in the making of the agreement.                       And I don't

 3   know that that's true.

 4                  MR. SILVERBERG:           Well, Your Honor,

 5   respectfully, in Doctor's Associates, I think the Court

 6   spoke very clearly that fraud, duress, and

 7   unconscionability are there and are part of something

 8   that can be raised under section 2.                       And also the

 9   Court's hold in Prima Paint --

10                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           No, I don't care what we --

11                  MR. SILVERBERG:           -- where fraud --

12                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't care what we said in

13   dictum.     It doesn't seem to me that unconscionability is

14   the same as duress or the same as fraud --

15                  MR. SILVERBERG:           To -- oh, I'm sorry.

16                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- that you can -- you can

17   be a stupid person who voluntarily signs an unconscionable

18   contract.     Now, the courts may protect you because you're

19   stupid, but you haven't been coerced.                       Is there no

20   distinction between unconscionability and coercion?

21                  MR. SILVERBERG:           Not under section 2, Your

22   Honor.    I think the -- the definition that the

23   Petitioner would have this Court adopt, that narrow view

24   of making -- again, something Justice Sotomayor

25   brought up -- would create a rule where certain


                                         47

 1   unconscionability challenges went to the court --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Why is that?

 3                MR. SILVERBERG:           -- and other

 4   unconscionability challenges didn't go to the court.

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Why is that?      I would say

 6   all unconscionability challenges, if you have an agreement

 7   that's as clear as this one, would go to the arbitrator.

 8   Which ones would have to go to the court?

 9                MR. SILVERBERG:           All of them should go to

10   the court, Your Honor, based on this Court's holding

11   both in Doctor's Associates and Prima Paint, in that

12   both fraud in the inducement, like in Prima Paint, and

13   unconscionability envision a situation where you've

14   got a formed contract that people can choose to opt out

15   of.   I may be subject to a contract that was induced by

16   fraud, but I may like the benefit of that bargain.                So I

17   may be able to go ahead with that.

18                And same with an unconscionability challenge.

19   We've got an agreement that was made that -- that the

20   innocent party can decide to opt out of.                And I think

21   that's very consistent with this Court's holding and

22   with what the various State courts have been doing in

23   reliance on those holdings.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:           But not every contract.        I

25   mean, I'll take that argument.              I'd like to know


                                       48

 1   about that argument.      I'd like to know what really

 2   is the underlying, which I've never looked up.

 3                What is the underlying rationale in contract

 4   law of setting aside contracts as unconscionable?                     Why

 5   do courts do it?   What's the theory?                   I'd like to

 6   know that.

 7                MR. SILVERBERG:           My understanding is that

 8   it's so unfair that it couldn't really be said that a

 9   party assented to -- to that.             And I think that's what --

10                JUSTICE BREYER:           See, that's what I wonder,

11   that last part -- is it that the basic theory is we want to

12   protect a group of people by -- who voluntarily entered

13   into contracts by giving them the right to opt out, or is

14   is that we don't think that they really meant to do it?

15                MR. SILVERBERG:           It's the latter, Your

16   Honor.   I think if they really chose to --

17                JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay.       On that

18   question, or any other question, is, I would imagine,

19   where we have agreement one, and the argument is maybe

20   agreement one was unconscionable.                And then we enter

21   into agreement two, and the parties in agreement two

22   agree to -- to arbitrate their unconscionability dispute

23   in agreement one, and there's nothing wrong with

24   agreement two, I would think that's then the question of

25   unconscionability is for the arbitrator.

 1                 MR. SILVERBERG:           If I understand your

 2   question --

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:           You said "all," and I just

 4   don't think you meant all.            But maybe you did.        That's

 5   why I asked the question.

 6                 MR. SILVERBERG:           I -- I think that the safe

 7   thing to do is to keep the door open to people,

 8   especially in situations like this, where there is such

 9   unequal bargaining power, where people are presented

10   with a nonnegotiable term of their employment --

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask this kind of

12   elementary question?

13                 MR. SILVERBERG:           Yes, Your Honor.

14                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Are there cases out there

15   that hold that an agreement can be partially

16   unconscionable, that it's unconscionable for some

17   clauses but not in its -- in its entirety?

18                 MR. SILVERBERG:           Certainly.       And I think

19   that would be matter of State law, again, to determine

20   when there --

21                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           But there are cases

22   that -- that draw that distinction?

23                 MR. SILVERBERG:           I'm sorry.

24                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           There are cases drawing

25   that very elementary distinction?

 1               MR. SILVERBERG:           I believe so, Your Honor.

 2   I think in Nevada you would -- if we had maybe just one

 3   unconscionable clause, that the court might sever and

 4   send the rest to the -- and validate the rest of the

 5   arbitration agreement.      But then when -- certain -- any

 6   number of clauses, depending on State law, would make

 7   the entire agreement to arbitrate unconscionable.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Does it make a

 9   difference in response to Justice Stevens's hypothetical

10   that there is a provision saying the arbitrator will

11   decide the conscionability of all clauses?                 The

12   arbitrator may decide that clauses 2 and 8 are

13   unconscionable, but if there's an agreement and it's

14   not unconscionable that the arbitrator will decide, then

15   the arbitrator decides all of them, right?

16               MR. SILVERBERG:           If the agreement -- I think

17   I understand your question.           If the agreement to

18   arbitrate itself is not --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Right.

20               MR. SILVERBERG:           -- there's no

21   unconscionability challenge to that, and there's no

22   other fraud in the inducement or any other thing that

23   the court has mentioned it would go to the broader view

24   of making the grounds for revocation, if those grounds

25   for revocation are not present, then I believe the


                                      51

 1   arbitrator would be empowered to make those decisions,

 2   Your Honor.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Can I ask you just a

 4   follow-up on Justice Breyer's hypothetical to you where

 5   he had the first agreement and then the issue to the

 6   second?   You said you've got to leave the door open.

 7   The door open on the second agreement or on the first

 8   agreement?

 9                 MR. SILVERBERG:           I think the door should be

10   open on all the agreements, because until that door is

11   open under section 2 -- as long as that door is open

12   under section 2, then we don't have the concern about

13   parties making the terms of arbitration so onerous or

14   burdensome that they would not be able to even access the

15   arbitral forum.    And that's really a huge concern in --

16   in not just in this case, but in the bigger picture.

17   Courts must remain open to protect people.

18                 I would venture to say that there are many

19   people in this room who are subject to arbitration

20   agreements, and they don't even know, through --

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Silverberg --

22                 MR. SILVERBERG:           Yes, Your Honor.

23                 JUSTICE GINSBERG:            -- on that, underlying

24   your whole case I think is the notion that this is an

25   adhesion contract; it's a take-it-or-leave-it contract,

 1   very common in consumer, credit card agreements, in

 2   employment contracts, that one party has no say except

 3   to sign or not to sign.          Are all those contracts subject

 4   to the unconscionability argument that you're making or

 5   only some of them?      And if only some, which ones?

 6                  MR. SILVERBERG:           I would suggest, Your

 7   Honor, that they all are subject to that.                     And then we

 8   look to State law to determine, whether, for example, in

 9   Nevada if you've great procedural unconscionability

10   they have the sliding scale approach based on the D.R.

11   Horton case, which we have briefed, where you would

12   require less of a showing of substantive

13   unconscionability.

14                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Not much use signing an

15   arbitration agreement then, not much use for the employer.

16   He's going to end up in court anyway.                     Every one of them

17   will be acknowledge as unconscionable.                     So what's the

18   use?

19                  MR. SILVERBERG:           Well, Your Honor --

20                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           I mean, kiss good-bye to

21   arbitration.

22                  MR. SILVERBERG:           Not at all, Your Honor.

23                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           No?

24                  MR. SILVERBERG:           That door's been open under

25   section 3 and 4 since the inception of the Act.                     We are

 1   advocating the status quo be maintained here, Your Honor,

 2   and there is no reason to suggest that there will be some

 3   rush to court on this.         Courts are quite capable to do this

 4   in a summary fashion.

 5                If a party comes before the court with a

 6   baseless unconscionability challenge, I would imagine

 7   not only will the court dispose of it quickly, but if an

 8   attorney makes a routine practice of bringing baseless

 9   motions to the court, he'll have his own issues to

10   deal with.   So, I don't -- I -- I disagree that there

11   will be some floodgates or that this will in any way --

12   to the contrary --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:             The amici certainly claim

14   the contrary.   The Chamber of Commerce claims that this

15   is what's happening and that it has been a snowballing

16   effect.

17                MR. SILVERBERG:             We disagree with them and

18   Your Honor, and I would cite that we have some of the

19   most prestigious arbitrators in this country that have

20   joined our position and recognized the courts' vital role

21   in maintaining the fairness of the arbitration process

22   so the public can trust it and so the weaker parties to

23   these agreements can be protected, because should that

24   disappear, there will be nothing to stop stronger

25   parties from again sending Mr. Jackson, who lives in

 1   Reno, to Minnesota to arbitrate his claim.

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, this --

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:            There --

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             This clause is not of that

 5   kind, and you've singled out three things that made it

 6   unconscionable.   One, the fee provision, the splitting

 7   fees, that the court rejected.               So the only two left is

 8   the one-sided aspect of it and the limited discovery.

 9                It seemed to me that the limited discovery

10   clause, that that was quite common to say we're not --

11   we don't want to get involved in the massive discovery

12   you can get in a -- in a civil proceeding.                 Is there

13   something unusual about limiting discovery to documents?

14                MR. SILVERBERG:            There -- there is something

15   unusual.   They've gone well beyond the AAA and limited

16   discovery to one deposition and one expert, which in an

17   employment case is very difficult.

 1   Justice Scalia, I'm hearing my colleague state that

 2   there is concern that the arbitrator is not going to

 3   apply State law.

 4               This is merely distrust of arbitrators.

 5   This Court has rejected this bias that arbitrators cannot

 6   make these decisions.      And, in fact, this Court and many

 7   others have sent very, very complicated issues to the

 8   arbitrator to decide.      There is no reason to believe that

 9   an arbitrator, as well as a judge, cannot decide State

10   law issues of unconscionability, and the arbitrator will

11   have the discretion and the ability to either strike the

12   entire arbitration agreement or strike certain clauses

13   as he or she sees fit.

14               Furthermore, this type of speculation, this

15   fear as to what the arbitrator may do, that was rejected

16   in this Court's decisions in Vimar and PacifiCare, where

17   the Court stated we are going to enforce this, and the

18   arbitrator may do something wrong, may do something

19   right, but at the tail end there will be an ability

20   under section 10 to address it.               There is no difference

21   there.

22               Additionally, this -- this analysis of

23   unconscionability -- I want to reiterate

24   unconscionability is based on a policy decision that --

25   that attacks an agreement that unquestionably has

 1   already been made.

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.       What is the

 3   one-sentence answer, one sentence, to the thing, this is

 4   a very interesting case, lots of stuff in it that we

 5   needn't reach because irrespective of everything else,

 6   they in their reply, the district court, and the court

 7   of appeals all said these whole four pages, the whole

 8   four pages were unconscionable, so none of it's

 9   enforceable, and all we have to decide is whether that's

10   an issue for the court.          And the answer to that

11   being not an issue for the court is what, in a sentence or

12   two?

13                 MR. FRIEDMAN:          Justice Breyer, I'm sorry.

14   I'm going to ask you to --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:            They said, look, there's a

16   four-page document.       They said this four-page document

17   is unconscionable, the product of unconscionability, and,

18   therefore, don't enforce it.              That's their claim.       That

19   issue is at least is for the court, because there is no

20   valid agreement here at all, if that's right.

21                 MR. FRIEDMAN:          No, Justice Breyer, the

22   determination of unconscionability is for the

23   arbitrator.    The -- the limited role of the court goes

24   only to the making, not to the issue of

25   unconscionability.      So the court --

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             The problem -- I -- I

 2   keep going back to my initial question to you, is you

 3   want to parse out what making is from unconscionability,

 4   and you want us to say, well, if it's too onerous a fee

 5   for arbitration, that goes to the making, because you're

 6   depriving the party of -- of an arbitration forum.

 7   If it's discovery, that doesn't go to depriving them

 8   of anything because the arbitrator could give them more

 9   discovery if he or she chose.             Am I correct, this is

10   your argument?

11                MR. FRIEDMAN:         No, Justice Sotomayor, our

12   argument about the onerous fee -- and it would have to

13   be evidence put in by the party opposing counsel -- by

14   the party opposing arbitration, that there was an actual

15   barrier, an impossibly burdensome barrier.                So it does not

16   come under making; it would be under a -- a Randolph

17   standard or under a First Options standard.

18                There's two areas that we agree are for the

19   court.   One is to determine whether or not there's an

20   issue with the making of the agreement.                 The other one,

21   if it's challenged, is to determine whether or not there

22   is indeed access to arbitration.

23                The First Circuit in Awuah applied this test

24   very neatly in a very reasonable manner and applied both

25   First Options and Randolph, harmonized those cases, and

 1   made a determination that unconscionability is for the

 2   arbitrator based on a clear and unmistakable delegation.

 3   But issues as to whether or not --

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           If there's no access to

 5   arbitration, there's no way that you can leave that

 6   issue to the arbitrator, is there?

 7                 MR. FRIEDMAN:         Exactly, Justice Scalia.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Because you never get to

 9   the arbitrator.

10                 MR. FRIEDMAN:         Exactly, Justice Scalia.          It

11   fails the First Options test.              There can't be an ability

12   under First Options for the arbitrator to make a

13   decision if there's no access to the arbitrator.                 So

14   those are the two tests.          In -- in this case, what I

15   think I'm hearing is my colleague is saying that the

16   arbitrator can decide nothing; the arbitrator should

17   decide nothing, notwithstanding this Court's regular

18   holdings sending very, very complicated matters to the

19   arbitrator.    In this case, the arbitrator can absolutely

20   decide these issues of unconscionability as well as a

21   judge can.

22                 Thank you.

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

24   Mr. Friedman, Mr. Silverberg.

25                 The case is submitted.
