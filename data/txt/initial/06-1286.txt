 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in case 06-1286, Michael Knight,

 5   Trustee, v. the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.

 6                Mr. Rubin.

 7                    ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER J. RUBIN

 8                          ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                MR. RUBIN:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                The question in this case is the meaning of

12   a statute that provides that, in arriving at a trust or

13   estate's adjusted gross income, amounts are allowable in

14   full if they are -- and I quote here from 26 U.S.C.

15   section 67(e), which you can find at the bottom of page

16   3a of the appendix to the blue brief -- "costs which are

17   paid or incurred in connection with the administration

18   of the estate or trust and which would not have been

19   incurred if the property were not held in such trust or

20   estate."

21                I'd like to make three broad points.

22                First, when one applies the judicial tools

23   of statutory interpretation, the statute can mean only

24   one thing.   Second, "would not" does not mean "could

25   not."   The Commissioner's current reading of the statute


                                         3

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   and the Commissioner's previous readings of the statute

 2   are wrong.   Indeed, the logic of the Commissioner's

 3   position supports us.      It acknowledges the distinctive

 4   nature of trusts and fiduciary obligations.                     Finally,

 5   our reading makes sense.         It is consistent with the

 6   treatment of trusts and estates elsewhere in the Code.

 7   It puts in place an administrable rule that draws a

 8   clear line, and by contrast the Commissioner has

 9   provided no reason at all why Congress would have wanted

10   to subject the fees at issue here to the 2 percent

11   floor.

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I think those three points

13   are certainly what would help me.                Could I ask just two

14   preliminary questions?       They don't necessarily have to

15   do with this case, just to get something straight.                     I

16   take it that you couldn't have claimed this deduction

17   under 162 without getting into an argument that it

18   should be capitalized and that's why 212 is in the Code?

19                MR. RUBIN:      Well, 212 and 162 are really

20   sort of two sides of the same coin.                     162 is for costs

21   incurred in a trade or business, and there's no -- the

22   trust isn't engaged in a trade or business any more than

23   an individual who invests for the protection of property

24   is in a trade or business.          212, by contrast -- and the

25   text of 212 can be found in the governor's -- the


                                        4

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   government's brief appendix at 5a -- 212 is about

 2   expenditures for the preservation of property and for

 3   income in that context.        So that's why this is a 212,

 4   not a 162.

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           My other question is

 6   background only.   Perhaps I should ask the government.

 7   Are 162 expenses subject to the 2 percent ceiling?

 8                MR. RUBIN:      My recollection is that 162 --

 9   162 expenses are not subject to the -- they're not

10   miscellaneous itemized deductions.

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, you agree

12   that as a taxpayer seeking an exception to a general

13   rule, you have the burden of proof in this case?

14                MR. RUBIN:      No, Your Honor.            We think that

15   -- well, there are really two things built into your

16   question, Mr. Chief Justice.

17                First is the question of who bears the

18   burden of proof in tax cases specifically, and as this

19   court has made clear, this was litigated below on a

20   slightly different theory.          The government's theory has

21   changed during the pendency of the litigation.                 And

22   below they argued that this was a common expense for

23   individuals; yet they introduced no evidence of that.

24   And under the United States v. Janis, this Court's

25   decision in that case, they can't -- the government is


                                        5

 1   required to come forward with something before assessing

 2   tax.   But in terms of exceptions and rules, we can --

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We can't take -- I

 4   guess it's not judicial notice, but we can't assume that

 5   individual investors with several million dollars of

 6   liquid assets might hire investment advisors?

 7                 MR. RUBIN:      They might hire investment

 8   advisors, Your Honor, but we don't think that --

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Do they usually hire

10   investment advisors?

11                 MR. RUBIN:      I don't think it's clear that

12   they usually hire investment advisors, but I think the

13   important point here, in a way, is the premise of your

14   question, which is that only certain trusts with certain

15   assets, under a test that looked at what the

16   Commissioner used to argue, which is commonality or

17   customariness of a particular expense, only -- the

18   Commissioner herself now argues that, that this test is

19   unmanageable because there's difficulty in figuring out

20   what the denominator of the fraction is.                 Do you mean

21   all people?    Is it common among everyone, among

22   taxpayers, among taxpayers with certain assets?                 Would a

23   $100,000 trust have to be treated differently than a

24   million dollar trust?       Then there's the question of what

25   do you mean by "common."          You suggested "usually" or


                                         6

 1   "sometimes," "might."     That's not clear either.                And

 2   then ultimately there would have to be a trial somewhere

 3   to determine whether costs like this are indeed common

 4   to whatever standard was articulated.                  And I think this

 5   is why --

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I guess you'd

 7   concede, wouldn't you, that you're not entitled to all

 8   of the investment advice that you receive but perhaps

 9   only that that is related to the trust status?                  In other

10   words, if your investment advisor charges you $50,000

11   and, you know, 10,000 of it is unique to the trust, but

12   40,000 is the same sort of advice he'd give an

13   individual, you'd only be able to get the 10,000 outside

14   of the 2 percent limit?

15               MR. RUBIN:      We think, Your Honor, that all

16   trust investment fees are distinctive, that what renders

17   them distinctive and renders them fully deductible under

18   the statute is that they are incurred as a result of

19   distinctive fiduciary obligations.                We think the statute

20   draws a line between costs like that, that are incurred

21   as a result of distinctive fiduciary obligation, which

22   would include all investment management or advice fees,

23   and by contrast costs that inhere in ownership of a

24   particular piece of property and that any owner of that

25   property would have to pay.

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, I don't -- I don't

 2   really see that line.      I mean, let's -- let's take, you

 3   know, fixing the roof on a house that's in the trust.

 4   Aren't there distinctive trustee obligations with

 5   respect to preservation of property, just as there are

 6   with respect to preservation of financial assets?

 7               MR. RUBIN:       Yes, Your Honor.

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I think that's a very hard

 9   line to draw.

10               MR. RUBIN:       Yes, Your Honor.               I think the

11   line is -- is actually easier to draw than your question

12   suggests.   I think that fixing a roof on a house might

13   be a cost that is close to the line.                    It may be that

14   some -- for example, if there were an ordinance in the

15   community that required upkeep of a house, we think that

16   it would be subject to the 2 percent floor.

17               The archetypal example of a cost that we

18   think Congress intended and by this language we believe

19   Congress rendered subject to the 2 percent floor are the

20   costs of pass-through entities that might be owned by

21   the trust or estate.      So, for example, if there's an S

22   corporation and its management incurs an expense, that's

23   reported back -- because the S corporation has no

24   independent existence, that's reported back to the

25   owner, individual or trustee, and is reported as an


                                        8

 1   administrative expense.       It would be subject to the 2

 2   percent floor from the individual who incurred it, and

 3   it would have been incurred, which is the language of

 4   the statute, whether or not --

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:             I'm still --

 6              MR. RUBIN: -- it was held in such trust or

 7   --

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:             I'm still trying to get

 9   back to my original question.            I -- I would like to know

10   what you think is not an expense that's distinctive to

11   -- to a trust, other than fixing the roof, because you

12   haven't persuaded me on that.

13              MR. RUBIN:       The --

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:             I think fixing a roof is

15   fixing a roof.

16              MR. RUBIN:       The cost of -- not distinctive

17   costs would be the costs incurred by an S corporation

18   owned by the trustee.

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Anything else?

20              MR. RUBIN:       A condo fee, for example, that

21   simply essentially runs with the property.              Whoever owns

22   this land is going to have to pay the condo fee.

23   Required insurance on a vehicle.

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Isn't there a trustee

25   obligation to pay all -- all expenses which if not paid


                                       9

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   will -- would cause a depletion of the assets?

 2                 MR. RUBIN:       It's a question of --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Can't you say that that's a

 4   trustee response -- I mean, if the criterion is he paid

 5   this money only to discharge an obligation as a trustee,

 6   it seems to me all of his expenses are in that category,

 7   with the possible exception of the S corporations you're

 8   talking about.

 9                 MR. RUBIN:       Well, Your Honor, the costs are

10   distinctive in the case of -- of those things that are

11   caused by fiduciary obligation in the sense that we

12   describe because that's how they are caused.                 These

13   costs are incurred without regard to that fiduciary

14   obligation.     They're paid perhaps because of fiduciary

15   obligation, but they are incurred through ownership of

16   the property.

17                 And there is a hint in the text.               If you

18   look at the text, you'll note that costs that are paid

19   or incurred are deductible.              But this asks about whether

20   they would have been incurred if the property were not

21   held in such trust or estate.

22                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Rubin, you were not

23   willing to agree with the Chief when he said:                 Well,

24   maybe there are some investment expenses that are

25   special because this is a trust.                 But there must be some


                                         10

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that any investor would incur.                But you say it's got to

 2   be all one way.

 3                 MR. RUBIN:       Yes, Justice Ginsburg.            Trustees

 4   cannot under law, and do not, invest as individuals do.

 5   To begin with, they always have to keep their eye on

 6   current, future, contingent and remainder beneficiaries

 7   and treat them with equal fairness.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But they don't have

 9   to hire investment advisors.              There is a standard that

10   they may think they can meet on their own.                   They may --

11   you know, it may be an investment advisor that is the

12   trustee.   He doesn't have to hire somebody else.

13                 So it's not something that necessarily

14   inheres in the nature of the trust.

15                 MR. RUBIN:       Whenever a trustee hires an

16   investment advisor, it is to fulfill this fiduciary

17   obligation.    It is true that there may be a trustee who

18   is expert in this.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Why -- if I could

20   pause you on that, why is that the case?                   Let's say it's

21   a -- the trustee understands perfectly his obligations

22   under the law.    Let's just say he is supposed to

23   preserve capital and invest conservatively, but he wants

24   advice on which is the best conservative investment.

25                 You know, is it railroads or is it

 1   utilities?     And that's the investment advice he seeks --

 2   just that.     He says:     I know how I'm supposed to invest

 3   as a fiduciary, but there are options in there, and I

 4   just want advice on the options.

 5                 MR. RUBIN:       Yes, Your Honor.            I think that

 6   that is actually quite a typical situation.                   The

 7   trustee, of course, knows his or her obligations.                   It's

 8   his or her inability to figure out how to fulfill them

 9   that --

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, isn't that

11   just like an individual investor?                  If you have an

12   individual investor with $10 million in liquid assets,

13   he or she might know what he wants to do, either capital

14   appreciation or preservation, you know, whatever the

15   option is, but just wants some advice on how best to go

16   about that.     That sounds exactly like the trustee in our

17   hypothetical.

18                 MR. RUBIN:       Well, Your Honor, there are

19   unique obligations.       Some of these are set out in

20   Connecticut statutes.        This is in our brief at page 7 of

21   the blue brief.     There are ten considerations that

22   Connecticut law requires trustees to examine, including

23   things unique to trusts:           the nature of the trust, its

24   duration.     The need for liquidity or income versus

25   capital, which is principal growth versus income, is a

 1   uniquely trustlike concern.

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    No.   No.    No.   You

 3   see, that's my difficulty with your position.                      It's not

 4   uniquely trust because you certainly have individuals

 5   who may want income rather than capital appreciation or,

 6   you know, preservation of capital.                   They may have

 7   exactly the same objectives as a trustee.                    It's not

 8   unique to the trust.

 9              MR. RUBIN:          It -- I guess I have two answers

10   to that, Your Honor.        It may, by happenstance, be that

11   out of the black box of investment advice an individual,

12   by happenstance, gets the same advice as a trust

13   somewhere; but it would be by happenstance.                      The

14   decisional process leading to obtaining the advice,

15   incurring the cost, is distinct for trust, and indeed

16   the advice they receive is distinct.

17              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Well, it seems to me that

18   that just simply couldn't have been Congress's purpose

19   in passing this statute because now you have a recipe

20   for avoidance.     In most States -- California has a rule

21   that the trustee has to make prudent business

22   investments.     I assume a great number of businessmen

23   outside the trust context think that they have their

24   principal objective of making prudent business

25   investments.     But under your theory all expenses for


                                         13

 1   that objective would fall within this exclusion.                       I just

 2   don't think that's what the Congress could possibly have

 3   intended.

 4                 MR. RUBIN:      Well, Your Honor, to begin with,

 5   there is no risk here of tax avoidance through creation

 6   of a trust.    These are non-grantor trusts.                    There are

 7   substantial costs involved in creating them, but, among

 8   other things, the top bracket of 35 percent --

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, is that true just in

10   your case?

11                 MR. RUBIN:      No --

12                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Universally, there is

13   never a danger of tax avoidance?                You want us to write

14   the decision on the assumption that tax avoidance is

15   never a problem in the creation of a trust?

16                 MR. RUBIN:      Well, the Commissioner concedes

17   at page 37 of her brief that there is no substantial

18   problem of income- splitting through the use of

19   non-grantor trusts; and, indeed, throughout --

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is that true?          And I'm

21   looking at testimony given by J. Roger Mintz in 1986

22   when this measure was before Congress, and in that

23   written testimony is the statement:                      "First, the

24   treatment of trusts as separate taxpayers with a

25   separate, graduated rate schedule can cause income to be


                                        14

 1   taxed at a rate lower than if the grantor had retained

 2   direct ownership of the trust assets or given the assets

 3   outright to the beneficiaries."

 4               So apparently the Treasury was telling the

 5   Congress that there is a problem.

 6               MR. RUBIN:      Yes, Justice Ginsburg.                That

 7   problem was solved in Section 1 of 26 U.S. Code -- and

 8   this is described at page 37 of our brief -- by a

 9   compression of the tax brackets.              The 35 percent bracket

10   kicks in for non-grantor trusts at $10,500.                    For an

11   individual it kicks in at $349,000.                    As a consequence,

12   there is no incentive to move money into a trust in

13   order to avoid taxation at a -- at a lower rate.

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Excuse me.           I am not sure

15   what you mean by "non-grantor trusts."                   What is a

16   "non-grantor trust"?

17               MR. RUBIN:      A non-grantor trust is a real

18   trust with economic substance.             A grantor trust is a

19   trust in which the grantor retains certain powers, for

20   example it's revocable, or whatever; and it's treated as

21   -- people set them up for estate- planning purposes, but

22   --

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Every trust has a grantor,

24   I assume.

25               MR. RUBIN:      Yes, yes, yes.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:           So a "non-grantor trust" --

 2                MR. RUBIN:      But this is -- I guess this is a

 3   term of art.

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- is a trust without any

 5   money.

 6                MR. RUBIN:      Yes.

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            A grantor trust would be

 8   one of those pass-throughs.

 9                MR. RUBIN:      Yes.       And, indeed, this, I think

10   -- and part of the answer to Justice Kennedy's question:

11   The problem of tax avoidance was dealt with in section

12   67)(c), where entities like that were -- were said to be

13   treated as pass-through entities with no independent

14   existence.   But trusts and estates were excepted

15   specifically from that because of this absence of risk

16   of income-splitting.      And, indeed, we think that the --

17   the structure of the statute, not merely its text, but

18   the structure of the statute, indicates that this is

19   what Congress intended.

20                It's not -- it's not written the way I would

21   have written it, Your Honor.            But none of the other

22   readings are textually even supportable, and this --

23                JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask this sort of

24   elementary question, and it may reveal my stupidity.

25   But actually sometimes these costs are incurred by


                                       16
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   individuals, and sometimes they're not.                 But -- so that

 2   you would normally think there's going to be a

 3   case-by-case analysis of what happened in the particular

 4   case.

 5              But do I understand correctly that both you

 6   and the government take the position that we should

 7   apply the same rule across the board regardless of the

 8   actual facts?

 9              MR. RUBIN:        I wouldn't say "regardless of

10   the actual facts," Your Honor.              But I would say this:

11   We believe it's a categorical test.

12              The first of what the Commissioner calls her

13   textually plausible readings is literally a case-by-case

14   examination of what would have happened with this

15   property if it were held by whomever, the beneficiary,

16   the grantor, it's not clear whom.                And, as they

17   described, Congress can't have meant that.                And this

18   would be an imponderable.          How would you ever --

19              JUSTICE STEVENS:             That's the most normal

20   reading of the language, it's a case-by-case test.                   It

21   seems to me the -- probably the most unwise reading,

22   also.

23              MR. RUBIN:        Well, Your Honor, I think -- I

24   see your point.   And I think this is why, if you look at

25   the structure of Section 67, which treats pass-through


                                       17
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   entities but not trusts and estates as presenting a risk

 2   of income-splitting; if you look at the Code more

 3   broadly, which permits deductions by trusts and estates

 4   in many circumstances -- section 68 does; section 154

 5   does -- when they're not permitted by individuals and

 6   especially when you look at the statutory history

 7   here --

 8                 Both houses of Congress -- well, this was

 9   preexisting law, I should begin by saying.                   And then

10   both houses of Congress passed in the '86 Act this

11   statute without the second clause.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I've read the legislative

13   history, which shows to me, anyway, precisely no light

14   whatsoever.    It's -- the only relevant sentence, which

15   is the third sentence, simply repeats the statute.                    And,

16   therefore, I thought that what Congress is trying to do

17   is say, treat trusts like individuals, except in respect

18   to special expenses.

19                 What are special expenses?                 Those that

20   are related to the trust and that an individual wouldn't

21   have occurred -- incurred.           I can't say it much clearly

22   than that.    But I have an absolutely clear idea what it

23   means.    To me it means that if this is an expense that

24   the trust is saying is special, I would say, would a

25   reasonable person who did not hold these assets in


                                        18
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   trust, would such a person be likely to make that kind

 2   of expenditure?

 3                And if the answer to that question is yes,

 4   well, then I would say it's not a special expense.                    And

 5   if the answer is no, I would say it was.

 6                And then the IRS and you will come and say

 7   that isn't precise enough.           And I'd say the IRS has

 8   plenty of authority in its regs to give lists of

 9   examples which they do in such instances.

10                Now, I'm posing that, not because I bought

11   into it, though I'm tempted to, but I'd like to know

12   what your response is.

13                MR. RUBIN:       Well, Your Honor, I guess my

14   response is severalfold.          To begin with, the statute

15   doesn't ask what usually happens on the outside or

16   commonly or customarily, and indeed the Commissioner has

17   abandoned this reading of the statute precisely because

18   it presents the kind of imponderables that I was

19   discussing with the Chief Justice:                  What is usually

20   done?    Do trusts of different sizes have different

21   rules?    When a trust's assets come below a certain

22   point, what about that?         And most importantly, it's not

23   in the text of the statute.

24                Now, the Commissioner concedes the

25   distinctive nature of trusts.              And if you look at the


                                        19
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   examples that she gives on page 23 of her brief of what

 2   it is that, that is deductible in full, it's the same as

 3   this:   Fiduciary income tax preparation.                  Well,

 4   people -- many people get income tax preparation for

 5   individual income tax returns.              The only difference is

 6   it's a Form 1040 or a Form 1041.

 7               Our case is much further from the line than

 8   that because the investment advice must be tailored to

 9   these, to these rules under Connecticut law.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Okay.     Well, then

11   let's take that.   Let's suppose that the trustee goes to

12   an investment advisor, doesn't tell him that he is a

13   trustee, just says, I need to know, I can't decide,

14   should I invest in Union Pacific or CSX?                   I'm going to

15   invest in a railroad; which one do you like better?                       He

16   doesn't tell him he's a trustee, gets some advice and

17   gets a bill.   Is that subject to the 2 percent floor,

18   because presumably the advice has got nothing to do with

19   fiduciary responsibilities?

20               MR. RUBIN:       If it has nothing to do with

21   fiduciary responsibilities, Your Honor, we think it

22   would be a breach of fiduciary obligation to get --

23   waste the trust money paying for the advice and to act

24   upon it.

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Oh, no.     It's a


                                       20
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   reasonable -- let's say a railroad stock is a reasonable

 2   investment for a trust.        He just wants to know which one

 3   is the best one.

 4              MR. RUBIN:        We think that this is intended

 5   as a categorical rule.       And we think that asking that

 6   question is in furtherance of these unique obligations

 7   and the prudent investor standard, which is not -- this

 8   is a new standard that's developed in the United States

 9   over the next decade or so.            It is not merely what a

10   prudent man would do under the old Harvard College v.

11   Amory common law test.

12              Investments that individuals can and do

13   invest in are not open to trustees who have a series of

14   rules, some of which are counterintuitive, in fact,

15   about what they can do.        And these are listed at pages 7

16   to 10 of our brief.     But that -- what you're describing

17   we think is investment advice and if it's properly

18   obtained it is distinctive.

19              I should say also in response --

20              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  How can it be

21   distinctive if the advisor doesn't even know that the

22   person's a trustee?

23              MR. RUBIN:        Well, the question is the

24   decisional process of the trustee.                 When the trustee

25   calls up anyone, the income tax preparer, and says I'd


                                       21

 1   like to hire you, he doesn't have to say at the moment

 2   of hiring it's for a trust.

 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, when it's

 4   filled out --

 5              MR. RUBIN:       He'll figure it out --

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 -- he knows it's on

 7   Form 1041 rather than 1040.

 8              MR. RUBIN:       He will eventually come to know

 9   that the form is different, Your Honor, yes.                  But I

10   don't think the subjective knowledge of the person from

11   whom one gets the advice is the question.                  The question,

12   I think, is textually directed to the incurment of the

13   cost.

14              And I should say also in part of response to

15   part of Justice Breyer's question, the statutory history

16   isn't merely the legislative history.                  It's the fact

17   that, despite having just the first prong in it when it

18   was passed by both houses of Congress, there was a floor

19   amendment in the Senate on the day that it passed the

20   Senate that dealt with pass-throughs.                  The first part of

21   67(c), and the changes made in the conference committee,

22   again as the Commissioner acknowledges at page 37 of her

23   brief, the changes made in conference, including the

24   addition of this, were to deal precisely with how should

25   we deal with pass-throughs and trusts, and trust


                                      22
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   ownership of pass-throughs --

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            There's nothing that I

 3   could find anywhere that talked about pass-throughs in

 4   respect to the special situation of trusts and estates.

 5   In the first sentence it speaks to it in respect to

 6   individuals.     It all makes sense.               And what they seem to

 7   be saying is just what I said initially.                      We do agree

 8   trusts do have a special claim, but only in respect to

 9   special trust expenses.          And which are they?              They're

10   the ones an individual wouldn't have incurred.

11                 And I'll put a gloss on it, like we do in

12   law.     I say a reasonable individual.                   I say wouldn't

13   reasonably have incurred.            And then I leave it up to the

14   IRS to say which are the expenses that an individual

15   would likely incur and which ones he wouldn't likely

16   incur.

17                 Now, that runs throughout tax law, doesn't

18   it, that kind of list, what's a necessary expenditure,

19   what isn't.     I mean, they do that all the time, don't

20   they?

21                 MR. RUBIN:       Yes, Your Honor.               Regulations,

22   however, have to be both reasonable --

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Not buying into they're

24   thing with "could."       I mean, that isn't my problem.

25                 MR. RUBIN:       Okay.        If they drew a list of

 1   what are the distinct trust costs, it would have to

 2   include, if it includes fiduciary, income tax

 3   preparation or, better yet, judicial accounting,

 4   individual duties in the case of guardianships and so

 5   on.   This is of the same caliber and at the same level

 6   of generality we think would have to be covered.

 7               JUSTICE ALITO:          But have they issued a

 8   regulation drawing up this list at this point?

 9               MR. RUBIN:       There's only a proposed

10   regulation, Your Honor.        And we believe that because

11   their readings are not textually supportable, are

12   unadministratable and aren't what Congress intended,

13   that after applying the ordinary tools of statutory

14   construction, there is only one meaning that this text

15   can have.

16               I'd like to respond to --

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Why is it not

18   administerable?   Whether you think it's a faithful

19   rendition of the statute is one thing, but this is

20   exactly what Justice Breyer was talking about.                 It says

21   these are the things that are special to the trust, and

22   then these are the things that are not.                 That's what the

23   proposed reg does, right?

24               MR. RUBIN:       Yes, Your Honor.           It is -- it's

25   a little bit of a moving target but it does say that.

 1   If those are nonexhaustive lists and the difficulty of

 2   allocating these costs of attributing them to one thing

 3   or another, putting in place systems that trustees that

 4   charge unitary fees, which is what corporate trustees

 5   do, is enormous.    And some of this can be seen in the

 6   comments, the public comments to the regulation, some

 7   excerpts of which are included in the appendix to our

 8   reply brief.

 9                But this is not a simple test.                 And indeed,

10   the Commissioner essentially concedes that, saying that

11   she would need to have safe harbors or some other

12   unprincipled line because of the difficulty.

13                I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

17                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER

18                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

19                MR. MILLER:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

20   please the Court:

21                Section 67(e) creates a narrow exception to

22   the 2 percent floor for costs which would not have not

23   have been incurred if the property were not held in

24   trust.

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             It wasn't narrow in the

 1   beginning, right?

 2                MR. MILLER:        Well, that's correct, Your

 3   Honor.    The second clause was added in a floor

 4   amendment.    Initially Congress had drafted just the

 5   "which are paid" -- "which are incurred or paid in

 6   connection with the administration of the estate or

 7   trust."    Then the second clause was added.                   And that

 8   clause demands that the costs would not have been

 9   incurred if the property were not held --

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             This is somewhat of a

11   mystery, the wording of that clause.                     And since it came

12   in at the very last minute, isn't it appropriate to give

13   it a limited reading, rather than, in your suggestion,

14   that this provision that up until the very end read just

15   administration, "costs paid or incurred in connection

16   with the administration of the estate or trust,"

17   period?   And then there was this add-on.                    Why should we

18   give that an expansive meaning?

19                MR. MILLER:        I think, regardless of the

20   timing, Your Honor, Congress chose to enact it and that

21   choice has to be given effect.               And I think when you

22   look at the way that the section as a whole is set up,

23   67(e), the first introductory clause creates the general

24   principle that for purposes of this section the adjusted

25   gross income of an estate shall be computed in the same

 1   manner as in the case of an individual, except that, and

 2   then there is clause one.

 3              So in the context of this section, we have a

 4   general rule and then an exception.                       And that ought to

 5   be interpreted in light of the usual principle that

 6   exceptions, particularly ambiguous exceptions, should

 7   not be construed so as to swallow up the entirety of the

 8   rule, which is essentially what Petitioner's

 9   interpretation would do.

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Why do you think that the

11   only instances where the expense would not have occurred

12   are those instances where it could not have occurred?

13   That doesn't strike me as self-evident.

14              I mean, I understand why you do it, so that

15   can you have a nice clear line, which I am all for.                       But

16   the line given by your colleague is just as clear.                       I

17   don't know why I should accept yours when -- I mean,

18   "would" just does not mean "could."                       I mean, would have,

19   could have, should have, it's -- they're different

20   words.

21              MR. MILLER:           Well, they are -- they're

22   certainly different words.            We're not suggesting that

23   they are synonyms.      But we are suggesting that there are

24   contexts in which the word "would" can carry the same

25   meaning that is also expressed through the word "could."

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Give me a context where --

 2   where -- other than this statute, where in common

 3   parlance people use "would" to mean "could."

 4                MR. MILLER:       Another example would be if I

 5   were to say that that glass would not hold more than 8

 6   ounces of water, that would mean that it could not hold

 7   more than 8 ounces of water.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:           No, I don't think it would

 9   mean that.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:           A glass --

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Anything that could not be

12   done of course would not be done.                But that doesn't mean

13   that the -- that the two words mean the same thing.

14                MR. MILLER:       But --

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:           It's true that one is

16   included within the other, but they don't mean the same

17   thing.

18                MR. MILLER:       Would -- I think that the

19   unadorned use of the word "would" here --

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:           What could not happen would

21   not happen, of course.       But it doesn't mean that -- the

22   two concepts are not the same.

23                MR. MILLER:       I think, when -- when you have

24   the word "would," as we have in this statute, that's not

25   qualified in any way, it's ambiguous in the sense that

 1   it can mean definitely would not have been incurred,

 2   probably would not have been incurred, customarily,

 3   ordinarily would not have been incurred, which is the

 4   meaning --

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  You didn't think

 6   much of this argument before the Second Circuit adopted

 7   it, did you?   You didn't argue this before the Court of

 8   Appeals?

 9                (Laughter.)

10                MR. MILLER:         We did not argue it before --

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So you have a

12   fallback argument.

13                MR. MILLER:         Well, that -- that's right.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, now might be a

15   good time to fall back.

16                (Laughter.)

17                JUSTICE BREYER:             Before -- I mean, we have

18   lots of good examples.         I mean, I could have colored my

19   room at home, painted it with light green plastic, but I

20   wouldn't have done it.         I mean, endless examples.

21                MR. MILLER:         Right.        And certainly the

22   statute also admits of the reading given to it by the

23   Fourth and Federal Circuits, which is that "would not

24   have been incurred" means customarily or ordinarily

25   would not have been incurred by individuals.

 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             If we can rush to the

 2   fallback position, is it acceptable to have a test that

 3   says would the expense have been incurred if the

 4   nontrust business wanted to achieve an objective that

 5   the trust wanted to achieve here, fixing the roof?

 6                MR. MILLER:         I -- I think that that raises

 7   the question of what is the relevant comparison group

 8   for -- for individuals outside of the trust side of it.

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And I think the structure

10   of the statute requires us to -- to do that.

11                MR. MILLER:         That's right.            And -- and we

12   would suggest that the relevant comparison is

13   individuals with -- with similar assets, right, because

14   it's in the absence of a trust, not if the property did

15   not exist.   So you have to look at an individual who

16   held those assets outright, and an individual with those

17   assets trying to achieve those goals might well seek

18   investment advice.

19                JUSTICE ALITO:           Will, you give as an example

20   of something that wouldn't fall within the 2 percent

21   floor the cost of preparing and filing a fiduciary

22   income tax return.      What is the difference between that

23   and getting fiduciary investment advice?

24                MR. MILLER:         The -- the difference is --

25                JUSTICE ALITO:           Just because it's a


                                         30

 1   different form that's filled out?

 2              MR. MILLER:        What --

 3              JUSTICE ALITO:          Is it more expensive to --

 4   to fill out a 1041 than to fill out the 1040?

 5              MR. MILLER:        It's more expensive because

 6   it's an additional cost.        If an individual were to hold

 7   the property outright, he or she would simply put the

 8   income from that property on his own 1040.                   If in

 9   addition there is a trust, then the trust has to fill

10   out a 1041, the trust also has to prepare Form K-1s and

11   send them out both to the beneficiaries and to the IRS,

12   showing the beneficiaries' share of the trust income,

13   and then the individual still has to file a 1040.                    So

14   the existence of the trust has created this whole

15   additional set of filing and reporting obligations.

16              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes, but it's the

17   individual who has to file the 1040.                   What the trustee

18   is filing is the 1041.      And -- and why do you place -- I

19   was going to ask the same question that Justice Alito

20   did, and that is why do you place so much significance

21   either in the label, i.e., it's fiduciary return, or in

22   the peculiar fact that it is a fiduciary who is filing

23   that return?

24              It's a tax return and -- and I think your --

25   the government's argument is that with respect to -- to


                                      31

 1   other items that may be disputed, you should regard them

 2   at a fairly general level, i.e., investment advice, not

 3   fiduciary investment advice.            But when you come to the

 4   tax return, you don't regard it as a general -- at a

 5   general level; you regard it at a very specific level,

 6   i.e., a fiduciary tax return.             It seems to me that the

 7   government with respect to the tax return is doing

 8   exactly what it criticizes the taxpayer for doing with

 9   respect to investment advice.             And I don't understand

10   the distinction.

11               MR. MILLER:        With respect to the tax return,

12   it's not that it's a fiduciary tax return as opposed to

13   an individual tax return; it's that it's an extra tax

14   return that has to be filed.

15               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, it's the only tax

16   return that the fiduciary has to file; isn't that

17   correct?   The fiduciary files that tax return and the

18   beneficiary files a 1040.

19               MR. MILLER:        That's right, but if the

20   beneficiary --

21               JUSTICE SOUTER:            But the only return the

22   fiduciary's filing is the 1041; isn't that right?

23               MR. MILLER:        That's the only -- but in that

24   -- in the system of the beneficiary and the fiduciary

25   there are two tax returns that have to be filed, whereas

 1   --

 2               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Okay; I understand that

 3   that is a factual difference, but I don't understand

 4   what it is that makes that a difference in principle.

 5               MR. MILLER:          I think that -- that's an extra

 6   obligation that would not have been incurred in the

 7   absence of the trust.        And I think, turning to the case

 8   of investment advice, I think there is really no level

 9   of generality or particularity at which one can look at

10   investment advice such that there is anything unique

11   about trust investment advice.

12               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Well, can't you ask it --

13   can't -- can't you ask this question pointing towards

14   something unique:     If the individual investor does a

15   very poor job of managing his investments, all he can

16   ultimately do is cry about it.                But if the trustee does

17   a very poor job, the trustee is going to get sued.                So

18   that when the trustee asks for an investment advisor's

19   advice, the trustee is addressing an issue that the

20   individual does not have.            The trustee wants to be

21   covered.   He also, I presume, wants to be a good

22   trustee.   But he is in fact doing something which is, to

23   use your phrase, in addition to what the individual

24   investor would do.      He is looking out for somebody else

25   and he is looking out for himself if the investment goes

 1   south.     Why isn't that a sufficient difference that is

 2   at least comparable to the difference that you talk

 3   about in the filing of a fiduciary tax return?

 4                 MR. MILLER:        It's not a difference, because

 5   if the individual invests poorly he'll lose money.                 And

 6   if the -- and he'll lose his own money.                   If the

 7   fiduciary invests poorly he may get sued and the measure

 8   of damages in that suit will be the amount of money he

 9   lost.    So they're both facing the possibility of losing.

10                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes, but whether -- whether

11   he gets socked with damages or not is going to depend in

12   part whether he is covered by an investment advisor's

13   bit of advice; and that is -- that is a different item

14   in the calculus of liability.               He is providing for

15   something that the individual investor does not provide

16   for or need to provide for.

17                 MR. MILLER:        Well, the -- the standard of

18   conduct that is supposed to govern the fiduciary is the

19   prudent investor rule, which looks at what a reasonable

20   prudent individual would do in managing his own money so

21   I think that --

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, I have the same

23   problem.    You know, I -- it seems to me that it is

24   entirely reasonable to say only a trustee can seek

25   investment advice concerning what he should do to


                                         34

 1   fulfill his responsibilities under the trust.                 Only a

 2   trustee can do that.       A private individual might seek

 3   investment advice as to how he could maximize the income

 4   or -- or the growth of the funds that he has, but

 5   only -- only a trustee seeks advice as to how he can

 6   fulfill his responsibilities under the trust.                 And you

 7   could say that's distinctive.              No individual would do

 8   that because he's not a trustee.

 9                 MR. MILLER:       But there's no distinction in

10   that case in the -- in the fee that's charged or in the

11   advice that's given by the investment advisor.                 In

12   either case somebody goes to the advisor and says, I

13   have the following goals that I want to achieve with

14   this money.    It may be my money; it may be a trust's

15   money.   And the advisor thinks about those goals and

16   comes up with -- with investment advice.                 And those

17   goals --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It may -- it may well be

19   the same advice, but in -- but in one case it is -- it

20   is advice sought by and given to a trustee, a unique

21   kind of advice.    In -- in substance, it may turn out to

22   be the same; but it's not the same advice you're giving

23   to a private individual.          You're saying here's the trust

24   instrument and here are the objects to be achieved by

25   the trust instrument and this is the -- the advice that

 1   will best do that.      That doesn't happen with an

 2   individual.

 3                 MR. MILLER:        I mean, but for the fact that

 4   the word "trust" is in there, I think the substance of

 5   the interaction with the investment advisor is exactly

 6   the same.

 7                 JUSTICE ALITO:           But doesn't your proposed

 8   regulation concede that there is investment advisory

 9   advice that is unique to -- to estates and trusts?

10   Isn't that what subparagraph C says?

11                 MR. MILLER:        No.      Subparagraph C has two

12   lists, both of which are nonexclusive:                    a list of items

13   that are unique to trusts and a list of items that are

14   not unique to trusts.        In the list of items that are not

15   unique to trusts is investing for total return.                    There

16   is no type of investment advice --

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Why that limitation?          Why

18   wouldn't it say just "investment advice," but it's --

19   investing for total return is more limited?

20                 MR. MILLER:        I think perhaps because that's

21   most obviously the type of advice that is not unique to

22   trusts.   But the -- the proposed regulation does not

23   identify any kind of advice that is unique to trusts.

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             It doesn't say it's one

25   or the other.    So it's not so sure, right?                  It's sure

 1   about advice on investing for total return.

 2               MR. MILLER:         And --

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              In other words, the

 4   regulation, the proposed regulation, doesn't answer this

 5   case of investment advice in general as opposed to

 6   advice on investing for total return.

 7               MR. MILLER:         You're right that the

 8   regulation in terms of the enumeration in subsection (b)

 9   is silent on the question of other types of --

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Can you really spice up

11   advice that way?    You ask the advisor, say, which --

12   what percentage of your advice was the advice that went

13   to maximizing total return and what percentage went to

14   this other thing?    I mean, gee, I don't want to get

15   courts into trying to figure that out, or private

16   individuals or financial advisors in trying to figure

17   that out.   That's just a crazy way to run a tax system,

18   it seems to me.

19               MR. MILLER:         I think that's right, and

20   that's why I think that the -- despite the fact that

21   investing for total return is the only example given in

22   the list, which, again, is described as not exclusive.

23   I think the best reading of the proposed regulation is

24   --

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:             But that's not all advice.

 1   That's just some of the advice, right?

 2               MR. MILLER:         Yes.

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Now, what about the rest of

 4   it?   How do you slice up, you know -- now, investment

 5   advisor, tell me what percentage of your advice went to

 6   the total return and what percentage went to other

 7   things.   I don't think the investment advisor is going

 8   to be able to tell you.

 9               MR. MILLER:         I think the best reading of the

10   proposed regulation, and perhaps the Service may well

11   clarify this during the rule-making process, is that all

12   advice is not unique to trusts because there's no type

13   of advice that a trustee could seek that an individual

14   could not --

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              They certainly weren't

16   sure about it when they drafted this regulation,

17   proposed regulation.

18               MR. MILLER:         Well, it is -- it's just a

19   proposal, again, and I think they picked what's perhaps

20   the most obvious.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But in other categories,

22   they express no such limitation.                Custody or management

23   of property, not qualified.             And they -- but when you

24   get to investing, it has that total return.                Everything

25   else has got maintenance, repair, insurance.

 1                 MR. MILLER:       That's right.            And there's also

 2   a fairly extensive list of nonexclusive -- of nonunique

 3   products or services, and that does not include any

 4   other type of investment advice.                So I think what one

 5   can draw the opposite inference from that list, but in

 6   any event, that's something that could be clarified in

 7   the rule-making process.

 8                 Returning to --

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So how does your

10   customary or commonly incurred test work?                  Let's say you

11   have two trusts, one $10 million, the other 10,000.                    I

12   think an individual with $10 million might well seek

13   investment advice, but an individual with only 10,000

14   might decide it's not worth it.               Would you have a

15   different application of the 2 percent rule for those

16   two trusts?

17                 MR. MILLER:       I think if the test is whether

18   -- whether the individuals would have -- would commonly

19   ordinarily incur that cost, I think one might well look

20   at that because the comparison would be individuals with

21   similar assets, and, as Your Honor knows, there might be

22   a difference depending on the size.

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                How many -- how many

24   individuals do you need?          Let's say it's $3 million in

25   the trust, and we think maybe 60 percent of people would


                                        39
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   hire an investment advisor; 40 percent would think they

 2   can do just as well on their own.                 Is that customarily

 3   incurred by individuals?

 4                MR. MILLER:        I think it might well be enough

 5   that -- for something that the Service could clarify

 6   through --

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Your answer to both

 8   questions is "might well be," and that's a fairly vague

 9   line when it comes to taxes.

10                MR. MILLER:        The --

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:            And whatever line you --

12   you pick, I guarantee you, trusts are going to break

13   themselves up into mini-trusts that fall under the line.

14   I mean people aren't stupid.

15                (Laughter.)

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Or, even worse,

17   advisors are going to break themselves up into different

18   advisors.    There's going to be somebody who says I'm a

19   fiduciary advisor whenever a trustee calls, but, I'm a

20   normal advisor, when it's an individual.

21                MR. MILLER:        I think the difficulty in

22   applying that test is one of the reasons why we suggest

23   that the categorical -- the more categorical approach,

24   which we think is also a permissible reading of the

25   statute, is the preferable one.               But, in either event,

 1   if the test is customarily or ordinarily incurred, it

 2   was Petitioner's obligation in the tax court to show

 3   that they qualified for the exemption from the 2 percent

 4   floor.    And so it would be Petitioner's burden to show

 5   that this is a cost not that's customarily or ordinarily

 6   incurred by individuals.

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What's your best

 8   case for that proposition?             Your colleague resisted the

 9   notion that he had the burden and what's your best case

10   for that?

11                 MR. MILLER:        It's not a case, but it's the

12   rule.    Tax Court Rule 142 places the burden of proof on

13   the taxpayer.     Petitioner sites --

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But I thought that

15   rule applied to the applicability of individual

16   exemptions.     Here we have a different question.                It's

17   how to read an exception to the general rule.                   Do you

18   have a case for a proposition that the taxpayer has the

19   burden in those cases?         You said that in your brief, but

20   it didn't have a case cite with it.

21                 MR. MILLER:        No.      We don't have a case, but

22   the rule is unqualified in terms of its applicability.

23   It doesn't say only on particular issues.                   And the case

24   that Petitioner cites is United States against Janis,

25   which is about a "naked" assessment, which is far

 1   removed from what we have here.

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Are you saying --

 3               MR. MILLER:          A "naked" assessment is --

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Are we saying, as a

 5   question of law, the taxpayer has the burden of proof?

 6   If it isn't a question of proof, it isn't a question of

 7   evidence?

 8               MR. MILLER:          No.      I was referring to

 9   questions of fact.      I understood the question to be if

10   the legal test turns on the factual question of what is

11   it, what is customary or ordinary for individuals to

12   incur, then on that fact, that would be a factual issue.

13               JUSTICE BREYER:              Well, what would -- that's

14   why I made the suggestion I had earlier.                  I was doubtful

15   about the wisdom of trying to turn this matter into a

16   purely factual one.       And so suppose you said, which

17   would come to about the same thing, that expenditure

18   would be incurred in this instance by someone who didn't

19   hold these assets in trust.              What that means is would a

20   -- an investor not in the trust, not holding it in

21   trust, reasonably have been, or a reasonable investor

22   have been likely to make this expenditure?                 That turns

23   it into a more quasi-legal question where people -- and

24   then it's a matter of judgment, which these things do

25   come down to.   That's what judges are there for, to

 1   judge.     And thereby we avoid the burden-of-proof

 2   problem.     It comes to about the same thing.                Is there

 3   any objection to it?        What's the reason not to do it?

 4                 MR. MILLER:        If that is the test, then it's

 5   very easy to apply to the case of investment advice,

 6   because we know that the trustee's obligation is to act

 7   as a reasonable and prudent individual would.                   And so we

 8   know that if -- to the extent that the trustee seeks

 9   investment advice in pursuance of that obligation --

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:            But are you --

11                 MR. MILLER: -- that would --

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:            You would be, of course,

13   exactly right, that there could be trusts, very big

14   trusts.    Children get into fights trying to split up the

15   assets.    Millions is paid on lawyers and investment

16   advisors to see if each share, figured 14 different

17   ways, is going to earn this money or that money.                   And

18   that kind of thing exists.            And there the investment

19   advisors are likely to be special.                   So you can't say

20   investment advice is always special or never special.

21                 Now, again, this seems to me not unknown,

22   this kind of problem, to the Internal Revenue law, and

23   therefore there tend to be methods of allowing

24   exceptions, of putting burdens.                I mean, is this case

25   somehow -- am I wrong about that?

 1              MR. MILLER:          I think that to the extent that

 2   you're suggesting that the Service could be -- could

 3   clarify the statute through the use of regulations, we

 4   certainly agree with that.           The service has the ability

 5   to resolve some of the ambiguities.

 6              JUSTICE BREYER:              I'm looking really for a

 7   form of words to write that does not use the word

 8   "could" but which gets at what I think the statute was

 9   after, which is:    Let them have this no floor for their

10   special stuff but not for ordinary stuff that others

11   would have incurred regardless.                I want to know what

12   form of words.   I find it difficult to go beyond the

13   statute, frankly.

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:              I think "would not have

15   occurred" is pretty good --

16              JUSTICE BREYER:              Yes.

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:              -- actually.

18              JUSTICE BREYER:              That's right.     That's

19   right.

20              (Laughter.)

21              MR. MILLER:          The -- the formulation that the

22   Service has proposed of course is to look at costs that

23   are unique to --

24              JUSTICE BREYER:              If I reject this word

25   "could" and "uniqueness," now what form of word should I

 1   write?

 2              MR. MILLER:           I think "ordinarily" or

 3   "customarily" is also a permissible interpretation of --

 4              JUSTICE BREYER:               If had you to choose

 5   between that and getting the idea of the reasonable

 6   taxpayer who didn't hold this in trust, which would you

 7   choose?

 8              MR. MILLER:           I think they are actually very

 9   similar inquiries, because we expect that the reasonable

10   person is the ordinary person.                So I think in practice,

11   those formulations get you to the --

12              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               It almost sounds like

13   ordinary and necessary under 162?

14              MR. MILLER:           Well, ordinary and necessary

15   under -- I mean here we are talking about -- as

16   Mr. Rubin said, it's under 212.

17              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               212.       I understand that.

18              MR. MILLER:           It's not in connection with a

19   trade or business.      Ordinary and necessary in that

20   context means simply that it's a legitimately connected

21   to the production of income.              That's a requirement for

22   it to be deductible at all.

23              JUSTICE ALITO:             It seems to me the

24   difficulty is in characterizing the level of generality

25   at which you describe the cost, not whether it's

 1   ordinary or customary or unique.               You run into the same

 2   problem no matter how you do that, but you have to

 3   decide whether you're talking about investment advice or

 4   fiduciary investment advice, tax preparation costs or

 5   fiduciary tax preparation costs.               And what is the

 6   formula for making that distinction?

 7               MR. MILLER:        I think what the Service is

 8   trying to do in the proposed regulation and what we have

 9   suggested is appropriate is simply a common sense

10   practical approach to that.            And there may be some

11   difficult cases at the margin.              And that's one of the

12   things that the service will try to --

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And this must be one.

14   The Service must think this is one because it was

15   certain about the tax return.             It says tax return that

16   doesn't get the subject to the 2 percent but only this

17   kind of investment advice for total return.                    So that the

18   Service didn't see this as a clear and certain category.

19               MR. MILLER:        Again, I think what the Service

20   was doing there was picking out just the most obvious

21   example.   But there simply is no such thing as fiduciary

22   investment advice that is distinct from --

23               JUSTICE ALITO:          How do we deal with this

24   problem until there is a regulation?                    It may be that if

25   the Service issues a regulation and says that these fall

 1   into one category and these fall into the other, that

 2   would be entitled to a deference.                But right now we

 3   don't have a regulation, right?              So what do we do?

 4              MR. MILLER:         I think what we have suggested

 5   is there are two -- there are a couple of possible

 6   readings of the statute based on the ambiguity in the

 7   word "would."   And in the absence of a regulation, we

 8   are not suggesting that the Service's position is

 9   entitled to deference under Chevron.                    But I think some

10   deference to the consistent position of the Service

11   since the statute was enacted that the investment advice

12   be subject to the 2 percent floor.

13              JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I ask you the same

14   question I asked your adversary?               Whether you use the

15   term "could" or "customarily" or whatever you're

16   formulating, the bottom line, as I understand your

17   position, is that these costs will never be deductible?

18              MR. MILLER:         They will -- they will be

19   deductible but they will be subject to the floor.

20              JUSTICE STEVENS:             But they will never -- you

21   would not say some trusts yes, and some trusts no?

22              MR. MILLER:         Well, under -- I mean, if the

23   test were customarily or ordinarily, it might be the

24   case that a trust could show that given the nature of

25   the assets in it, if it were --

 1               JUSTICE STEVENS:             Would you have to have a

 2   case-by-case analysis of the facts as to whether the

 3   particular advice would have been sought, whether the

 4   advice was by a trustee or by an individual?

 5               MR. MILLER:         It's not -- we are not

 6   suggesting that it's at the level of that particular

 7   advice.   The question would be --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:             The cost of the advice?

 9   What percentage of the costs incurred by a trust do you

10   think the investment advice consists of?                 I mean, it

11   seems to me the main thing a trustee ordinarily does, at

12   least if he is a trustee of just cash, is to invest it.

13   It seems to me his major expense must be getting

14   financial advice, isn't that right?

15               MR. MILLER:         I don't know the answer to

16   that.   The Service --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, imagine something

18   else.   Guess.   What other, what other expense could even

19   approximate that?

20               MR. MILLER:         One --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:             And then my follow-up is,

22   is there any -- I don't care about legislative history

23   but some of my colleagues do.              Is there any -- is there

24   any indication that Congress thought it was, it was

25   whacking trusts with this immense new tax with respect

 1   to their major expenditure?              I expect it must be their

 2   major expenditure.

 3               MR. MILLER:          To take your second question

 4   first, the legislative history is silent on specifically

 5   what Congress's objective was in section 67(e).

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:              The dog didn't bark.

 7               MR. MILLER:          But I think -- but I think what

 8   one can infer from legislative history of the '86 Act

 9   and more broadly and from the text of the statute is

10   that Congress wanted property to be treated the same,

11   regardless of whether it was held by an individual

12   outright or held by a trust.              So if an individual would

13   incur certain costs if he held the property outright,

14   those costs shouldn't be able to escape the 2 percent

15   floor simply because the property is placed into a

16   trust.   But if the trust -- the existence of the trust

17   relationship creates some new or additional costs that

18   would not have existed otherwise, then those are not

19   subjected to the 2 percent clause.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, you know a trust is

21   sort of like a business.           And deductions that an

22   individual could not take if he were not in a business

23   are perfectly okay for a business.                   And I don't know why

24   trusts wouldn't be treated the same way.                   A trust has to

25   get investment advice.         True?        When it's -- when it's an

 1   individual getting it, you wouldn't allow a deduction,

 2   but a trust is different.

 3              And unless Congress is clearer than this

 4   statute, I -- it seems to me that no individual would

 5   get trust investment advice.              Only a trust can get trust

 6   investment advice.

 7              MR. MILLER:           Well, individuals could get --

 8   could and do get investment advice that is no different

 9   in substance from the advice the trust might get.                      And a

10   trustee might decide that he didn't need investment

11   advice if the trustee is financially sophisticated and

12   doesn't need an advisor.           To go --

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    What if you get a

14   bill from the investor advisor, and it's $50,000 and

15   it's broken up, 30,000 is general stock picking advice,

16   and 20 percent is specialized fiduciary advice?                   In

17   other words, they figure out what good stocks are they

18   pushing these days and they go down and say, well,

19   you're a trustee, you can't buy this you can't buy that.

20   You would -- would you agree that the $20,000 is not

21   subject to the 2 percent floor but the 30,000 is?

22              MR. MILLER:           Yes.       As we acknowledged in our

23   brief, if the advisor -- or another example would be if

24   the advisor imposed some extra charge on the fiduciary

25   accounts for whatever reason, that would be an expense

 1   that an individual going to that same advisor could not

 2   incur or ordinarily would not incur.

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But the individual who

 4   wanted to maximize income, for example, if the trustee

 5   has to maximize income for some of the life

 6   beneficiaries or something, an individual could seek

 7   that same advice if he wanted that particular result

 8   from the investment, couldn't he?

 9                 MR. MILLER:        That's right.            I understood the

10   question to refer to the case where the advisor charges

11   some extra fee because the client is a trust.

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Oh, I didn't understand it

13   to be that.     I thought it was going to be, you know, the

14   advisor had to figure out we need so much for the, for

15   the remainder man and so much for the life beneficiaries

16   and so forth.     You don't think that would be enough?

17                 MR. MILLER:        No.      No.      It wouldn't be.

18                 Thank you.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

22             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER J. RUBIN

23                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

24                 MR. RUBIN:       Trust investment advice is

25   always distinct from the investment advice that's given


                                         51

 1   to individuals, both because of the demanding legal

 2   obligations specifying certain factors that have to be

 3   taken into account by the trustee in investing and

 4   because of the risk of personal liability.

 5              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             What do you have to

 6   support that?   I resist accepting that broad

 7   proposition, and I don't know where to look or who to

 8   ask in order to determine its -- its truth or falsity.

 9              MR. RUBIN:        Well, I think, Your Honor, if

10   you look at, at our brief, at pages 7 through 10, there

11   is a discussion of the specific legal factors that are

12   codified in Connecticut law in the Uniform Prudent

13   Investor Act, which does not, as the Commissioner

14   suggested, require people to invest as a prudent

15   individual, but it's a different standard.

16              So, for example, safe investments,

17   conservative investments are not permitted any more in

18   many circumstances to trustees when an individual could

19   well engage in that kind of investment.                 Investment in

20   areas that the trustee is familiar with is not adequate

21   to meet this obligation.         So the advice really is

22   tailored as a matter of state law in the trust

23   instrument in every case to the trust.

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But it could also be

25   tailored to an individual with particular circumstances


                                       52

 1   that are similar to that of the trust.                    So an individual

 2   could incur it.     An individual with the same amount of

 3   money involved probably would incur it.

 4                 MR. RUBIN:       No trust, Your Honor, has

 5   exactly the same circumstances as a trust, because

 6   trusts always have, by definition, more than one

 7   beneficiary.    There is always a remainder beneficiary,

 8   at least.     Ordinarily there will be --

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So an individual

10   might have more than one child he wants to provide for

11   and as far as a remainder, there may be more than one

12   grandchild.    It could be exactly the same -- an

13   individual could have exactly the same objectives as a

14   trustee.

15                 MR. RUBIN:       The decision process for the

16   investments will be different in the case of a trustee,

17   though, than for an individual.                And a trust, of course,

18   could be multigenerational.              This trust will probably

19   last for about a hundred years from the time that it was

20   initially adopted.

21                 I should also say --

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Rubin, is it the advice

23   that's different or is it -- is it the inquiry that's

24   different.

25                 MR. RUBIN:       Both.        The decision -- the


                                         53

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   decision to hire the investment advisor is an exercise

 2   of fiduciary judgment taking into account these -- these

 3   factors; and the advice that you're paying for is a

 4   different service that's tailored to the trust.                This,

 5   therefore -- the Commissioner acknowledges that -- that

 6   the -- that trusts are distinct.                But -- but resists

 7   the -- the analogy between, for example, fiduciary

 8   income tax returns or judicial accountings and other tax

 9   returns.

10                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Rubin, is there a

11   subcategory of investment advisors who hold themselves

12   out to be fiduciary investment advisors?

13                MR. RUBIN:       I believe, Your Honor, there may

14   be specific fees for trust investments that are offered

15   by firms that -- that provide investment advice.

16   Whether there are specific advisors who will take only

17   fiduciary clients, I don't --

18                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Or even those who

19   advertise themselves as specialists in fiduciary advice?

20   I never heard of them.        Maybe there are.

21                MR. RUBIN:       Well, I think that this actually

22   points out, Justice Stevens, part of the problem with

23   the Commissioner's position, which is it relies on

24   labels.    The Commissioner has said it's a common --

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             As far as a tax return,

 1   are there accountants this specialize in trust tax

 2   returns as opposed to individual or corporate returns?

 3                 MR. RUBIN:      Not that I know of, Your Honor.

 4   My sense is that an income tax preparer will be willing

 5   to prepare an income tax return for a fiduciary or an

 6   individual.    I see that my time has expired.

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

 8   Mr. Rubin.    The case is submitted.
