 7                ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                 MR. DREEBEN:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                 Convicted sex offenders pose a serious

12   threat to public safety.            When those convictions are

13   entered under Federal law, Congress has the authority to

14   impose both a criminal and a civil sanction for that

15   conduct in order to protect the public.

16                 The Fifth Circuit in this case applied a per

17   se rule that once Respondent had completed his military

18   sentence, Congress lost authority to apply a civil

19   sanction for that violation of Federal law.

20                 That per se rule is wrong.

21                 Nothing in Article I prevents Congress from

22   legislating retroactively with respect to civil remedies

23   for past violations of Federal law.                       The Ex Post Facto

24   Clause, the Due Process Clause, and Article I analysis

25   under the Necessary and Proper Clause all provide some

                                         3

 1   degree of protection against retroactive provisions, but

 2   no per se rule bars Congress from applying sex offender

 3   registration requirements, which this Court has held to

 4   be civil remedies not barred by the Ex Post Facto Clause

 5   to past Federal criminal convictions.

 6                 Now -

 7                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 What's the limit of that

 8   power?    How -- for any Federal conviction, whether it's

 9   related to sex offense or anything else, Congress could

10   impose any kind of registration requirement?

11                 MR. DREEBEN:           Well, certainly, Justice

12   Sotomayor -

13                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 Could it ask every

14   convicted Federal felon to come in for a DNA test,

15   because we know that people who have been convicted of a

16   crime are more likely to be recidivists?

17                 MR. DREEBEN:           Well, Justice Sotomayor, there

18   are independent constitutional limits both outside of

19   Article I and within Article I that mean that I will

20   answer your question no, it's not the case that my

21   position today means there are no limits.                   There are

22   limits.    If we -

23                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 So what -- what is the

24   limit?    Is it just safety?              It can't be just safety of

25   the public, because you just said that it doesn't apply

                                          4

 1   to recidivist Federal offenders, generally.

 2                  MR. DREEBEN:         The -- the principal

 3   limitation on retroactive legislation is the Ex Post

 4   Facto Clause.     Indeed, there would have been no need for

 5   an Ex Post Facto Clause if the Fifth Circuit were

 6   correct.

 7                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I don't understand.    I

 8   just posited a civil registration for Federal offenders

 9   of any kind.     That's not ex post facto under your

10   theory, so -

11                  MR. DREEBEN:         So if -- if the Court agrees

12   that it's not a punitive measure and it is a remedial

13   measure -

14                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, I don't know if I

15   agree with that, but accept -- accepting that

16   hypothetical.

17                  MR. DREEBEN:         Well, if you don't agree with

18   it, then you'll be going on the Ex Post Facto Clause,

19   and you won't be getting to Article I.

20                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               No, you know, that's

21   settled law.     Whether it's right or wrong is a different

22   issue.

23                  MR. DREEBEN:         It is settled law, and that

24   means that sex offender registration provisions aren't

25   punitive.   The question here is, are they within

                                         5

 1   Article I.     And the Court in United States v. Comstock

 2   went through an elaborate Necessary and Proper Clause

 3   analysis -

 4                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, in Comstock,

 5   it was very different than the situation here, because

 6   the analysis was that the Federal Government basically

 7   was the source of the problem in incarcerating sex

 8   offenders away from the State so that no State felt an

 9   obligation to do something with the problem of their

10   release.

11                  You don't have anything of that sort here.

12                  MR. DREEBEN:         No.       This provision, Mr. Chief

13   Justice, rests on a different analysis than Comstock.

14   In Comstock, the problem was caused by Federal custody

15   that, as Your Honor has said, broke the relationship

16   between the individual and some State that might take

17   cognizance of him for purposes of sex offender civil

18   commitment.

19                  The basis for the statute in Comstock was

20   that people in Federal custody, regardless of the nature

21   of their prior convictions, might pose threats if

22   released.     The basis for the statute in this case is not

23   that the individual was in Federal custody.                       Federal

24   custody is irrelevant to it.                The basis for the statute

25   in this case is that this is a sex offender in violation

                                         6

 1   of Federal law, and Congress has the authority to

 2   impose, as was done in this case, criminal punishment,

 3   but it also has the authority to impose civil regulatory

 4   sanctions.

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:            So I assume that applies to

 6   all Federal crimes, right?             Anyone convicted of any

 7   Federal crime can thereafter be subjected to whatever

 8   civil restraints Congress later decides are -- are a

 9   good idea in order to prevent that crime, that type of

10   crime from reoccurring, right?                I mean, nothing peculiar

11   here about sex crimes.        Any -- any crime Congress can

12   later decide, you know, it would be a good idea if

13   when -- when a person has committed, I don't know, crime

14   with the use of a gun, we -- we impose retroactively all

15   sorts of different civil limitations.

16                MR. DREEBEN:         Well, Justice Scalia, there is

17   no per se rule in Article I that forbids retroactive

18   civil regulations imposed on a Federal offender.                So the

19   question -

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:            No, no, that's not the

21   point, that it's -- that it's retroactive.                The point is

22   that it is not in execution of a Federal power.

23                MR. DREEBEN:         Well, I think the whole point

24   in this case is that it's retroactive, because there

25   isn't any serious dispute that if somebody commits a

                                       7

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Federal sex offense they can be placed on supervised

 2   release for life so -

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:              That would be an execution

 4   of a Federal power -

 5               MR. DREEBEN:           Well, so is this.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:              -- the power -- the power

 7   to prevent that crime and to punish it.

 8               MR. DREEBEN:           Well, but Congress's power is

 9   not limited to preventing and punishing crimes through

10   criminal law.   Except for a brief interlude under United

11   States v. Halper where this Court viewed double jeopardy

12   as precluding multiple criminal and civil sanctions, the

13   Court has recognized that when someone violates Federal

14   law they're exposed both to criminal punishment and to

15   civil sanctions.   The criminal punishment has to comply

16   with the Ex Post Facto Clause; the civil sanctions do

17   not.   So what the -

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:              But they have to be imposed

19   simultaneously as -- as the punishment for the crime of

20   which the individual has been convicted.                Here, the

21   trial is over, the conviction is over, and then some

22   years later the Federal Government decides, oh, it would

23   be a good idea if people who have committed sex crimes

24   are -- are subjected to these limitations.                That's quite

25   different from imposing that simultaneously as -- as a

                                        8

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   punishment for the crime.             This is not a punishment for

 2   the crime, right?

 3                MR. DREEBEN:           That's precisely -

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:              Yes.

 5                MR. DREEBEN:           -- what makes it a civil

 6   sanction.   But, Justice Scalia, Your Honor is

 7   presupposing that Congress can only react to a sex crime

 8   through the criminal law and that it must have those

 9   laws in place at the time of the punishment, and there

10   is no such Article I precept.

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      So your argument

12   depends in no way on the fact that he was convicted of a

13   Federal offense or -- or incarcerated for that offense,

14   nothing at all?     We're just here arguing about the

15   retroactivity under -- whether they have the authority

16   under Article I to impose punishment for not registering

17   under State law?

18                MR. DREEBEN:           This case turns entirely on

19   the fact that the defendant is a Federal offender.                          The

20   source of power in question was the power to regulate

21   the armed forces.     This is an individual who committed a

22   sex crime while in the armed forces.                       And Congress's

23   power to address that and to prescribe remedies for it

24   both civil and criminal is entirely tied to the Federal

25   nature of the offense.

 1               JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, we start out with the

 2   power under the Constitution to make rules to regulate

 3   the military and we end up with a registration

 4   requirement that applies to someone who's not in the

 5   military and perhaps is not even living anywhere near

 6   any military installation.            So what would be helpful for

 7   me is to start out with the constitutional provision,

 8   identify a purpose of that that is served by this civil

 9   registration that is imposed later, and trace this whole

10   progress through the Necessary and Proper Clause.

11               MR. DREEBEN:         Justice Alito, I think the

12   most helpful way to do that would be for me to progress

13   through a series of examples that illustrate how

14   protecting the public against a Federal sex offender is

15   a legitimate aim under the Necessary and Proper Clause

16   to implement the underlying constitutional authority.

17               JUSTICE ALITO:            Yes.

18               MR. DREEBEN:         So start with a sex offender

19   who commits a sex offense in the military, is tried,

20   court-martialed and sentenced.               Subject to cruel and

21   unusual punishment limitations, due process limitations,

22   et cetera, that individual can be incarcerated, placed

23   on supervised release potentially up to life.               A

24   condition of supervised release, well-recognized and now

25   mandated by Federal law, is that that individual

                                     10

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   register as a sex offender.               And the reason that that is

 2   tied to Federal law is that when an individual violates

 3   Federal law it is a legitimate purpose of Congress to

 4   protect the public against recidivism by that

 5   individual.     So that's the criminal example that I

 6   believe is undisputed.

 7                  Now, suppose that the Federal Government

 8   didn't actually get the sex offender while he was in the

 9   military.     It missed the crime, but later information

10   comes to light still within the statute of limitations

11   that shows that while this person was in the military

12   they committed a sex offense.                 This court in United

13   States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles made clear that that

14   individual can be tried in an Article III court for his

15   criminal violation even though he's out of the military.

16   It's enforcing the rules that were impressed upon him at

17   the time while he was in the military.

18                  Now let me give a civil example and then I

19   will bring it right back to this case.                       Suppose that

20   Congress concludes that sex offenses in the military are

21   a very serious problem and that there are a lot of

22   people who have escaped prosecution because of lax

23   interest in pursuing those crimes.                       And after a period

24   of years, it sets up a board of inquiry and it says this

25   board of inquiry is going to look into sex offenses that

                                        11

 1   were committed at the time that people were in the

 2   military, even if they're out of the military, and we're

 3   going to subpoena people to testify, and if individuals

 4   are determined in a civil proceeding to have committed

 5   sex offenses they may have their military records

 6   revised, they may lose military benefits, and they may

 7   have other civil sanctions imposed upon them.

 8                  JUSTICE ALITO:            When you say in a civil

 9   proceeding, you mean?

10                  MR. DREEBEN:         Yes, noncriminal.

11   Noncriminal.

12                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            So it's just by a

13   preponderance of the evidence we think this guy

14   probably, you know, 51/49, committed a sex crime.

15                  MR. DREEBEN:         Not going to be a criminal

16   punishment that's imposed at the end of the day.

17                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            So just -- just more -

18   more likely than not is the test.

19                  MR. DREEBEN:         That's an acceptable level of

20   proof for the civil law.

21                  And if Congress can do that in order to

22   protect the integrity of the military and to promote

23   confidence in the military, then it's a very small step,

24   if any step at all, to SORNA.

25                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Yes, but if they can

 1   do that.   But that's not what they've done here.                    Your

 2   argument, as you told me a while ago, is linked to the

 3   Federal offense and the incarceration.

 4                MR. DREEBEN:         Yes, absolute -- well,

 5   Mr. Chief Justice, it's not linked to the incarceration.

 6   This is the difference between this case and Comstock,

 7   and this is why the Solicitor General's concession in

 8   Comstock on which the Fifth Circuit heavily relied has

 9   no applicability here.

10                In Comstock, it was irrelevant what offense

11   the individual had been committed.                     The problem was he

12   was in Federal custody, he was sexually dangerous at the

13   time he would be released.             Ties had been broken between

14   him and the community, and if he were released it would

15   pose a threat to public safety that the Federal

16   Government had power to protect against.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Because the States

18   were not doing anything about it.

19                MR. DREEBEN:         Right.

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Here you have a

21   situation where I think at the time every State dealt

22   with the issue of whether the sex offenders should have

23   to register or not.

24                MR. DREEBEN:         That's correct.             But Federal

25   law did as well and Federal law provided encouragement.

 1   This is actually a primary example of partnership

 2   between State governments and the Federal Government.

 3   The Federal Government offers financial support, it

 4   offers logistical assistance, it offers tremendous

 5   resources of the U.S. marshals to track down sex

 6   offenders.

 7                And as this Court said in Carr v. United

 8   States, it was entirely reasonable for Congress to have

 9   assigned a special responsibility for prosecuting

10   Federal sex offenders who failed to register.              This was

11   integral to this Court's reasoning in Carr, where the

12   Court was confronted with two provisions of 2250, the

13   criminal sex offense provision under SORNA.              For State

14   offenders, there had to be travel in interstate

15   commerce; for Federal offenders there didn't.

16                The Government argued that the provisions

17   ought to be given as co-extensive a reach as possible so

18   that the coverage of the statute would be equally

19   comprehensive for both State and Federal.              And this

20   Court -

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             The discussion so far has

22   assumed, your discussion primarily, that there's this

23   line between civil and criminal, we don't need to worry

24   about ex post facto.      Is that line made clear in our

25   precedents or is there some room to argue that if the

                                      14

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   line is somewhat blurred that there may be ex post facto

 2   concerns here and that that in turn is a reason for

 3   constitutional avoidance when we evaluate your argument?

 4                Is that -- is the civil -- a criminal

 5   distinction with reference to ex post facto clause

 6   absolutely foreclosed and clear in the facts of this

 7   case?

 8                MR. DREEBEN:         Yes, it is, I believe, Justice

 9   Kennedy.   In an opinion that you wrote for the Court,

10   Smith v. Doe, which considered the retroactivity of

11   Alaska's sex offender registration and notification

12   provisions, which are similar but not identical, to the

13   Federal provisions, the Court went through the

14   established analysis to determine whether the

15   legislature had intended a punitive effect and if it

16   didn't, whether there was the clearest proof that it was

17   punishment in purpose and effect.

18                Notwithstanding the legislature's intent,

19   the Court upheld the retroactive applicability of sex

20   offender registration and notification, making clear

21   that it is not governed by the Ex Post Facto Clause.

22                Now, that's not to say that an individual

23   couldn't argue that SORNA is different or an individual

24   couldn't argue that the Due Process Clause makes it

25   either irrational or substantively off limits to impose

                                      15

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   this kind of civil remedy.             The individual can also

 2   argue that running this through the Comstock factors,

 3   it's not reasonably adapted to fulfilling Congress's

 4   aim.   But what the Fifth Circuit did is apply a per se

 5   rule that it drew, I think, from the Solicitor General's

 6   statement in Comstock that once an individual got out of

 7   custody and was back in the control of the State and

 8   within its jurisdiction and population, then the Federal

 9   Government couldn't reach out and commit him as a sex

10   offender.

11                And there are two main distinctions between

12   that concession and this case.                The first is, as I've

13   already alluded to, the Government's argument in

14   Comstock was based on custody.                This case is based on

15   the consequences of the conviction itself.                    The second

16   distinction is that committing somebody civilly is a

17   massive intrusion on that individual's relationship with

18   the State.

19                The individual has been brought within

20   Federal custody; they have no relationship with the

21   State anymore.   Whereas sex offender notification is far

22   more accommodating of State interests.

23                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Mr. Dreeben -

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:            To -- to what does this

25   civil -- civil-criminal line apply?                    Suppose instead of

                                      16

 1   a registration requirement, Congress just decided, you

 2   know, our past punishments for sex offenses have not

 3   been -- have not been severe enough, and so we are now

 4   going to impose a civil fine on all -- all persons who

 5   have been convicted in Federal court of sex crimes.

 6   It's a civil -- it's a civil penalty, not a criminal

 7   penalty.    That's okay?

 8                 MR. DREEBEN:         It's not per se barred by

 9   Article I, Justice Scalia.              The question of whether it's

10   constitutional is really a question of individual rights

11   analysis and whether it passes through the necessary and

12   proper gate under the considerations similar to what the

13   Court looked at in Comstock.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I find that difficult to

15   believe that -

16                 MR. DREEBEN:         Well, there's no -

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- that whether it's ex

18   post facto and impermissible or not is simply

19   eliminated, that issue was eliminated by simply calling

20   it civil.

21                 MR. DREEBEN:         Well, it's not eliminated.       It

22   still is available for an individual to argue, as

23   Respondent did in this case in the district court but

24   abandoned long before he got to the court of appeals,

25   that it violates due process, that it violates ex post

 2                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            I'm talking about the -- ex

 3   post facto.

 4                  MR. DREEBEN:         He can argue that.             I submit

 5   that he will lose.

 6                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Because it's civil.

 7                  MR. DREEBEN:         If it in fact is civil and

 8   passes through this Court's analysis, then yes.

 9                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            I -- I find that difficult

10   to grasp.

11                  MR. DREEBEN:         Well, it's actually quite well

12   established as a principle of double jeopardy law in

13   cases like Hudson v. United States and United States v.

14   Ursery.     It's established in ex post facto law as a

15   consequence of Smith v. Doe.                It's the foundation for

16   deciding whether a proceeding requires preponderance of

17   the evidence versus proof beyond a reasonable of doubt.

18   The Court has articulated this line in a variety of

19   contexts.

20                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Your argument

21   based -- your argument based on Congress's authority

22   with respect to the military, your Article I argument,

23   and you say it doesn't make a difference that he's no

24   longer in the military, does that -- do you come out

25   differently if the basis for jurisdiction is asserted to

 1   be inter -- interstate commerce?

 2                MR. DREEBEN:         No.       As long -

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    The fact that

 4   somebody at some time in their life traveled across

 5   State lines means that the Federal Government can go

 6   back, even though their activity that's challenged in

 7   the particular instance is only intrastate, and still

 8   assert jurisdiction over them?

 9                MR. DREEBEN:         Well, that would probably fail

10   a Necessary and Proper Clause analysis, in which there

11   has to be a showing that the measure is plainly adapted

12   to furthering the underlying power.                     This is not a

13   difficult problem that the Court has never confronted

14   before.   It has resulted in difficult permutations on

15   particular facts, but the Court has always recognized

16   that there is broad Necessary and Proper Clause

17   authority subject to limits.              Those limits -

18                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               As broad as that

19   authority is, perhaps I'm going back to Justice Alito's

20   question, which is if you put aside that it's part of

21   the punishment because you say it's not part of the

22   punishment, you want us not to look at it as punishment

23   because otherwise you'd run into the ex post facto

24   problem, you're saying we have a need today.                     Outside of

25   protecting the public from a recidivist, what's the

 1   interest?   Because that wasn't enough in Comstock.                  We

 2   made it very clear that wasn't enough.

 3                So if you take out all of the punishment

 4   aspects of this, which you should have done at the time

 5   he was sentenced and not now, what remains in terms of

 6   the Federal interest?

 7                MR. DREEBEN:         Justice Sotomayor -

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               What's promoted?

 9                MR. DREEBEN:         There is a sufficient Federal

10   interest in protecting the public from someone who

11   committed a Federal crime.             Supervised release

12   essentially performs that function.

13                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               But that was -- why did

14   we even bother going through anything in Comstock?                   If

15   that stands alone as a Federal interest, then anything

16   we do at any point with respect to any person who's

17   violated a Federal law would stand in the same shoes.

18                MR. DREEBEN:         It's a valid -

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               You could do whatever

20   civil penalties you want for as long as you want.                   We go

21   back to my initial question and Justice -

22                MR. DREEBEN:         Justice Sotomayor, really, the

23   answer to your question is the same.                   The answer to all

24   of your questions is the same, which is that there is an

25   analysis that the Court went through in Comstock where

                                      20

 1   it took into consideration history, it took into

 2   consideration the nature of the fit between the purpose

 3   of Congress and the activity that it was regulated.                          It

 4   took into account the degree to which the State

 5   interests were accommodated, and it took into account

 6   the degree of attenuation between the regulation and the

 7   underlying offense.       And it -- it didn't open up

 8   Congress to say any offense you've ever committed means

 9   Congress owns you for life, it can do whatever you want.

10   It has to pass through an analysis.

11                But the Fifth Circuit never conducted that

12   analysis except for believing that once the individual

13   had completed military service, once the individual had

14   completed his criminal sentence, Congress lost all

15   authority.

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      I'm getting confused

17   between two different assertions of a Federal interest.

18   Earlier you talked about the integrity of the military

19   forces.   They go back later, they think they should

20   address the fact that people were engaging in criminal

21   activities when in the military, they weren't -- they

22   weren't found out, they weren't prosecuted.                       Later on

23   they can go back.

24                But then you say that the interest that's at

25   issue here is preventing recidivism, and that doesn't

                                        21

 1   seem to have anything to do with the integrity of the

 2   military force.

 3                MR. DREEBEN:         Well, it does because when the

 4   criminal law finds someone who has violated Federal law,

 5   many of the purposes of the sanctions that are imposed

 6   on that individual are public protection purposes and

 7   anti-recidivism purposes.           Most of the things that are

 8   done on supervised release fulfill those purposes.                 If

 9   those purposes were not validly connected to taking

10   someone who's violated criminal law and imposing a suite

11   of sanctions on them, then supervised release would

12   apparently be beyond Congress's authority.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:            It -- it seems to me that

14   when -- when you say that as your answer to the Chief

15   Justice, you're -- you're no longer relying on -- on the

16   power to regulate the military.                 You're relying on -- on

17   some general Federal power to protect citizens against

18   people who have committed any Federal crimes.                 And I --

19   I don't see that enumerated power in the Constitution.

20   Yes, I see a power to regulate the military, but your

21   description, it has nothing to do with regulating the

22   military.   It has to do with protecting the -- the

23   public at large from people who have committed Federal

24   crimes, military or not.

25                MR. DREEBEN:         As the Court has pointed out

                                      22

 1   numerous times, including in Comstock, there is very

 2   little authority in the Constitution in an enumerated

 3   way for criminal law at all.              All of criminal law, with

 4   the exception of a handful of instances that are

 5   specified in the Constitution, comes in by virtue of the

 6   Necessary and Proper Clause.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's right, because it

 8   protects Federal functions.             The Federal -- the criminal

 9   applicability to the armed forces protects the function

10   of regulating the armed forces.                 But how does protecting

11   the public at large from people who have committed a

12   crime in the armed forces, how does that have anything

13   to do with regulating the armed forces.

14                MR. DREEBEN:         That is inherent in taking

15   somebody who violated Federal law and imposing

16   appropriate sanctions on them for that violation.

17                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Dreeben, it would help

18   me in answering some of these questions if you went

19   through the analysis on the assumption that this was

20   instead a Commerce Clause case.                 So take the military

21   out of it; what would the necessary and proper analysis

22   look like?

23                MR. DREEBEN:         It would look essentially the

24   same, Justice Kagan.      Somebody who violates a Federal

25   law that's premised on the Commerce Clause, say a sex

                                      23

 1   offender who travels in interstate commerce with the

 2   intent to commit a sex offense, has placed himself

 3   within the regulatory authority of the Federal

 4   Government.    Now, that individual can be criminally

 5   prosecuted for that violation, and that violation

 6   furthers Congress's interests in regulating interstate

 7   commerce.

 8                 Congress could also decide, you know, for

 9   some of these sex offenders, criminal punishment is not

10   the right approach.      The right approach is mandate sex

11   offender rehabilitative counseling.                     And it might

12   discover that that's so effective for a class of

13   offenders that it's going to apply that even to people

14   whose offenses were committed before the law in question

15   is passed.    It can't punish those people based on

16   retroactive legislation, but it can reach them with a

17   civil remedial measure so long as it passes through the

18   Comstock-type analysis of the Necessary and Proper

19   Clause.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Dreeben, you say

21   nothing about the -- what was the opening argument in -

22   in your brief, that the assumption that SORNA is

23   something new added after is wrong because there were

24   these predecessor laws that established a Federal

25   requirement to register.

 1                  MR. DREEBEN:         Justice Ginsburg, I believe

 2   that the Fifth Circuit was wrong on that too.                         As we

 3   describe in our brief, Title 42 Section 14072(i)(3) and

 4   (4) did, in our view, impose criminal punishment on

 5   Respondent for failing to register as a sex offender at

 6   the time he was in the military.

 7                  We think the Fifth Circuit was wrong on that

 8   statutory analysis, but, more fundamentally, the Fifth

 9   Circuit was wrong in thinking that it mattered whether

10   he was under some sort of Federal criminal jurisdiction

16              ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. CAROLYN FUENTES

17                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18                  MS. FUENTES:         Yes.        Mr. Chief Justice, and

19   may it please the Court:

20                  The Government asks this Court to go beyond

21   its holding in United States v. Comstock to allow the

22   Federal Government to reach back, after a Federal

23   sentence has expired, to bring back into Federal control

24   a person who has returned to the authority of the State.

25                  And I'm quite surprised to hear the

                                        25

 1   Government say that this is not a Comstock analysis.

 2   I'm not sure they stuck with that throughout the

 3   argument, but I think the Comstock factors are factors

 4   that this Court looks at quite frequently in doing any

 5   kind of a necessary and proper analysis.

 6                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Going back to -- to a

 7   prior question, are you challenging -- you didn't on

 8   appeal, but it seems as if you're accepting that the

 9   Federal Government has the power to impose this

10   requirement as part of a Federal sentence.

11                 MS. FUENTES:         I think that's correct.

12                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               All right.   Are you -

13   if it's not part of a Federal sentence but part of

14   release, it's not announced at the sentence but it's

15   announced at the time the prisoner is put into

16   supervised release or release from jail, do you think

17   the Government has the power to impose it then?

18                 MS. FUENTES:         In this case, on these facts

19   and based on the Federal statutes that exist today, the

20   answer is yes.    And the illustration, I think, is the

21   way that SORNA works today.              As the Government

22   mentioned -

23                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, SORNA today

24   becomes part of the supervised relief terms.

25                 MS. FUENTES:         Correct.

 1                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I'm not talking about

 2   SORNA today.

 3                  MS. FUENTES:         Okay.

 4                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I'm talking about just

 5   any prisoner who has been in jail but it's not made, has

 6   not been paid, part of the punishment.

 7                  MS. FUENTES:         I think the law permits a

 8   sentencing judge -- I'm not talking about Congress, but

 9   a sentencing judge -- to go back and impose additional

10   conditions of supervised release.

11                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I -- I don't know of

12   that power, but do you have a statutory -

13                  MS. FUENTES:         It's 18 -- 18 United States

14   Code Section 3583.      And 3583 permits the sentencing

15   judge to change conditions of supervised release based

16   on the factors that are considered important in

17   sentencing in 18 United States Code Section 3583.

18                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               All right.   So that

19   power -- I guess then what the Government is saying, as

20   I understand their argument, if you have the power to do

21   it at that point, why can't you have the power to do it

22   later?

23                  MS. FUENTES:         Well -

24                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Are the same factors

25   that compel permission for the Government to do it then?

                                        27

 1                  MS. FUENTES:         It's because the way the

 2   statute works, even though it wasn't announced at

 3   sentence, supervised release is considered to be part of

 4   the sentence.     So if I understand the question

 5   correctly, the reason the court can go back and impose

 6   those conditions and possibly the reason that Congress

 7   can go back and do it is because those statutes that

 8   I've mentioned, 3583 and 3553, have given notice to the

 9   individual.

10                  JUSTICE ALITO:            We are not talking -- I'm

11   sorry.

12                  MS. FUENTES:         That's all right.

13                  JUSTICE ALITO:            I didn't mean to interrupt

14   your question.

15                  MS. FUENTES:         It's all right.

16                  JUSTICE ALITO:            We're not talking about

17   statutory authorization.            We are talking about

18   constitutional power.         So if we start out with the

19   example of registration for life being imposed as part

20   of supervised release, part of the criminal sentence,

21   then we go to an example where it is not part of the

22   criminal sentence but it is a civil requirement

23   triggered by a separate civil proceeding for every

24   Federal -- every person convicted of a sex offense under

25   Federal law.

 1               Now, if that were the setup statutorily,

 2   would that fall within Congress's power under Article 1?

 3               MS. FUENTES:            I think not, but I want to

 4   qualify that because it depends on what powers Congress

 5   is relying on.

 6               And let me give an example.                     I know the

 7   Government was -- a lot of the Government's argument

 8   relies on this difference between criminal and civil

 9   consequences.

10               JUSTICE ALITO:               Well, we know what -- and we

11   know what power they are relying on.                     Let's just look at

12   the power that they're relying on here:                     It's the power

13   to make rules for the regulation of the military.                        So

14   part of their -- in the exercise of their power to make

15   rules for the regulation of the military, they impose a

16   civil sex offender registration requirement for someone

17   convicted of a sex offense under the Uniform Code of

18   Military Justice.     That does not, in your judgment, fall

19   within Article I?

20               MS. FUENTES:            It does if the person is still

21   in the military or if he has been -- or if he has

22   committed a criminal offense and the prosecutorial

23   power, the Federal power to prosecute him for that

24   offense, has not been exhausted, yes, that can be done.

25               JUSTICE KAGAN:               How about if he is on

                                        29

 1   supervised release?        He is not in the military, but his

 2   entire sentence has not been completed.

 3                MS. FUENTES:            I think if he is still being

 4   supervised by the military, then I think it's likely

 5   that power exists.

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:               Okay.          Then why not this?

 7                MS. FUENTES:            Because Mr. Kebodeaux was not

 8   on supervised release.

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:               Well -- why not?          I mean,

10   look, this is -- Thomas Reed Powell once said, "If you

11   can think of a thing that is inextricably related to

12   another thing without thinking of the other thing, then

13   you have the legal mind," and that seems to be this

14   case.   All right?

15                MS. FUENTES:            Yes, but -

16                JUSTICE BREYER:               So somehow I have to get

17   out of my mind the ex post facto part, the potential

18   violation of due process part, the equal protection

19   part, take that aside.           Now I've got to just think about

20   whether it has, the Congress has the power under the

21   provision that Justice Alito said.                        I'm trying to do

22   that, and I've dissented in other cases on other

23   grounds.

24                All right.          But in -- in just trying to do

25   that, I think, well, the military, suppose they found a

                                         30

 1   certain number of -- of individuals, men or women, have

 2   unfortunate problems in the military.                    They discover

 3   there is a mental illness problem; the person's out of

 4   the military.   But the law says you can go and tell the

 5   local mental health authorities about this person even

 6   though he's no longer there.

 7               And suppose the person had a criminal

 8   problem in the military and was in prison and suppose

 9   the law said, you know, you're the ones who got the

10   situation where he unfortunately got into that problem,

11   and you, later on, can -- can go and tell authorities

12   about his problems so they can take appropriate action.

13               Now, if they can do that, why can't they

14   have the power under Article I to say really, you all

15   have to register.     Now, maybe there are other things,

16   but you got this problem in the military.                    You were

17   convicted in the military.               You did it in the military.

18   We turned you loose and there you are, and we want, as

19   part of our military regulation, to be able to tell

20   authorities about you and to make you register according

21   to State law.

22               Now, no due process problem; I have to

23   assume that away.     No punishment, bad punishment

24   problem, none of those.           But it's a power, all right?

25               Why not?

 1               MS. FUENTES:            Well, the power can't go to

 2   both of the examples that you've given.                       I don't see any

 3   problem with them giving notice.                    That does not impose a

 4   Federal obligation on an individual.                       So there is no

 5   power being exerted on the individual.                       They can have a

 6   public -- a public protection purpose and they can

 7   tell -- tell authorities who need to deal with the

 8   individual, and those authorities may have the power

 9   through State power -

10               JUSTICE BREYER:               Where you're leading me,

11   because I'm not so worried about this case, but where

12   you're leading me is down in Commerce Clause cases and

13   all kinds of other cases, suddenly a distinction arises

14   that Congress can, in fact, do all kinds of things

15   having Federal authorities do this and that, but you

16   couldn't make someone in a State -- you know, you can

17   imagine a few that are coming into my mind -- and so

18   what I'm worried about is following this distinction

19   into other areas.

20               MS. FUENTES:            I don't think that is a

21   problem, and I think the reason is I disagree

22   fundamentally with the Government.                       I think necessary

23   and proper analysis is important in each case and it

24   does bear similarities in each case.                       But depending on

25   the power being relied upon, the analysis can be quite

                                        32

 1   different.    Commerce Clause is a very broad power.

 2                 I can't say whether this sort of thing,

 3   depending on the Commerce Clause, would be right or

 4   would be wrong.    Look at the power to make a uniform

 5   rule of naturalization.

 6                 JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, let me -- let me try

 7   this chain of reasoning out on you and -- and get your

 8   reaction.    We're starting out with the power of Congress

 9   to make rules for the regulation of the military.                 And

10   one of the things that they want to do in making those

11   rules is to make military installations acceptable to

12   the local communities where they are located.

13                 They know from experience, for example, it's

14   happened in Okinawa, that when have you military

15   personnel who go -- who commit sex offenses with people

16   off base, it can cause tremendous opposition.                 And this

17   is what happened here; not the opposition, but an

18   offense involving a 15-year-old girl who lived off the

19   base.

20                 So in order to ensure that there -- we don't

21   have excessive civilian opposition to the location of

22   military bases, we are going to do a number of things.

23   One thing is we're going to criminally prosecute members

24   of the military who commit these offenses.                 This will

25   deter; this will incapacitate.                 But also, to provide

                                       33

 1   further assurance to the community that these people are

 2   not going to be dangerous, we are going to require them

 3   to register.

 4                  Now, maybe that's too attenuated, but I'd

 5   like to get your reaction.               Why could Congress not do

 6   that under the Necessary and Proper Clause?

 7                  MS. FUENTES:         Well, I think while that

 8   person is still within the criminal jurisdiction, or any

 9   Federal jurisdiction, it could be done.                        I think that

10   once that jurisdiction has been exhausted, once the

11   criminal prosecution power has been exhausted, once the

12   person has returned to the authority of the State, and I

13   think that analysis is important always.

14                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            You don't have to go that

15   far though to -- to distinguish the example that Justice

16   Alito just gave.     This is not a statute which only

17   requires him to registrate -- to register if he hangs

18   around the military installation.                        This requires him to

19   registrate anywhere, you know, in the -- in the wilds of

20   Alaska where -- it's just not this case.

21                  And even -- even if you would allow that,

22   and say it is a reasonable -- it has a reasonable

23   connection to the power to regulate the military, to say

24   wherever he goes he has to register is -- is a different

25   question, isn't it?

 1               MS. FUENTES:           I think it may well be.

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:              But yet, now that's exactly

 3   the problem for me, because the -- the wilds of

 4   Alaska you think I think, and I think I think, that -

 5   that sure, if there's a post office there -- there's a

 6   post office there, then what -- the military is all

 7   right, they can mail a letter to the -- to be delivered

 8   to the local doctor to say, look, he has a problem.

 9   That seems to be okay.

10               But you say it's not going to be okay to

11   tell him he has to go and make that registration.              At

12   that point what you've done is like Madison.              I mean,

13   it's an interpretation of the Commerce Clause that I

14   think Madison might have wanted, which is you're reading

15   a lack of power because of a civil rights problem.

16               I mean, it's -- the difference between the

17   two cases is really not the need because we have to

18   assume the need.    The difference is the restriction on

19   the individual.    And it's that part that I'm suddenly

20   worried about the Commerce Clause and every power in

21   Article I being read with exceptions in the civil rights

22   area even though we have the amendments to protect the

23   civil rights problems.

24               MS. FUENTES:           I haven't thought of it that

25   way and that really isn't the argument that I'm making.

 1   I think that the military has jurisdiction.               It's gotten

 2   information about this individual when it had power over

 3   him and they can talk to whomever they care to about

 4   him, or whether -

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             We've never -- we've never

 6   held, have we, that what the Federal Government can

 7   itself do under the Necessary and Proper Clause it can

 8   impose upon individuals to do under the Necessary and

 9   Proper Clause?    Aren't there two different -- what is

10   necessary and proper for the Federal Government itself

11   to do is not necessarily necessary and proper for the

12   Federal Government to require private individuals to do.

13                 MS. FUENTES:          I absolutely agree with that.

14   And I think that this goes back to something that the

15   Government -- well, it gives me an opportunity to

16   address something the Government has said about the

17   Fifth Circuit's opinion.            That it is a per se rule, and

18   that is just incorrect.           I -- I have to disagree with

19   that.     And I have to disagree with it because the -

20   everything the Fifth Circuit said was limited by these

21   facts.

22                 These facts are what controls the case.             And

23   the Fifth Circuit took great care to make a very narrow

24   ruling.    And that ruling, the Fifth Circuit said, is

 1   applied to Mr. Kebodeaux and others like him.                  It has no

 2   effect on Congress's ability to impose conditions on a

 3   prisoner's release from custody or on Congress's ability

 4   to effect the registration requirements for anyone who

 5   has been convicted after SORNA's enactment.

 6               So really, it is not a per se rule.                  It is a

 7   rule, maybe you call it per se as it -- as it affects

 8   people in Mr. Kebodeaux's position, but I think that is

 9   very different from what the Government is arguing.

10               JUSTICE KAGAN:               I guess, Ms. Fuentes, what I

11   don't quite understand about the argument, this goes

12   back to Justice Alito's original question.               You seem to

13   say that if this -- if Congress passed a civil statute

14   like this one within the time that Mr. Kebodeaux was in

15   custody or within the time that he was under supervised

16   release, that that would be appropriate.

17               But I guess what I don't get is why the

18   Federal interests change, whether it's the day before he

19   gets out of supervised release or the day after he gets

20   out of supervised release.               What in the Federal

21   interests shift based on that?

22               MS. FUENTES:            I'll answer that question

23   first, then come back to another.

24               It's not a question, I don't think, of

25   Federal interest.     It's a question of Federal power.

                                        37

 1   And you have to look at the individual power being

 2   exercised.    And so the way I look at it is what's the

 3   difference if the Federal Government makes a rule for a

 4   person in the military before -- when he's in the

 5   military or after he gets out of the military?                    That's

 6   all the difference in the world.                   In -- in -- that's our

 7   argument.    That is all the difference in the world.

 8                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, I wasn't assuming that

 9   he was in the military while he was on supervised

10   release.

11                 MS. FUENTES:         I'm sorry.           I didn't hear.

12                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            I was assuming that he was

13   out of the military in both these cases, but that you

14   said while he was still serving his sentence, it would

15   be appropriate for Congress to add this additional

16   thing, but not after.

17                 MS. FUENTES:         I think -

18                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            In both cases, he's not in

19   the military anymore.

20                 MS. FUENTES:         Constitutionally, it -- it can

21   be all right constitutionally, depending on the

22   statutory procedures that govern it.                    And the way that

23   the Federal law operates now, the statutes that I

24   mentioned, 3583 and 3553, the way those statutes -

25   statutes operate is they -- they give someone notice

                                       38

 1   that their conditions of supervised release can be -

 2   can be changed.   And so there isn't an ex post facto

 3   problem with that.

 4               And there isn't a power problem with that,

 5   because the criminal -- the power to make the criminal

 6   offense and punish it still exists while that person is

 7   on supervised release.        It has expired with respect to

 8   Mr. Kebodeaux, and I think that is one of the most

 9   important points in this case, and it goes along with

10   the Comstock analysis.

11               JUSTICE ALITO:             Is it your argument that

12   Congress lacks the power to impose supervised release

13   after the date when the person leaves the military?

14               MS. FUENTES:          No.       After the criminal

15   sentence is served.

16               I'm sorry.        Maybe I didn't understand the

17   question.

18               JUSTICE ALITO:             Someone is sentenced to

19   prison -

20               MS. FUENTES:          Right.

21               JUSTICE ALITO:             -- under the UCMJ, released,

22   dishonorably discharged from the military.               Can Congress

23   say the person has to remain on supervised release for a

24   longer period of time after he is returned to civilian

25   status?

                                      39

 1               MS. FUENTES:          Not if -- not unless it was -

 2   that provision was imposed as part of the sentence or

 3   while he was still within the Federal power, before the

 4   Federal criminal jurisdiction expires.

 5               JUSTICE ALITO:             See, I understand -- I can

 6   understand why that might create -- that might raise all

 7   sorts of constitutional arguments about notice and so

 8   forth.

 9               But I don't see how that -- how that

10   connects with the question whether Congress has the

11   power to do it under -- under Article I -

12               MS. FUENTES:          Well, I'm not sure -

13               JUSTICE ALITO:             -- under the power to

14   regulate the military.

15               MS. FUENTES:          Yes.        I'm not sure I'm

16   answering the question correctly, but that power doesn't

17   last forever.   The powers -- there are some powers in

18   the Constitution which may last longer than others, and

19   the example I raised before was the rule of making

20   uniform naturalization.         That's a broader power, I

21   think, than the military power.

22               And we see that in the cases the

23   Government's mentioned and we've mentioned, the Toth

24   case and the Kinsella case.

25               JUSTICE ALITO:             Well, you could be making

                                      40

 1   the argument that the power to make rules for the

 2   military applies only to people who are in the military,

 3   and that once you're out of the military that power does

 4   not permit Congress to do anything special to you.

 5                  But you're not making that argument, I

 6   gather.

 7                  MS. FUENTES:         No.       No, I'm not making that

 8   argument.     And again, it goes to the individual facts

 9   and the power asserted and the way the power operates

10   always makes a difference.

11                  The example that the Government gave with

12   that board of inquiry and being able to bring people

13   back in, I find that whole scenario very questionable.

14   But there -- there were people who were -- were

15   receiving military benefits, if I understood it.

16                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               How would you write this

17   opinion if you wanted to protect against what Justice

18   Breyer was concerned about, constricting the Commerce

19   Clause, which has been since Madison more broadly

20   defined than he did, or Justice Alito's example of

21   ensuring that you're not closing off other things that

22   can be done after someone leaves, that might be related

23   to, like punishing a crime that you find out about

24   afterwards.     How would you write this opinion?

25                  MS. FUENTES:         Just the way the Fifth Circuit

                                        41

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   did in its en banc opinion.

 2               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Well, it wasn't really

 3   helpful, because it -- it doesn't give us a limiting

 4   principle like -- I don't know if it's possible -- that

 5   if you're relying on just recidivism, Congress has to

 6   have an independent basis, a power for the imposition

 7   of -- of criminal or civil sanctions on someone.

 8               MS. FUENTES:          I'm not certain an opinion

 9   like that could be written.             I think that the limits,

10   the limitations that exist, are on the narrowness of the

11   way the opinion is written.             But future cases I don't

12   think can be decided that way.

13               Certainly, principles can be articulated

14   which help to limit.      And I think the -- the best you

15   can say in terms of limiting principles is it's going to

16   depend on the enumerated power upon which the government

17   relies to impose this obligation.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Well, how -- I'm not

19   sure that makes much sense.             You're saying if they're

20   relying on the enumerated power with respect to the

21   military, they can do more than if they're relying on

22   the enumerated power over interstate commerce?

23               MS. FUENTES:          No.       And if that's your

24   understanding -

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     So in what sense -

                                      42

 1                  MS. FUENTES: -- I -- I apologize.                    I did not

 2   mean that.

 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, in what sense

 4   does it then depend on which enumerated power they're

 5   invoking?

 6                  MS. FUENTES:         Well, let -- let me give an

 7   example that goes to the collateral consequence cases

 8   that the Government raised.

 9                  The Government raises, for example, the

10   Hudson case, where a person who is convicted of bank

11   fraud both can be punished criminally and then can be

12   debarred civilly from participating any more with

13   Federal Government contracts.                 I think the words that

14   were used in the Hudson case were "no longer may have

15   business doings with an insured bank."

16                  Okay, that has to be, I think, the spending

17   power.   The Government can decide with whom it wants to

18   do business.     If it's dealing with an insured bank, then

19   it can impose that civil consequence.                       And it can do

20   it -- I don't want to use the word "independently" of.

21   They may do it by reason of the criminal conviction, but

22   there is an independent power to do it.

23                  That power doesn't exist here, and so it

24   would have to be -

25                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    They say -- they say

                                        43

 1   it exists by virtue of the enumerated power to regulate

 2   the military forces.

 3                MS. FUENTES:          Well, I don't think it does.

 4   Perhaps I don't understand the -

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Well, I'm trying to

 6   see why you're saying the enumerated power under the

 7   Spending Clause allows them to take this subsequent

 8   action, but the enumerated power under the Military

 9   Clause does not.

10                MS. FUENTES:          Well, because the -- I'm

11   sorry.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     I would have thought

13   that if you're arguing under the Necessary and Proper

14   Clause, that you need an enumerated power that the

15   Necessary and Proper Clause is going to serve.

16                But I don't see how it makes a difference

17   which enumerated power you're talking about.

18                MS. FUENTES:          I think it all -- I think it

19   does turn on the nature of the power.                      I mean, could you

20   use the military power to say you, Mr. Bank Fraud

21   Client, cannot contract with the Government any more?

22   No.

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     I get to ask the

24   questions.   You don't.

 1                MS. FUENTES:           Sorry.          You are so correct on

 2   that.   I apologize.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:              No, but it's the

 4   military -- look, it's the military that they are

 5   mostly -- that they're relying on.

 6                MS. FUENTES:           Yes.        And it -

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:              So they say -- I mean, the

 8   famous statement -- I looked it up -- "Let the end be

 9   legitimate, let it be within the scope of the

10   Constitution, and all means which are appropriate and

11   not forbidden are -- fall within the Necessary and

12   Proper Clause."

13                All right?         The end is to protect the

14   communities from those individuals in respect to those

15   matters that they became dangerous with when they were

16   in the military; okay?          That's the end.

17                And is the means appropriate?                   They say yes.

18   They say, after all, the means here is, notify them when

19   we're -- you're moving around.                  And therefore, is it

20   forbidden?

21                Well, we're not supposed to consider that

22   part, but -- so leave that out.                   But the -- the others,

23   they say is okay.      So that's the basic.

24                Do you think maybe we should send this back

25   to the -- to the Fifth Circuit?                   The Government suggests

                                        45

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that -

 2                 MS. FUENTES:         Well -

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER: -- because they didn't get

 4   it right in respect to what the previous statutes

 5   require.

 6                 What about all that?

 7                 MS. FUENTES:         Well, the Fifth Circuit did

 8   get it right with respect to the previous statute.                 And

 9   the reason that the Government wants to send it back is

10   because they say that the Fifth Circuit relied on the

11   fact that Mr. Kebodeaux was unconditionally released.

12   And as a matter of fact, he was unconditionally

13   released.    But they equate unconditional release with

14   release free from a registration requirement.

15                 We have gone over that in great length in

16   our brief.    The Government is simply wrong about that,

17   for the reasons that we state in our brief.                 And I can

18   go into those, if you want, if you'd like.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:            I just want to know what to

20   do if I end up thinking they are right.

21                 MS. FUENTES:         Yes.        They are -

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:            What's your recommendation

23   there on that assumption?            I'm not saying I would, but

24   I'm just saying on that assumption.

25                 MS. FUENTES:         I -- I guess it depends on

                                       46

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   which assumption.     The Fifth Circuit would not have

 2   changed its opinion in this case because Mr. Kebodeaux,

 3   as a matter of fact, whether the Government agrees or

 4   not, was not released on condition that he comply with

 5   sex offender registration requirements.

 6               You can see the difference between

 7   Mr. Kebodeaux's release and the release of a person who

 8   is released on conditions that he comply with

 9   requirements, and that is in 35 -

10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  Your argument is he was

11   released on condition of State registration.                  Isn't your

12   argument dependent only on that there was no Federal

13   registration requirement?

14               MS. FUENTES:            No.       It is dependent on

15   whether that release was conditioned on his

16   registration, and it wasn't.                Today, when a person is

17   released from custody on supervised release, it is a

18   condition of that release under 3583 that he comply with

19   sex offender registration requirements.                  What happens if

20   he doesn't comply?

21               He can go back to prison on the original

22   conviction, because he was released on condition that he

23   comply with Federal sex offender requirements.                  It just

24   goes to -- to the judge.            It's by preponderance of the

25   evidence.

 1                  That is not what happened here.

 2   Mr. Kebodeaux was released, not on any conditions.                       Now,

 3   the State may have imposed an independent obligation to

 4   register, but that was not a condition of his release.

 5   And so it is not the case, as a matter of fact, that he

 6   was released on condition.

 7                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               The bottom line is you

 8   don't think the Wetterling Act applied to him.                       Is that

 9   your point?

10                  MS. FUENTES:         I'm sorry?

11                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               The Wetterling

12   Act didn't apply to him; is that -

13                  MS. FUENTES:         No.       I don't think the

14   Wetterling Act applied to him.

15                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               At all?

16                  MS. FUENTES:         Correct.             But even if it did,

17   it was -- it's far removed from a registration

18   requirement.     It is a penalty, not a registration

19   requirement.

20                  The State imposed a registration

21   requirement.     Wetterling did not.

22                  And if you'd just read -- and I think that's

23   what the Fifth Circuit did.               They just read the statute,

24   14072(i)(3) and (i)(4).           It doesn't say a person who is

25   required to register will follow -- will suffer the

                                        48

 1   following punishment.         It says a person described in

 2   4042(d), a person who's been into a court-martial.

 3                  If you look at the rest of 14072 and parts

 4   of 14071, there are provisions that say such and such

 5   person shall register.          That is a registration

 6   requirement.

 7                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            I -- I guess what I'm not

 8   understanding, Ms. Fuentes, is -- I understand the

 9   difference between a requirement of registration and a

10   penalty for failing to register, but it's a little bit

11   cutting -- slicing the baloney thin.

12                  And if you think that he was in any event

13   while he was undergoing his sentence subject to a

14   penalty, it's a pretty minor exercise of Federal power,

15   isn't it, to say that, instead of making you just

16   subject to a penalty for doing something, we're going to

17   tell you, you have to do it?

18                  MS. FUENTES:         I guess I don't.     And the

19   reason is it's not the degree of power exerted, it's

20   whether the power exists.             And once Mr. Kebodeaux

21   completed his Federal sentence, the military power,

22   which permitted him to be prosecuted and punished, had

23   expired.

24                  And so in some ways it's like there's

25   Federal enclave jurisdiction on this side of the street

                                        49

 1   where the base exists, where the Navy yard exists, and

 2   things that happened here can be punished by the Federal

 3   Government, but just across the street the exact same

 4   things can occur and the Federal Government cannot

 5   punish it.

 6                 So I think it is very careful to draw those

 7   fine lines, and I think it is essential when discussing

 8   issues of the enumerated powers, because they are

 9   limited.

10                 I don't mean to move on fast.                    I did want to

11   mention -- I know my time is almost up -- that we have

12   offered an alternative ground for deciding the

13   constitutional questions here:                 The effective date

14   argument.    I know we didn't raise it in the Fifth

15   Circuit, but this Court has the authority to consider

16   it, and we have put into our brief all the reasons that

17   Mr. Kebodeaux is not covered by SORNA to begin with.

18                 In the Sixth, Ninth and Third Circuits, he

19   could not be prosecuted under SORNA, and so that is an

20   alternative basis that I think the Court can decide this

21   case on.

22                 And if there are no other questions, I will

23   cede the rest of my time.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

25                 Mr. Dreeben, you have three minutes

 2            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 3                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 4                MR. DREEBEN:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 5                As I understand Respondent's argument,

 6   Respondent concedes that he could have been put under a

 7   lifetime requirement to register with State authorities

 8   and punished federally if he did not, if only that

 9   requirement had been imposed on him either at the time

10   of sentencing or in a parallel civil proceeding that

11   occurred while he was in the military.

12                This case, therefore, reduces to a question

13   of timing.   The essential argument that Respondent is

14   making is that Congress had its -- had its authority

15   expire because it didn't exercise it.                  There's some sort

16   of notion that Congress must speak now or forever hold

17   its peace.

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:            But that's not unusual.

19   When you're released from the military, for example,

20   you're no longer subject to -- to Congress's

21   jurisdiction over the military.                 That's a matter of

22   timing too, isn't it?

23                MR. DREEBEN:         Well, that's just wrong,

24   Justice Scalia, because this Court made clear in United

25   States ex rel Toth v. Quarles that if an individual has

                                      51

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   left the military but hasn't been prosecuted, they can't

 2   be court-martialed, but they can be prosecuted in an

 3   Article III clause.

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Not for something that

 5   they've done after they left the military.                       That's a

 6   question of timing.       Had they left the military when

 7   they committed this crime?               If so, they can't be

 8   prosecuted under -- under that power of the Federal

 9   Government.

10                 MR. DREEBEN:          But sex offender registration

11   is a consequence of the military crime.                       That was

12   committed while they were in the military.                       It's a civil

13   remedy that may, consistent with other constitutional

14   provisions, be imposed retroactively.

15                 And this case comes down not to whether any

16   member of the Court agrees with the Ex Post Facto

17   Doctrine analysis in Smith v. Doe or whether there might

18   be due process or other concerns out there, it comes

19   down to whether Congress has Article I authority to

20   say -

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     And that's not

22   limited.   You've limited it to sex offenses, but the --

23   Congress could say it's important to us that people who

24   serve in the military behave correctly even after

25   they're released.     So it is a Federal offense to do

                                        52

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   anything that violates State law for the rest of their

 2   lives, and your argument would say, well, that's part of

 3   their authority to regulate the military and so it's

 4   okay.

 5                MR. DREEBEN:         Let me make two points about

 6   that, Mr. Chief Justice.          First of all, a standard

 7   condition of Federal supervised release is that the

 8   individual shall not violate any Federal, State or local

 9   law, and for many sex offenders, supervised release runs

10   for life.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's part of his

12   sentence.   That's part of the punishment imposed.                    You

13   assert that this is not part of the punishment imposed.

14                MR. DREEBEN:         I don't see any relevance that

15   has to Article I authority; it has relevance to other

16   constitutional provisions.

17                So, insofar as supervised release does

18   contemplate this longstanding, continuous jurisdiction,

19   that's a feature of Federal law that the Court ought to

20   keep in mind in the way that it writes this opinion.

21                But second, if Congress passed such a law,

22   it's not that it has carte blanche to do that, it's just

23   that there's no per se rule that says it can't.                     The

24   Court would -

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So your answer to my

                                      53

 1   question is yes, Congress can do that.                    It can say

 2   anyone in the military is subject for the rest of their

 3   life to Federal jurisdiction.              Whatever is a State law

 4   crime is a Federal crime.

 5               MR. DREEBEN:         Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not

 6   going to say no to that question, because I don't want

 7   to foreclose options that Congress may decide it's

 8   appropriate to pass, but the Court -

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Right.          Who knows what

10   they'll do, right?

11               MR. DREEBEN:         But the Court does not have to

12   agree that that is constitutional -- may I complete my

13   sentence?

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Sure.

15               MR. DREEBEN:         -- in order to uphold this

16   narrowly focused, tailored law that looks at a specific

17   crime and imposes a specific requirement that's directly

18   tied to the nature of that crime.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel,

20   counsel.
