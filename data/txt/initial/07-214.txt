 8                         ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9               MR. OLSON:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               The False Claims Act addresses and redresses

12   fraud on the government, not on every recipient of

13   government funds.     The liability-imposing provisions of

14   the False Claims Act refer ten times in a single

15   sentence to a submission to the government, getting a

16   claim paid or approved by the government, or defrauding

17   the government.     Liability is to the government and it's

18   based upon the amount of damages that the government

19   sustains.

20               20 years ago, construing an even broader

21   statute, this Court unanimously determined that

22   defrauding the government in any manner for any purpose

23   does not include defrauding recipients of Federal funds.

24   That's the Tanner case.          The United States made the same

25   arguments in the Tanner case in 1987 that it's making

 1   today in connection with the False Claims Act, and this

 2   Court unanimously decided that case that defrauding the

 3   government did not include defrauding grantees or

 4   recipients of Federal funds.

 5               There is no evidence in this case that false

 6   or fraudulent claims were submitted to the United

 7   States.   Indeed, we don't know from the record what was

 8   submitted to the United States, when it was submitted to

 9   the United States, what it contained.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What about the

11   certificates of conformance with specifications of?             I

12   believe they were the Navy's specifications and Allison

13   submitted to someone those certificates of conformance.

14               MR. OLSON:       The district court very

15   carefully analyzed that evidence, as well as all the

16   other evidence in the case, Justice Ginsburg, and found

17   that an inference could not be drawn with respect to

18   what had happened or when it happened because there is a

19   time lag to drawing an inference from certificates of

20   performance when you don't know when those certificates

21   were made, when they were submitted to the government,

22   what they said.

23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Could the government have

24   asked -- could the Navy have asked for them?

25               MR. OLSON:       The Navy, you mean in connection


                                        4

 1   with the litigation or in connection --

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             No.      In connection -- the

 3   Navy -- the engines are being supplied for Navy

 4   destroyers and the Navy obviously has an interest in

 5   making sure that the -- they measure up to the

 6   specifications.     So my question is whether in this

 7   procedure for dealing with subcontractors there is any

 8   kind of audit where the Navy can say, we want to see the

 9   certificates of conformance for those engines or other

10   documents relating to them.

11                 MR. OLSON:       The answer to your question as I

12   understand it, Justice Ginsburg, is yes, the Navy had

13   the right to test the equipment, look at the -- look at

14   the specifications, examine the specifications, ask for

15   corrections if they were unsatisfied, to test the

16   products.     The Navy had the right to do all of those

17   things.

18                 And one -- fundamental to this case is we

19   don't know whether they did, whether they were satisfied

20   with the generators as ultimately delivered to them,

21   whether there were corrections, if there were

22   deficiencies or deviations from the specifications when

23   they were first submitted to the shipyards, whether

24   those were corrected, whether those deviations were

25   immaterial.     Because --

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Did the Navy have the

 2   right to audit the subcontractor's books?

 3                 MR. OLSON:       It's my understanding -- I'm not

 4   100 percent sure of that, Justice Kennedy, but it's my

 5   understanding that the government did have the right to

 6   follow the process all the way through.                   There's no

 7   evidence that they did so.

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Suppose they audit the

 9   subcontractor's books and they don't discover a fraud

10   and leave.     Would there be liability then under your

11   view?

12                 MR. OLSON:       Well, I think it would depend

13   upon what was in the books and whether there was --

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            The books show that X

15   dollars were spent for certain parts and that was far

16   too much.     That was an inflated figure.                It fools the

17   government.     The government then paid the

18   subcontractor -- pays the contractor; the contractor

19   pays the subcontractor.

20                 MR. OLSON:       It -- that might be,

21   Justice Kennedy.     Regarding the terms of the statute,

22   whether you might interpret that as providing under

23   (a)(2), providing a record or document to the government

24   with the intention that the government pay or approve a

25   claim, I think you'd have to examine the evidence in


                                          6

 1   that context.

 2                 What we don't have here, we don't know what

 3   was submitted to the government.                 What the lawyers

 4   representing the claimants in this case -- and this is

 5   from page 5a of the appendix to the cert petition,

 6   footnote 3.     We -- this is what the -- when they were

 7   asked about this issue:          We haven't shown you the ship

 8   yard's invoices to the United States and we're not going

 9   to show you those.      Because they are totally irrelevant

10   under the False Claims Act.

11                 Now, that could not be more wrong, it seems

12   to us.   You can't determine -- if there's going to be a

13   fraud, a claim of fraud against the United States, you

14   have to know what the United States received to see

15   whether it's fraudulent, to see whether any deviation

16   from the facts were material, whether the deviation from

17   the specifications where maybe the product was better,

18   maybe it deviated in an insubstantial way or an

19   immaterial way, maybe the government had an opportunity

20   to fix it.

21                 We don't know whether there was reliance by

22   the government.    We don't know whether there was a loss

23   by the government.      And we don't know, if there was a

24   loss by the government, the quantification for the loss.

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:             I must be just missing

 1   something here.     Tell me what I'm missing.                  What about

 2   the definition of "claim"?            It says a claim includes a

 3   request under a contract for money or property, and the

 4   request is made to the contractor if the United States

 5   provides any -- any of the money.

 6                 Is there an issue here as to whether some of

 7   the money provided -- are you saying there was no money

 8   provided by the United States or maybe there was no

 9   money provided?

10                 MR. OLSON:       No. The way the record -- the

11   record is a little confusing with respect to that,

12   Justice Breyer, but I think that one of the witnesses --

13   I don't know how he knew --

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:             Yes.

15                 MR. OLSON:       But one of the witnesses said,

16   yes, the money that we received was money that came from

17   the United States.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:             Well -- so why doesn't that

19   end it?   Why doesn't -- how do you win, then, given the

20   language I just read?

21                 MR. OLSON:       Well, that's the definition of

22   the word "claim."

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:             "Claim."        And there has to

24   be a claim.

25                 MR. OLSON:       There has to be a claim.              But

 1   then section -- you're reading subsection (c).

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            That's right, that's right.

 3                 MR. OLSON:      Subsection (a) provides the

 4   standard for liability.         So you can have a claim, but

 5   you're not liable for a false claim unless it's

 6   submitted to the government, unless it's knowingly made

 7   to get a fraudulent claim paid or approved by the

 8   government.

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, you say (a), but

10   we're talking about (a)(2) --

11                 MR. OLSON:      Yes.

12                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           -- in connection with (c).

13                 MR. OLSON:      Yes.       I -- I'm looking at the

14   statute --

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But you were quoting from

16   (a)(1).

17                 MR. OLSON:      No, I quoted from both (a)(1)

18   and (a)(2).    (A)(2) --

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I know that, but doesn't

20   (a)(2) stand by itself, especially as -- as (c) is

21   written, (c) and (2), (c) and (a)(2) make perfect

22   grammatical sense without any presentation to the

23   government.

24                 MR. OLSON:      Well, it reads out the words "by

25   the government" from that section, which is what the


                                         9

 1   statute looked like until it was specifically amended.

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Well, the words "by the

 3   government" are in (a)(2).

 4              MR. OLSON:        Pardon me?

 5              JUSTICE STEVENS:             The words "by the

 6   government" are in (a)(2).

 7              MR. OLSON:        They are in (a)(2), but the way

 8   Justice -- the way Justice Kennedy was reading it, I

 9   respectfully submit, would read out those "by the

10   government."   What (a)(2) --

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:             You're saying, in addition

12   to being a claim, that's not enough reliability?            It has

13   to be a claim that's presented to the government?

14              MR. OLSON:        It's presented to the government

15   and --

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:             And all that (c) does is

17   tell you what a claim is.          So that, even if it's not a

18   claim against the government but just a claim against a

19   subcontractor, that still can be the basis for liability

20   so long as it's presented to the government.

21              MR. OLSON:        It's presented to the government

22   or, under (a)(2), knowingly made to get --

23              JUSTICE STEVENS:             But (a)(2) says it has to

24   be paid or approved by the government.

25              MR. OLSON:        It has to be made or used to get

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   a claim paid or approved.            In other words, it has to be

 2   something that's created, then given to the government,

 3   so in order to get a claim paid or approved by the

 4   government.     What I am --

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But you said given to the

 6   government.     It's "paid or approved by the government."

 7                 MR. OLSON:       Well, I think a reasonable

 8   reading of the statute is -- and this is essentially

 9   what this Court unanimously decided 20 years ago in the

10   Tanner case, that these cases about defrauding the

11   government must involve something that causes the

12   government to suffer a loss, some something that impacts

13   the government.    Even -- even the government today is

14   making the same statement that there has to be a loss.

15                 What I'm saying with -- it's important,

16   Justice Kennedy, that -- that if you are going to want

17   to get something paid or approved by the government, you

18   have to do something that gets it to the government in

19   some fashion.

20                 And reading (a)(1) and (a)(2) and (a)(3) and

21   the Tanner decision and the history of this statute from

22   1863 all suggest very strongly, I submit, the plain

23   language of the statute is that it's -- involves fraud

24   against the government.

25                 Now, you may submit something to a prime --


                                         11

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   you may be a subcontractor that submits something to the

 2   prime contractor, and this very -- this case is a very

 3   good example of it, and this case is very much like the

 4   Tanner case.    What did the prime contractor do with it?

 5   If it was false or deficient or out of specifications,

 6   the prime contractor had a right to say:                    Wait a minute,

 7   tighten those bolts up a little bit more, or we're going

 8   to deduct it, a little price from that, and we're going

 9   to tell the government that there's a deviation from the

10   specifications.

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But if it's disguised,

12   how would the -- how would the prime contractor know?

13                 MR. OLSON:      Well, that's just the point,

14   Justice Ginsburg.    We don't no one way or the other

15   unless the evidence is submitted.                 We don't know what

16   the government received, so we don't know whether the

17   government was deceived.          So, if I submit that it might

18   well be in this case -- we don't know how much time

19   elapsed between the submission of the invoices or the

20   other materials from the subcontractor to the prime

21   contractor.    What happened then between then and when

23   could have happened.       We don't know.

 1                 MR. OLSON:      There was a trial.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            There was?

 3                 MR. OLSON:      And there was a motion at the

 4   close of the evidence of the plaintiff's case.                    And at

 5   that -- it's at that point that counsel said:                    We are

 6   not going to show you the invoices to the United States.

 7   We're not --

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, how could -- they

 9   would have at a minimum, even if your theory is not

10   correct -- they would have to prove loss to the

11   government.    Otherwise they would have no claim.

12                 MR. OLSON:      That's -- that's correct,

13   Justice Ginsburg.    And that's my point.

14                 If you can't -- if you don't know what went

15   to the government, you don't know whether a claim or a

16   document or a statement, to use the words of the

17   statute, went to the government, you don't know whether

18   what the government got was false; you don't

19   know whether they --

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Does the other side concede

21   that point, that you have to prove loss to the

22   government?    I don't think they do, do they?

23                 MR. OLSON:      I'm not sure.              I think --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't think they do.

25                 MR. OLSON:      What the statute says --

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, the government

 2   certainly has that in its brief.

 3               MR. OLSON:       What the statute says is that it

 4   is liability to the government for the damage the

 5   government sustains.      Now, it may well be --           there's

 6   penalties even if there isn't damage to the government.

 7   I would concede that.

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You could say that the

 9   missed funds which are in the hands of subcontract -- of

10   contractors, harms the government, even though it

11   doesn't come out of the government's pocket, because

12   those funds were given for a particular purpose, and if

13   that purpose is frustrated, the government is harmed.

14   That would work, without saying that the government has

15   lost any money.

16               MR. OLSON:       Well, you could say that, but

17   you don't know whether the government got what it

18   wanted.   You don't know whether the -- if something

19   deviates from specifications in a contract, it might

20   deviate on the plus side of something, it might deviate

21   in an immaterial way.

22               The contractor, the prime shipyards here,

23   and the government had the right to correct any

24   deficiencies.

 1   government gives money for building schools, okay, to a

 2   State and a fraudulent claim is submitted as -- in

 3   connection with the construction of the school.

 4                 The government has been cheated in that the

 5   money it gave for a school is not going to the school;

 6   some of it is going into the hands of the fraudulent

 7   contractor.

 8                 MR. OLSON:      Well, what you've done with your

 9   question, Justice Scalia, is left out the link.                  What

10   happened -- what -- the government may have made

11   -- given money to the schools.               Subcontractors might

12   have submitted something false.               The prime contractor

13   might have discovered it and said:                  Correct this or --

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I understand that, but

15   that's a different point.

16                 MR. OLSON:      No, it isn't --

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I am talking now about the

18   point of whether the government itself has to suffer any

19   harm other than the fact that the money it gave was not

20   used for the purpose for which it gave it.                 That alone,

21   it seems to me, could be harm.

22                 MR. OLSON:      Well, it -- it might under some

23   circumstances be harm.        It might not under other

24   circumstances be harm.        It might be misleading in an

25   immaterial way.    It might -- there might have been no

 1   reliance by the government.             There might have -- the

 2   government might have said -- the contract between the

 3   prime contractor and the subcontractor might have

 4   different requirements than what the government wants.

 5   None of those --

 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Mr. Olson, it seems to me

 7   you're fighting a hypothetical.               Let's say they built a

 8   lousy school, sub-spec.         The roof is falling in; the

 9   plumbing leaks.    It's a fraud, but they've given the

10   money, the feds have given the money to the States and

11   the States have let this slip by.                 Justice Scalia's

12   point was the Federal Government has been injured.

13               MR. OLSON:        The Federal Government may have

14   been injured.   The question is what does this statute

15   redress?   There are other statutes.                     There's a major

16   fraud provision of Title 18 that has major penalties for

17   fraud by subcontractors against contractors in

18   connection with public projects just as the one -- like

19   the ones you're describing.

20               But if this Court's Tanner decision is

21   correct -- and it was only 20 years ago; it was

22   unanimous -- it defined the term "defrauding the

23   government" and it said "defrauding the government"

24   means defrauding the government, not filing a false

25   claim --

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:            But that's why the

 2   definition -- it seems to me at the moment -- that's why

 3   I'd like your view -- that the language is perfectly

 4   ambiguous, the language of "knowingly makes a false

 5   statement to get a false claim paid."

 6                 Now, the "false claim" is the claim that

 7   they made to the contractor, because that's the

 8   definition.    And you are saying:               Well, they made this

 9   statement to get a false claim paid by the government.

10   Now, you could read those words "paid by the government"

11   to say "and there has to be a causal connection," which

12   is what you're saying, that you have to make the false

13   statement, make the claim, and that led the government

14   to pay.

15                 But you could also say it's paid by the

16   government when the money to pay it comes out of

17   government funds, because it was paid by the government

18   even though the government gave the money to build the

19   school 100 years ago.        But it's there in the bank

20   account, and then the contractor took the money from the

21   bank account that the government put in and paid it.                In

22   such a case, linguistically, you can say it's paid by

23   the government.

24                 MR. OLSON:       It has to be a false claim paid

25   by the government.

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:            It was a false claim.

 2   That's there.

 3                 MR. OLSON:       What -- Justice Breyer, what is

 4   missing from your hypothetical is what went to the

 5   government.     Suppose the prime contractor decided that

 6   the paint was off-white instead of white, and that was

 7   satisfactory.

 8                 Suppose the subcontractor said to the

 9   government:     This is a major project; this is

10   a billion-dollar project; there are all these little

11   things that are out of specifications and could be

12   called false or fraudulent or misleading; we're going to

13   disclose all of these things to the government.                  The

14   government has a complete opportunity to test them, look

15   at them, and decide whether it's satisfied.                  Then the

16   government isn't deceived.

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, it doesn't say that.

18   It says it was a false claim, which it was.                  It's false,

19   and it is a claim to the general.                  And was it paid by

20   the government?    Yes.      It was paid by the government,

21   even though everything you said is true, because the

22   money to pay it came from government funds.                  So that's

23   why I'm having a problem.            I can read those words "paid

24   by the government" either way.

25                 MR. OLSON:       Well, I think you are taking the

 1   words and isolating them.

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:            That's true.

 3               MR. OLSON:       It is knowingly making a false

 4   record or a false statement to get a false claim paid.

 5   If the government didn't pay a false claim, then (a)(2)

 6   doesn't provide for liability.

 7               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, that's not strictly

 8   correct.   I mean, it "paid or approved."

 9               MR. OLSON:       Yes, I should have said --

10               JUSTICE SOUTER:            -- which means there is a

11   third way, and the third way of reading it is if the sub

12   makes the false statement to the general contractor in

13   order ultimately to get a false claim, i.e., the

14   ultimate contractor's claim for conforming work,

15   approved or this particular claim approved by the

16   government when the government makes the ultimate

17   decision to pay the general contractor, that would be

18   covered by (2).

19               MR. OLSON:       Well, if -- I should have said

20   the word "approved" because I -- I was shortening it up.

21   But it does say "paid or approved."                     But what has to be

22   done is that the government has to -- what has to be

23   submitted is something to cause the government to pay or

24   to approve a false claim to the government.

25               JUSTICE SOUTER:            But that can simply be done

 1   by the false claim to the general contractor, who either

 2   accepts it as true or, for that matter, knowingly

 3   understands that it is false, and ultimately submits the

 4   same claim, i.e., as an element of its ultimate bill for

 5   the whole project.

 6              MR. OLSON:          Well, what I might say in

 7   addition to what I have said, Justice Souter, is that

 8   there is no stopping point for that theory.               The

 9   government says as long as the project involved Federal

10   money, as long as the project used Federal funds, as

11   long as the project might endanger the Federal fisc, as

12   long as the program is financed in part by Federal

13   money, there would be liability under this statute.

14              Given the tens of thousands of government

15   contracts, government funds, government financing of

16   States, localities, universities, and so forth, there is

17   no limiting point.      And what --

18              JUSTICE SOUTER:               With respect, I think there

19   is a limiting point.        You are certainly right when you

20   talk about the thousands of contracts that the

21   government ultimately makes or finances for the benefit

22   of lower units of government.               But it does not follow

23   from the government's theory that if the United States

24   makes grants to a sub-unit of government, not for the

25   purpose of a given contract or a given project, it


                                         20

 1   simply makes grants, revenue-sharing sorts of things, it

 2   doesn't follow from the government's position that when

 3   one of those sub-units of government then makes a

 4   contract spending part of that money, that it's covered

 5   by this statute.

 6                 This statute would cover the myriad of

 7   grants made for particular contracts.                    It would not

 8   cover every subset of funds in a lower government unit,

 9   some of which had been contributed by the national

10   government.

11                 MR. OLSON:      I don't -- I don't think, with

12   respect, that that's a fair reading of what the

13   government said either in the Tanner case, think making

14   essentially the same arguments which were rejected

15   unanimously by this Court, or what it says in its brief

16   to the Court today.

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, perhaps we should

18   ask the government to explain what its position is.                     But

19   one of the points that has been raised in opposition to

20   your argument is that your interpretation would cut out

21   claims that today are regarded as properly presented

22   under the False Claims Act.

23                 And the one that was featured was false

24   claims for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement, because

25   those are presented not to the government but to an


                                        21

 1   intermediary.

 2              MR. OLSON:          In -- with respect to that, the

 3   government filed a brief in a case called Atkins versus

 4   McInteer in the Eleventh circuit, and I have the brief

 5   here -- it is not part of the material that is before

 6   you -- in which the government said that even if the

 7   District -- D.C. Circuit decision that's involved in

 8   this case, the Totten case, was correctly decided, those

 9   Medicare-Medicaid cases would be substantially covered

10   under the statute even under that construction because

11   the provider's claim is passed on by the insurer to the

12   Medicare agency or entity.

13              Now, I don't know, Justice Ginsburg, the

14   facts of that case or the facts of all of those

15   circumstances.   But the fact is that if you take this

16   statute as it was enacted in 1863, all of this used to

17   be a part of one section that talked in the first case,

18   the first instance, one sentence which discussed in the

19   first instance a presentation of a claim to the

20   government and which was the liability to be imposed

21   upon the claimant.

22              The second part of the sentence said -- it

23   was intended to cover the people aiding the fraud, those

24   people that provided with records or statements in order

25   to get the payment made.

 1                 And then the third provision was the

 2   conspiracy provision.

 3                 Those were broken out into the subsections

 4   you see today.     In 1982, Congress specifically said:               We

 5   are simply codifying the statute; we're not changing the

 6   statute.     We are making no substantive changes in the

 7   statute.

 8                 If you read that provision in the context of

 9   the Marcus versus Hess case, which was in the early

10   '40s, in which the government -- in which the Court

11   specifically said there's liability for an intermediary

12   causing a -- Federal Government to pay the claim.               But

13   in that case, the invoices were passed on, and the --

14   and the government entity in that case, the Public Works

15   Administration, had the opportunity to review and

16   approve --

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So the whole

18   difference -- the whole difference, then, is if the --

19   the invoices are passed on, as opposed to the government

20   having the right, if it so chooses, to inspect the books

21   and records?

22                 MR. OLSON:       I think I may not have heard

23   your question.    In the --

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The difference is if the

25   government gets the invoices from the contractor, then


                                         23

 1   there's a claim under the False Claims Act.               But if,

 2   instead, the subcontractor is required to make its books

 3   and records available on request to the government,

 4   that's not enough?

 5              MR. OLSON:          Well, I -- I think -- it's

 6   certainly not this case, because the -- although the

 7   government had an opportunity to do these things, we

 8   don't know what happened.

 9              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                But it made -- I thought

10   you said that it is this case that the government had

11   the right --

12              MR. OLSON:          If --

13              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                -- to audit the --

14              MR. OLSON:          The problem is, as this Court

15   said in the -- unanimously in the Tanner case, given --

16   forgive me for doing this, but it's important -- given

17   the immense variety of ways the Federal Government

18   provides Federal financial assistance, always

19   accompanied by some restrictions or conditions on its

20   use, the inability of the substantial supervision

21   language which the government was advancing then, which

22   it's sort of advancing now, does not provide any test

23   for any real guidance or --

 1   that Justice Breyer is putting to you.

 2              MR. OLSON:       Yes --

 3              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            This statute that we're

 4   looking at, in effect, defines what a fraud against the

 5   government is.

 6              MR. OLSON:       Yes, but it -- but when it

 7   was -- when it added that section, it specifically added

 8   in the words "by the government," which those words were

 9   added after the legislative history that both the

10   Respondents and the government cite.                   And it did not

11   change, Justice Kennedy, the definition of "liability."

12   It simply defined "claim."         If the Court --

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Am I correct in this that

14   without the claim definition, the statute would not

15   cover a fraudulent submission by the subcontractor to

16   the contractor which is known to be passed on to the

17   government ultimately?

18              MR. OLSON:       No, I think --

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Without that definition,

20   the claim would be made against the contractor, not

21   against the government.

22              MR. OLSON:       I --

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:            And, therefore, wouldn't be

24   a claim.

25              MR. OLSON:       I think under both the -- if the

 1   claim by the subcontractor to the contractor is intended

 2   to be passed on, that the -- that the contractor is an

 3   intermediary, then under Marcus versus Hess, which is

 4   the situation there, there could be liability.

 5                 I'd like if I could, Mr. Chief Justice, to

 6   reserve the balance of my time.

10            ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,

11                 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

12                          AS AMICUS CURIAE,

13                   SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

14                 MR. STEWART:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

15   please the Court:

16                 I'd like to begin with the same point that

17   Mr. Olson began with, namely, does the False Claims

18   Act -- is the False Claims Act directed solely at

19   schemes to defraud the government or does it encompass

20   schemes to defraud people who receive Federal money?

21   And we're in agreement with Petitioners that the False

22   Claims Act is directed at schemes to defraud the Federal

23   Government.

24                 Our theory in this case is not that the

25   subcontractors are potentially liable because they may


                                        26

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   have attempted to defraud the prime contractors.                 Our

 2   theory is that the subcontractors are potentially liable

 3   because they are alleged to have used false

 4   representations made to the prime contractors but with

 5   the ultimate purpose of defrauding the United States.

 6              And I think if you imagine what would have

 7   happened if the allegations in this case are true and if

 8   the fraudulent scheme had been carried to completion,

 9   it's very clear that the government, rather than the

10   prime contractors, would have been the injured party.

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Mr. Stewart, I don't

12   understand that point.       Let's say Allison Engine is

13   defrauding Bath, but Bath makes ships for a lot of

14   people, boats, whatever they make.                 Allison Engine is

15   defrauding, saying these engines, you know, work this

16   way and, in fact, they don't.

17              It doesn't know Bath is going to use some of

18   them in a government ship as opposed to a private ship.

19   So you're saying in that context, since there's no

20   intent to defraud the government, there's no liability?

21              MR. STEWART:          Well, we would say certainly

22   in the context where Allison knows that the engines are

23   to be used for private work, that the False Claims

24   Act would not --

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  It just sells them


                                       27

 1   engines.    It doesn't know what Bath is going to do with

 2   them.    They are going to put some in private boats and

 3   some in the government boats.

 4                 MR. STEWART:        I think you could still have a

 5   FCA claim, if in fact the work was being done for the

 6   government contract.       But whatever the correct answer to

 7   that question in the circumstance where the

 8   subcontractor really doesn't know what the ultimate

 9   project is for, that's not the case here.                The

10   subcontractor --

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I have another question.

12   Suppose the subcontractor -- the fraud consists of

13   inflating the hours spent in a cost-plus contract.                   So

14   the subcontractor submits and receives payment for

15   $10,000 more than the subcontractor deserved.                  All

16   right?

17                 But that all comes out of the hide of the

18   contractor.    The contractor gets the same amount of

19   money from the Federal Government and the fraud only

20   harms the contractor.

21                 MR. STEWART:        Our view is that that would

22   not be covered.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           That would not be --

24                 MR. STEWART:        That would not be covered.           It

25   would --

 1              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Why?

 2              MR. STEWART:            Because the statute -- if you

 3   look at page 2 of the blue brief, that reproduces the

 4   relevant provisions of the statute.                       And the one that

 5   we're principally -- the two that we're relying on here

 6   are subsection 2, which says:               "Knowingly makes, uses or

 7   causes to be made or used a false record or statement to

 8   get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the

 9   government."

10              And we would say that the reference to false

11   or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government

12   should be taken as limited to a claim that is false as

13   to the government.      That is, it's false in a respect

14   that the government cares about.

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:               -- injured by it because

16   it, in effect, gets less than it paid for?

17              MR. STEWART:            Well --

18              JUSTICE SOUTER:               If it were a cost-plus

19   contract, the government would pay an extra 10,000 and

20   it would lose.

21              MR. STEWART:            That's right.

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:               If they -- if they simply

23   supplied defective parts, the government would get less

24   of a machine than it paid for.                But in the -- in

25   Justice Scalia's example, the government ultimately ends

 1   up with exactly what it bargained for, and the person

 2   who's out is the person who paid for too much labor,

 3   which is general -- is that your --

 4                 MR. STEWART:        That's correct.        And in that

 5   circumstance, I think the scheme could fairly be

 6   characterized as one to defraud the prime contractor,

 7   because the prime contractor would bear the loss

 8   associated with the scheme.             And we would agree that

 9   that's not covered.      Here --

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:           What you are saying is

11   covered, I take it -- and this is -- I want to know how

12   this has worked out -- what is covered is -- imagine

13   government grant programs.           And suppose there are vast

14   numbers of grant programs now that go to all kinds of

15   entities throughout the country, and a large portion of

16   which are just grants.        They're paid and the government

17   is not going to get a penny back.

18                 Now, there are instances of frauds in such

19   situations of subs against the person who gets the

20   grant.   And in -- I can't imagine a case -- maybe

21   imagine, but it would be imaginary -- where the

22   Government couldn't say:          But we got less than the grant

23   was supposed to pay for.

24                 And you're saying all those are covered.             Is

25   that right?

 1                 MR. STEWART:        I mean, I think our test would

 2   be, is the effect of the fraud to cause the money

 3   provided by the Federal Government to be diverted to

 4   purposes --

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:           To get less than it was

 6   supposed to get.

 7                 MR. STEWART:        I --

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:           And so this is what

 9   surprises me on your side.           It's 20 years later.     And if

10   all those things are covered, given the vast extent of

11   government grant programs in the United States, has your

12   interpretation worked to bring within this statute, and

13   lots of qui tam cases against municipal frauds of all

14   kinds, things that they just never thought of at the

15   time of the Civil War?        Do you see what the question is?

16                 MR. STEWART:        I mean, I think -- I think it

17   has basically worked.       I don't think it has worked

18   perfectly.    But I don't think --

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Have there been a lot of

20   such cases?

21                 MR. STEWART:        I think there are a lot of

22   cases -- I mean, Medicare and Medicaid fraud is an

23   example that we would deal with differently textually,

24   but those are programs in which the Federal Government

25   provides money.    Persons other than Federal officials

 1   decide whether the claims should be paid, but ultimately

 2   there's reimbursement by the Federal Government.                    Now,

 3   our answer to the question --

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Olson said on the

 5   Medicare that the providers, that the intermediary does

 6   present the --

 7               MR. STEWART:         And our view is that those

 8   would be covered even if there is a presentment

 9   requirement, because subsection (a)(1) of the statute

10   refers to a person who knowingly causes a false claim to

11   be presented to a Federal official.

12               So because there's the reimbursement

13   mechanism we think that would be covered.               But a big

14   part of our argument here is that the applicability of

15   the FCA should not depend on these sorts of quirks of

16   timing.   That is, to take the school hypothetical that

17   was discussed in the first part of the argument, you

18   have provision of government money for -- Federal money

19   for construction of a school, and the contractors who

20   deal with the State agency defraud the State agency and

21   they produce a shoddy product.

22               Now, if the way that the funding program

23   works is that the State agency pays first and then

24   presents a claim for reimbursement to the Federal

25   Government, that would be covered even with the

 1   presentment requirement.

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, how far down

 3   the line?    I mean, let's take that hypothetical.                     The

 4   government gives money to the State to build a school.

 5   The school has to be painted as part of that, so the

 6   school contractor, the prime contractor, takes some of

 7   the money from the Federal Government and pays the

 8   painter.    The painter needs to buy paint.                   So the

 9   painter takes some of the Federal money and pays the

10   paint company.     The paint company has to get the

11   chemicals from somebody.           So the paint company takes

12   some of the money and pays the chemical company.                       And at

13   that point, the chemical companies fraudulently added,

14   you know, a dollar on to the cost of the chemicals.                      So

15   that dollar goes all the way through.                     So the Government

16   ends up paying a dollar more because of the fraud five,

17   six, seven times down the line.

18                Can an uninterested person bring a qui tam

19   action against the chemical manufacturer because of that

20   fraud?

21                MR. STEWART:          I think our answer would

22   probably be yes.     A court might read a de minimis

23   limitation into the statute, but part of our point would

24   be that be that that --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:             A hundred dollars more a

 1   can.

 2                 (Laughter.)

 3                 MR. STEWART:        Well, the answer to that

 4   hypothetical -- and the answer to that hypothetical

 5   really has nothing to do with whether the statute

 6   imposes a presentment requirement, because the

 7   hypothetical --

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                It's not a

 9   presentment requirement.          That's in (a)(1.          It's that

10   the claim be paid, the fault claim, be paid by the

11   government.    And what you're saying is when the

12   government pays the State, that pays the school, that

13   pays the contractor, that pays the paint -- blah, blah,

14   blah -- that that is payment by the government of a

15   false claim because the chemical manufacturer six or

16   seven steps down the line commits fraud.

17                 MR. STEWART:        It could be an (a)(2)

18   question, but my point was that the same type of issue

19   could arise even with the presentment requirement,

20   because if the chemical manufacturer presents his own

21   bill to the paint company, who presents his bill to the

22   contractor who does the painting work, who presents his

23   bill, et cetera, et cetera --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           He has to know that.      He

25   has to know that his bill is going to be sent up the

 1   line to the government.        "Knowingly makes, uses or

 2   causes to be made or used a false record to get a false

 3   or fraudulent --

 4                MR. STEWART:        I guess I would say --

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:           And if he knows it, serve

 6   him right.   But this other guy thinks he's just honestly

 7   cheating the guy who's buying the chemicals.

 8                (Laughter.)

 9                MR. STEWART:        Again, whatever -- whatever

10   the answer -- the point I was trying to make about the

11   timing is -- again assume away these issues about how

12   much might be de minimis.          You have substantial fraud by

13   the contractor directed at the State agency.            If the

14   State -- if the way the funding program works is that

15   the State agency then presents its own bill to the

16   Federal Government, we're going to have a good (a)(1)

17   case regardless of whether presentment is required,

18   because we're going to say the subcontractor, the person

19   who did the work, caused the State agency to submit a

20   false claim to the Federal Government and we can recover

21   on that theory.

22                MR. STEWART:        But -- but if the government

23   provides the money up front, gives it to the State

24   agency and says, use it for the defined purposes, you'll

25   still have presentment of a claim by the State agency,

 1   namely the request for funding, but there will be no way

 2   to say that that difference --

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:            The difference is that

 4   government money today is in everything.               So if it's in

 5   everything, then everything is going to become subject

 6   to this False Claims Act.         And of course I exaggerate by

 7   using the word "everything," but only a little.

 8              (Laughter.)

 9              MR. STEWART:         But the point about timing --

10   but the point about timing is if the State's claim is

11   submitted to the Federal Government at a time when the

12   fraud has not yet occurred, the State's claim can't be

13   denominated false, assuming that the State intends it --

14              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I don't know that that

15   accords with the definition of "claim" in (c).

16              MR. STEWART:         Well, the definition of

17   "claim" in (c) says it's a request or a demand --

18              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It says the government

19   will reimburse.

20              MR. STEWART:         Will reimburse, but it also

21   says "if the United States Government provides any

22   portion of the money or property which is requested or

23   demanded, or if the government will reimburse."              And so

24   --

25              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But I meant provide.     It

 1   has provided it already.

 2                 MR. STEWART:        That's correct.         And my -- my

 3   point is the definition of "claim" indicates that

 4   Congress didn't want liability to turn on this quirk of

 5   timing, whether the fraud occurs before the claim is

 6   submitted to --

 7                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So in your own school

 8   hypothetical, there's liability.

 9                 MR. STEWART:        There's liability if the

10   Federal Government reimburses a claim for expenses that

11   have already been incurred, but under Petitioner's

12   theory, if the Federal Government pays the money up

13   front, the State has submitted a claim but it's not a

14   false claim.    And then if the contractor defrauds the

15   school -- the State, by producing a shoddy school, the

16   contractor can't be charged with having caused a false

17   claim to be submitted.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It doesn't shock me.      I

19   don't know.    It doesn't shock me at all.               If indeed the

20   object of this is to prevent fraud upon the government

21   and if the government has not been deceived at all, get

22   yourself a new statute.

23                 MR. STEWART:        But our point is that --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           This statute doesn't have

25   to cover every ill in the world.

 1              MR. STEWART:           That's correct.        But fraud --

 2   fraud against the government can occur whether -- the

 3   whole point of the definition of (c) is that fraud

 4   against the government can occur if Federal money is

 5   diverted away from its intended purposes, whether the

 6   deceit is practiced directly upon a Federal official or

 7   a contractor or a grantee.

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Before -- before you

 9   finish, the major objection is the one that Justice

10   Breyer just voiced, that your position is vastly

11   overbroad and every time there's government money there

12   will be -- one of these qui tam people can come in.

13   What are the limiting principles that you say attach to

14   this statute?

15              MR. STEWART:           There are two principal

16   limiting principles.       The first is that the bill has to

17   be submitted to the contractor or grantee in his

18   capacity as such.    That is, there has to be a nexus

19   between the provision of Federal funds and the request

20   that's made.    So if a subcontractor defrauds Boeing on

21   work that Boeing is doing for a private airline, there's

22   no FCA violation.    Even though Boeing literally is a

23   government contractor, it's not being defrauded in its

24   capacity as such.

25              And the second is that the fraud has to be


                                        38

 1   of a nature that if successfully carried to completion

 2   could be expected to injure the Federal Government.                So

 3   in the hypothetical of the cost-plus contract between

 4   the prime contractor and the sub and the sub presents an

 5   inflated bill, if the loss false on the prime contractor

 6   and is not passed along to the government, the claim

 7   would not lie under the FCA

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:             But if injuring the Federal

 9   Government would -- it would suffice to injure the

10   Federal Government that the schools are shoddy and the

11   roofs are leaking?      That would be enough?

12                MR. STEWART:          That would be enough.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Even though the Federal

14   Government is not out of pocket any more, but the

15   program that it -- that it was desirous of encouraging

16   is simply not as good as it would have been otherwise.

17                MR. STEWART:          That's -- that's correct.

18                JUSTICE SOUTER:             And you would still -- your

19   theory would still cover the case of the -- of the

20   agency that gets 10 percent of its budget by -- through

21   a general grant from the United States, no matter what

22   it spent its money on, regardless of the fact that the

23   United States has no connection with particular

24   contracts.   If in fact a fraudulent claim was presented

25   to that agency, it would fall within the qui tam

 1   statute?

 2                MR. STEWART:        We would still be asking was

 3   the -- whether the fraud was of a sort that the Federal

 4   Government cared about.        That is, if the Federal

 5   Government made a grant with no strings attached, use it

 6   as you want.

 7                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Right, no strings attached.

 8                MR. STEWART:        Then there would be no FCA

 9   liability.

10                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Why wouldn't there be?

11                MR. STEWART:        Because the fraud would not --

12   in that -- in that hypothetical, you would have

13   something akin to a fraudulent car repair bill passed

14   along, given to me.     I happen to be a Department of

15   Justice employee and I might use my Federal salary to

16   pay the fraudulent claim.          But we wouldn't say that's an

17   FCA violation.

18                JUSTICE SOUTER:           No, but when your salary is

19   paid, in effect the government's interest stops when it

20   pays for your labor.      In the -- in the hypothetical in

21   which the government funds 10 percent of a sub-agency's

22   operating budget, presumably its intent generalized goes

23   to everything that agency does.

24                MR. STEWART:        Well, we would still ask

25   whether the government has -- the Federal Government has

 1   placed meaningful limitations on the way in which the

 2   money may be spent and whether the nature of the fraud

 3   is to prevent those limitations from being honored.

 4               Thank you.

 8               ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES B. HELMER, JR.,

 9                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

10               MR. HELMER:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11   please this Court:

12               Electricity is the critical component in a

13   modern warship that allows it to fight, to defend

14   itself, and to carry out its mission.                     Because of that,

15   the Navy imposed rigid requirements on all who work on

16   its generator sets in manufacturing those generator

17   sets.

18               Those rigid requirements were passed down

19   from the Navy to Bath.         Bath was ordered by the Navy to

20   pass those down in writing to each of its subcontractors

21   who were going to work on these Gen-Sets, and Bath did

22   that.   Each of the subcontractors in this case knew they

23   were working on the DDG-51 project, which is the Arleigh

24   Burke-class destroyers.          They knew that military

25   requirements were called out in their paperwork that had


                                         41
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to be met; and they did not satisfy those military

 2   requirements and yet submitted both claims for payment

 3   and, as Justice Ginsburg has pointed out, certificates

 4   of compliance.

 5              If you look at the Sixth Circuit's joint

 6   appendix at page 620, you're going to see, at paragraph

 7   6.1 in the contract between Bath Iron Works and Allison,

 8   the subcontractor, that Allison was required, when it

 9   delivered the Gen-Sets to the shipyard to give a

10   certificate of conformance that all of these rigid

11   requirements had been satisfied, and that certificate of

12   conformance had to be given to the United States Navy.

13              And third, until that certificate of

14   conformance was given to the United States Navy, no

15   money; no money was going to be paid to Allison.

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Whose certificate is it?

17   Is it the contractor's certificate that everything that

18   the subs have done or the certificate of conformance

19   that Allison provided, that SOFCO provided?

20              MR. HELMER:        Yes, ma'am.              There are two

21   certificates of conformance, you're absolutely correct.

22   What I'm speaking of is the certificate of conformance

23   from the defendant in this case.              They have to take and

24   give that to the shipyard that says:                   We have met all

25   the requirements, the Navy requirements; and we have to


                                      42
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   give that to the U.S. Navy.            The U.S. Navy then takes

 2   that certificate and releases the Gen-Set.               It's under

 3   lock and key.   It releases the Gen-Set --

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I thought --

 5               MR. HELMER:        -- to be installed in the ship.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I thought it was not

 7   established that anything from this defendant got to the

 8   Navy.

 9               MR. HELMER:        You were told that earlier this

10   morning, Your Honor.      I don't believe that's correct.

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, where in the record

12   is there some indication that some -- some paper from --

13   with a fraudulent representation made it up to the Navy?

14               MR. HELMER:        If you'll look at the joint

15   appendix, the Sixth Circuit joint appendix, at page 620;

16   it's clause 6.1 -- talks about the certificates.               The

17   certificates are in the record starting at joint

18   appendix, Sixth Circuit joint appendix 515 --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, I know what

20   certificates are, I mean, you know, their general

21   content.   But was there anything in the record that a

22   certificate from Allison went to the Navy with Allison's

23   signature on it?

24               MR. HELMER:        Yes, Your Honor.         The contract

25   with Bath required the Navy to receive that for Allison


                                       43

 1   to be paid.     There was evidence in this case that

 2   Allison was, in fact, paid for delivering these

 3   Gen-Sets.     That's circumstantial evidence that they did

 4   submit their certificates of conformance --

 5                 JUSTICE ALITO:          What about the statement

 6   that Mr. Olson quoted during his argument, when counsel

 7   for plaintiffs said to the jury:                 You haven't seen

 8   anything that was submitted to the Navy and you're not

 9   going to see anything that was submitted to the Navy?

10                 MR. HELMER:        No, Your Honor.          That -- I made

11   that statement, and that was not my statement.

12                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, what was your

13   statement?

14                 MR. HELMER:        My statement was:          You are not

15   going to see the invoices from Allison -- the invoices,

16   not the certificates of conformance, not the invoices

17   from Bath to the Navy.         You're not going to see those.

18   But the invoices from Allison to Bath were all admitted

19   into the record in this case.               They're all summarized.

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, then there's less to

21   this case than we had thought.                My goodness, even under

22   the Petitioner's theory, you win.                  If indeed a

23   fraudulent document was given to Bath and Bath passed

24   that on, I think the Petitioners would have conceded --

25                 MR. HELMER:        Your Honor, this case --

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- that there's a cause of

 2   action.    What is all this fuss about, then?

 3                 MR. HELMER:       This case is not a outlier on

 4   the ends of this statute.           It is squarely in the middle

 5   of (a)(2).

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I wish you had said that in

 7   your brief because we could have saved ourselves a lot

 8   of reading.

 9                 (Laughter.)

10                 MR. HELMER:       Your Honor, anything that I can

11   do to help the Court.       I apologize if I didn't write the

12   brief better than I could have.

13                 But I do have another point that I -- that I

14   would like to make in addition to what's in the record

15   in this case.    If you go back and look at the 1863

16   version of the False Claims Act, which continues on in

17   1943, the statute talks about in the second clause --

18   and the second clause is what is now known as (a)(2) --

19   it talks about a false record or statement being made

20   for the purpose of obtaining or aiding to obtain

21   payment.   It does not say, and it never said, that there

22   has to actually be payment, there has to actually be

23   payment.

24                 Now the statute reads today "to get a false

25   or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government."

 1   My point is -- and the Rainwater case, Justice Scalia,

 2   that I think you may have been referring to says that --

 3   the government does not have to have a monetary loss for

 4   there to be a False Claims Act violation.                  However, for

 5   there to be a violation of (a)(2), the false record or

 6   statement that's presented, the false record or

 7   statement that's made, has to be made with the purpose

 8   of reaching Federal funds.           That's what the statute

 9   originally said.    That language was taken out in 1982.

10   We all seem to agree that the '82 recodification did not

11   change any of the meaning or purpose of the statute --

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   So your argument --

13   your understanding of the scope of the statute is

14   exactly the same if the words "by the government" were

15   replaced by "with Federal funds"?                 You think those

16   are -- you think the statute is exactly the same if it

17   said "with Federal funds" instead of "by the

18   government"?

19              MR. HELMER:          Yes, Your Honor.           I think

20   that's correct.    I think that --

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   So when the

22   government -- when the phrase "by the government" was

23   added -- was it in '86?

24              MR. HELMER:          Yes, Your Honor.

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   There were a lot of


                                        46

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   statutes that said "with Federal funds," right?

 2                 MR. HELMER:        There were.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So why did the

 4   Congress add the phrase "by the government" instead of

 5   "with Federal funds" if it meant the same thing?

 6                 MR. HELMER:        The legislative history is dark

 7   on that subject.     But I have two answers for you,

 8   Mr. Chief Justice.      First, if you look at the '82

 9   version of the statute, there were six liability

10   provisions set out.       A seventh was added in '86, (a)(7).

11   But of the first six that were added in '82, when they

12   broke this long sentence down into parts, every one of

13   those provisions except for (a)(2} dealt with either "by

14   the government" or "defrauding the government."                  (A)(7)

15   likewise has such similar language.

16                 My first point to you is that I believe that

17   when Congress amended this statute in '86 it wanted all

18   provisions to be consistent with each other in that

19   sense that we're talking about fraud on the government,

20   not fraud against private parties, fraud on the

21   government.

22                 The second response I would make to you,

23   Mr. Chief Justice, is that we don't read "by the

24   government" as meaning presented to the government or

25   even paid by the government.              We read "by the


                                         47
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   government" as indicating that this is a limitation on

 2   (a)(2), because without that language on (a)(2), if you

 3   read the definition of "claim," then any claim or

 4   private funds could be -- could have been covered by

 5   (a)(2).     By adding the words "by the government," the

 6   Congress has limited this to directing to Federal funds.

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Right.   So I guess I

 8   get back -- you read "by the government" as if it said

 9   "with Federal funds"?

10                 MR. HELMER:        I do, Your Honor.

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Suppose -- you just said to

12   Justice Scalia -- if you have one minute; I rather

13   missed that -- that your point was if you lose on that

14   point you just made and it isn't "with Federal funds"

15   and it is that the government has to pay the claim, you

16   still win.     That was your point to Justice Scalia, I

17   guess.

18                 MR. HELMER:        Yes.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, what was that

20   argument?     Because you said it wasn't in the brief, and

21   what is it?     How do you still win?

22                 MR. HELMER:        Well, I believe they -- that

23   was the first point that I was making to Justice Scalia.

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.

25                 MR. HELMER:        And my point there is that

 1   (a)(2) covers making a false record or statement to get

 2   a false claim paid or approved by the government.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes.

 4                MR. HELMER:       In this case, they were

 5   required -- Allison was required by its contract with

 6   Bath and the Navy to submit a certificate of conformance

 7   to Bath and the Navy to release the Gen-Set for

 8   installation into the destroyer.               Without that

 9   certificate of conformance -- and we spent 5 weeks in

10   front of a jury talking about why they were false, why

11   each of those were false -- without that certificate of

12   conformance, the Gen-Set could not have been released to

13   be installed in the ship and Allison could not have been

14   paid.   That's what section 6.1 of the contract provides.

15                JUSTICE ALITO:         The the certificate of

16   performance made its way to the Navy.                   That was required

17   by contract.   Why did you not introduce direct evidence

18   of that in your case?

19                MR. HELMER:       We did put all the certificates

20   of conformance that were given to Bath in the record of

21   this case.

22                And all of those by the terms of Allison's

23   contract with Bath had to be shown to the U.S. Navy

24   employee on site at the shipyard.                And that contract was

25   also admitted into evidence.

 1               But we did not --

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But that was only the

 3   contract.   You didn't show that in fact that had

 4   happened, that the certificates of conformance actually

 5   were shown to a naval officer?

 6               MR. HELMER:         No, ma'am, we did not have a

 7   witness who testified that this certificate was given to

 8   Ensign So-and-So.    But --

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:             And whose -- whose contract

10   required this?   It's a strange provision to be in the

11   contract between Allison and Bath.

12               MR. HELMER:         It -- you are correct, Your

13   Honor.   It was the contract between Bath and Allison

14   that I'm speaking about now that flowed -- that also

15   flowed down the U.S. Navy's requirements that these

16   Gen-Sets be -- be built rigidly to the specifications

17   set out by the Navy.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:             And that contract between

19   Allison and Bath said that this certificate from Allison

20   had to be presented to the Navy?

21               MR. HELMER:         Yes, Your Honor.         It had -- it

22   had to be shown to the Navy.             If you want to get paid,

23   you have to show it to the Navy, and then the Navy will

24   release the Gen-Set.       See they build these ships around

25   the Gen-Sets.    They are so huge that you don't install

 1   them on a destroyer; you build the destroyer up around

 2   it.   So before you can release those to the shipyard for

 3   construction, you had to have the certificates of

 4   conformance.

 5                JUSTICE SOUTER:           In the contract between the

 6   Navy and Bath, was there a provision that Allison's

 7   invoices would be shown to the Navy?                    In other words,

 8   was the parallel provision in the contract with the --

 9   with the general the same as the provision between the

10   general and the sub?

11                MR. HELMER:       Justice Souter, it was

12   different.   There is a provision I believe

13   Justice Ginsburg was referring to.                 You will find it at

14   page 415 of the Sixth Circuit's joint appendix.                   That

15   provision required that when Allison made a certificate

16   to get paid to the Navy -- I'm sorry, strike that --

17   when Bath made a certificate to the Navy to get paid, it

18   had to have available for the U.S. Navy all of the

19   underlying documentation.          All of the bills, the

20   invoices, and certifications had to be available to show

21   the Navy.

22                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Available but not

23   necessarily transmitted.

24                MR. HELMER:       Not necessarily stapled to the

25   invoice and given to the Navy, but they had to be


                                       51

 1   available.

 2                JUSTICE SOUTER:            But the contract between

 3   Bath and Allison says:        You give those to us, and we

 4   give them to the Navy.        It was specific in saying they

 5   go -- your invoices, your -- your certificates, go to

 6   the Navy?

 7                MR. HELMER:        It was specific in saying your

 8   certificate of conformance goes to the Navy.

 9                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.

10                MR. HELMER:        It did not say in the provision

11   that I have cited to the Court, your invoice.

12                JUSTICE SOUTER:            I understand that.

13                MR. HELMER:        And that was why I said,

14   Justice Alito, to the trial court, not to the jury, that

15   the invoices are irrelevant.             And I -- I didn't make

16   that up.    That comes out of the Bornstein opinion.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:            And Bath would have been in

18   breach of its contract with Allison unless it passed

19   these things on to the Navy?             That's why I say it's a

20   strange provision to be in the contract between Bath and

21   Allison.

22                MR. HELMER:        The certificate was required.

23   Your Honor, yes, that was required.                      The invoices had to

24   be available --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Allison could sue Bath for

 1   not passing the certificate on to the Navy?

 2                 MR. HELMER:       Well, I believe the way it

 3   reads, Allison is supposed to hand the certificate to

 4   the Navy employee at the shipyard.

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So if in fact, as

 6   you suggest, Allison submitted the certificate to the

 7   Navy person at the shipyard, then the question presented

 8   in this case is not in fact presented here?                  Because the

 9   question presented assumes that there had not been a

10   submission to the Federal Government of the false --

11   false claim.

12                 MR. HELMER:       I think that's fair to say,

13   Your Honor.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Did you make this point in

15   response to the petition for cert?

16                 MR. HELMER:       We opposed the petition for

17   cert on other grounds.        I did not cite the Court to the

18   joint appendix, the Sixth Circuit joint appendix at page

19   620.

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, you know, usually we

21   take a case to decide the question presented; and if

22   this question is really not before us you should have

23   told us that.

24                 MR. HELMER:       Well, my understanding, Justice

25   Scalia, is under your Rule 26.2 I am permitted to bring

 1   to the Court's attention additional information that was

 2   in the joint appendix below.             And that was what I was

 3   attempting to do in response to Justice Ginsburg's

 4   initial question that started the presentation today.

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            There has been a

 6   statement, in opposition to your position, that the way

 7   you read (a)(2) would render (a)(1) useless, That

 8   everything would fall within (a)(2).

 9                 Is there a distinction between what comes

10   under (a)(1) and (a)(2), in your view?

11                 MR. HELMER:       Yes, ma'am.              That is pointed

12   out in the solicitor's brief at pages 18 and 19, the

13   silver brief, the distinction between (a)(1) and (a)(2).

14   (A)(1) can be a claim that just says, pay me; there's

15   nothing false on its face, but it is impliedly false

16   because it -- it's not entitled to be paid because the

17   requirements haven't been met.

18                 (A)(2) would require a specific false

19   statement in that record or statement that's used.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Thank you.

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

22   Mr. Helmer.

23                 MR. HELMER:       Thank you, Your Honor.

 1              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 2                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 3              MR. OLSON:          Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 4              Let me address the -- what seems to be a

 5   controversy as to what was submitted to the Navy.

 6              In the first place, the invoices were not

 7   submitted to the Navy.         We know that.              That's the

 8   provision that I quoted before.

 9              The Plaintiffs in this case did not call a

10   single Navy witness.        They did not call the prime

11   contractor as a witness.           So we don't know what the Navy

12   received, or what the Navy did not receive.

13              With respect to the so-called certification,

14   that is addressed on pages 57a through 59a of the cert

15   petition appendix.      This is a district court decision,

16   three pages of discussion.

17              This was an argument that the relators came

18   up with relatively late when they couldn't explain why

19   they didn't have the invoices or what actually went to

20   the Navy, and they argued that Bath submitted a false

21   implied certification.

22              Then the district court goes through the

23   evidence on pages 57a to 59a and concludes at the top of

24   59a there is no evidence of a requiring -- of a

25   required, continuing certification with respect to


                                         55

 1   quality, which is the issue tried in this case.

 2               I don't have time to go through all of that

 3   or all of the evidence, but that is backing and filling.

 4               There -- and the question presented is a

 5   correct question presented.            As the relators put it to

 6   the -- to the district court, we don't have to do that.

 7   We are not going to show you --

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Let me ask you this

 9   question:   Suppose they had submitted the qualification

10   certificate, but not a claim?             Would they have had a

11   case, under your view?

12               MR. OLSON:       If it was -- if the

13   qualification -- if a -- if a --

14               JUSTICE STEVENS:            What I am really asking

15   is:   Do they still need a claim?

16               MR. OLSON:       I -- they -- there has to be --

17   no.   Under (a)(2), Justice Stevens, you could submit a

18   statement intending to get a false claim approved or

19   paid by the government.

20               Now, the government can't approve anything

21   if it's not actually submitted to it, or not intended to

22   be submitted to it.     That's in the same section of -- of

23   the statute.

24               Let me -- let me turn to the -- this is a

25   penal statute.   There is a punitive statute, as you


                                       56

 1   pointed out, in the Vermont versus Stevens case.

 2                 There is no meaningful limitation on what

 3   the government and the Respondents want in this case.

 4   The government has now come up with this limitation:

 5   Well, it must be really a government project.

 6                 Well, that isn't in the statute.              That's

 7   basically the same thing you unanimously rejected in the

 8   Tanner case.

 9                 The government said in its brief if the

10   government is the ultimate source of the funds.                  That

11   goes back to the example that the Chief Justice was

12   making.     There might be 15 different layers, the way

13   this government works.         Money is fungible.         It's

14   impossible to trace.

15                 This statute is intended to address claims

16   made, or statements made in connection with claims made,

17   to -- to commit to defraud the government, and defraud

18   the government irrespective of the definition of

19   "claim," which could have been put in section (a), but

20   was not put in section (a), the liability section.

21                 The Congress knows how to put those words in

22   statutes.     They were in the major fraud statute, the --

23   the case that this Court distinguished in Dixon, in --

24   in Tanner.     The Dixon case was money given -- paid to or

25   on behalf of the government.              There is language like


                                         57

 1   that throughout the congressional statutes.

 2                 We don't know in this case whether the

 3   government was defrauded, or was intended to be

 4   defrauded, because there is this big space between what

 5   went on between the subcontractors and the shipbuilders

 6   and what went on between the shipbuilders and the

 7   government.

 8                 There could have been all kinds of dialogue.

 9   There could have been disclosures.                  There might be

10   deviations from the specifications in any kind of

11   government contract.       But this statute has to have a

12   limitation point.

13                 And if you look at it from 1863 up to the

14   present, it is intended just as the Tanner case said.

15   And in Marcus versus Hess you said that the criminal

16   false claim statutes have to be construed identically

17   with the civil false claims provisions if they contain

18   identical language.      371 has the same language as the

19   False Claims Act's, and the Tanner case is dispositive.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

21   Mr. Olson.

22                 The case is submitted.
