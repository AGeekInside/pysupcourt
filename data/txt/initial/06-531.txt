 4   06-531, Sole versus Wyner.

 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF VIRGINIA A. SEITZ

 7                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 8               MS. SEITZ:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10               The court of appeals held that plaintiffs

11   who obtain a preliminary injunction are prevailing

12   parties entitled to fees, even though the district court

13   concluded that the State's nudity ban does not violate

14   the Constitution, that plaintiffs were not entitled to

15   any permanent relief, and that final judgment should be

16   entered against the plaintiffs.

17               This Court's cases have found plaintiffs to

18   be prevailing parties in only two situations, when they

19   win judgment on the merits or enter into a consent

20   decree.   And this Court has declined to confer

21   prevailing party status based on interim rulings in

22   ongoing litigation.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Ms. Seitz, I'd be curious

24   to get your reaction to one of the points made by

25   opposing counsel, which is that there were really sort


                                         3

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   of two different pieces of litigation at issue here,

 2   that it was an as-applied challenge that produced the

 3   preliminary injunction, and what was rejected in the

 4   final decision was a facial challenge.                   Is there

 5   anything to that?

 6               MS. SEITZ:        No, I don't think there is.           In

 7   the preliminary injunction, the district court predicted

 8   that it would find the nudity ban significantly

 9   infringed free expression and that the State had less

10   restrictive alternatives.           That's at page 18a and 19a.

11   In the summary judgment decision, the court held that

12   the nudity plan's effect on free impression was de

13   minimis and it had, that the State had no less

14   restrictive alternative.          So in both instances the

15   underlying legal claim was that as applied to nude

16   expression the nudity ban was unconstitutional.

17               JUSTICE SOUTER:              What do we make of what I

18   understand was the court's post hoc statement that what

19   was -- the reason for issuing the temporary injunction

20   was the perception that there was a content basis at

21   work?   And what do we make of it in light of the fact --

22   I think this is of record; you correct me if I'm wrong.

23   what do we make of that in light of the fact that I

24   believe it is in the record that I forget the

25   appropriate State official said, well, it's true we've


                                         4

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   let you do this in the past, but this is political or

 2   this looks political, which suggests that there was a

 3   content basis going on?

 4              What do we make of the court's statement and

 5   the record statement by the official in deciding whether

 6   there really was in effect a separate kind of order

 7   involved in the preliminary injunction from the order

 8   that was denied at the end of the case?

 9              MS. SEITZ:       There's a factual answer to that

10   and a legal answer, and I'll start with the legal

11   answer, which is that the preliminary injunction itself

12   states that it is assuming content --

13              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Oh, I know that.   I know

14   that.

15              MS. SEITZ:       And as a legal matter --

16              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Because that's why I asked,

17   what do we make of the court's statement subsequently?

18              MS. SEITZ:       I think we, as the court of

19   appeals did, have to disregard those statements because

20   under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,

21   the preliminary injunction itself is the operative

22   document, and the bases that it states for the issuance

23   of the preliminary injunction are the bases that must

24   govern both on judicial review of the injunction and as

25   a matter of notice to the parties of the operative


                                       5

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   effect and basis for the injunction.

 2                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Is that so when there is

 3   some evidence in the record that a content basis

 4   actually was the criterion?

 5                MS. SEITZ:      And that's the factual part of

 6   my response, which is that this testimony that was

 7   relied on which we quote in full in our reply brief, was

 8   testimony by the State, a State official who did not

 9   make the decision so was not actually aware of why the

10   decision was made, and was testimony only to the effect

11   that the demonstration envisioned on February 14th might

12   be different than her previous plays, because more

13   people might be expected.

14                Now the court drew from that telephonic

15   testimony a possibility that the reason for the State's

16   denial on February 14 was the content; but in fact,

17   although the court didn't recognize it, it also had

18   before it a decision by the State in 2000 denying her

19   permission to put on her play based on its decision to

20   enforce its nudity ban against her at that time.

21                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Now the 2001 order was it

22   -- was it?   She applied, I think it was in --

23                MS. SEITZ:      She wrote a letter in 2000

24   requesting permission to perform her play --

25                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yeah.


                                        6

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               MS. SEITZ:       Under the same terms that she

 2   had under the stipulated settlement from 1998.                 The

 3   State denied her request in a letter indicating that the

 4   nudity ban would be enforced against the play.

 5               JUSTICE SOUTER:             So the factual answer in

 6   effect is there isn't enough fact to support the

 7   distinction?

 8               MS. SEITZ:       And -- and I guess there's in

 9   addition a legal elaboration on that factual record,

10   which was this was all occurring in a preliminary

11   injunction hearing that took place 24 hours before the

12   demonstration, telephonic testimony of an ill-prepared

13   State witness.   It was never followed up, even though

14   that claim remained live through summary judgment,

15   because the plaintiffs continued to have a claim against

16   an individual defendant for damages.

17               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Yeah.      But when you got to

18   the summary judgment stage, the particular peace

19   demonstration performance was -- was behind them.                 So

20   they're, I'm not sure that it would have been expected

21   to be reinjected into the case.

22               MS. SEITZ:       The challenge continued because

23   there was a claim for individual damages from the park

24   manager.   So in order to determine that individual claim

25   for damages, of course, the plaintiffs could have put in


                                        7

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   evidence that, in fact, rather than just as a

 2   preliminary prediction, the injunction was issued to

 3   prevent content-based discrimination.

 4              JUSTICE SOUTER:             So it wasn't moot after the

 5   demonstration.

 6              MS. SEITZ:       That was not mooted out.

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 That's one of the

 8   things that concerns me.        I mean in many of these cases

 9   you have fairly elaborate proceedings over the

10   preliminary injunction and the event takes place.               I

11   would not want to get to a situation where people feel

12   the need to artificially keep a case alive simply to

13   ensure their entitlement to attorney's fees.               So how do

14   you protect against that?

15              MS. SEITZ:       We -- the purpose of the

16   attorney's fees provision is to encourage and reward

17   meritorious litigation.       And at the point at which you

18   only have a preliminary injunction, no matter how long

19   that preliminary injunction has been in effect, what you

20   have is a prediction of success on the merits, a

21   balancing of equitable factors that determine interim

22   fairness, but you do not have a decision that the

23   defendant has violated the Constitution or any Federal

24   law.

25              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But in, but in many cases


                                       8

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the case will become moot after a period of time and the

 2   Chief Justice and I have the same concern.                The question

 3   is directed to do we just keep this litigation alive for

 4   the -- for the ancillary issue of attorney's fees?

 5              MS. SEITZ:       There are significant

 6   consequences to a finding of liability.                And to

 7   conferring preliminary -- or fees for preliminary

 8   injunction when you do not have a final determination of

 9   violation by the State, you're essentially ordering the

10   State and local governments who have not been judged

11   violators of law or had a full or fair opportunity to

12   defend as a matter of law --

13              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, we're asking about

14   what rule you propose we adopt and the submission to you

15   is that if we have a rule there can never be attorneys

16   fees in this instance, that will then create pressure to

17   continue the litigation when it's for all practical

18   purposes of no real importance to the parties, other

19   than to just establish attorney's fees.                And that seems

20   a waste of resources.

21              MS. SEITZ:       And but the -- the situation --

22   that situation will also obtain if you confer attorney's

23   fees and prevailing party status on a plaintiff who only

24   has a preliminary injunction.

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But do we have to judge


                                       9

 1   all preliminary and judgments alike?                      I mean, in some

 2   cases, the preliminary injunction is the thing.                      For

 3   example, suppose in this case, the demonstrators had

 4   said yeah, we went in with a -- with a broad challenge

 5   but we knew all we wanted was that peace demonstration,

 6   and we got it; so we're -- that's enough.                      We're not

 7   going to fight on.

 8               MS. SEITZ:         The fact that a plaintiff gets

 9   his or her way temporarily based on a preliminary

10   junction does not mean that the defendant has violated

11   that plaintiff's constitutional rights or that that

12   would be the resolution of the --

13               JUSTICE BREYER:              Who -- who -- where does it

14   say you have to have done that?                My statute here says in

15   any action to enforce a provision of 1983 -- the TRO or

16   whatever was such an action.              It says the court in its

17   discretion may allow the prevailing party an attorneys'

18   fee.   Well, did they prevail fail or not?                    They got what

19   they wanted.     And it was such an action.                  Doesn't say

20   anything about whether you have been declared horrible

21   or wonderful or violator or not a violator.                     It says did

22   they get what they want in the action?                     Answer, yes.

23   End of matter.

24               Now what's wrong with reading it that way?

25               MS. SEITZ:         To prevail you must prevail on a

 1   legal claim.

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:             Yeah, they got the legal

 3   claim.   The legal claim is we want to have our

 4   demonstration on February 14; we have a right to do it

 5   and therefore issue an order.              You said no, don't issue

 6   the order, because they don't.               And therefore, they won.

 7               MS. SEITZ:        Respectfully, that's not a legal

 8   claim.

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:             It is not?

10               MS. SEITZ:        The underlying legal claim is

11   that the State's denial of the permit was

12   unconstitutional.

13               JUSTICE BREYER:             Yeah.       But what about the

14   legal claim we are under the law entitled to a

15   preliminary injunction.

16               MS. SEITZ:        That is a type of relief you are

17   seeking but it's based on an underlying legal claim.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:             It is not a determination,

19   is it, that they have a right to hold a demonstration?

20               MS. SEITZ:        It is --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:             It is just a determination

22   that we don't know at this point enough to say that you

23   don't have a right.

24               MS. SEITZ:        It is a product of an equitable

25   balancing that determines interim fairness --

 1              JUSTICE BREYER:            Well I thought, where it

 2   say that in the statute that you have to have that

 3   particular kind of a claim?

 4              MS. SEITZ:       I think this Court's cases have

 5   interpreted the word prevail and prevailing parties to

 6   mean you must prevail on the merits of a legal claim.

 7   The only instance in which that is not true is in a

 8   consent decree scenario and in a consent decree what you

 9   have is a defendant assuming legal responsibility for

10   providing relief on the merits that resolves a claim.

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So what do you do in

12   a situation of mootness where there's -- you know,

13   they'd be happy to pursue the claim to establish that

14   they prevail on a permanent junction as well as a

15   preliminary one, but the case has become moot.                   Are they

16   automatically disentitled to attorneys' fees in that

17   case?

18              MS. SEITZ:       A claim that is never resolved

19   cannot be the basis of prevailing party status.                   And

20   that's what your hypothetical poses.                   And I also think

21   it's not correct to say there is no point in continuing

22   with litigation in that setting.              In a private attorney

23   general setting, there is a value to having at the end

24   of litigation a decision --

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, there may be a

 1   pint to pursuing it but I'm not sure it's one that the

 2   locality governments -- I mean if you ask them the

 3   question, would you rather be liable for attorney's fees

 4   where you lose in a preliminary injunction but then the

 5   case becomes moot, or would you rather have to face

 6   individual officer liability to prevent the case from

 7   becoming moot?   Or would you rather face ongoing

 8   litigation to prevent the case from becoming moot

 9   because there's too much invested in the fees -- they

10   might choose the former.

11              MS. SEITZ:        Well in this case, of course,

12   the State officials decided to defend the

13   constitutionality of their nudity ban to the end.                     It

14   was important to them.

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, the plaintiffs

16   decided to challenge it to the end.                     But I'm suggesting

17   that if they know they might -- it might result in a

18   loss of attorneys fees, when all they really wanted was

19   a particular demonstration, others might pursue it

20   differently.

21              MS. SEITZ:        There are significant

22   countervailing considerations, and one is that under the

23   rule you're proposing, state and local governments would

24   be fearful about enforcing perfectly valid laws in

25   emergency situations for fear of being penalized with

 1   fees.     Then they have no fair chance --

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, you are saying the

 3   Chief Justice is proposing a rule.                   I think he was

 4   asking you -- you want to just give us all or nothing.

 5   And we're suggesting that it just doesn't make systemic

 6   good sense to insist that every preliminary injunction

 7   be carried through to a final adjudication for

 8   attorney's fees.     And we are asking is there some midway

 9   ground.    And you, you've so far -- you can structure the

10   argument the way you want, but you so far are -- in

11   effect telling me absolutely not.

12                 MS. SEITZ:       I -- I think that because of the

13   rule I distill from this Court's case which is that you

14   can't prevail on a claim that's not decided, it's hard

15   for me to see what the middle ground would be.                  We do of

16   course have the alternative ground for decision in this

17   case which is that a claim, a preliminary junction

18   that's issued in ongoing litigation whose prediction on

19   the merits is later essentially proven to be false by

20   subsequent litigation, can't be the basis for prevailing

21   party --

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:            So what do you think, when

23   this was enacted, to make up an example that it is as

24   horrifying as I can think, where the Ku Klux Klan was

25   riding in the South, and a group of civil rights

 1   demonstrators wanted to make certain they could have

 2   their demonstration outside the jail and they go to the

 3   judge and says the sheriff is involved in this, the

 4   whole town is; we want an injunction tomorrow.

 5   Tomorrow.     Right now.     So -- and we don't really care

 6   that much about the end of it, but we'll -- we'll go

 7   ahead and litigate it if you want.                   Now they get their

 8   injunction.     They have the demonstration; it's over.                   I

 9   would have thought if there was a situation for which

10   1983 was written, it's that one.

11                 MS. SEITZ:       And if in fact it is clear that

12   there is no issue law in that setting.

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Oh, there is.      The other

14   side has a lot of arguments.              And they each have

15   arguments.    There are plenty of issues of law.

16                 MS. SEITZ:       Then you just articulated why

17   that plaintiff should not be considered a prevailing

18   party without taking the position that that is capable

19   of repetition, but evading review situation, arguing

20   that in effect the judgment is based totally on law and

21   converting it essentially to a judgment on the merits,

22   or otherwise coming to a final judgment on a claim, so

23   that the plaintiff would have --

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But why should a

25   plaintiff do that when the plaintiff's position is we

 1   got precisely what we wanted; this is not going to be --

 2   this is a one-time only demonstration.                    We're not going

 3   to repeat this.

 4                Why force litigation, especially when we can

 5   say in this case, you lost on the merits?                    The judge

 6   made a prediction.      Turned out that -- that that was

 7   wrong.

 8                MS. SEITZ:        To -- to impose attorney's fees

 9   on a defendant, it's not simply about what the plaintiff

10   gets, whether the plaintiff gets what he wants, but it

11   is also about what the justification is for forcing the

12   state and local government to pay fees.

13                And the purpose of the Civil Rights Act is

14   to impose such fees against violators of civil rights

15   and for the benefit of victims of similar rights

16   violation, and not simply on those whom it is predicted

17   will have a substantial likelihood of success on the

18   merits.

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              So you get a case that

20   involves a student.       And -- and something like the

21   DeFunis case.     The student is admitted to the law school

22   event.    They have much controversy over this affirmative

23   action program.     The student graduates.                And -- but the

24   student has prevailed up until that time.

25                MS. SEITZ:        I don't believe the student has


                                         16
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   prevailed within the meaning of Section 19(a).                     The

 2   student has been predicted to be likely to prevail and

 3   has received an interim fairness -- an interim

 4   adjustment based on considerations of fairness.

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But can't fight on

 6   because first, the student had gotten everything that he

 7   wanted and the case is moot.             The student has graduated.

 8                MS. SEITZ:       In that situation, I think the

 9   benefit is capable of repetition for debating review or

10   of utilizing the class action --

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             On if you had a class

12   action.    He had a single action, and he's graduated.

13                MS. SEITZ:       But there are tools a plaintiff

14   can use to prevent this kind of case from becoming moot

15   where there is an important need to have an issue

16   decided.

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Apart from the class

18   action, what -- what else is there?

19                MS. SEITZ:       65(a)(3) which allows

20   consolidation of a merits determination.

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Oh.      Yeah.

22                MS. SEITZ:       I reserve the reminder of my

23   time?

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, I mean, what if --

25   what if there's nothing else he can do?                     What -- what

 1   horrible does he face?        He faces a horrible of having to

 2   pay for his own litigation, just like the rest of us do.

 3              I mean this is an extraordinary benefit

 4   we're talking about here, getting -- getting your

 5   attorney's fees paid.       I -- it doesn't seem to me that

 6   we're casting this, this person into the underworld.

 7              MS. SEITZ:         And there's no basis for

 8   awarding fees against the innocent state and local

 9   government not determined to have committed a violation.

10   May I reserve the balance?

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, Counsel.

12              We'll hear from Ms. Millett.                   Ms. Millett.

13           ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT,

14                ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,

15           AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONERS

16              MS. MILLETT:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

17   please the Court.

18              This Court has held repeatedly that

19   liability for attorney's fees and liability for

20   violation of Federal law go hand in hand.                  A preliminary

21   injunction does not determine that there has been a

22   violation of Federal law.

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Is it -- can a

 2   preliminary injunction never be the basis for an award

 3   of attorney's fees?

 4                 MS. MILLETT:           I won't say never in this

 5   narrow circumstance.          And that is when, when a

 6   preliminary injunction results in a definitive and

 7   determinative ruling of law such as Thornburgh versus

 8   Obstetricians -- College of Obstetricians and

 9   Gynecologists, or the steel mill seizure case from this

10   Court.   It came up on a preliminary injunction but this

11   Court made a dispositive and controlling ruling of

12   constitutional law.         And assuming that that declaration

13   is then followed up by a change in behavior by the

14   defendant compelled as result of the ruling, that would

15   be enough.    But --

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:              Excuse me.       How can that

17   be, that a preliminary injunction resolves a dispositive

18   question of law?    Does that happen?

19                 MS. MILLETT:           Well it happened -- it

20   happened in this Court and -- and -- and there were

21   dissenters.    But there -- it happened in this Court's

22   case in the Thornburgh case.                It came up on a

23   preliminary junction.          This Court determined there were

24   no disputed questions of fact and it was only a contest

25   of law what the Court said is that when they have done

 1   that we can make dispositive ruling of law.              But I think

 2   that's an unusual situation and what's critical is that

 3   when --

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           But it wasn't the issuance

 5   of the preliminary injunction that resolved it, it was

 6   the appeal to this Court where we -- we resolved a

 7   question of law.

 8                 MS. MILLETT:        This Court resolved a question

 9   of law on the merits.       The debate in that opinion

10   between the majority and the dissents was that the --

11   the dissent said majority should only decide whether it

12   was an abuse of discretion to issue the preliminary

13   injunction.

14                 And, I mean -- it, it, it can become sort of

15   the same thing if an error in law is necessarily an

16   abuse of discretion, but when -- when a superior court's

17   made a definitive --

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:           What is the law in respect

19   to this, which is right on the point you're arguing,

20   that two parties have this kind of suit and the

21   government party -- they settle it, and giving

22   everything that the plaintiff conceivably wants, but at

23   the end they say:    We don't admit we violated the law.

24   Can you get attorney's fees there or not.

25                 MS. MILLE TT:         If it's a consent decree.

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:           It's a consent decree, but

 2   no admission of a violation of law.

 3                MS. MILLE TT:         No, that's right.         This

 4   Court, while repeatedly stating, including unanimously

 5   just two years ago, that the central justification for

 6   attorney's fees is that the defendant is a violator of

 7   Federal law, has found that it will also permit

 8   attorney's fees in the consent decree situation, but

 9   that's because there you have a defendant who is not

10   fighting and continuing to resist any form of final

11   relief, has instead agreed to provide final relief that

12   runs to a plaintiff, in favor of a plaintiff, and that

13   advances the purpose of Federal law.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I have never

15   understood why that's an issue.              Can't the parties -- it

16   seems to me an exception that isn't consistent with the

17   theory.   Why can't the parties just agree on attorney's

18   fees in the settlement agreement and the consent decree

19   and then it wouldn't have to be an issue?

20                MS. MILLETT:        I think, I think that in

21   reality certainly a party can say, I'm not entering into

22   a consent decree if we're not going to resolve

23   attorney's fees now or if we're going to have a fight

24   over them.   So they certainly have that power because

25   it's largely a contract, although one enforced by


                                       21
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   courts.    I'm only trying to be candid with this Court's

 2   precedent, which is also recognized in Mayer versus

 3   Gagne.    For some reason, maybe they reserved the

 4   question there to be disputed in court whether you'd be

 5   responsible for attorney's fees.

 6                But I do think That's much more of a side

 7   show because that can all be dealt with through the

 8   contract elements of the consent agree.                    And really what

 9   you're talking about when a court is coercively imposing

10   attorney's fees on a defendant is that the defendant has

11   a right to not pay those unless they have been found to

12   be a violator of Federal law or have agreed to through

13   contract to deal with that issue.

14                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay, but the argument is

15   undercut, as you yourself say, by the settlement rule.

16   Don't we have the settlement rule simply because we want

17   to promote settlements?         We don't want litigation to go

18   on and on and on simply because somebody wants to

19   establish a right to attorney's fees.                    And doesn't that

20   same reasoning apply here when there is a preliminary

21   injunction and that's all the person wants.                    By the same

22   reasoning that we accept a settlement, why shouldn't we

23   accept a preliminary injunction as being a sufficient

24   determination of rights to justify fees because we don't

25   want it to go on and on and on when nobody has any issue

 1   of substance involved, but is just litigating for the

 2   sake of establishing a right to fees later?

 3              MS. MILLETT:            I have three answers to that.

 4   First of all, there are two parties here.                      The defendant

 5   has a right not to be assessed attorney's fees, which

 6   are a form of final relief not interim relief, without a

 7   final decision that they violated on the merits.

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:               But the only attorney's

 9   fees that would be assessed would be attorney's fees

10   attributable to the preliminary injunction.

11              MS. MILLETT:            That's right, but they have a

12   right not to pay anything if they haven't done anything

13   wrong.

14              JUSTICE SOUTER:               They have been found

15   subject to a preliminary injunction.                      The playing field

16   is no longer even.

17              MS. MILLETT:            They haven't been found to be

18   -- there may be a Presumption or a substantial

19   likelihood they're going to lose, but that doesn't

20   always come out.     And there's not even always a

21   substantial likelihood --

22              JUSTICE SCALIA:               The point is you wouldn't

23   mind putting that on a resume, that you have been

24   subjected to a preliminary injunction.

25              MS. MILLETT:            No --

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:            It's not a black mark on

 2   your name, is it?

 3                MS. MILLETT:         No.

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:            You haven't violated any

 5   Federal law.

 6                MS. MILLETT:         This is a case in point.

 7                JUSTICE SOUTER:            But it does mean, it does

 8   mean that somebody with a burden to establish an

 9   entitlement to the injunction has carried the burden.

10                MS. MILLETT:         Well, the test is the

11   prevailing party, not the substantially likely to

12   prevail party.   And the other reason --

13                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Then let's not have it in

14   the settlement case.

15                MS. MILLETT:         Well, again settlements can be

16   dealt with through the settlement, as part of the

17   settlement process.      But I think --

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:            They are voluntary, these

19   settlements, aren't they?           So you could at least say

20   that the innocent person who gets stuck with attorney's

21   fees for settling gets what he asked for, right?             It's

22   voluntary.

23                MS. MILLETT:         Well, that's what I tried to

24   explain to Justice Breyer.

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:            That may be, but that's not

 1   the way the statute is written.

 2                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Would this case be

 3   different if the defendant had consented to the entry of

 4   a preliminary injunction?

 5                 MS. MILLETT:        No, I don't think so, and I

 6   don't think courts as a matter of judicial economy want

 7   to tell the government every time we agree not to

 8   oppose, to stay the removal of an alien, that we somehow

 9   would get a bill.

10                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           So if this had been, if

11   they had entered into a consent decree covering just the

12   one event on the front burner, that would have been?

13                 MS. MILLETT:        A consent decree is a final

14   resolution of a claim that legally obligates the

15   defendant, final relief that runs in favor of the

16   plaintiff.

17                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           But if they consented to

18   the entry of a preliminary injunction, why wouldn't that

19   be equally binding?

20                 MS. MILLETT:        Because it is not a final

21   resolution.    Preliminary injunctions are important.

22   They're of value to the parties.                But there's a

23   trade-off in getting it.          The reason courts can give

24   them is they aren't committed to final relief.                  They

25   aren't committed to final obligation, and they can

 1   decide when --

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Well, they were able to go

 3   ahead with their one demonstration that precipitated the

 4   litigation, and they would have been able to do it the

 5   same way if they had a consent decree instead of having

 6   the other side not fight very vigorously in opposition

 7   to the preliminary.

 8              MS. MILLETT:         The defendant who'S been fully

 9   vindicated at the end of the case shouldn't have to

10   write checks to two attorneys instead of just their own.

11   There's a fundamental fairness element here.

12              But also on the judicial economy --

13              JUSTICE STEVENS:            But then why isn't the

14   attorney -- if there were a consent decree -- I don't

15   understand the difference.

16              MS. MILLETT:         Because the defendant's in the

17   control of the fairness issue in the consent decree and

18   is not in this situation.

19              But the other situation, concern, is concern

20   about judicial economy.        And there's arguments in the

21   amicus briefs on the other side that preliminary

22   injunctions are common.        But remember, this is -- the

23   central justification is that the plaintiff is a private

24   attorney general who doesn't just do what they want to

25   do, but either resolves the issue of law or obtains

 2   utility to the community at large.                 Contrary to --

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            We have when election

 4   season comes many, many requests for injunctions, and

 5   after the election is over the case just goes away.

 6   Nobody is interested.

 7               MS. MILLETT:         That is not --

 8               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Under your position, all

 9   of these matters must be contested until final judgment

10   before attorney's fees are available.

11               MS. MILLETT:         That is not the United States

12   Government's experience when it's been involved in a lot

13   of voting cases.   Lots of them get fought until the end,

14   and this Court's decision in Brown versus Choate

15   recognizes these are capable of repetition, yet evading

16   review.   Now, if the private plaintiff doesn't want to

17   do the work of a private attorney general, that's their

18   choice.   No one says you have to stay.                 It's just, if

19   you want attorney's fees, you have to accept a

20   preliminary injunction for what it is.                  It's very

21   beneficial, but it is not a resolution on the merits

22   that obligates the defendant to provide a form of final

23   relief, not interim relief, to you.

24               And this Court itself has expressed

25   significant concerns about having voting cases being run

 1   up on preliminary injunctions at the last minute and the

 2   impact that can have on voting, and we shouldn't

 3   encourage that.

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Ms. Millett, did I

 5   hear your legal test a while ago is an enduring change

 6   in the defendant's behavior?           Is that your standard?

 7              MS. MILLETT:         Enduring more in -- not in the

 8   transient sense of preliminary injunction.                    Obviously,

 9   things change on the outside world.                    But in the form of

10   final relief and permanent relief, and that's what this

11   Court's cases have said time and again.                   Not only must

12   the defendant be a violator of Federal law, but in

13   Ferrari, in Texas Teachers versus Darwin, in Hanrahan

14   and Hewitt, the Court has made clear that it is final, a

15   resolution of a dispute, a final judgment, the settling

16   of a problem that makes someone a prevailing party.                   And

17   "prevailing party," as this Court explained in

18   Buckhannon, is a term of art.            As we say on pages 11 to

19   12 of our brief, "That term of art, as defined in the

20   relevant dictionaries at the time, was not just that you

21   won something, but that you won at the end of the suit."

22              And that's a question of basic fundamental

23   fairness to plaintiffs.       Remember, there's going to be

24   countervailing judicial economy concerns.                   If you tell

25   governmental entities that they're going to have to

 8              ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH M. GALANTER

 9                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

10              MR. GALANTER:            Mr. Chief Justice and may it

11   please the Court:

12              Respondents went into Federal court because

13   State officials told them their protest would be illegal

14   and they left Federal court with a preliminary

15   injunction that prohibited State interference with their

16   protest.

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   No, no.   They left

18   Federal court having lost on the permanent injunction.

19              MR. GALANTER:            Well, Your Honor, 20-some

20   months later they lost on another component of their

21   case, where they were seeking permanent relief to enjoin

22   the facial applicability of the regulations.

23              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Their legal, their

24   legal claim was that these regulations were invalid

25   under the First Amendment.           And they lost on that legal

 1   claim.

 2                 MR. GALANTER:         At the end of the case, Your

 3   Honor, yes.    But at the preliminary injunction stage,

 4   one -- their claim for relief was a violation of the

 5   First Amendment and there was evidence at the

 6   preliminary injunction stage that --

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, they succeeded

 8   in filing their complaint as well, but they don't get

 9   attorney's fees for that, because they were successful

10   at the filing complaint stage.

11                 MR. GALANTER:         That's true, Your Honor.          But

12   what they obtained on February 13, 2003, was the relief

13   they sought.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           What if they got a TRO

15   instead of a preliminary injunction?

16                 MR. GALANTER:         We're not suggesting that

17   TROs --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I know you aren't.      Why

19   not?

20                 MR. GALANTER:         Well, there are structural

21   differences between the two.

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           What are the two?      I mean,

23   they prevailed.    They have a TRO here, something of

24   value.

25                 MR. GALANTER:         There was not the adversaries

 1   that exists in a preliminary injunction.                  And I think

 2   the distinction --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But it's just prevails.        If

 4   you think "prevails" means you come out of there with

 5   anything that's worth something that has a contempt

 6   citation behind it, I don't see why a TRO wouldn't

 7   qualify.

 8                 MR. GALANTER:          We're not suggesting that as

 9   the basic rule.    What we are suggesting is that if you

10   obtain a preliminary injunction, in part because

11   Congress recognized the difference between TROs and

12   preliminary injunctions and placed preliminary

13   injunctions and permanent injunctions together as the

14   kinds of orders that had --

15                 JUSTICE ALITO:          What if you get a

16   preliminary injunction and then at the permanent

17   injunction stage the basis for the preliminary

18   injunction is reversed.          Let's say the preliminary

19   injunction here was based on the ground that the

20   decision was content-based, a factual decision, and at

21   the permanent injunction stage the court finds that it

22   was not content-based.

23                 MR. GALANTER:          Then we would not be

24   prevailing.    But I have to point out the district court

25   in this case expressed --

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Even though you got what

 2   you wanted?     You got to put on the show.

 3                 I thought that at the end of the line, the

 4   judge said your First Amendment rights have not been

 5   violated, the nudity ordnance can be enforced.               If you

 6   had come back again, say the next week, and said, we

 7   want to do another peace symbol, after the court has

 8   ruled on the permanent junction and you lost, you

 9   certainly couldn't prevail when you're coming back with

10   another as-applied, when the court has said this

11   ordnance is good and doesn't violate the First

12   Amendment.

13                 That's correct.            But if there were an

14   intervening fact, if they permitted a performance of

15   "Hair" and then said, but we'll enforce the nudity

16   prohibition against your protest, then we would be able

17   to come back.

18                 The final judgment in this case does not

19   preclude future as-applied challenges, either

20   content-based or arbitrary, and the district court

21   recognized that when it made very clear that it did not

22   reverse or repudiate its preliminary injunction ruling

23   simply because we lost the permanent junction.

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought this court

25   said, and correct me if I'm wrong, that you wanted to

 1   put on a demonstration that would be like the plays,

 2   that would be hidden from public view because you have a

 3   curtain or whatever around it.               And then the judge said,

 4   oh no, that's not what they wanted, they didn't want it

 5   to be hidden from you view, they wanted people to see

 6   their demonstration, so if that's what they want to do,

 7   they don't have any First Amendment protection.

 8               MR. GALANTER:           That is what was at the end.

 9   I would just point out that at the preliminary

10   injunction stage, you have to remember Ms. Weyer had

11   been permitted to put on her play, not hiding it,

12   several years before.       There was testimony suggesting

13   that one of the differences in the result, the refusal

14   to allow the anti-war protest, was because it was an

15   anti-war protest.    And the district court makes it

16   clear, in our brief in opposition appendix at page 4a.

17   He says:   "The court did not revisit or reverse its

18   earlier decision regarding the same legal issue.

19               But I think all this just goes to the point

20   for that this case presents some interesting issues, but

21   that the per se rule that the Petitioners press, that

22   you can never get --

23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Let's stay with this case

24   because your interest is in getting fees in this case.

 1   you won at the end of the line.                Certainly you would be

 2   prevailing throughout, right?

 3                 MR. GALANTER:          We would obviously be a

 4   prevailing party.     But under Hens ley --

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Even though you lost on

 6   the preliminary injunction?

 7                 MR. GALANTER:          Yes.      Under Hensley versus

 8   Eckert, this Court has made clear you can win on some

 9   claims, lose in others.

10                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            But you would get

11   attorney's fees for the preliminary injunction work,

12   even though you lost on that?

13                 MR. GALANTER:          We would get attorney's fees

14   for the reasonable work that ended up leading to the

15   success.     District courts have for decades now parsed

16   through these legal records, subject to review by the

17   court of appeals.

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That parsing, is there

19   any doubt that if you won on the main, in the main bout,

20   that you would get your fees for your entire

21   representation?

22                 MR. GALANTER:          Yes, there is doubt, Your

23   Honor.     The court does look for whether these fees are

24   reasonable.

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Not that.     But would you

 1   not get -- would the judge say you don't get a penny for

 2   the effort you made to achieve the preliminary

 3   injunction because you lost, you lost it, even though in

 4   hindsight I could see that that was the wrong decision,

 5   you should have had it?

 6                MR. GALANTER:          Well, Your Honor, under

 7   Hensley you look to see whether they're related or

 8   unrelated claims.    This Court has adopted --

 9                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             They're obviously

10   related.    It's the same thing.             I need -- I have a short

11   time to answer the preliminary injunction.               The judge

12   said:   You haven't shown probability of success on the

13   merits, or denies it.       You win.          I thought that there

14   wasn't any doubt that you could get your fees for the

15   successful result from the time you filed the complaint

16   until the final judgment.

17                MR. GALANTER:          We would hope a court would

18   find that an as-applied challenge and a facial challenge

19   were sufficiently related that we'd be entitled to fees

20   for both.   But what I have to stress --

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Even though you lost on the

22   preliminary injunction?         The fees that you reasonably

23   expended in seeking a preliminary injunction, even

24   though you lost, you'd be able to charge to the other

25   side?

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes or no?          I think you can

 3   answer yes or no.

 4                 MR. GALANTER:         Yes.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Okay.

 6                 MR. GALANTER:         But I would like to caution

 7   that that would be eligible for fees, but the court

 8   would go through it and say how much of this were rated

 9   to your final win, was it reasonable.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           No.     No.      No.   How much of

11   it related to the preliminary -- you mean anything that

12   related only to the preliminary injunction you would be

13   denied?

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                All the work you did

15   to show irreparable harm, balance of the equities, not

16   on the merits, you're saying that's off the table?

17                 MR. GALANTER:         Well, it -- no, Your Honor,

18   because those very things are also needed at a permanent

19   injunction.

20                 JUSTICE ALITO:         But you've got five hours

21   billed -- you bill for five hours to write the brief

22   that you submit at the preliminary injunction stage.

23   You could get those fees later if you won at the

24   permanent injunction stage, could you not?

25                 MR. GALANTER:         Probably.            And we certainly

 1   would get the money we did for writing the complaint.

 2   And one of our counts for the complaint here was exactly

 3   for the preliminary injunction that we obtained.

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel, your

 5   approach, just as there are problems from the judicial

 6   economy perspective with your friend's approach, but

 7   doesn't your approach require the States to fight tooth

 8   and nail on the preliminary injunction because they're

 9   running the risk if they lose there, they're going to

10   pay fees even if they prevail later?                    As opposed to, as

11   is often the case, they might say, you know, we consent

12   to the entry of the preliminary injunction or we

13   don't -- you know, we're going to save our energy.

14   Doesn't it require them to fight every possible stage,

15   including appeal and so on?

16               MR. GALANTER:          Well, two things, Your Honor.

17   As I think I made clear to Justice Alito, if the

18   decision is reversed or repudiated by the district

19   court, there would now -- we would not be prevailing

20   parties.   We would simply have gotten this benefit.                   But

21   --

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't know what you mean,

23   if the decision on what?         On the preliminary injunction?

24               MR. GALANTER:          Yes.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is repudiated by the

 1   district -- how is it repudiated?                    What do you envision?

 2                 MR. GALANTER:            Well, in the hypothetical

 3   where the same facts, the same law, and the district

 4   court says I was wrong, that would be the kind of

 5   repudiation.

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:              In a later case, you mean?

 7                 MR. GALANTER:            In the course of the

 8   proceedings in the same case, Your Honor.                     But --

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, he doesn't

10   have to say he's wrong.            What often happens is as it is

11   here, he say's I've got 24 hours, I don't have a brief

12   from the other side, I kind of make the best guess I

13   can.   And then later on after an adversary presentation

14   and an evidentiary hearing, he issues a different

15   ruling.     As here, he doesn't have to say I was wrong on

16   my 24-hour off-the-cuff guess.                  It's just that I'm

17   better informed.       Is that repudiation or not?

18                 MR. GALANTER:            No, Your Honor, it's not.

19   And here, in fact he said the opposite.                     He said I

20   wasn't wrong, these were based on different legal

21   theories.     And --

22                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Where -- can you -- I

23   thought what he said was -- I thought they wanted a

24   demonstration that was going to be secure from public

25   view, and instead I understand now that's not -- that

 1   wasn't what they wanted from the start.

 2               So on the premise on which I was operating,

 3   I was right, that they were going to do it just like the

 4   plays.   But what they really planned to do, and did do,

 5   I was wrong because those facts were not before me.              Had

 6   those facts been before me, they would have lost on the

 7   preliminary injunction.

 8               MR. GALANTER:          I don't believe that that's

 9   the fairest reading of the district court's subsequent

10   orders in this case.      What the district court made clear

11   was that his as-applied holding, that the plays and the

12   war protests were being treated differently.            Remember

13   that it's --

14               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Yes, but assume the

15   district court thought he was right at the preliminary

16   injunction, and ruled otherwise at the permanent

17   junction.   But what if the court of appeals when it

18   reviews the fee application, thinks he was wrong both

19   times?

20               MR. GALANTER:          Well, Your Honor, we would

21   suggest that the person in the best position to

22   understand what the district court was doing --

23               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Is the district court.

24               MR. GALANTER:          Yes, Your Honor.

25               JUSTICE STEVENS:            But maybe the court of

 1   appeals is in the best position to determine whether

 2   they made an error of law or not.

 3               MR. GALANTER:          Yes.      And obviously they

 4   review errors of law, questions of law --

 5               JUSTICE STEVENS:            And if they think he made

 6   an error of law, what should they do?

 7               MR. GALANTER:          If he had made an error of

 8   law in the preliminary injunction ruling that, on

 9   de novo review, and reversed, then --

10               JUSTICE STEVENS:            No, there's no reverse.

11   It's too late.   They've had the demonstration so it's

12   all over.   But in reviewing the fee application, the

13   court of appeals concludes that the district judge --

14   the decision represented an incorrect premise of law and

15   therefore, he did make an error.               Would that control or

16   would the district judge's view of the validity of his

17   own decision control?

18               MR. GALANTER:          We would suggest the latter,

19   Your Honor, in part to avoid the fees on fees litigation

20   problems.   I mean, other than the per se rule of --

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            In other words, to avoid

22   fees on fees, we do something that's wrong?

23               MR. GALANTER:          No, Your Honor.       It's not

24   wrong.   It's consistent with the text and the policies

25   underlying --

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:             I thought that it -- am I

 2   wrong about that?    I thought that if, A, he goes in, he

 3   gets a preliminary injunction, he says the law is da,

 4   da, da, the judge says you're right, that's what it is,

 5   preliminary injunction.         And now it's continued up on

 6   appeal, the appellate court says you're wrong about the

 7   law.   You got it, you had the event, but you're

 8   absolutely wrong, the law did not support you.                      I

 9   thought under those circumstances you were not

10   prevailing and you couldn't get it.                      Is that the law or

11   not?

12               MR. GALANTER:           It is the law, Your Honor.

13   What I'm suggesting, though, is that --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I thought the hypothetical

15   was different, was, the case proceeds to final judgment

16   on the merits; and at that point -- okay -- at that

17   point, the issue of whether the preliminary injunction

18   was valid or not comes up, not in the direct appeal from

19   the preliminary injunction.

20               MR. GALANTER:           I --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Assume you win on the

22   merits.

23               JUSTICE STEVENS:             It's a direct appeal on

24   the fee issue.

25               MR. GALANTER:           Yes, Your Honor.             What my --

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   if I may, I agree with Justice Breyer's hypothetical

 2   that if you're appealing the merits and the court of

 3   appeals says something which shows that the -- the

 4   preliminary injunction should not have been issued,

 5   we're not a prevailing party.               I agree with

 6   Justice Scalia that if you're appealing from the

 7   preliminary injunction and the court of appeals

 8   reverses, then you're not the prevailing party.                 But

 9   Justice Stevens, what I would suggest to you and to

10   Justice Kennedy was, we shouldn't be adjudicating

11   whether the preliminary injunction was correctly entered

12   at the fees stage.      If there is --

13               JUSTICE BREYER:              Is there any authority for

14   that?   Because it does seem to me wrong, that where a

15   person has got a preliminary injunction and it's legally

16   unsupportable, and then he gets the fee but then they

17   appeal that and the court of appeals determines it's

18   legally unsupportable, he never should have gotten it,

19   I'd be surprised if there is a case that awards the fee

20   in those circumstances, but maybe there is.                What is it?

21               MR. GALANTER:            Well, I mean, the courts of

22   appeals have adopted different standards.                 I can't point

23   to one --

24               JUSTICE BREYER:              Is there any case you can

25   think of that under those circumstances let's him have

 1   the attorney's fees?

 2                MR. GALANTER:         I can't point to one.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:           No, I would be surprised.

 4                MR. GALANTER:         But the --

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:           The other thing that I

 6   wonder about this case is, are you the prevailing party?

 7   And the reason I ask that is because when I look through

 8   the record it seems to me your clients are very

 9   interesting.   They have their point of view.               And their

10   point of view, one of their points of view was that the

11   state said you can have this demonstration, just wear a

12   skimpy swimming suit.      No.      Well, you can have the

13   demonstration maybe, I'm not sure of this, but we're

14   going to put up a cloth so other people who don't want

15   to see you don't have to see you.                And there your client

16   said, we won't pay any attention to the cloth.                At least

17   we didn't in the past.       And then looking at that I

18   thought, well, maybe what they got was, they got a

19   preliminary injunction or a TRO, whatever you want to

20   call it, but it didn't stop the State from putting up

21   the cloth.   It was pretty clear the State would, and it

22   should have been pretty clear that they were going to

23   ignore it, which they did.

24                And why is this any different than having

25   won an injunction to say okay, you can demonstrate, but


                                       43

 1   in your swimming suit?         In other words, they didn't want

 2   this.     They didn't want what they got.                    Now, what's the

 3   response to that?

 4                 MR. GALANTER:          They did get what they

 5   wanted.     They wanted to be nude.              They wanted to make

 6   sure they weren't escorted off the beach or arrested.

 7   And that's exactly what happened.                  They had an order

 8   that protected that.

 9                 Now, the screen was there, and there's

10   material disputes of fact about what they were told

11   about the screen by whom.            But the court's order did not

12   say stay behind the screen.              They were not in violation

13   of the court order.

14                 But I think this goes to the more general

15   point, how can you tell when someone prevails, and this

16   Court has already established that.                       You obtain some

17   relief through a court award that materially changes the

18   relationship.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Did the court order

20   provide for a screen?

21                 MR. GALANTER:          The court order that -- no.

22   The court order said that the State was not prohibited

23   from using the means it had in the past.                       So it

24   clarified what the State was not prohibited from doing.

25   It did not impose any requirement on the plaintiffs.

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           That included a screen.

 2                 MR. GALANTER:         It did, Your Honor, but it

 3   didn't order the screen.

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           But your people didn't want

 5   a screen.

 6                 MR. GALANTER:         That's correct, Your Honor.

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           So they didn't get what

 8   they asked for.

 9                 MR. GALANTER:         They didn't get removed from

10   the beach or arrested for being nude either, Your Honor,

11   so they did get what they wanted.

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, that's only because,

13   I guess the other side didn't take the action that they

14   could have taken if they didn't -- if they didn't apply

15   the screen.

16                 MR. GALANTER:         Your Honor, when you obtain

17   the court award, just as if you obtain a court award to

18   get on a ballot or to hold a parade, or to wear a tee

19   shirt, I mean, you get that --

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Did they conduct the

21   demonstration with a screen or without a screen?

22                 MR. GALANTER:         I'm sorry?

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Did they conduct the

24   demonstration with or without a screen?

25                 MR. GALANTER:         They did not use the screen.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:           And since they didn't use

 2   the screen, the State was not prohibited from arresting

 3   them; is that correct?

 4                MR. GALANTER:         That's correct.

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:           So they did not get what

 6   they asked for.   Mainly a prohibition against the state

 7   interfering with the kind of demonstration they wanted,

 8   which was one without a screen.              You say they didn't get

 9   that.

10

11                MR. GALANTER:         They didn't get that, but

12   they got something more than they had when they went in,

13   which was, they got the right to be naked on the beach,

14   which would have otherwise subjected them to arrest.

15   And, I mean --

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:           The state had no problem

17   with that.   In the past the State had let them do that,

18   as long as they had the screen.

19                MR. GALANTER:         It wouldn't let them do that

20   this time even with the screen.              It sent them a letter

21   saying you may not appear on the beach nude.                 And I

22   mean, obviously, at some times you don't get --

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So the State

24   prevailed to some extent as well.                They prevailed to the

25   extent of getting in the order that they can do what


                                       46

 1   they had done, which is erect a screen.

 2                 MR. GALANTER:         They -- yes.         They

 3   narrowed --

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So they're entitled

 5   to some -- I mean, if -- this is not a reciprocal

 6   switching thing, but I mean, it does go to the question

 7   of whether or not you are the prevailing party when your

 8   opponents have prevailed to a significant extent as

 9   well.

10                 MR. GALANTER:         With respect, even if we had

11   sought and obtained a permanent injunction that allowed

12   us to protest but not behind the screen, we'd be a

13   prevailing party, although the defendants by their

14   successful advocacy would have narrowed the scope of the

15   injunction.

16                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Let me ask you this.      Is

17   it correct that an underlying principle of law that

18   justified your claim for relief and your actual relief

19   was that there's some First Amendment right to

20   demonstrate in the nude?

21                 MR. GALANTER:         Yes, Your Honor, that was an

22   underlying part of that.

23                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           And what is the support in

24   our cases for that proposition, if any?

25                 MR. GALANTER:         Well, I think this Court's

 1   cases in Barnes, the nude dancing cases suggest that

 2   expressive activity combined with nudity is protected by

 3   the First Amendment.       Judge Calabrese in the Second

 4   Circuit wrote an extensive opinion in a case called

 5   Tunic versus Zapper, where he surveys this Court's

 6   cases, and finds that occasionally there may be for

 7   artistic or political reasons a right to be nude as part

 8   of more expressive conduct.             But I'd like to maybe --

 9              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But that was also a --

10   that was the demonstration or the show arrangement under

11   the -- was it the Brooklyn Bridge or the Williamsburg

12   Bridge?

13              MR. GALANTER:            It was on the streets of New

14   York, Your Honor, yes.

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               At 6 a.m.

16              MR. GALANTER:            Yes, Your Honor.       But to take

17   this back just one step, to the notion that we either

18   not need something that's sort of enduring or merits

19   based in order to obtain relief.                Maher versus Gagne

20   suggested, a court doesn't need to resolve the merits in

21   order for a party to be prevailing.

22              JUSTICE SCALIA:              But see, it's so

23   extraordinary for somebody to make the other side pay

24   for his attorney.    We don't even do that -- we don't

25   even do that for guilty people when they -- when the

 1   other side wins.     So they have violated the law.               We

 2   still don't make them pay the other side's attorney's

 3   fees.   Now you want us to pay your client's attorney's

 4   fees even though you're not dealing with a guilty party,

 5   because ultimately the court found no, there really,

 6   this person didn't violate the law.

 7                That is -- you know, that's double

 8   indemnity.   I mean, it's multiplying the extraordinary

 9   departure from our usual practice, which is that each

10   side pays his own.      It's one thing to say well, if

11   you're a bad actor, in certain circumstances, civil

12   rights cases, we'll make you pay the other side.                  But

13   it's another thing to say if you're -- if you're not a

14   bad actor in a civil rights case but you're unlucky

15   enough to get hit with a preliminary injunction, we'll

16   make you pay for the other side.                 It just grates

17   that that -- it ain't fair.

18                JUSTICE STEVENS:             It's not just a question

19   of weaker, but what Congress intended when they wrote a

20   statute authorizing these fees.

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:             I assume that Congress

22   doesn't often do things that are grossly unfair.                  And if

23   there are various interpretations, one of which is not

24   grossly unfair, that's the one we should --

25                JUSTICE STEVENS:             And these trump the

 1   literal language very definitely.

 2              MR. GALANTER:             Speaking of the language, we

 3   have here when Congress enacted in 1970 -- in 1998 -- in

 4   1976, just two years before this Court had interpreted

 5   another civil rights attorney's fees statute.                In that

 6   one, however, Congress had actually required a final

 7   order before attorney's fees would be awarded.

 8              JUSTICE BREYER:               Well, before you leave

 9   that, I wonder if -- there's one other thing floating

10   around in my mind.      I might as well bring it up.            The

11   word is prevailing, and if I go with you on the ground

12   that it's flexible and can apply to all kinds of things,

13   at least you have to really be prevailing, is there a

14   good faith element in that?              That is to say, if your

15   clients when they went in to get this order and they got

16   it, and at that time they had no intention of following

17   what they had to do.        Rather, they had every intention

18   of going out and tearing down the curtain.                Does that

19   enter into the determination of whether they are really

20   a prevailing party who ought to get their attorney's

21   fees, if you're bringing the ethical element into it?

22              MR. GALANTER:             I think, Your Honor, that --

23   well, first of all, the preliminary injunction itself

24   was an equitable remedy.           Unclean hands could have gone

25   into that question, and yes, in determining the amount

 1   of fees, again, equity can be considered.                  The good

 2   faith of the parties, just as the complete bad faith of

 3   a plaintiff, this Court has held, permits fees to be

 4   awarded for the defendants.

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You can't go into

 6   court with the objective of just getting preliminary

 7   relief, can you?    I mean, you have to have an underlying

 8   claim of illegality and, that seeks permanent relief,

 9   right?

10                 MR. GALANTER:         That's true, Your Honor.

11   Although you can go into court knowing that --

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Knowing that --

13                 MR. GALANTER:         -- you're only going to be

14   getting --

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- preliminary

16   injunction.

17                 MR. GALANTER:         And everyone here -- excuse

18   me.   And everyone here knew that absent an appeal, this

19   was the final word on the February 14th --

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                On the February

21   14th, but your client sought further relief.

22                 MR. GALANTER:         Yes.      But it also sought it

23   as a discrete claim for relief in the complaint, this

24   very injunction.

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            You get costs?      The

 1   phrase is "attorney's fees as part of costs".               So, do

 2   you get costs for up to the preliminary injunction?

 3                 MR. GALANTER:         Yes, Your Honor.      The

 4   district court in this case awarded us costs and also

 5   awarded the other side costs.              And that's actually --

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So you would split the

 7   costs?

 8                 MR. GALANTER:         He found we were both

 9   prevailing parties in the case.               And that's also

10   consistent with this Court's decision in Hensley, which

11   says you look at a case and the unrelated claims; you

12   can find that the plaintiffs are prevailing parties on

13   some, the defendants are prevailing parties on others,

14   and order cross awards of attorney's fees.

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So this defendant, having

16   succeeded in being the winner in the whole case, didn't

17   get costs for the whole case; is that what you're

18   telling me?

19                 MR. GALANTER:         They were awarded -- they

20   sought and were awarded all their costs for the entire

21   case, or they sought their costs for the entire case.

22   It was reduced by the district court as a matter of

23   equity.   But they -- not because -- not parsing it out

24   among various parties to the case.

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So they were entitled to


                                        52
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   costs for the entire case?

 2               MR. GALANTER:          Yes, they were, Your Honor.

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And attorney's fees under

 4   the statute are to be awarded as part of costs?

 5               MR. GALANTER:          Yes, Your Honor.

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So if you're not entitled

 7   to costs, if the defendant got the full costs, then how

 8   do you get entitled to attorney's fees when the statute

 9   puts them together?     Because attorney's fees are part of

10   costs.

11               MR. GALANTER:          That's correct.      And there

12   are many cases where both parties end up getting awarded

13   costs.   Hensley was one that suggested it was possible.

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But this wasn't --

15               MR. GALANTER:          No.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             This was one that the

17   state got all of its costs from your client?

18               MR. GALANTER:          Yes.      And our client got

19   costs from the state.      There were counter awards --

20   cross awards of cost, which is not unusual in civil

21   litigation with multiple claims.

22               But more importantly, I think, when we go

23   back and we look at the purposes, not only do we have

24   the language here, we also have the recognition, I think

25   as I was mentioning to the Chief Justice, that there's

 1   going to be a lot of situations where core 1983 rights,

 2   core constitutional rights are at stake where you know

 3   you're not going to be able to obtain a permanent

 4   injunction.    You may even, as my friends on the other

 5   side say, ask that the two be consolidated.

 6                 JUSTICE ALITO:         What if that's not the case,

 7   but the plaintiff after getting a preliminary injunction

 8   just voluntarily dismisses the case?                      Do they still get

 9   costs for the preliminary injunction?

10                 MR. GALANTER:         Oh, I think the answer is

11   yes.   And I think that that's actually something that

12   should be encouraged.       In this case, the preliminary

13   junction was relatively cheap, as litigation goes.                        To

14   encourage them to continue, particularly since the core

15   relief they sought had become moot.                      Yes, there was

16   additional relief they sought, or it could, in a

17   hypothetical could seek.          But absent an appeal, that

18   part of the case is over and there's no real need to

19   continue to litigate it.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I know you were

21   asked this question and your answer may have just

22   slipped by me.    Why, if you had asked for a TRO, why

23   would you not be entitled to fees on that?

24                 MR. GALANTER:         We think that Congress's

25   distinction as far as putting preliminary injunctions


                                        54
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   and permanent injunctions in one category and TROs in

 2   another for purposes of appealability, reflect kind of a

 3   congressional judgment about which is -- which mechanism

 4   is intended to alter the kind of substantial rights.

 5   And absent the rights to appeal, absent the

 6   adversariness, the heavier focus on irreparable

 7   injuries, unlike at the preliminary injunction stage,

 8   those are all things that we think make TROs generally

 9   ineligible to affect prevailing party status.

10                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Because the TRO case,

11   characteristically the other side isn't heard, so you

12   haven't prevailed.

13                 MR. GALANTER:          That is one way to view it,

14   Your Honor.    Without the adversariness at the hearing,

15   there really was no one to prevail over.                    Whereas

16   here --

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No.   I thought you

18   prevailed in the sense that you secured relief.                       That's

19   how you articulated it up to this point.

20                 MR. GALANTER:          Well, this Court has

21   certainly described some relief as the threshold of

22   prevailing.    I'm simply suggesting that there may be

23   other kinds of orders, as this Court suggested in

24   Hanrahan versus Hampden, that are just not sufficiently

25   -- they don't have a sufficient change in the legal

 1   relationship between the parties to warrant prevailing

 2   party status, even though they do benefit the

 3   plaintiffs.

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, you surely wouldn't

 5   say that the fact that the other side never shows up

 6   means that you can't get your attorney's fees.

 7                 MR. GALANTER:         No, Your Honor.         What I'm

 8   suggesting --

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           So you're a prevailing

10   party whether there's an adversary on the other side or

11   not.

12                 MR. GALANTER:         What I'm saying is that the

13   TRO anticipates that, which is in part why we're not

14   suggesting TROs are --

15                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Yes.       But in this very

16   case, if you had gotten a TRO instead of a preliminary

17   injunction, you'd have exactly the same practical

18   situation.

19                 MR. GALANTER:         Yes, Your Honor, but we were

20   -- we did have a preliminary injunction.                  The State

21   therefore did have a right to appeal, and a lot of other

22   consequences flow from the fact that there --

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                The State did make a

24   point, that they were kind of -- this was short notice

25   and they were doing the best they could on short notice.

 1   I mean, they showed up but only sort of.

 2                MR. GALANTER:          With three attorneys, Your

 3   Honor.   And yes -- and we both have our stories about

 4   why there was short notice.             Ours is they only told us a

 5   week before they weren't going to allow her to protest

 6   nude.    And so we moved as quickly as we could.                And this

 7   is what often happens in election cases, demonstrations,

 8   parades, religious exercise.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But the regulations

10   told you weren't allowed to protest nude.

11                MR. GALANTER:          Your Honor, those same

12   regulations had been in effect the four previous times

13   she had protested nude.         And it was consistent with the

14   stipulation they had entered into that her nudity was

15   protected by the First Amendment.                 So again, she was

16   certainly entitled to negotiate as she tried to do with

17   the State.   She was told one week before that she

18   wouldn't be allowed to do this.               She went to court.      She

19   got the very relief that she sought and she was able to

20   protest in the nude.

21                Now in the other cases, you're going to get

22   someone who just finds they were denied the right to

23   register or to get on the ballot, and that's going to be

24   disposed of immediately.          It won't be capable of

25   repetition by evading review because the person is now


                                        57
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   registered, the election is now over.                   Maybe that

 2   candidate won't run again.          So we have a whole core of

 3   First Amendment cases that will be affected if

 4   Petitioner's per se rule that preliminary injunction is

 5   never enough goes into play, because then States have

 6   the unfortunate incentive of pushing the decisions very

 7   close to the actual event deadline so that even if they

 8   lose in court, they won't have to pay attorney's fees.

 9                And I would add that in terms of the broader

10   notion, here we have a midlevel state official sending a

11   letter to an individual saying we don't think you have

12   any First Amendment rights, and if you come, you'll be

13   violating a law that's subject to criminal arrest, if

14   you come and you're naked, you're going to be subject to

15   criminal arrest.   Absent Section 1998, it would be

16   incredibly difficult for persons in Ms. Wyner's

17   situation to find attorneys.

18                Thank you, Your Honor.

22                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Ms. Seitz, would you

24   clarify that point about costs?              Did your client have to

25   pay costs?


                                       58

 1                 MS. SEITZ:      The plaintiffs were awarded

 2   costs incurred on the preliminary injunction.                My client

 3   was awarded a right to costs on the remainder of the

 4   litigation.    Those costs were reduced to mirror the

 5   precise costs that the plaintiff was awarded on

 6   preliminary injunction, so in the end no one received

 7   any costs.    But costs were allocated for plaintiffs for

 8   the preliminary injunction, and defendants for the

 9   remainder of the case.

10                 I just want to make one point about the

11   timing.   The time prior to the 2003 demonstration, in

12   2000 she wrote a letter requesting the right to protest

13   nude and received a denial letter in response, similar

14   to the one she received in 2003.                So she was on notice

15   as of 2000 that we were enforcing the nudity ban against

16   her activities.

17                 Second, I want to say that the district

18   court itself characterized its holding on summary

19   judgment, quote, "as plaintiffs are unable to show

20   actual success on the merits," page 34a of the appendix.

21   So there's no doubt that what even the court understood

22   its own holding to be was that the prediction in the

23   preliminary injunction had failed to materialize when

24   the court considered the full case on the merits.

25                 And finally, I want to say that awarding


                                        59

 1   fees, conferring fees for a plaintiff for obtaining a

 2   preliminary injunction essentially requires the State

 3   treasury to pay its opponents when, in fact, the State

 4   has done nothing but enforce a valid law.                And we know

 5   that in this case because the case ended up getting

 6   litigated to conclusion.        But simply because we don't

 7   know that in other cases involving preliminary

 8   injunctions doesn't mean it isn't true, and that's why

 9   it's fundamentally unfair to impose fees on State

10   defendants and local governments that haven't had a full

11   and fair opportunity to defend their legal position.

12              Thank you.

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

14   The case is submitted.

15              (Whereupon, at 12:19 p.m., the case in the

16   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
