 7                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY FISHER

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9                MR. FISHER:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                Unlike the previous case, this case does not

12   involve the need to formulate Federal common law or to

13   survey customary international law.               Here Congress has

14   expressly created the cause of action at issue in a

15   statute.   And we know that in every single other Federal

16   tort statute that Congress has ever enacted, it has

17   provided for organizational liability.               As,

18   Justice Kennedy, I think you put it earlier, it's a

19   simple concept in our country.

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               We usually like --

21                MR. FISHER:      Of course, the question --

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               We usually like to

23   begin with the language of the statute.

24                MR. FISHER:      That was my next sentence, Your

25   Honor.

                                                                              4
 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, then go ahead.

 2               (Laughter.)

 3               MR. FISHER:       Thank you.          But, of course, the

 4   question arises in this case why did Congress use the

 5   word "individual"?    And we think the answer comes from

 6   the Tel-Oren case, which is the case, of course, from

 7   the D.C. Circuit that gave rise to the TVPA.               And in

 8   that case, Judge Edwards wrote a lengthy concurrence

 9   where he again and again used the word "individual

10   liability" and "individual" to describe the PLO, which

11   was the very defendant in that case, against the

12   backdrop of international law, which uses the term

13   "individual" to differentiate anyone from the state.

14               After Nuremberg, starting with the

15   discussions were recited most prominently in our reply

16   brief at pages 6 to 8, Professor Jessup and many others

17   discussed whether international law applies simply

18   against states or whether it applies to, quote,

19   "individuals."   And the word "individual" was used again

20   and again to mean anyone but the state.               And as

21   Professor Jessup and many others said, it includes

22   organizations and juridical persons.

23               And this is the usage that Judge Edwards

24   used in his opinion in Tel-Oren.            He uses the word

25   "individual" 43 times in that opinion.               And if you look

                                                                            5
 1   at nothing else --

 2                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           I thought Justice --

 3   Judge Edwards' opinion was about politically motivated

 4   terrorists not coming within the Alien Tort Statute.

 5                  MR. FISHER:     No.        What Judge Edwards

 6   concluded, Justice Ginsburg, was that, as he understood

 7   the Alien Tort Statute at the time against the backdrop

 8   of international law, that any private actor acting

 9   under color of law could be held liable.              And what Judge

10   Edwards decided in that particular case is that the PLO

11   as it then existed was not a state actor.              But the rule

12   that Judge Edwards prescribed -- and this is at page

13   793, I believe, of his concurrence -- was that

14   individuals acting under color of law should be held

15   liable.   That's the precise language that the TVPA uses.

16                  So, if you want to know where Congress got

17   the word "individual" and what it probably thought it

18   meant, the best place to look is Judge Edwards' opinion.

19   Now, what --

20                  JUSTICE BREYER:       Why isn't the place --

21                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       Really?       Congress got it

22   from Judge Edwards?      Gee, I -- my goodness.

23                  MR. FISHER:     Well, I think --

24   Justice Scalia, I think --

25                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       I'll bet you none of

 1   them -- none of them even read that opinion.

 2               MR. FISHER:      Well, I think Judge -- Judge

 3   Edwards' opinion was quite prominently read by the

 4   Congress then.   It's cited throughout the legislative

 5   history in the Senate Report, in the House Report, again

 6   and again in the hearings.

 7               And this Court -- I think in Skilling, a

 8   couple terms ago, this Court said we have a statute

 9   before us dealing with honest services.          And what did

10   Congress mean when it used particular language?           Well,

11   it probably meant what lower court judges had used that

12   language to mean, that it was --

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:        That is a strange phrase,

14   "honest services," as -- you know, as a crime,

15   deprivation of honest services.          But the word

16   "individual" is not a strange --

17               MR. FISHER:      Well, it's a strange --

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- word at all.      It's used

19   all the time.

20               MR. FISHER:      No, Justice Scalia --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:        It means an individual.

22               MR. FISHER:      I think it's a strange -- it's

23   a very strange phrase in the context of a tort statute

24   because we know that Congress always provides for

25   organizational liability, and it has never used, to our

                                                                           7
 1   knowledge, the word "individual" in a tort statute.             So,

 2   it is odd that it appears here.

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Is that -- is that better

 4   for you or worse for you?

 5               MR. FISHER:      Well, I think it's better for

 6   us in that it shows that Congress -- something is amiss.

 7   And I think Judge Edwards' opinion explains what is

 8   going on.

 9               Now, what my opponents want this Court to do

10   is to look at other places in the U.S. Code where the

11   word "individual" is used outside of international law,

12   outside of tort regimes.      And we concede --

13               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           The problem --

14               MR. FISHER:      -- often the word

15   "individual" --

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           The problem is I don't

17   even look there.   I look to the TVPA, section 2(a)(2),

18   which uses the word "person."           So, it wasn't as if in

19   writing the statute Congress forgot the word "person."

20               MR. FISHER:      No, it didn't.

21               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           They appear to be

22   using "person" in the organizational way that "person"

23   is defined in the Dictionary Act and elsewhere.           So,

24   isn't that a textual clue that they were using the word

25   "individual" in a different sense?

 1                MR. FISHER:      No, Justice Sotomayor, for two

 2   reasons:   One is because, for reasons I'll explain, the

 3   word "person" as it appears in the TVPA actually only

 4   applies to natural persons.         Well, let me start with

 5   that.   The argument the other side has is that the

 6   word --

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Individuals, legal

 8   representative, or to any person who may be a claimant

 9   in an action for wrongful death.             I'm not quite sure.

10   Legal representative is often -- can be a person but can

11   often also be a -- a corporate entity.

12                MR. FISHER:      Well, I think the -- I think

13   the argument is that the word "person" somehow contrasts

14   with "individual."

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Yes.

16                MR. FISHER:      And, as we've shown in our

17   brief, only natural people can bring wrongful death

18   actions.   They -- they claim -- in the D.C. Circuit

19   argued that an estate could.             As we've shown in our

20   brief and this Court has squarely held, only natural

21   people acting as administrator or executor of a -- of an

22   estate can bring an action.

23                JUSTICE KAGAN:        Mr. Fisher --

24                MR. FISHER:      So, the word "person" refers to

25   natural person.

                                                                     9
 1                JUSTICE KAGAN:       You know, it's obvious that

 2   "individual" doesn't usually mean what you want it to

 3   mean.   Now, you have a theory that they all just read

 4   Judge Edwards, and they came in and used "individual."

 5   But it seems actually that we know where "individual"

 6   came from in this statute.        The statute started out by

 7   saying "person," and then there was this moment where

 8   one Congressman said I don't want this to apply to

 9   corporations, and the staff member said I have a great

10   idea to make sure it doesn't apply to corporations;

11   let's change the word "person" to "individual."       So,

12   that's the way "individual" got into the statute, and it

13   got in specifically to address this question.

14                MR. FISHER:     We don't disagree with that's

15   how the word gets into the statute, but the question, as

16   this Court has always looked to legislative history, is

17   what does that -- what light does that shed on

18   Congress's understanding of the law it ultimately

19   passed?   So, two Congresses later, 4 years later,

20   Congress passed the statute with the word "individual."

21   And the problem with that --

22                JUSTICE KAGAN:       And "individual" means what

23   it means.

24                MR. FISHER:     And the problem with that

25   theory, Justice Kagan, is it squarely is contradicted by

 1   the committee reports contemporaneous with the statute

 2   that say we're using the word "individual" to make

 3   crystal clear that foreign states and their entities

 4   cannot be sued.   And that's the reason --

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:       So, what else should I look

 6   at?   Because I've looked at the -- I did really -- I

 7   know I have to go through legislative history.         I've

 8   said it's meaningful, and so I do it.

 9                (Laughter.)

10                JUSTICE BREYER:       And, so far -- so far, I

11   think I have to say that you're on a weak wicket.

12                (Laughter.)

13                JUSTICE BREYER:       The -- the word "persons"

14   -- when was there -- I found lots and lots of instances

15   and by people in the civil -- international civil rights

16   community who are testifying, where I look at what they

17   say, and over and over they say a limited statute, the

18   person won't often be in the United States.         Well, the

19   PLO had a presence in the United States.         The person

20   won't be in the United States very often.         I know, but

21   sometimes he may come over here; it's important to take

22   a -- make a symbolic step.        And not a word could I find,

23   when they're talking even about the word "person," that

24   suggested they meant even the PLO at that time.         In

25   fact, they thought, well, it would be a nice thing, but,

 1   but, but, but....

 2                  MR. FISHER:     Yes.

 3                  JUSTICE BREYER:       I mean, that's the tenor of

 4   what I seem to have found so far.             So, I mention that

 5   because you will point out to me the things that I have

 6   accidentally skipped.

 7                  (Laughter.)

 8                  MR. FISHER:     Yes, pages 46 through 49 of our

 9   blue brief, Justice Breyer.          There are numerous

10   references to the word "organization," "group."             "It" is

11   a word used.

12                  And, I think, Justice Kagan, this is also

13   responsive to your question.              Two years after the change

14   you described was made, there was a hearing held before

15   the Senate Judiciary Committee where both bills were

16   being considered.    The one bill from the House that used

17   the word "individual" and the word -- and the Senate

18   bill which used the word "person."

19                  And one would expect that if people thought

20   the word "individual" meant something different and

21   limited the class of defendants, that that would have

22   come up or somebody would have expressed some awareness

23   of it.   But to the contrary --

24                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       Well, suppose I'm a member

25   of the House or of the Senate, and I'm not a member of

 1   the committee that engages in all of this legislative

 2   history.   And I -- I see the word "individual" in this

 3   statute, and that's the basis on which I vote for or

 4   against a statute.    Why should I be saddled with

 5   whatever sayings by members of the committee or by

 6   experts testifying before the committee occurred?       It

 7   was out of my hearing.      I voted for "individual."

 8                And "individual" -- well -- if Congress

 9   wanted "individual" to mean what you say it doesn't

10   mean, what word would they have used instead?      I mean,

11   if "individual" is a code word for person, what's the

12   code word for individual?

13                (Laughter.)

14                MR. FISHER:      Natural person, Justice Scalia.

15   And -- and we've cited many statutes in our blue brief

16   that use the word "natural person" in the U.S. Code.

17                And this goes to the question -- I think

18   this is also responsive to Justice Sotomayor:      Why did

19   they use the word "individual," instead of "person"?

20   Why did they say in the committee reports that the word

21   "individual" made it crystal clear that states and their

22   entities could not be sued?

23                And the reason why is because "person" would

24   have left some residual ambiguity as to whether

25   something like a foreign city or a foreign county --

 1   think of a foreign county jail that tortured somebody.

 2   Under section 1983 law, which uses the word "person,"

 3   counties and cities are liable.              However, under the

 4   Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and under established

 5   international law sovereign immunities principles,

 6   they're not.

 7                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              So, they did this

 8   to --

 9                  MR. FISHER:     The word "individual" --

10                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              They chose that word

11   to avoid any residual ambiguity.              But they thought there

12   was no ambiguity at all as to whether the term

13   "individual" meant natural persons or organizational

14   entities?

15                  MR. FISHER:     Well, I -- I respectfully

16   submit they didn't think about that question, which is

17   why I'm standing here today.              What they were really

18   concerned with was avoiding sweeping in foreign states

19   and their -- and their -- and their entities.

20                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But there were --

21                  MR. FISHER:     And they just didn't think.

22                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           There were witnesses who

23   testified, were there not, Mr. Fisher, that the TVPA

24   would take care of a Filartiga type case, that when the

25   torturer shows up physically -- those were the words

 1   that were used -- the torturer comes into the state,

 2   into the United States, is physically present in the

 3   United States.   That was the model that at least those

 4   witnesses had in mind, and some of them were quite

 5   distinguished witnesses.

 6                MR. FISHER:     There are statements to that

 7   effect.   And, of course, the TVPA does cover natural

 8   persons if they happen to be in the United States.        But

 9   the comment that Justice Kagan pointed out is the only

10   comment that the other side can find anywhere in the

11   legislative history.

12                JUSTICE KAGAN:       But let's suppose that is

13   true, Mr. Fisher.   Let's suppose that aside from

14   Congressman Leach, nobody thought about this question.

15   But we know what the normal meaning of "individual" is,

16   and you're suggesting -- let's suppose that they just --

17   the -- the question of individual versus corporate

18   liability was not on their mind, but they chose a word

19   that means something.     And you're suggesting that we

20   should resort to background norms that -- you know, what

21   Congress generally does when it imposes liability,

22   rather than the words in the statute that they passed.

23   And why should we do that?

24                MR. FISHER:     Well, if the word "individual"

25   could only mean natural person, I agree.         The case would

 1   be over.    But we've cited many dictionary definitions,

 2   many usages in the U.S. Code, and many holdings from

 3   this Court and others that have actually found that a

 4   secondary meaning of the term is singularity.

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But you found no tort --

 6                 MR. FISHER:     A single unit or entity.

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          -- no tort statute uses

 8   the "individual" to include organizations.

 9                 MR. FISHER:     Right.      No tort statute uses it

10   one way or the other, Justice Ginsburg, which we think,

11   if anything, gets you back to the background norms and

12   the secondary meaning.      And let me say two things

13   about --

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But you have the --

15   you have the additional problem, though, that your

16   reading gives a different meaning to "individual" in two

17   sentences that are right -- actually it's in the same

18   sentence:   an "individual" who does the torturing,

19   subjects an "individual" to torture.

20                 Now, I understand your argument that you can

21   Have an organization doing the -- the subject thing, but

22   how do you subject an organization to torture?

23                 MR. FISHER:     You don't. 


24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              You don't. 


25                 MR. FISHER:     And I --

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              So, "individual" in

 2   the one clause you say means "organization";

 3   "individual" in the other necessarily does not.

 4                MR. FISHER:     I don't think it's that they

 5   have different meanings, but you're certainly correct

 6   that they refer to different things.              But that's no

 7   different than numerous other statutes we cite at page

 8   28 and 29 of our brief that use the word "person" to

 9   mean a plaintiff when it can be just -- be a natural

10   person and a defendant when it can be an entity.              And,

11   indeed, I think, if I don't get ahead of my --

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          In the same sentence?

13   In the same sentence?

14                MR. FISHER:     Yes.       Yes.

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Those statutes you --

16                MR. FISHER:     Yes.       Go to page 28 and 29 of

17   the blue brief.   And, indeed, their whole argument --

18   and, Justice Kagan, this goes back to your point.              Their

19   whole argument is when the word "person" was used

20   throughout the statute, then it -- then it changed

21   meanings in the same way, that it covered organizational

22   entities, but -- so, if the word "person" can do the

23   same work, the word "individual" can certainly do the

24   same work.

25                So, the question is why -- I think the

 1   question that you end up with is, given that

 2   "individual" does have this secondary meaning, does have

 3   this customary usage that Congress may well have been

 4   aware of, at least that as this Court often says that if

 5   there's a customary usage of a term, we'll assume

 6   Congress was aware of it, why would Congress have done

 7   what it did and limit this act, unlike any other Federal

 8   tort statute in the U.S. Code, to natural persons?         And

 9   we submit there is no good reason.

10                Justice Ginsburg, you talked about

11   statements in legislative history to the effect that

12   individual people who are torturers may be found in the

13   United States, and that's true.          But the TVPA is a tort

14   statute.   Congress already had on the books immigration

15   laws and criminal laws that refuse safe haven to such

16   people.

17                The only purpose of the TVPA is to provide

18   compensation.   And in every tort regime of which we are

19   aware in Federal law -- and they haven't even pointed to

20   anything to the contrary in State law or in

21   international law -- the way that you get compensation

22   in tort regimes is you hold agents liable and you hold

23   corporations liable for the acts of their agents.         It's

24   absolutely understood.     And there's no good reason -- if

25   you think of the three things that a tort statute is


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   supposed to accomplish -- compensation, deterrence, and

 2   accountability -- on all three of those stands, the TVPA

 3   utterly falls flat if it cannot reach organizations, and

 4   this is the perfect case that shows you how that is.

 5                  Just to start with remedies --

 6                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       Maybe organizations opposed

 7   it.

 8                  MR. FISHER:     Not --

 9                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       Maybe organizations opposed

10   the extension of the legislation to themselves.         Is that

11   conceivable?

12                  MR. FISHER:     Well --

13                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       And is Congress ever

14   influenced by -- by such lobbying?

15                  (Laughter.)

16                  MR. FISHER:     That may -- in other cases,

17   perhaps, but you don't find anything in this legislative

18   history suggesting that organizations were --

19                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       You don't find lobbying in

20   the legislative history.

23   that I don't have a piece of paper for, but --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:         I can imagine that

 3   corporations would have been quite upset by this notion.

 4                MR. FISHER:       Justice Scalia, one would

 5   expect to have found, over the 4 years this was debated

 6   and the hundreds of pages of legislative history, some

 7   clue that that's -- that that's what Congress was

 8   reacting to and thinking about.            This would -- this

 9   would be an extraordinarily unusual statute, and you'd

10   think that one person in the Congress that voted for it

11   or in the committee reports that are contemporaneous

12   would mention that.

13                The House -- the Senate Report has a section

14   called "Who can be sued."         And what it says -- I quoted

15   it to you earlier.     One would expect to find in that

16   section that, unlike every other tort statute, we're

17   restricting the people that can be sued, but they said

18   instead --

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:         This is the dog that did

20   not bark, right?    Legislation cannot mean what it says

21   unless the legislative history says that it means what

22   it says.   Right?

23                MR. FISHER:       No, Justice Scalia, I agree

24   that if the word "individual" can have no other meaning

25   than that which my opponent suggests, that I lose.              But

 1   I'm suggesting to you, and we've cited plenty of

 2   authority, that there's a secondary meaning both

 3   accepted in the U.S. Code and in cases, and in ­ and in

 4   international law.

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               But Congress -- as

 6   you've indicated, Congress focused on the very question

 7   of whether organizations would be covered or not in the

 8   context of whether a state would be covered.               It seems

 9   to me that the legislative history cuts strongly against

10   you, putting even aside Congressman Leach.               The issue

11   was there.   And if they meant to say, well, let's find a

12   term that leaves some types of organizations out,

13   states, but not others, we'll just say "individual," and

14   people will understand, oh, we don't mean a state, but

15   they'll also know but we do mean another type of

16   organization, a corporation.

17                MR. FISHER:      I think, Chief Justice, that

18   that's exactly the thought process that Congress went

19   through.   And I can't do any better than to point you to

20   pages --

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So -- but it's at

22   least ambiguous, and you're saying, well, we want a term

23   that's going to include individual persons and

24   organizations but not state organizations.               And the only

25   term that fits perfectly is "individual."

 4                  MR. FISHER:     And page 6 to 8 of our reply 


 5   brief explains why that is so.            I know -- I know it

 6   might be surprising, but if you read --

 7                  (Laughter.)

 8                  MR. FISHER:     If you read -- if you read the

 9   discourse --

10                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But you've been

11   saying all along "individual" has a secondary meaning.

12                  MR. FISHER:     It does.

13                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              So, why would they

14   have picked the secondary meaning of a word rather than

15   try --

16                  MR. FISHER:     Because it's more precise word

17   in international law discourse than the word "person"

18   for the reason I described before.                 If you look Judge

19   Edwards' opinion --

23                  MR. FISHER:     Well, except for -- remember, 


24   there's a state action requirement in the statute saying

 2   organizations.

 3                MR. FISHER:     I mean, maybe there's other

 4   ways that Congress could have done it, but the way that

 5   Judge Edwards did it and the way that international law

 6   scholars and people having this conversation about

 7   whether people other than states ought to be liable

 8   under international law was the term that they always

 9   used.   And it's not just -- you don't just -- you know,

10   we're not running a West Law search looking for wherever

11   we can find it.   There in the titles of the articles is

12   whether individuals are subject to liability.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Mr. Fisher, you -- it seems

14   to me you misrepresent our jurisprudence when you insist

15   that "individual" has to have only that meaning.           That's

16   not what our jurisprudence says.           We say that we give

17   words their usual meaning, their common meaning.           Even

18   though they may sometimes be used in a different

19   fashion, it's the usual or common meaning that we apply.

20                MR. FISHER:     There are obviously cases to

21   that effect, but I'm --

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Many cases to that effect.

23                MR. FISHER:     I'm aware of other cases --

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:       We say it all the time.

25                MR. FISHER:     Well, I think, for example,

 1   Justice Scalia, of the jurisprudence where I had an

 2   argument in this Court.      It's about the second or

 3   successive petition rule under habeas law.       And this

 4   Court has said "second" -- even though where "second"

 5   has an obvious ordinary meaning, it doesn't actually

 6   mean that.   It has a specialized usage that accumulated

 7   in the law; and when Congress used that term, we

 8   incorporate that usage.

 9                And so, there is case after case where this

10   Court has said -- the Morissette principle as a backdrop

11   against common law, where this Court has said that you

12   do look to usage in prior opinions, prior case law,

13   prior discourse, as a way of infusing statutes with

14   meaning.

15                And if I could just go back to the question

16   that I posed, which is why would Congress have done this

17   when it -- it just doesn't have an answer for why

18   Congress would do this in this particular statute.       Now,

19   the other side has given a few reasons why Congress

20   might have --

21                JUSTICE KAGAN:       But it doesn't really need

22   an answer.   Suppose we think there is no answer to that

23   question because Congress didn't think about it, other

24   than Congressman Leach who appears to have thought about

25   it and --

 1                 MR. FISHER:     Yes.

 2                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       -- reached the opposite

 3   result.    Most of them just didn't think about it.       But

 4   there you are.    The statute says what it says.

 5                 MR. FISHER:     Well, if you find the statute

 6   at least somewhat ambiguous for the reasons I've

 7   described, then what Meyer and other cases say is you

 8   assume if Congress didn't think about it, but they

 9   wanted ordinary tort and agency principles, in the --

10   the -- in Title VII and many other cases, this Court has

11   said, of course, Congress doesn't think about all these

12   things; and when they don't, and absent evidence to the

13   contrary --

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:       Maybe they did.   You see, I

15   might as well be honest with you, page 26 of the

16   Government's brief did have an impact on my thinking.

17   It's Father Drinan, and Father Drinan says in the

18   hearing, "I think it would be best to stay with that and

19   just avoid all of the problems about the PLO and related

20   groups."    And then Michael Posner testifies, it says,

21   the Government, to the same effect.

22                 So, there the great advocates of this thing

23   are sitting there saying we don't think it should cover

24   the PLO; let's not take that step at this time.

25                 MR. FISHER:     The --

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:        I mean -- and you have

 2   Congressman Leach, and you have the word "individual."

 3                 MR. FISHER:      The question that Father Drinan

 4   was responding to was whether or not the TVPA ought to

 5   be extended to private entities that do not act under

 6   color of law.

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Yes, but he's taking

 8   that --

 9                 MR. FISHER:      And at the time --

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:        He's taking that -- oh, go

11   ahead.

12                 MR. FISHER:      Yes.       If you look at that

13   quote, remember, that hearing was held before the Oslo

14   Accords, before the PLO became in our view a state

15   actor.    So, what he's saying, if you look at the quote

16   in context, Justice Breyer, is that the TVPA shouldn't

17   be drawn to sweep in groups that don't act under color

18   of law.

19                 And that issue is not before this Court

20   today.    We've argued that the PLO now does act under

21   color of law, and that's a question for remand.            But

22   that's --

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        I -- I find it hard enough

24   to parse the statute without having to parse Father

25   Drinan's testimony.      I mean --

 1               (Laughter.)

 2               MR. FISHER:     Well, of course, I was just

 3   responding to Justice Breyer's question as to that

 4   context.

 5               But -- but if you go even beyond

 6   compensation, you know, for compensation you have to

 7   identify somebody, you have to bring him into a court,

 8   and you have to enforce a judgment.             That's virtually

 9   impossible against only natural people.             Of course,

10   Congress would have expected the ordinary rule of

11   organizational liability.      For deterrence, the

12   Respondents' argument is that even if Pirates, Inc. --

13   and for this case we'll make it Torturers, Inc. -- were

14   created for a policy of torturing people abroad,

15   torturing American citizens who travel abroad, their

16   argument is you could not hold that corporation liable,

17   even under its express policy and purpose.

18               There's no good reason under deterrence

19   grounds why you'd let corporations or other

20   organizations cycle individual actors in and out with

21   impunity.

22               And, finally, in terms of accountability,

23   just think about the backdrop, again, with which this

24   statute was created.   There are some pretty horrible

25   groups in the world that actually claim credit and

 1   responsibility in the world stage for torturing or

 2   killing American citizens; and the idea that Congress

 3   would have passed a statute that these organizations can

 4   stand proud in their view and say we've done this, and

 5   that our statute in the U.S. Code would -- would somehow

 6   only get their agent, and not the organization or entity

 7   itself, we submit it just doesn't make any sense.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          Well, the TVPA is an

 9   extraordinary step in terms of exposing liability, and

10   it doesn't seem to me to be an odd idea that Congress

11   would want to proceed carefully before establishing a

12   situation where the use of the American tribunal is as

13   broad as it is under this situation.

14               MR. FISHER:    Well, I don't -- I don't

15   disagree that it's an unusual statute.           It's not unheard

16   of; just that we've cited in our briefs many other U.S.

17   statutes that apply extraterritorially.          But remember

18   that all the arguments for and against foreign policy

19   friction that you heard in the first case don't apply

20   here.   Congress expressly --

21               JUSTICE BREYER:       Oh, the obvious thing which again

22   they said is, look, just -- this is going to bring in

23   suits against the Palestinian Authority.          That's a very

24   touchy issue in foreign affairs, and we don't want to

25   have to go that far.   And some of the things that are

 1   said seem to bear that out.         That's -- that's what's

 2   pulling --

 3                 MR. FISHER:     With respect, Justice Breyer, I

 4   would just say if you look back at the legislative

 5   history, the only conversation that was had is should we

 6   reach non-state actors.       That was the only conversation

 7   that was had, and that's the conversation you referred

 8   to earlier.   Nobody suggested that if you apply this

 9   extraterritorially if you enacted this statute, that you

10   somehow ought to shirk from the ordinary rules of -- of

11   organizational liability.        Nobody suggested that.

12                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Mr. Fisher, one case that

13   you seem to have on your side -- you don't have very

14   many, but you have this one -- is Clinton, which --

15   which does read "individual" in the way that you say and

16   does it in order to avoid an absurd result, what the

17   Court thought of as an absurd result.             Do you think that

18   this statute is absurd if not read your way?

19                 MR. FISHER:     I don't think -- if I could beg

20   your indulgence for one moment, I don't think I need to

21   argue that because I think that for all the reasons I've

22   given, there's enough ambiguity and there's good enough

23   reasons why we would assume Congress meant the ordinary

24   rule.   But if I had to make that argument, I think I

25   could because the only arguments that have been advanced

 1   in the papers are reasons for not having this

 2   extraterritorial statute in the first place.               There's no

 3   good reason once you have it not to apply it to

 4   organizational actors.

 5                 And, Justice Breyer, this goes back to your

 6   comment.   It's still a mystery to me how it's more

 7   problematic in international relations to hold an

 8   organization accountable -- to not -- to hold

 9   organization accountable than to hold its -- its board

10   of directors on a personal basis or to hold, indeed, a

11   high official of a foreign government.               Nobody's made

12   that argument.

13                 And if I could say one thing and I'll

14   reserve my time, take a good look at the United States'

15   two briefs.   Their -- the only argument they provide in

16   of the Kiobel case is that there's no good reason --

17   that's -- that's the United States' terms -- why

18   Congress would want to have a statute that applies only

19   to judgment-proof individual actors and not to agents on

20   whom they're acting on behalf of.            And we think that's

21   exactly right, and that's why Congress wouldn't have

22   wanted that here.

23                 If I could reserve the remainder.

 1                ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURA G. FERGUSON

 2                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 3                 MS. FERGUSON:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 4   please the Court:

 5                 Congress enacted the Torture Victim

 6   Protection Act to create a cause of action against

 7   individuals who commit acts of torture or extrajudicial

 8   killing under color of law against other individuals.

 9   Petitioners attempt to inject ambiguity into what is a

10   very unambiguous term in U.S. legal usage by referring

11   in their reply brief to a supposed subtle definition of

12   "individual" in international law.                 But "individual" is

13   not a term of art that has a specialized meaning in

14   international law different from its ordinary meaning in

15   -- in U.S. legal usage.

16                 Petitioners' reply brief cites two secondary

17   sources spanning a 60-year period, while other

18   international law sources, including the Restatement,

19   international conventions, and other scholars, emphasize

20   the distinction between individuals and private

21   organizations.

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Mr. -- Mr. Fisher

23   ended by saying there's no reason Congress would draw

24   this line.   Why would they want to hold the individual

25   controlling officers of an organization liable for

 1   torture, but not the organization itself?

 2                 MS. FERGUSON:       Congress was proceeding very

 3   cautiously and incrementally in enacting a statute with

 4   extraordinary territorial reach over executive branch

 5   opposition.   It decided to focus on the personally

 6   responsible wrongdoers who subject victims to torture or

 7   extrajudicial killing, and it did not go beyond that to

 8   reach another class of organizations that could be held

 9   secondarily liable.      Congress --

10                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But the Chief Justice's

11   question was why did Congress do that?                 What were the

12   reasons for that?

13                 MS. FERGUSON:       Congress was focused very

14   much on the Filartiga case, where the Second Circuit had

15   found that there was a norm prohibiting public officials

16   from engaging in torture or extrajudicial killing; and

17   Congress wanted to avoid the scenario where you have a

18   torturer who comes to our shores; and Congress agreed

19   with the Second Circuit in Filartiga that if the

20   torturer comes here, he should not be able to escape

21   accountability from his victim.             If his victim finds him

22   in our -- in our country, there should be a cause of

23   action.

24                 But Congress had every reason to proceed

25   very cautiously and incrementally.                 It put its toe in

 1   the -- in the extraterritorial waters when it extended

 2   universal civil jurisdiction to violations of certain

 3   international law norms.     It did not dive in.      As we

 4   heard this morning in the Kiobel argument, this is a

 5   very complex area as to what norms are actionable under

 6   international law and --

 7               JUSTICE ALITO:       I don't understand that.

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          How many judgments

 9   under -- I don't know whether it's Filartiga or Filartiga

10   -- that -- that pattern, where the individual torturer

11   is found in a U.S. jurisdiction?

12               MS. FERGUSON:      There have --

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          There have been many

14   judgments; how many have collected?

15               MS. FERGUSON:      Petitioners identified one

16   case, the Jean v. Dorelien case -- excuse me -- where

17   there was a collection.     There may be other cases where

18   there ultimately is a satisfaction of the judgment.           But

19   it's inherent in a statute that reaches foreign

20   defendants that often they do not have assets in the

21   United States.

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Well, wouldn't -- if

23   Congress really wanted to have this, why wouldn't it

24   include entity liability?      The corporation is likely to

25   have more money than -- than an individual torturer.

 1               MS. FERGUSON:      The -- the situation Congress

 2   had in mind in enacting the TVPA was adjusting the norm

 3   against state-sponsored torture and extrajudicial

 4   killing, where the agent is -- is almost invariably

 5   acting on behalf of the state; and yet, it didn't create

 6   an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act for

 7   state sponsors of torture and extrajudicial killing.

 8               It was concerned with this Filartiga

 9   scenario, where the U.S. wanted to take a position:             We

10   will not give torturers a safe haven in our country.

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          What about the

12   point that the immigration law takes care of that?           They

13   wouldn't be able to get into the country.

14               MS. FERGUSON:      The immigration laws were not

15   as robust in 1991 as they perhaps are now.           We -- we

16   know that the TVPA is premised on the fact that the

17   torturer is, in fact, found in the United States

18   because, otherwise, the United States couldn't assert

19   personal jurisdiction over the torturer.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:       I'm not sure that the

21   immigration officials conduct a thorough investigation.

22   I mean, is there a box on the immigration form, you

23   know -- have you tortured people?          Yes/No.

 1   Justice Scalia --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:       You know, I really don't

 3   think they investigate that at all.

 4                MS. FERGUSON:      It's not a -- it's not a

 5   perfect screen because, of course, torturers don't

 6   announce themselves at the border as a torturer.               So, in

 7   fact, that's why we have situations where we've had

 8   these gross human rights violators that end up in the

 9   United States, even -- in one of the cases we heard, won

10   the Florida lottery.    So -- so, they do find their way

11   to our country.   And --

12                JUSTICE ALITO:       I still don't understand

13   your explanation of the reason why Congress would draw a

14   distinction between an individual and an organization.

15   You keep saying that the -- in the case of the

16   individual, the individual was here.             But the

17   organization can be here, too.

18                MS. FERGUSON:      The organization that

19   Congress had foremost in mind was the state.               This is

20   state-sponsored torture, state-sponsored extrajudicial

21   killing.   The -- the problem it described regarding

22   torture and extrajudicial killing was one of states.

23   The legislative history talks about how one-third of the

24   states are -- have been engaged in sponsoring torture

25   and extrajudicial killing.        So those were the

 1   organizations they had foremost in their mind; and yet,

 2   the statute doesn't impose liability on those

 3   organizations.   It's addressed to the very personal

 4   wrong of a torturer avoiding accountability to their

 5   victims in their home country and coming to our country

 6   and seeking safe haven.

 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            So, it's okay to keep

 8   out individuals who subject others to torture, but

 9   corporations -- we want their money so they should

10   invest here --

11               (Laughter.)

12               MS. FERGUSON:         I think --

13               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            -- because we're going

14   to protect them from liability to -- for people that

15   they torture.

16               MS. FERGUSON:         I think -- I think the

17   question is whether there was a plausible reason why

18   Congress would have taken this incremental approach and

19   focused first on those personally responsible versus

20   extending liability more broadly under secondary

21   liability theories.      And because the statute is so clear

22   on its face because "individual" carries its ordinary

23   meaning and the surrounding statutory text confirm that

24   Congress was using "individual" in its ordinary sense,

25   Clinton sets a very high bar for the Court to depart

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:        You don't have to prove

 3   it's an intelligent statute, do you?             Maybe it's a

 4   stupid statute.   Is that possible?

 5               MS. FERGUSON:       It -- it --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Is it possible?

 7               MS. FERGUSON:       It could be stupid, but it's

 8   clear.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Is it possible that it's

10   just -- that it's a stupid statute?

11               MS. FERGUSON:       Yes.     It is possible, but it

12   was clear enough.

13               JUSTICE BREYER:        It's also possible it's not

14   a stupid statute.

15               (Laughter.)

16               JUSTICE BREYER:        I took -- I took -- the

17   reason I say that is because if you want to elaborate on

18   this -- because I purposely asked it, but I -- one of

19   the things in the Government's brief that did, as I

20   said, have an impact was Father Drinan is asked,

21   shouldn't we have here -- this is before it reads

22   "individual"; it reads "person" at this time --

23   shouldn't we have another definition for including

24   organizations like the PLO?        He responds, "I think that

25   we should exclude non-governmental organizations."

 3   to stay with that and just avoid all of the problems

 4   about the PLO and related groups."

 5                  Now -- but you heard the response to that,

 6   which really was, if I look at the context, I'll see

 7   that's less relevant than I think -- than I did think.

 8                  So, what do you think?

 9                  MS. FERGUSON:      I think that even the human

10   rights supporters who were strong advocates of getting

11   this legislation enacted understood that this was an

12   incremental approach, that where there was some

13   certainty within international law within this area of

14   official torture carried out by public officials under

15   color of state law, and it provided a cause of action

16   for this Filartiga scenario, and even the human rights

17   supporters understood that it was important to proceed

18   cautiously and incrementally.

19                  This -- the United States does not tread

20   lightly when imposing its jurisdiction over the acts of

21   foreign defendants for foreign conduct under color of

22   foreign law.    That's an intrusion on other nations'

23   jurisdiction.

24                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       But, Ms. Ferguson --

25                  MS. FERGUSON:      And we don't do that lightly.

 1              JUSTICE KAGAN:       Your story makes it sound as

 2   though everybody was really focused on this question and

 3   made a determination to proceed incrementally and not to

 4   include corporations.   And isn't it, if you -- if you

 5   look at what happened here, more likely that other than

 6   Congressman Lynch -- Leach -- in fact, nobody was

 7   focused on this question.     But because of Congressman

 8   Leach's intervention, the words changed, and the word

 9   was continued throughout the legislative process, and

10   that's the word that was voted on.

11              MS. FERGUSON:      Well, Representative Yatron

12   was the sponsor of both the bill that was marked up

13   where "person" was changed to "individual," and then was also

14   the sponsor of the bill that was ultimately enacted.

15   So, he was certainly aware that "individual" was

16   selected for this reason of excluding corporations.

17              But, more importantly, "individual" almost

18   invariably carries the meaning of "natural person."          If

19   Congress had wanted the statute to reach nonsovereign

20   organizations, it very easily could have used the term

21   "person," as section 1983 does.        And the notion that

22   they couldn't use "person" because it would encompass

23   foreign states is not the case when you're dealing with

24   "person" to describe a potential class of defendants

25   because we presume that Congress does not intend to

                                                                     39
 1   abrogate the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.

 2                 And the Dictionary Act tells us that

 3   "person" is the term Congress uses when it wants to

 4   refer to natural persons and artificial persons, but not

 5   sovereigns.   So, if the Congress wanted to do what the

 6   Petitioners claim, they had a very useful term that

 7   Congress uses all the time to reach that category, and

 8   it's the term "person."        But, instead, they used

 9   "individual," and elsewhere in the same sentence, they

10   used "individual" to refer to who shall be liable.       They

11   used "individual" four more times in a way that can only

12   mean a human being.

13                 Now, granted, there are exceptions to this

14   canon of consistent usage, but they have no fair

15   application here.   Those canons apply when you have a

16   term that has more than one ordinary meaning, and you

17   can use them interchangeably without being confusing.

18   Here, the ordinary meaning of "individual" is to exclude

19   organizations.   We regularly use "individual" to mean

20   we're not talking about corporations; we're not talking

21   about organizations.

22                 So, in -- so, in the same sentence of the

23   statute, to use "individual" to mean -- oh, let's assume

24   we know it normally means corporations, and then

25   immediately just switch and -- and use it to refer to


                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   human beings would be very confusing.

 2                 And yet, we see Congress very deliberately

 3   and carefully then switch to the broader term "person"

 4   when it wanted to sweep in a broader class of potential

 5   plaintiffs.   They wanted to make sure they were sweeping

 6   as broadly as possible to allow persons who have

 7   wrongful death claims to be able to bring a suit where

 8   the victim has died.     So, they use the term "person."

 9                 And Petitioners' interpretation gives no

10   separate meaning to "individual" and "person," but we

11   assume that when Congress uses those terms distinctly,

12   they intend to give them different meanings.

13                 I would just return to the plain text of the

14   statute.   It's very clear.        The only situation in which

15   the Court has found that "individual" should be

16   interpreted inconsistent with its ordinary meaning is

17   upon a showing of absurd results.            And here, there

18   simply is no absurd result.         Congress had every reason

19   to proceed cautiously and incrementally in extending

20   U.S. jurisdiction over conduct that has no nexus to the

21   United States.   And it proceeded by focusing on this

22   Filartiga scenario, ensuring that the U.S. would not

23   become a safe haven for torturers.

24                 I would ask that the Court give the statute

25   its plain-text meaning and affirm the court of appeals.

 1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

 3                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON

 4                  ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 5         AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 6                  MR. GANNON:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 7   please the Court:

 8                  By using the term "individual" when

 9   describing who shall be liable for damages under the

10   Torture Victim Protection Act, Congress chose to limit

11   the statute's scope to natural persons.                That's the

12   ordinary meaning of the term "individual," especially in

13   legal usage.    And, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out,

14   this statute uses the term "person" in addition to the

15   term "individual."

16                  JUSTICE ALITO:       Mr. Gannon, suppose two

17   people are tortured, and one is an alien who has never

18   been within 10,000 miles of the United States, and the

19   other is a U.S. citizen.

20                  The position of the United States is that

21   the alien can sue, but the U.S. citizen can't?

22                  MR. GANNON:     The position of the United

23   States is that the alien may be able to sue.                And I

24   think that that's going to depend ultimately on this

25   Court's construction of the ATS.             There are always going


                           Alderson Reporting Company

                                                                            42
 1   to be differences in application between the ATS and the

 2   TVPA so long as the ATS is still on the books and has

 3   any vitality.

 4                  That, of course, wasn't clear to Congress

 5   when it enacted the TVPA in 1992.             It wasn't sure

 6   whether the ATS was going to be a going concern in light

 7   of Judge Bork's opinion in Tel-Oren.               But rather than

 8   amend the ATS, Congress in the TVPA decided to create a

 9   separate statute which provided an express right of

10   action both to aliens and to U.S. citizens for two

11   specific norms.

12                  It's broader than the ATS in several ways,

13   but it's narrower that the ATS in several ways.               So, if

14   your hypothetical involved piracy, two victims of

15   piracy, then it's quite clear after this Court's

16   decision in Sosa --

17                  JUSTICE ALITO:       No, but two victims of

18   torture -- you don't find that to be an incongruous

19   result?

20                  MR. GANNON:     Well, I think that is

21   ultimately going to depend upon what happens under this

22   Court's ATS jurisprudence.          And so, it does seem that

23   the Court --

24                  JUSTICE ALITO:       I'm asking about your

25   position, the position of the United States; not how --

 1                  MR. GANNON:     The position of the United

 2   States in the other case today is that the ATS does not

 3   include a categorical bar on corporate liability and

 4   that that -- that has no regard for the theory of

 5   liability, the locus of the acts, the citizenship of the

 6   parties, and the character of the international law norm

 7   at issue.

 8                  JUSTICE ALITO:       Suppose Mr. Rahim had never been

 9   naturalized.    I guess that was a mistake.

10                  MR. GANNON:     Well, in -- in this instance

11   then -- then that would present a different question

12   that this Court has not yet been presented with under

13   the ATS; and, ultimately, maybe an alien will be able to

14   bring a suit under the ATS that he can't bring -- that a

15   U.S. citizen could not bring under the TVPA, but that is

16   a product of the fact that there are still two different

17   statutes.

18                  The Alien Tort Statute will always give more

19   rights to aliens than to U.S. citizens because by

20   definition it is only available to aliens.

21                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So, what's the good

22   reason --

24                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- for the U.S. to have

25   limited liability to natural persons in the TVPA but not

 1   in the ATS context?

 2                MR. GANNON:       Well, I think that there are

 3   several reasons that Congress could have had in mind,

 4   although I think that if you read the legislative

 5   record, that Justice Kagan is probably correct, that

 6   most members of the Congress weren't thinking precisely

 7   about this question.      Representative Leach appears to

 8   have been.   I think that in the other passage cited on

 9   page 25 of the United States' brief involving Father

10   Drinan that Justice Breyer was looking at before,

11   there's an earlier passage that we cite where Father

12   Drinan seems to indicate that there may be a distinction

13   between the two bills that are pending before the Senate

14   at that point because one refers to persons and one

15   refers to individuals.

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:         But they were thinking

17   about that in 1797.      I mean, you're saying in the later

18   statute --

19                MR. GANNON:       No, I think that in --

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:         They were a much more

21   perceptive Congress in 17 --

22                MR. GANNON:       No, I think the difference is

23   that the ATS has not even attempted to speak to this

24   question, whereas the TVPA does.             As this Court noted in

25   Amerada Hess, the ATS does not define a class of


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

 1   defendants.   Here Congress did define a class of

 2   defendants, and I think that there are several reasons

 3   why they ended up with this result, the chief of which

 4   is that all of the cases that they were thinking about

 5   at that time had involved natural persons.          The

 6   Filartiga case was -- was the flagship case --

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:        That's why they're thinking

 8   of it.   His argument the other way, which I see now, is

 9   that -- is that, look, Father Drinan and the others are

10   not talking about individual versus person; they're

11   talking about whether, say, the PLO falls under color of

12   law of a foreign state.        And so, they're not thinking of

13   that question.

14                 MR. GANNON:      It's true --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:        And if -- and if, in fact,

16   it does fall under color of law there, they don't care

17   about whether it's individual or person.           They've never

18   really thought about that.

19                 MR. GANNON:      Well, but the --

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:        In fact, the only one who

21   thought about it was Congressman Leach, and that was

22   four bills earlier.      And --

23                 MR. GANNON:      No, but the reason that they're

24   not thinking about it is because the paradigm that they

25   were thinking about was the -- the torturer who is found


                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   in the United States who is -- who is walking on the

 2   streets.   There's an individual moral accountability

 3   that -- that everybody understood needed to -- to happen

 4   there.

 5                To the extent that the legislative history

 6   is referring to groups -- my friend Mr. Fisher referred

 7   to references in the legislative history to groups and

 8   organizations.   They basically are references to things

 9   like death squads.    And, as a practical matter, even

10   today, none of the cases in the Eleventh Circuit that

11   are being brought under the TVPA are being brought

12   against death squads.      They -- the case that Petitioners

13   cite in their reply brief, the Drummond case, was not a

14   case where the Colombian paramilitary was a defendant.

15   The defendants there were actually two corporations and

16   a CEO.

17                And so, I think as a -- as a practical

18   matter, although it is natural for us to think that if

19   an individual is liable, then so too is the -- is the

20   organization that it may have been acting -- he may have

21   been acting on behalf of; but it is not natural to think

22   that these type of clandestine shadowy organizations

23   that would claim responsibility for such acts, such

24   heinous acts, overseas would have a jurisdictional

25   presence in the United States.

 3   action, the organizational entity here is usually going

 4   to be the state, but Petitioners acknowledge that no

 5   state entity is going to be liable here.

 6               And, indeed, the result here is not that

 7   dissimilar to some of this Court's 1983 jurisprudence.

 8   Petitioners mentioned the question of whether Congress

 9   was concerned that the term "person" might pull in

10   something like municipalities because it could be read

11   to bring in sovereigns, but in -- in the context of

12   municipalities, under Monell this Court has concluded

13   that there's no respondeat superior liability and that

14   superiors or supervisors are not liable for the torts of

15   their agents; they're only liable for their own

16   individual wrongs.

17               And so, I do think that there are policy

18   reasons why Congress could have said something different

19   here, but -- and they may well be encouraged to do that

20   by 20 years of ATS precedent that has now, for the first

21   time since the TVPA was enacted, started to raise the

22   question of whether corporations should be held liable

23   under the other statute.

24               If Congress wants to disagree with the types

25   of policy concerns that were behind this Court's Monell

                                                                      48
 1   decision, Congress could reach a different result, but

 2   we don't -- we don't think that that's a decision that

 3   ought to be reached through statutory construction.

 4               Here, Congress used the term "individual."

 5   It spoke about an individual who subjects an individual

 6   to torture or extrajudicial killing.             It separately

 7   referred to "person."    And Petitioners' reading of the

 8   -- of the statute actually gets the relationship between

 9   person and individual, which is quite clear as an

10   ordinary question of Federal statutory construction in

11   the Dictionary Act, precisely backwards because under

12   their reading, "individual" means any nonsovereign

13   natural or artificial person, but "person" can mean only

14   natural person.

15               And so, we think that that is -- is a

16   particularly odd reading of the statute in light of the

17   Dictionary Act and the statutory structure.

18               If there are no further questions, I'd urge

19   the Court to affirm.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, Mr.

21   Gannon.

23              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY FISHER

24                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

25               MR. FISHER:     I can make four points, if I

                                                                         49
 1   may, Your Honor.

 2                First, when asked again and again why

 3   Congress would have done this, I think all I heard was

 4   that Congress wanted to adopt an incremental approach.

 5   And then Mr. Gannon said, well, maybe we also wanted to

 6   have moral accountability.

 7                Well, an incremental approach doesn't make

 8   any sense.   Yes, Congress did so in the context of

 9   requiring exhaustion and a limitations period.            And so,

10   it treaded softly there.      But there are numerous Federal

11   statutes -- RICO, the Sherman Act, the Antiterrorism

12   Act, which is quite similar to this act in many ways --

13   that apply to events abroad.            And they all apply to

14   organizations.   So, if Congress was going to do this,

15   there's no reason to think it wouldn't have wanted to do

16   it.

17                Ms. Ferguson pointed to the Dorelien case as

18   the one example she could point of where a TVPA judgment

19   was able to be enforced.      And the only reason why that

20   was able to be enforced is because that guy happened to

21   win the Florida lottery.      He had hidden all of his other

22   assets abroad and won the Florida lottery.

23                And is that the statute that Congress meant

24   to pass?   We don't think so.           Moral accountability was

25   already taken care of in the U.S. Criminal Code.

                                                                        50
 1   There's an express provision of the U.S. Criminal Code

 2   that holds torturers liable for torturing abroad.          And

 3   we've cited that in our briefs.

 4                I know some of you are going to look at the

 5   legislative history.    So, let me say two quick things

 6   about the legislative history.

 7                First, Justice Kagan, with respect to

 8   Representative Leach's comment, if anyone after that

 9   hearing wanted to know what that committee thought the

10   change it had made meant and what the bill meant, it

11   would have looked at its report.           And if we've cited --

12   we've cited the committee reports from the Foreign

13   Relations Committee, and it says the TVPA allows

14   liability for any person that commits torture.          It uses

15   the word "person" utterly interchangeably with the word

16   "individual."   So, that -- whatever -- whatever moment

17   happened 4 years before the enactment was long since

18   lost.

19                And the reason it used ultimately the word

20   "individual" and not "person," as I've described before,

21   was to steer clear, I think, of any possibility of state

22   entities.

23                Mr. Gannon points to Monell, but Monell

24   favors us.   Monell holds that organizations can be

25   liable.   Now, there's a separate question that you


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                    51
 1   talked about in the earlier argument, too, as to what

 2   the mens rea would be, whether it would have to be

 3   according to a policy or practice or whether it would be

 4   pure respondeat superior.       But Monell is on our side in

 5   this case, and we've alleged a policy in our complaint

 6   in this case.

 7                Thirdly, in the U.S. Code, where the word

 8   "individual" is used, it obviously means natural persons

 9   lots of times.   But when it does, it almost always uses

10   the -- contrasts it in that very sentence with an entity

11   or organization.

12                And so, in discourse, when you say

13   "individuals" or "corporations," yes, you mean a natural

14   person.   But as the United States points out in footnote

15   3 of its own brief, the word "individual" when it's used

16   alone is a less favored usage that actually gives rise

17   to ambiguity because of the secondary meaning I've

18   described before.

19                And then, finally, let me say -- the

20   questions were asked about the relationship between this

21   case and the Kiobel case.       And I think it's absolutely

22   clear -- and this goes again to one of Justice Kagan's

23   questions on absurdity -- if this Court holds that the

24   Alien Tort Statute would have let a torturer right by

25   Mr. Rahim, someone who is tortured, that is, bring a

                                                                            52
 1   cause of action, I think it would indeed be absurd to

 2   imagine Congress stepping in and passing a statute

 3   saying if you're an American citizen, I'm sorry, you're

 4   out of luck; but if you happen to be lucky enough to be

 5   an alien and never having tried to be a citizen in this

 6   country, go ahead and bring a case in our courts.              We

 7   think that would be absurd.

 8               So, with those points, if the Court has any

 9   further questions around the submissions I've made -- I

10   guess the last thing I would say is, at the end of Mr.

11   Gannon's argument, he referred to the interplay between

12   the word "individual" and "person" in the briefs, and I

13   can assure you from have having worked on this during

14   the case, it is an incredible sideshow as to whether or

15   not estates are people and all the ways that that works.

16   But it's laid out in our brief, and we think that it's

17   quite clear, that there is no disjoint between the word

18   "individual" and "person."        If you look at our brief, it

19   will explain why.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, counsel,

21   counsel.

22               The case is submitted.

23               (Whereupon, at 11:56 a.m., the case in the
