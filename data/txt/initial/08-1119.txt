 8            ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.

 9               ON BEHALF OF MILAVETZ, GALLOP &

10                    MILAVETZ, P.A., ET AL.

11               MR. BRUNSTAD:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

12   please the Court:

13               Section 526(a)(4) is unconstitutional

14   because it proscribes truthful information about

15   entirely lawful activity, it whipsaws the attorneys who

16   are trying to apply it, it creates an impossible

17   situation for them, and it harms the client.

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              If it were confined to

19   unlawful activity and narrowly drawn, do you concede

20   that such a statute would be constitutional?

21               MR. BRUNSTAD:           Perhaps, Justice Kennedy, but

22   the real challenge is to actually do that narrowing.

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              You say "perhaps."       Yes or

24   no?   Can Congress by an appropriately, an appropriately

25   drawn narrow statute, prohibit attorneys from advising,

 1   A, criminal conduct in reference to a bankruptcy; or, B,

 2   civil conduct -- conduct that is improper under the

 3   civil code because it's a fraud on creditors?

 4                 MR. BRUNSTAD:        Yes, Justice Kennedy, if it

 5   were narrowly drawn to apply to criminal activity or

 6   fraudulent activity, yes.          Those terms have

 7   well-established meanings.           We know how to apply them.

 8   This statute, of course, does not do that.

 9                 Now, the government does not defend the

10   statute as written.      The government seeks to rewrite it,

11   but the manner in which the government seeks to rewrite

12   the statute really doesn't work under the statutory

13   terms.   We do not have that guidance.

14                 The government in its brief proposes three

15   different formulations of how it might be narrowed.

16   None of those work, even if we -- we were to accept any

17   of those formulations.        We don't know what "abusive

18   conduct" means.    The government simply would trade a

19   First Amendment problem for a vagueness problem.             We do

20   not have --

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But there's already in

22   the statute an -- a required attestation from the lawyer

23   who signs a bankruptcy petition that the petition does

24   not constitute an abuse.         This is 707(b).

25                 MR. BRUNSTAD:        Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And the words are

 2   something like "does not constitute an abuse."               So

 3   apparently it has meaning there.               Why doesn't -- why

 4   don't we say, well, whatever it means in 707(b), it also

 5   means in 5, whatever it is.

 6               MR. BRUNSTAD:         Two reasons, Justice

 7   Ginsburg.   First, the 707(b) abuse standard is a

 8   completely different context.            It involves gatekeeping

 9   to the access to bankruptcy relief.

10               The second reason is that Congress -- there

11   is no indication whatsoever, in the legislative history

12   or elsewhere, that Congress intended to import the abuse

13   standard under Section 707 into the 526(a)(4) context.

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, again in the

15   hypothetical context, could Congress enforce by a

16   statute what it requires in the attestation clause?

17               MR. BRUNSTAD:         No, Justice Kennedy, because

18   the abuse standard is too nebulous to satisfy, I think,

19   scrutiny under the First Amendment.

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You think the attestation

21   clause cannot be the basis for sanctioning an attorney.

22               MR. BRUNSTAD:         It can be the basis for

23   sanctioning an attorney --

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I mean, how can that be if

25   it's too vague.

                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               MR. BRUNSTAD:        Well, I think, Your Honor,

 2   that the gateway to the bankruptcy procedures or

 3   basically provisions, like section 707 or in the Chapter

 4   11 context, basically are equitable inquiry that looks

 5   into the totality of the circumstances, whether what the

 6   lawyer has done or what the debtor has done -- and

 7   really it looks to what the debtor has done -- would be

 8   such that it would deny access to bankruptcy relief.

 9   Has the debtor engaged in inequitable conduct, engaged

10   in inequitable conduct in some way that would basically

11   shut the door to bankruptcy relief?

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           The attestation clause is

13   designed to ensure that the attorney has performed in an

14   ethical and proper way, I take it.

15               MR. BRUNSTAD:        In a sense.

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Isn't that one of its

17   purposes?

18               MR. BRUNSTAD:        I think it goes more towards

19   the attorney checking the information that the debtor

20   has basically provided in the petition and elsewhere to

21   make sure that the information that's provided is

22   accurate and that the bankruptcy petition is not being

23   proposed in essence for an abusive purpose.

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I won't take up too much

25   more of your argument, but it just seems to me odd that


                                      7

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   you can enforce an attestation clause, but not a statute

 2   that does the same thing.          I don't understand the

 3   principle for that.      You say it's a gateway and it's

 4   designed to facilitate the bankruptcy process.                   Well,

 5   the government could say the same thing about its

 6   statute.

 7                MR. BRUNSTAD:         Except, I think, Your Honor,

 8   that whereas for the purposes of getting into bankruptcy

 9   or staying in bankruptcy is one standard that courts

10   apply basically on an equitable basis, that analysis --

11   what Congress did there, it didn't have in mind First

12   Amendment concerns.      It didn't have in mind trying to

13   narrowly tailor the statutory regime so that lawyers

14   basically can understand what they are doing in a way

15   and communicate it to their client.

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, Congress often

17   forgets about the First Amendment, but lawyers don't.

18                MR. BRUNSTAD:         That's true, Your Honor, and

19   that's the heart of the problem here.                   The problem here

20   is that when Congress basically -- first of all,

21   Congress didn't import the 707(b) standard into

22   526(a)(4).

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What are the words in

24   707(b)?    I mean, they are both in the statute.                 What the

25   lawyer has to attest to is required by statute.

 1                MR. BRUNSTAD:         That is true, Justice

 2   Ginsburg.    But there is no evidence that Congress, in

 3   the legislative history or otherwise, that Congress

 4   intended the 707{b} standard to be the standard that

 5   governs what the lawyer can tell the client under

 6   section 526 (a)(4).

 7                JUSTICE STEVENS:            But isn't there another

 8   problem?    Even if Congress didn't think of the problem,

 9   don't we have the duty to construe the statute to avoid

10   constitutional problems if there is any reasonable basis

11   for doing so?

12                MR. BRUNSTAD:         Yes, Justice Stevens, but

13   this statute is not reasonable susceptible to the

14   government's interpretation.

15                JUSTICE STEVENS:            That is an entirely

16   different argument from the fact that Congress didn't

17   think of this problem.

18                MR. BRUNSTAD:         That's correct, Justice

19   Stevens.    But the problem here is that what the

20   government has tried to do is tease out a standard from

21   the "in contemplation of" language in 526(a)(4), and the

22   problem is that -- two problems:                One, the "in

23   contemplation of" language only modifies half the

24   statute, so the "or pay the attorney" prong is not even

25   addressed by the government's construction.                They kind


                                        9

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   of ignore that.

 2               The second problem is that the "in

 3   contemplation of" language cannot bear the weight the

 4   government would have it bear.

 5               JUSTICE ALITO:          What do you think that

 6   means?   What do you think "in contemplation of

 7   bankruptcy" means?

 8               MR. BRUNSTAD:         I think it means what the

 9   Court said it meant in the Pender case interpreting

10   section 60(d) of the former Bankruptcy Act of 1898.

11   That is, whether bankruptcy is likely or imminent; in

12   contemplation of bankruptcy, taking some action where a

13   bankruptcy case is imminent or likely.

14               Now, it appears --

15               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, let's say someone goes

16   to the lawyer and they discuss the person's debt

17   situation and the decision is made that a bankruptcy

18   petition is going to be filed at some future date.           Do

19   you think that everything that that person does after

20   that point is done in contemplation of bankruptcy?

21               MR. BRUNSTAD:         Not necessarily, Justice

22   Alito?

23               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well then, why not?   The

24   person drives home in contemplation of bankruptcy, the

25   person has lunch in contemplation of bankruptcy.

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                MR. BRUNSTAD:        Well, I think that would --

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:         Doesn't it mean -- "in

 3   contemplation of bankruptcy" means because of the

 4   expectation of filing a bankruptcy petition later?

 5                MR. BRUNSTAD:        I think that that would

 6   assume that the filing of the bankruptcy petition looms

 7   entirely in the consciousness of the debtor when the

 8   debtor does everything.        But I do -- I do think that the

 9   "in contemplation of" clause, which is also used in

10   section 529, is a neutral phrase.                "In contemplation of"

11   means nothing more than is the bankruptcy filing likely?

12   It doesn't have any nefarious, it doesn't have any

13   abusive context to it at all.

14                For example, section 329 --

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Wait.        It doesn't mean is

16   it likely.   "In contemplation of" means that the reason

17   you are doing this is the contemplated bankruptcy.                 You

18   don't see any causal connection in that phrase?

19                MR. BRUNSTAD:        I do see a causal connection,

20   but there is no element of doing something improper in

21   the language "in contemplation of."

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Well, that's true.        That

23   may be true enough.      But -- but the act must be taken

24   because you are about to file a bankruptcy petition.

25                MR. BRUNSTAD:        Yes, Justice Scalia.          But the


                                      11

 1   government relies and hinges its argument on the abusive

 2   connotation to the "in contemplation of."

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          That's a different

 4   question.

 5                 MR. BRUNSTAD:        That doesn't exist.          So what

 6   the government is trying to do is rewrite the statute by

 7   importing meaning into a phrase that has never been

 8   there and doesn't exist there.

 9                 Every time we see the "in contemplation of"

10   phrase appearing either under the current law or under a

11   prior law, if there was some element of abuse coupled

12   with it that was separately stated, and of course there

13   is no separate statement here.

14                 Now, again I go back to the fact that this

15   -- the practical effect of section 526(a)(4) is to make

16   an impossible situation for attorneys.                  We have two

17   regimes:    One under applicable normal ethical State bar

18   rules which say you have to give unfettered candid

19   advice to your client; and this provision which gives

20   you must give truncated advice; there are thing you

21   cannot say.    But whether you are in one regime or

22   another depends upon whether the debtor is --

23                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Is there a -- is there a

24   difference between unethical and illegal advice?

25                 MR. BRUNSTAD:        I think --

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              As an attorney can you

 3                MR. BRUNSTAD:          Yes, I think so, Justice

 5                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Under the State rules

 6   you can give unethical advice as a lawyer?

 7                MR. BRUNSTAD:          You cannot, no.             That is

 8   proscribed by the State rules.

 9                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              So if you are not

10   permitted to do so, what in the First Amendment would

11   otherwise give you that right?               I mean, this is a

12   commercial transaction of sorts.                 It's a fiduciary duty,

13   but it's a commercial transaction.                  They are coming to

14   you and they are paying you for certain advice, so why

15   would the person then protect your right to give

16   unethical advice.

17                MR. BRUNSTAD:          It wouldn't protect your

18   right to give unethical advice.                The problem is that the

19   statute sweeps within it's scope perfectly truthful

20   advice about lawful activity.

21                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              We are assuming that

22   it's not read with a limitation with respect to abusive

23   conduct.

24                MR. BRUNSTAD:          Correct.             But just as --

25                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Assuming that is read

 1   into the statute or is viewed as part of "in

 2   contemplation of bankruptcy," what in the First

 3   Amendment would make that be?

 4                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         The First Amendment would not

 5   protect unethical advice.           The problem, though, is that

 6   the term "abusive" which the government wants to

 7   interlineate into the statute is itself inherently

 8   vague, unlike "fraudulent conduct --

 9                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Which doesn't explain

10   why.

11                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         Because "abusive," it's like

12   "seditious utterances."         It's not something which a

13   normal person who just looks at it would be able to

14   understand what it means.

15                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             You don't understand

16   what it means as a lawyer?

17                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         I have some ideas about what

18   means.     But because of the onerous sanctions that

19   section 526(c) imposes, if I'm wrong I can be basically

20   subject to a whole panoply of remedies, some very

21   serious remedies and very serious punishments for making

22   a mistake.     And that's one of the problems under the

23   First Amendment --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           What if you leave "abusive"

25   out.     Let's accept your point that "abusive" is not

 1   there and the government is reading in out of nowhere.

 2   What's -- what's the matter with the statute then?

 3              MR. BRUNSTAD:           I'll give you -- -

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:             It just prohibits giving

 5   advice in contemplation of bankruptcy that somebody

 6   incur more debt.     What's unlawful about that?

 7              MR. BRUNSTAD:           Well, I'll give you -- I'll

 8   give you a perfect example.            Suppose the debtor's

 9   problem is that he lives in a house that is too

10   expensive for him.     He comes to the lawyer:          I'm in

11   financial distress.      The lawyer suggests -- the lawyer

12   would logically suggest:         Why don't you sell your house

13   and rent an apartment?        But the signing of the lease is

14   incurring debt, the lease obligation.

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:             But that's not in

16   contemplation of bankruptcy.

17              MR. BRUNSTAD:           It would be, Justice Scalia,

18   if the debtor comes to you in financial distress, is

19   thinking about filing for bankruptcy, and wants the

20   advice in that context.

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:             If the only reason the

22   lawyer gives the advice is because he knows that this --

23   that this debtor is planning to file bankruptcy, he

24   says, if you are going to file bankruptcy, you better

25   sell the house and move to an apartment, then it's no

 1   good.   Now, it may be a stupid law, but I don't see why

 2   it's -- why it's unconstitutional.

 3                 MR. BRUNSTAD:        Because it's perfectly

 4   legitimate advice about perfectly lawful activity.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          So it's a stupid law.

 6                 MR. BRUNSTAD:        Well, what happens is that

 7   basically it interferes with the lawyer's ability

 8   through speech to communicate full and candid advice to

 9   the client.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Exactly.         And that's why

11   it's a stupid law.

12                 MR. BRUNSTAD:        And ultimately under --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Now, where is the

14   prohibition of stupid laws in the Constitution?

15                 (Laughter.)

16                 MR. BRUNSTAD:        Justice Scalia, I think the

17   problem here is that this stupid law does not pass

18   either strict scrutiny and it is substantially

19   overbroad.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               How much of your

21   case depends upon the difficulty of defining what -- if

22   you accept the idea that "in contemplation of" means

23   abusive or fraudulent, how much of your case depends

24   upon the proposition that it's just hard to tell, that

25   it's -- it's a multifactored inquiry and that the lawyer


                                       16
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   sort of has to stop and think at every turn:                 Well,

 2   could this be construed as recommending abuse, or is

 3   this just construed as telling clients what they can and

 4   can't do?   And in some areas it's a gray area, and what

 5   should you do when it's a gray area?

 6               Is that -- does your case depend upon that,

 7   which is, I guess, just an issue with the limiting

 8   construction proposed by the Solicitor General?

 9               MR. BRUNSTAD:         It doesn't turn on that, but

10   that demonstrates the chilling effect.                 The effect of

11   the statute has been to drive conscientious bankruptcy

12   counsel from the practice.          Why?       Because it's not just

13   difficult to apply; it's often impossible to apply.                    The

14   whole statute turns on whether the debtor, the client or

15   prospective client, is an assisted person, which depends

16   on the relative wealth of the client, which is something

17   very, very difficult to determine at any particular

18   given point in time.

19               So the lawyer doesn't know:                 Am I restricted

20   in my speech under 526(a)(4) because that applies or

21   does 526(a)(4) not apply at all because I am not dealing

22   with an assisted person, such that I am under normal

23   State bar rules which requires me to give unfettered

24   advice?

25               And since that is impossible to know without


                                      17

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   detailed, careful analysis of the relative wealth of the

 2   client, the statute is basically impossible to apply.

 3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, if we assume a

 4   proper limited construction -- I know you disagree with

 5   that, but if we assume that we can limit the statute

 6   properly so that it applies just to unethical conduct,

 7   then you can't give that advice to anybody, and the fact

 8   that assisted persons is a subclass of that is

 9   irrelevant.

10                 MR. BRUNSTAD:        That would be true, Justice

11   Kennedy, if in fact we could tease out from the abusive

12   conduct, if people could actually understand what

13   "abusive" meant.    Does that proscribe -- what does it

14   proscribe?    It's too vague.

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes, but that doesn't go

16   to your other point that there's a problem in

17   determining the class of persons.                 If it's unethical,

18   you can't give it to anybody.             And the fact that the

19   class of persons is difficult to understand

20   is irrelevant.

21                 MR. BRUNSTAD:        Yes, Justice Kennedy, but

22   that assumes that we can do the narrowing construction,

23   I think as Your Honor points out.                 And that, again, is a

24   fundamental problem because the standard the government

25   would like to impose or interlineate in the statute is


                                       18

 1   entirely vague.

 2              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You want to -- I mean,

 3   your first point is -- and we never get to that question

 4   because lawyers shouldn't be under this act at all.

 5   They shouldn't be labelled debt relief agencies.

 6              MR. BRUNSTAD:          Yes, Justice Ginsburg.           Our

 7   point on the statutory construction piece is that the

 8   statute is ambiguous and that to avoid the

 9   constitutional questions -- actually, avoid two

10   constitutional questions here, the constitutional

11   question under 526(a)(4) and then a separate

12   constitutional question under 528(a)(4) and (b)(2)(B) --

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:            It's only lawyers who are

14   protected against vague criminal statutes?

15              MR. BRUNSTAD:          Certainly not, Justice

16   Scalia, which is why --

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:            So then -- so then there is

18   no reason in particular to take lawyers out of it just

19   to make it constitutional.

20              MR. BRUNSTAD:          Well, our argument there,

21   Justice Scalia, is that the statute does not

22   unambiguously embrace attorneys.               "Attorney" is not

23   mentioned in the definition of "debt relief agency" in

24   101(12)(a) where you think it would be, because wherever

25   Congress has otherwise intended to regulate attorneys in


                                      19

 1   connection with bankruptcy practice, it has used the

 2   word "attorney" specifically.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:           That's fine.       If you -- if

 4   you are letting that argument stand on its own, that's a

 5   fine argument.    But don't -- don't bring in the fact

 6   that, well then, moreover, if it's applied to attorneys,

 7   it's unconstitutional, because if it's applied to

 8   anybody it's unconstitutional according to your

 9   argument.

10                MR. BRUNSTAD:         That is also true, Justice

11   Scalia, because we do make a substantial overbreadth

12   argument.    The statute is substantially overbroad.

13                JUSTICE BREYER:           Now, but when you say it

14   isn't referred to, it seems to me to be referred to.                It

15   says "The term 'debt relief agency' means 'any person

16   who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted

17   person."    And the term "bankruptcy assistance" is

18   defined to include "appearing in a case or proceeding on

19   behalf of another or providing legal representation with

20   respect to a case or proceeding."

21                Doesn't a lawyer provide legal

22   representation?

23                MR. BRUNSTAD:         A lawyer does, Justice

24   Breyer.

25                JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.       So doesn't the

 1   term "provide legal representation" include a lawyer?

 2              MR. BRUNSTAD:          The problem, Justice Breyer,

 3   is that I think when Your Honor was quoting from section

 4   101(4A), Your Honor took out a whole lot of information

 5   that goes between the word "bankruptcy assistance" and

 6   "legal representation."

 7              JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes; they include other

 8   people besides lawyers.

 9              MR. BRUNSTAD:          Not only that, but I think

10   that that language is inherently ambiguous.                 What is

11   Congress getting at there?

12              JUSTICE BREYER:            I don't know.        What is it

13   getting at with "providing legal representation with

14   respect to a case"?

15              MR. BRUNSTAD:          That would seem to be with

16   respect to lawyers.

17              JUSTICE BREYER:            It would seem to be a

18   lawyer.

19              MR. BRUNSTAD:          But it's precluded -- it's

20   preceded by language, "any goods or services sold or

21   otherwise provided to an assisted person with the

22   express or implied purpose of providing information, et

23   cetera, about legal representation."

24              JUSTICE BREYER:            Yeah.        Those are other

25   people who are covered.

 1              MR. BRUNSTAD:          Well, not just other people,

 2   but what it looks like, is it looks like what Congress

 3   was getting at was people who provide things like what

 4   attorneys provide.

 5              Now, there are a whole host of problems with

 6   including attorneys within the definition of "debt

 7   relief agency."   I mean, it's counter -- it's contrary

 8   to the purpose of what Congress seemed to be getting at.

 9   It leads to anomalous results.             It does various things.

10              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How is it any different

11   from including lawyers within the category "debt

12   collectors," which lawyers objected to in this Court

13   unsuccessfully?

14              MR. BRUNSTAD:          Yes, Justice Ginsburg.            But

15   there it was interesting.         There, there -- in the Heintz

16   case, that was a situation where lawyers had been

17   expressly excluded from the statutory regime, then

18   Congress repealed the exclusion, so a clear signal to

19   include attorneys.

20              Here, we have the opposite.                 We have a very

21   ambiguous legislative history, where in the initial

22   version of this legislation the House report

23   accompanying it said lawyers were included and the

24   language was "debt relief counseling agency."                Then

25   Congress amended the statute -- Congress amended the


                                      22
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   proposed legislation in 1999, and thereafter in the

 2   2001, 2003, and 2005 House reports deleted all reference

 3   to attorneys -- a very, very strange tale, which seems

 4   to signal exactly the opposite of the Heintz case.

 5                 So we have a very ambiguous legislative

 6   history that seems to give us a contrary signal.              That

 7   in part is part of the ambiguity behind this statute,

 8   which I think is one of the reasons why it's perfectly

 9   -- the statute is readily susceptible to an

10   interpretation --

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I thought that in the

12   legislative history there were examples of lawyers

13   overreaching, that the conduct that Congress was aiming

14   at was engaged in by lawyers, as well as others.

15                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         There are some references in

16   the legislative history to that, Justice Ginsburg.

17   There are a few scattered references in the legislative

18   history.

19                 But again, the legislative history is very

20   ambiguous.    It seems to go in lots of different

21   directions.    Now, recall, Justice Ginsburg --

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I have heard of referring

23   to legislative history when the statute is ambiguous.                 I

24   haven't heard of referring to legislative history to

25   make the statute ambiguous.

 1                 MR. BRUNSTAD:        Yes, Justice Kennedy.            I

 2   think the statute is ambiguous for a whole host of

 3   reasons, and the legislative history does not clear up

 4   the ambiguity; it actually deepens it.                  So the

 5   legislative history reinforces the other indicators, the

 6   textual indicators, of in fact ambiguity here.

 7                 But I think -- I think it is also important

 8   to underscore not only would the constitutional

 9   avoidance, application of that canon here, by excluding

10   attorneys from debt relief agencies solve the problem

11   under section 526(a)(4), but also under section

12   528(a)(4) and (b)(2)(B).         528 --

13                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Before you go on on 528,

14   could you clarify for me:          What is your challenge to

15   528?   Is it a normal --

16                 MR. BRUNSTAD:        528, Justice Sotomayor?

17                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            528.

18                 MR. BRUNSTAD:        Yes, Justice Sotomayor.

19                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Is it a normal facial

20   invalidity?    Is it an overbreadth invalidity?                  Is it an

21   as-applied challenge?       What exactly are you claiming

22   with respect to that --

23                 MR. BRUNSTAD:        Does Your Honor mean 526 or

24   528?

25                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            528.

 1               MR. BRUNSTAD:         528.       528, the disclosures in

 2   the advertising provision?

 3               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Yes.

 4               MR. BRUNSTAD:         We are challenging that on

 5   as-applied it violates the Constitution --

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Can you tell me how you

 7   have an as-applied challenge when I don't even know what

 8   ad is at issue?

 9               MR. BRUNSTAD:         Yes, Your Honor.       I think

10   it's the same as the Cincinnati case, where in fact

11   there was no obligation that the handbills that were

12   being distributed were any way deceptive or misleading.

13   That's the same situation here.              The district court --

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             I -- I have scoured the

15   record for a handbill, meaning -- an advertisement --

16               MR. BRUNSTAD:         Yes.

17               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             -- by you that I could

18   look at and say, you know, I'm looking at it and it's

19   not misleading.   So where is it in the record?

20               MR. BRUNSTAD:         The ads are not in the

21   record.   But, as the district court found, there is no

22   evidence suggesting that bankruptcy assistance

23   advertisements that -- that Petitioners' bankruptcy

24   advertisements are deceptive in any regard.             The

25   government never alleged that Petitioners engaged in any


                                      25

 1   deceptive advertising.        That's --

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             I -- I truly have never

 3   heard of an as-applied challenge when we don't know what

 4   it is being applied to.        But putting that aside, so you

 5   have an as-applied challenge; do you have a facial

 6   challenge or an overbreadth challenge?

 7                MR. BRUNSTAD:         With respect to the

 8   advertisements with the commercial speech?

 9                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR.             Yes, the 528.

10                MR. BRUNSTAD:         No, it's not a -- it's not a

11   facial challenge; it's an as-applied challenge.              But

12   here -- here's the point on the evidentiary point.               The

13   government never sought to introduce that evidence

14   because it's not at issue.           There is no dispute that

15   Petitioners' advertisement is not -- is --

16                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Did the government bring

17   this lawsuit below?

18                MR. BRUNSTAD:         We brought this lawsuit as a

19   declaratory judgment action.

20                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So what, were they

21   supposed to scour your advertisements to find the

22   violation?   Was that it?

23                MR. BRUNSTAD:         No, unless there was an

24   allegation that in some way Petitioners' advertisements

25   were misleading.   It's not.           It's not a disputed


                                       26

 1   question.    It's not a disputed factual question.

 2                 There is no dispute, and the district court

 3   basically found that there is no allegation that

 4   Petitioners' advertising is deceptive or untruthful in

 5   any way.     So Petitioners' advertising is not of the kind

 6   that Congress was trying to target.

 7                 Now, the problem and the burden that 528

 8   imposes is that it requires counterfactual, misleading

 9   statements that interfere with legitimate advertising

10   messages.    That's the problem.             The statute is not

11   narrowly tailored under Central Hudson to address the

12   "make debts disappear" problem the government identifies

13   as animating this particular statute.

14                 Let me give a simple illustration to sort of

15   illustrate my point.       Suppose I sell bread and the

16   government required me to say -- disclose:               I am a bread

17   supply agency; I sell products that contain wheat.

18   Well, what if the bread I sell does not contain wheat,

19   it's wheat-free?    Forcing me to make that statement is

20   counterfactual and misleading.               That's what this statute

21   does.   If I also sell milk, it requires me to make the

22   statement:    I am the bread relief -- the bread supply

23   agency --

24                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Could I ask you

25   something?    When you are an attorney advertising as an

 1   attorney who gives advice on bankruptcy, why aren't you

 2   a debt release -- relief advisor?

 3                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         The problem, Justice

 4   Sotomayor, is that that statement inherently is

 5   misleading.     When lawyers -- when clients look for

 6   lawyers, bankruptcy lawyers or just lawyers in general,

 7   they don't want to see someone called a debt relief

 8   agency.     It conveys no meaningful information.                  In fact,

 9   it's misleading.     What does that mean?

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            They don't want to be --

11   lawyers don't want to be called debt collectors either,

12   and in this, the Fair Debt Collection Act, it says

13   that -- that communication must say the communication is

14   from a debt collector, except that formal pleadings are

15   not -- you don't have to identify.                  It seems to me that

16   that -- that would be a harder thing for a lawyer to do,

17   to identify herself in an advertisement as, I am a debt

18   collector, than I am a debt relief agency.

19                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         Yes, but the debt collection

20   statute doesn't require that in advertising.                  It

21   requires that in letters and things like that that go to

22   other parties where you are actually trying to help

23   collect the debt.     So it's a communication that the

24   lawyer is making, for example, and a disclosure that's

25   required.

 1                 Here putting in your advertising "I'm a debt

 2   relief agency" conveys no meaningful information to the

 3   public.     In fact, it is misleading.

 4                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, A, I suppose you

 5   don't have to advertise; or B, if you do, you can say in

 6   your bread hypo:     Under the Federal law we have bread,

 7   but our bread is -- I don't know -- gluten-free or

 8   whatever.    You can use --

 9                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         Yes, Justice Kennedy.

10                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You can always add -- add

11   in order to make it non-misleading.

12                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         But that would require a

13   statement in our advertising that is actually -- to make

14   it fundamentally dissimilar to the statement that's

15   being actually imposed on us, we have to say -- we have

16   to put in the advertising something like "This product

17   contains wheat."    Then we also have to say, but my

18   product doesn't.

19                 So, for the consumer who is looking at the

20   information, it's inherently misleading because the two

21   conflict.

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           This is a proposal for a

23   commercial transaction, right?               You are trying to get a

24   consumer to hire you.        And the First Amendment standards

25   for proposals for commercial transactions have always


                                        29

 1   been more -- more lenient than other First Amendment

 2   contexts.

 3                We -- we -- we regulate the content of

 4   advertising all the time.

 5                MR. BRUNSTAD:        Yes, Justice Scalia, but this

 6   statute is odd because it requires counterfactual

 7   information, it's not narrowly drawn to address the

 8   problem the government identifies.

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:          I don't know --

10                JUSTICE ALITO:         If a law firm -- if a law

11   firm provides representation for debtors in bankruptcy,

12   what is misleading about requiring them to say:          We help

13   people file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy

14   Code?

15                MR. BRUNSTAD:        Because the scope of

16   528(b)(2)(B) is so broad.         If I am advertising mortgage

17   foreclosure services having nothing to do with

18   bankruptcy, I still must make this counterfactual

19   statement.   528 -- for example, in my bread

20   hypothetical, if I am also selling milk, and the

21   government says when I am selling milk through my milk

22   advertisement I have to say I am a bread supply agency,

23   I sell products that contain wheat, that is misleading

24   and irrelevant to the milk advertisement.

25                But this statute does the same thing.         If I


                                      30

 1   am advertising eviction protection services having

 2   nothing to do with bankruptcy or mortgage foreclosure

 3   services representation having nothing to do with the

 4   bankruptcy, I have to make these counterfactual

 5   statements that are inherently misleading.

 6               If there are no questions at the moment, I

 7   would like to reserve my time.

11                ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY

12                ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

13               MR. JAY:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

14   please the Court:

15               I would like to begin with the threshold

16   statutory question if I may.              I have only a few points

17   on that.

18               A debt relief agency is any person who

19   provides specified services to specified clients for

20   pay.   An attorney is a person, a defined term under the

21   Bankruptcy Code, and the Petitioners have affirmatively

22   alleged in their complaint that they provide bankruptcy

23   assistance to assisted persons.                We think that is all

24   that is required to determine that they are debt relief

25   agencies under the statute.

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What about the provision

 2   that says the directors, employees, are not included?

 3               MR. JAY:     As I understand Petitioners'

 4   argument about that provision, it is that Congress would

 5   surely have made an exception for partners as well had

 6   it intended to include attorneys.                We think that that is

 7   a multi-step chain of reasoning that breaks down at each

 8   step.

 9               Congress made an exception from the

10   definition of "debt relief agencies" for officers and

11   employees of the business that is itself a debt relief

12   agency.   Partnerships, of course, have employees as

13   well, and a run-of-the-mill employee of a partnership

14   who doesn't provided the bankruptcy assistance services

15   himself is not himself a debt relief agency.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What about an associate?

17               MR. JAY:     I think, Justice Ginsburg, an

18   associate is an employee, so if the associate in a law

19   firm provides -- doesn't provide the bankruptcy

20   assistance herself, then she is not a debt relief

21   agency.   It's the -- because any person is defined under

22   the Bankruptcy Code to include individual partnership or

23   corporation.   That is Section 101(41).                It's the law

24   firm that provides the services, is a person who

25   provides the services and therefore a debt relief


                                      32
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   agency.    I suppose an individual who provides the

 2   services himself or herself might be an agency, a debt

 3   relief agency, as well.

 4                But we don't think that the absence of a

 5   specific exception for partners of a partnership tells

 6   us anything that would derogate from the plain meaning

 7   of the defined terms in the statute.                    The fact that

 8   partners are liable for actions of the partnership is a

 9   commonplace of partnership law.               And it's also not the

10   case that all attorneys practice in partnerships.                   The

11   Petitioner law firm is a professional corporation and

12   one of the individual Petitioners is a director of

13   that -- of that professional corporation.

14                JUSTICE BREYER:           What he -- what I think his

15   argument is, as I understand it, is if you look at the

16   definition of "bankruptcy assistance," you will see

17   there are seven different things that a person could do

18   and fall within that definition.                And all of those seven

19   things are probably provided by the kinds of agencies

20   you see advertised on television, which say:                   We will

21   help you with your debts.          And they probably aren't

22   lawyers.

23                And, so, if you look at the six of the seven

24   things, it's clear that all of those are provided by

25   those television companies.            And the seventh is simply


                                       33
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   added in, namely the providing legal representation, to

 2   be a catch-all to be sure that if one of those companies

 3   actually does something that is legal representation,

 4   even though they are not lawyers, they are caught, too.

 5              So he is saying, read the whole paragraph

 6   and then you will see they are after the companies that

 7   appear on television and they're not after lawyers.                     And

 8   then he says that's the history of the bill, and so

 9   forth and so on.   Okay.

10              Now, that's the argument, and so it isn't --

11   can't quite be brushed off as quickly, I think, as you

12   did.

13              MR. JAY:       Well, I -- I am happy to respond

14   to it in further detail.         I think that the -- first, the

15   reference to appearing in a case or proceeding on behalf

16   of another, that can only refer to lawyers.                    Even if as

17   you --

18              JUSTICE BREYER:             Why?       I mean, there could

19   not only be lawyers.      I mean, there are numerous

20   proceedings where your brother, your mother, your

21   cousin, your friend appears for you.                    They say:   Bring a

22   friend, bring one of us.

23              (Laughter.)

24              JUSTICE BREYER:             We will charge you very

25   little, we will save you money.               I am a lawyer, by the


                                       34

 1   way.

 2                (Laughter.)

 3                MR. JAY:    That's right, Justice Breyer, and

 4   I think --

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:          I have relatives who

 6   aren't, and you can bring one of them.

 7                MR. JAY:    But appearing -- appearing in a

 8   case or proceeding under this title, Your Honor, means

 9   entering an appearance in court.               I think that's --

10   that's the natural reading of that phrase.                And

11   Petitioners have suggested that this is an attempt to

12   catch the unauthorized practice of law.                But certainly

13   neither the plain meaning nor the legislative record

14   suggests that people who are not lawyers were actually

15   engaging in conduct so brazen as to show up in Federal

16   Bankruptcy Court, enter -- file a notice of appearance

17   and purport to be a lawyer.           That is not what this

18   statute is intended to catch.

19                At any rate, the legislative history I think

20   amply supports our view.        Page 21 of our brief collects

21   a number of citations to the legislative record

22   specifically referring to attorneys.

23                As for the point Mr. Brunstad made about the

24   change in the drafting history of this bill from "debt

25   relief counseling agency" to "debt relief agency," that


                                      35
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   change was made in 1999.          And in the House report

 2   accompanying the 1999 version of the bill, which had

 3   changed from "debt relief counseling agency" to "debt

 4   relief agency," the House report said, "It applies to

 5   attorneys, as well as to non-attorneys, such as petition

 6   preparers.     That is page 120 of House Report 106-123.

 7                So I think that amply refutes the point

 8   about the drafting history.

 9                But in any event, if the Court were to look

10   at legislative history, we think that the provisions of

11   the 2005 House report accompanying the bill that

12   actually was enacted are the most probative, and we've

13   cited two references on page 21 of our brief that we

14   think amply demonstrate that attorneys are included.

15                If the Court has no further questions about

16   the --

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So, if -- if -- if

18   lawyers are debt relief agencies, I am curious how your

19   limiting construction works.              If a client comes into a

20   lawyer and says, look, I know we are thinking of filing

21   bankruptcy, but I want to go to Tahiti and charge it;

22   can I do it?    And the lawyer says:                Oh, the law says I

23   can't give you advice in contemplation of bankruptcy;

24   the Solicitor General says that means I can't give you

25   advice in aid of fraud that would deprive debtors of

 1   assets they might otherwise get, so I can't tell you.

 2                 MR. JAY:    Well --

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Has that

 4   person violated -- has that lawyer violated the statute?

 5                 MR. JAY:    I don't think so, Your Honor.             The

 6   statute prohibits only advice to incur more debt in

 7   contemplation of bankruptcy.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, the person has

 9   asked, can I charge the trip to Tahiti?                 And the lawyer,

10   although giving perfectly truthful advice, has

11   effectively conveyed to his client that if he does he

12   would be depriving debtors of assets they might

13   otherwise get.

14                 MR. JAY:    But the lawyer in your

15   hypothetical, Mr. Chief Justice, has not advised the

16   client to take the trip; it has not advised the client

17   to do that.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               He has communicated

19   to the client that if he takes the trip, one, he will

20   have a good time in Tahiti; and two, he will be using

21   assets that would otherwise end up in the hands of the

22   debtors.

23                 MR. JAY:    I suppose that, you know, there

24   might be a fact question about whether a particular wink

25   and nod communication between an attorney and client

 1   were in fact advice to engage in the transaction, that's

 2   prohibited under the Bankruptcy Code, the fraudulent or

 3   abusive transaction.

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  What if -- what if

 5   the lawyer said:     I can't give you advice in

 6   contemplation of bankruptcy, but here's the Solicitor

 7   General's brief, read that.

 8              (Laughter.)

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  And a reasonable --

10   my point is a reasonable person reading the brief would

11   say, well, the reason he can't give me advice is because

12   that might cause me to do something that would defraud

13   the debtors, so I'm going to buy the ticket.

14              MR. JAY:       Well, if -- if that debtor reads

15   our brief, that debtor will also see that there are

16   serious consequences for the debtor himself, which is

17   precisely why Congress passed this statute providing for

18   relief for the debtor against the attorney who provides

19   this unethical or abusive advice.

20              An attorney -- sorry.                  A client who incurs

21   additional debt intending to defraud the creditor may

22   not be able to obtain a discharge of that debt and

23   indeed may not be able to obtain a discharge in

24   bankruptcy at all.

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, that's one of

 1   the things I'm concerned about your limiting

 2   construction, "intending to defraud the debtor."                  What

 3   if the person takes a trip to Tahiti every November?

 4   They've always done it.         They are not intending to

 5   defraud the debtor.      They are just doing what they have

 6   always done.    So an attorney that gives that advice,

 7   would be -- that would be okay?

 8                 MR. JAY:     Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think

 9   the Culver case, a -- a disciplinary case that we

10   referred to in our brief, is a good illustration of

11   this.   Fraud turns on the defrauder's intent as a -- as

12   a general matter.     And when someone --

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So if -- so if the

14   lawyer said that, I can't give you advice in

15   contemplation of bankruptcy, but I can tell you that

16   fraud turns on the debtor's intent?

17                 MR. JAY:     Well, again, Mr. Chief Justice, I

18   -- I don't think that that would be advice to incur the

19   additional debt.    And I don't think that the -- that a

20   debtor who read our brief or who informed himself with

21   these hints that you're positing the attorney giving, I

22   don't think that the debtor would take the step of -- of

23   incurring the additional debt, precisely because there

24   are consequences for the debtor, and it's -- it's a

25   grave risk.    That's precisely why Congress prohibited --

 1   prohibited this form of --

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               No, but the whole

 3   point is that the attorney could be providing advice

 4   that would steer the debtor away from doing anything

 5   wrong.   And yet the other -- the government would say,

 6   oh, no, no, no, no; you are trying to tell him it's okay

 7   to take the trip to Tahiti.            If he says you can take the

 8   trip to Tahiti so long as your intent is not to defraud

 9   the debtor -- correct advice that could be read as

10   telling the debtor not to do anything wrong or could be

11   read as giving the debtor a little, as you say, a wink

12   and a nod and saying, you know, what do you intend to

13   do?   And he says, oh, I just intend to go on vacation,

14   not to defraud the debtors.

15                 MR. JAY:    I think, Your Honor, subject to

16   some kind of situations of willful blindness, that the

17   attorney in that situation would not be read by any

18   factfinder to have advised a -- to have advised her

19   client to incur additional debt in contemplation of

20   bankruptcy.

21                 And it is -- it is that that is the

22   statutory touchstone.

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Well, let's take some of

24   the examples that were in the amicus brief.                One of them

25   was the debtor is just told by her doctor that she has a


                                       40

 1   serious cancer that needs operation and radiation, and

 2   she is at the end of the line on resources.               She has her

 3   trade tools, which she could sell to get some money, but

 4   then she won't be able to carry on her business.               And

 5   she could also borrow money, but incurring that debt --

 6   since she's on the brink of the bankruptcy, she's

 7   incurring the debt knowing that she's on the brink of

 8   bankruptcy.

 9                 Could the lawyer say, you don't have to sell

10   your -- the lawyer could say:              Sell your equipment.

11   That wouldn't be a problem.             But could the lawyer say,

12   incur the debt?

13                 MR. JAY:     I think the lawyer under a number

14   of circumstances could say incur the debt.               Precisely --

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, take this

16   circumstance.     There is no other -- the person is on a

17   brink of bankruptcy, has no resources, can get money by

18   selling assets or by borrowing.

19                 MR. JAY:     Well, if I may, Justice Ginsburg,

20   the hypothetical doesn't state how she's going to borrow

21   the money.    So for example, if she has an open home

22   equity line of credit and she borrows against that home

23   equity line of credit, it's a secured loan that is not

24   going to be discharged in a Chapter 7 proceeding, I

25   think that that's unobjectionable under our reading of


                                        41
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the statute.   It's not -- it's not abusive, because it's

 2   not an abuse of the bankruptcy system.

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Suppose she doesn't have

 4   a home equity loan.      Suppose she's a renter?

 5               MR. JAY:      Well, the two -- the two scenarios

 6   that our view -- that in our view are covered by the

 7   statute are taking on debt in an attempt to abuse the

 8   bankruptcy system or to defraud the creditor.                 And even

 9   -- even someone without -- without a home equity loan, a

10   home equity line of credit, can take on additional debt

11   without intending to defraud the creditor simply by --

12   by intending to repay it.

13               And that is illustrated in the Culver case,

14   in which the attorney had advised the client to take on

15   additional debt, to -- indeed, he gave her a credit card

16   application and said, get some more cash advances.                 And

17   she said:   I don't want to take on this additional debt.

18   And he said:   Don't worry, I will represent you in

19   bankruptcy; you won't have to repay a penny of it.                 And

20   the Court of Appeals of Maryland explained that that was

21   unethical advice under the Rule 1.2(d), the model rule

22   that applies in just about every jurisdiction.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You can come up with

24   your own hypotheticals that are a lot easier from your

25   point of view, and Justice Ginsburg has been suggesting


                                      42
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   some that are much more difficult because they depend on

 2   particular facts.     And under your construction it seems

 3   to me that a lawyer trying to give correct, legal,

 4   ethical advice has got to pause before every sentence

 5   and think, oh, is this going to be construed in

 6   violation of subsection (a)(4)?

 7               MR. JAY:       I don't think so, Mr. Chief

 8   Justice, and I'm certainly not attempting to fight

 9   Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical.                 I'm attempting to

10   illustrate that -- that the aspect of the statute that

11   prohibits advice to defraud creditors, you know, will

12   turn on, among other things, whether there is any intent

13   to repay the debt.

14               JUSTICE ALITO:            Isn't something in

15   contemplation of bankruptcy done only -- isn't something

16   done in contemplation of bankruptcy only if it is done

17   because of the anticipation of filing a bankruptcy

18   petition?   So that if -- if a person takes on additional

19   debt in order to obtain life-saving treatment, that is

20   not done in contemplation of bankruptcy; it's not done

21   because of the bankruptcy.            It's done because there is

22   an emergency that requires immediate expenditures.

23               MR. JAY:       I think that that's right, Justice

24   Alito, that in that hypothetical there is no -- the mere

25   -- the mere fact that the bankruptcy may be looming,


                                        43

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   even in the hypothetical, is not the animating cause.

 2   And the Court has --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           If indeed "in contemplation

 4   of bankruptcy" means, as -- as you argue, that it has to

 5   be for the purpose of abusing the Bankruptcy Code --

 6   right?   If that's true, then aren't all these vagueness

 7   arguments irrelevant, because it would be illegal

 8   anyway, wouldn't it?

 9                 MR. JAY:     Well --

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           So even without this

11   statute, the lawyer would have to worry about -- about

12   whether he's doing something that is unlawful.

13                 MR. JAY:     The two prongs of -- of our

14   reading of the statute, that's right, Justice Scalia,

15   are to abuse the Bankruptcy Code or to -- or to defraud

16   creditors.    The fraud of course is illegal --

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But the point is you

18   don't know.     Of course you can't give advice to do

19   something illegal.       But I -- I would think that some of

20   the questions have been suggesting that it's hard to

21   know whether it's illegal.            You yourself say it depends

22   on the debtor's intent.         So if a client came in to me

23   and said, can I do this, and it depends on his intent,

24   as a lawyer I would want to say:                 It depends on why you

25   are doing it.     But if -- but that I think could be

 1   construed as being -- giving advice in contemplation of

 2   bankruptcy.

 3                 MR. JAY:    But precisely because, Mr. Chief

 4   Justice, the definition of fraud turns on the defendant

 5   or the fraudulent actor's intent, that's true under

 6   present law, under Rule 1.2(d) which prohibits all

 7   attorneys from counseling their clients to commit

 8   fraudulent acts.

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          The lawyer runs that risk

10   anyway, whether this statute applies or not.                 He has --

11   he has to decide whether what he is doing is a fraud on

12   creditors.

13                 MR. JAY:    Or an abuse of the Bankruptcy

14   Code.   And as Justice Ginsburg pointed out in

15   Mr. Brunstad's argument, that is something that the

16   attorney already must be familiar with under Section

17   707(b) and must certify in filing any Chapter 7

18   bankruptcy that in -- after the attorney's professional

19   investigation, that the granting of relief would not be

20   an abuse of the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

21                 Attorneys are -- are making that

22   certification every day when they are filing for Chapter

23   7 bankruptcies.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               This is a regulation

25   of the attorney-client relationship to pursue an


                                       45
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   unrelated substantive objective.               You want to ensure

 2   that debtors don't do something and you think, well, the

 3   way -- it's not enough to tell debtors, don't do this.

 4   You're going to say:     We are going to regulate what

 5   lawyers tell them as a way of pursuing an unrelated

 6   objective.

 7                MR. JAY:    I don't think it's unrelated,

 8   Mr. Chief Justice.      The objective is in many -- in some

 9   instances criminal and in other instances it is

10   prohibited by the Bankruptcy Code.                And the reason

11   that --

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, the objective

13   is criminal; that doesn't mean it is not being

14   indirectly enforced by interfering with the

15   attorney-client relationship.

16                MR. JAY:    Well, it is certainly --

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- or affecting the

18   attorney-client relationship.

19                MR. JAY:    It is certainly true,

20   Mr. Chief Justice, that the attorney is the

21   sophisticated player here.          It is the attorney who is

22   the repeat player, and it is the attorney who, by being

23   made subject to this statute, is --

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Yes, it's a good way

25   to enforce it, to tell people you can't get legal advice

 1   about it.

 2               What if a State thinks that there are too

 3   many punitive damage awards, that they are out of

 4   control, and so it passes a law saying lawyers may not

 5   tell their clients that they can get -- they can seek

 6   punitive damages?

 7               MR. JAY:       Well, Mr. Chief Justice, seeking

 8   punitive damages is not illegal --

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Oh, if it's done

10   with the purpose of fraud, it is.                  If you think, well,

11   I'm really -- I really wasn't -- it really wasn't

12   malicious conduct, I know that, or whatever the standard

13   is for punitive damages, then it's illegal, just like

14   here if you incur debt to defraud your debtors it's

15   illegal, but if you don't it's not.

16               MR. JAY:       Well, I think that the restriction

17   that you're positing is that advice ever to seek

18   punitive damages is -- is going to be --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Oh, no, no, no, no.

20   Only if it's -- you know, it says you can't give that

21   advice in contemplation of filing a lawsuit.

22               MR. JAY:       Well, no.           That would, of course,

23   would be outside the bankruptcy context, and we are

24   relying in part here on -- both on the avoidance

25   doctrine and on the meaning that "in contemplation of


                                        47
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   bankruptcy" has had for a long time.

 2                 But -- but to answer your question, I think

 3   that, if there is actually a tie between -- so that

 4   sounds exactly to me like a prohibition saying to the

 5   lawyer, don't file complaints for punitive damages that

 6   aren't supported just under the normal Rule 11 evidence

 7   standard.     And I don't think that that is an

 8   impermissible attempt to --

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, no, no.   It's a

10   difference between filing, because there the lawyer

11   signs the -- signs the complaint.                  It's giving advice to

12   the client.

13                 And the -- I guess what I would see as the

14   parallel is that it's an objective outside the

15   attorney-client relationship.              It's not like saying, you

16   can't charge more than 50 percent contingent fee or --

17   or whatever -- you know, designed to regulate the

18   client -- protect the client.

19                 It's -- it's a totally extraneous objective.

20                 MR. JAY:     Well, here, I don't think -- I

21   don't think it's an extraneous objective.                  Perhaps I am

22   misunderstanding how you -- how the Court is meaning

23   extraneous.

24                 The -- here, the advice is the motivating

25   cause in some of these instances of the -- of the debtor

 1   taking the step that's going to lead to actual harm to

 2   the debtor.

 3                 That's why Congress provided that the remedy

 4   for a violation of this is either an injunctive action

 5   by a government official, the U.S. trustee or by the

 6   Court or State attorney general, or actual damages paid

 7   to the debtor who has suffered harm from the unethical

 8   or abuse of advice given to him or her by the attorney.

 9                 So I think that saying that -- that it's

10   extraneous to the attorney-client relationship, I think

11   that's not the statute that -- that Congress enacted

12   here.

13                 It enacted a statute that protects the

14   client from improper, unethical, abusive, or even

15   criminal -- criminally fraudulent advice by the

16   attorney.

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           One thing that lawyers

18   who render services for money want -- is to be sure that

19   they will get paid, and one part of this provision, this

20   526(a)(4), talks about incurring debt to pay an attorney

21   for representing the debtor.

22                 So what can a lawyer say safely about the

23   lawyer's getting paid?

24                 MR. JAY:    Well, I would like to note, if I

25   may, Justice Ginsburg, that we don't think that that is

 1   properly part of this challenge.              I will be happy -- I

 2   will be happy to answer the question, but the court of

 3   appeals struck down this statute, and it said, nine

 4   times, that it was talking about the portion of the

 5   statute referring to in contemplation of bankruptcy.

 6              And the to pay an attorney provision was not

 7   addressed in the Petitioner's brief in the court of

 8   appeals or in their brief in opposition to our cert

 9   position, so we don't -- we don't think it's properly

10   here -- it hasn't been addressed.

11              But to -- to answer your question, the

12   statute says not -- and this part of the statute is on

13   page 5a of the appendix to our brief -- "to advise an

14   assisted person to incur more debt to pay an attorney or

15   bankruptcy petition preparer."

16              So advising the client -- you know, that the

17   client ought to pay the fee -- you know, here's my bill,

18   my fee is due on day X, that simply doesn't come within

19   the terms of the statute.        It's only to incur more debt

20   to pay the attorney.

21              And the situation that we think Congress is

22   getting at is the circumstance where the attorney wants

23   to be paid up-front, again, like in the Culver case, the

24   attorney wants his client to take out a cash advance

25   from the credit card company, knowing -- and to give


                                     50
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that money to the attorney to pay his fee, precisely

 2   because the debt's going to be -- the unsecured debt to

 3   the credit card company is going to be discharged in

 4   bankruptcy.

 5                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             That's -- that's the

 6   clear case.     How about the person comes in, shows the

 7   attorney his or her financial state.                     There is no money

 8   to pay the fee.     The attorney simply gives a bill and

 9   says, "I need it by Friday."

10                 No self-respecting person would believe that

11   the individual is going to pay that bill without

12   borrowing money from somewhere, if you have looked at

13   their financial statement and there is no money to be

14   had.     Would the attorney have violated the statute

15   there?

16                 MR. JAY:     I don't think so, Justice

17   Sotomayor, precisely because the attorney -- the

18   attorney still hasn't issued the advice to incur more

19   debt.     I mean, the client, of course, also has the

20   opportunity -- or the option of not paying the fee and

21   carrying it -- carrying it forward into bankruptcy.

22                 So, in any event, we don't think that that

23   provision can -- can be the basis for a holding that the

24   other provision about in contemplation of bankruptcy is

25   substantially overbroad, which is what the court of


                                        51

 1   appeals held here.

 2                If I may, unless the Court has further

 3   questions on --

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Just one.   So,

 5   basically, your bottom line is any advice to incur debt

 6   to pay an attorney is illegal?

 7                MR. JAY:     To incur more debt to pay an

 8   attorney, I think -- I think that is the import of the

 9   statute, and that's because Congress recognized that

10   there is an incentive for attorneys to put pressure on

11   their clients to -- to favor the attorney as creditor,

12   to, essentially, treat the attorney as a creditor in a

13   better position than other creditors.

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Perhaps I am being --

15   not quite understanding you.             You are underscoring the

16   more debt, that is going to always be additional, if the

17   advice is to incur it.        So what meaning are you giving

18   to more that I am missing?

19                MR. JAY:     Well, in some of the examples that

20   have come up in the briefing in this case -- you know, a

21   refinancing transaction, for example -- you know, or a

22   sale -- sale of the house and replacing it with a

23   rental.    We don't think that that is more debt.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:           I don't how this works

25   exactly.    I'm not an expert.           I thought that, when


                                       52

 1   someone goes bankrupt, that one of the things you ask

 2   the bankruptcy judge for is permission to pay for

 3   ongoing expenses, and that would include an attorney's

 4   fee.   Otherwise, people could never be represented.

 5                MR. JAY:     It's true that the court can

 6   authorize --

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:          Well, so why is there some

 8   incentive here?   All the attorney has to do is follow

 9   ordinary procedure.

10                MR. JAY:     Precisely because, Justice Breyer,

11   different standards apply to the -- to payments made to

12   the attorney before the bankruptcy commences and

13   payments made to the attorney after the bankruptcy

14   commences.

15                It's a -- the standard of scrutiny after the

16   bankruptcy commences is a -- is a bit more searching

17   under Section 330.

18                If the Court has no further questions on

19   Section 526, I do want to address Section 528, the --

20   the advertising disclosure requirements.               And, there, we

21   think that, as Justice Sotomayor brought out in her

22   exchange with Mr. Brunstad, there is no evidence in this

23   case pertaining to the particular advertisements that

24   petitioners want to run.

25                They simply say, on pages 38 and 39 of the


                                      53
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   joint appendix, that they have advertised, and they wish

 2   to continue to advertise.         There is no allegation about

 3   their content.   And they sought and were granted summary

 4   judgment in the district court on the theory that this

 5   statute is unconstitutional.

 6              And so to the extent that it's anything

 7   other than a facial challenge, it's an as-applied

 8   challenge, as applied, essentially, to any attorney or,

 9   indeed, anyone who wants to run these advertisements.

10              We think that, as I understand the gravamen

11   of Petitioners' argument, is that the two-sentence

12   suggested text is incorrect, that it's -- that it's

13   misleading because it's wrong.

14              And the basis for that is saying that some

15   people who are debt relief agencies don't help people

16   file for bankruptcy relief under the Bankruptcy Code.

17   That is not correct.

18              JUSTICE ALITO:           But isn't it misleading for

19   an attorney to say, I'm a -- I'm a debt relief agency?

20   Nobody is going to know what a debt relief agency is,

21   unless they are familiar with this statute.

22              MR. JAY:      Well --

23              JUSTICE ALITO:           A perspective client looks

24   at that, and they say, well, I don't want a debt relief

25   agency, I want a lawyer.

 1               MR. JAY:       Well --

 2               JUSTICE ALITO:            That's misleading.

 3               MR. JAY:       Four points on that, Justice

 4   Alito.

 5               First, the advertisement can and indeed, I'm

 6   sure always will, say that the advertiser is a lawyer.

 7   Nothing forbids the advertisement from saying that.

 8   There is no restriction on what content goes in the ad,

 9   only that it include this is disclaimer.

10               Second, the term "debt relief agency" is a

11   new one.   It was coined by Congress in 2005 precisely

12   because it includes -- it includes attorneys; it

13   includes bankruptcy petition preparers.                  They had to --

14   you know, they had to come up with an amalgamated term

15   that includes them both.          The fact that it's a new term

16   -- it came freighted with no -- no preceding -- no

17   baggage from its preceding history, and indeed, if the

18   statute were on the books and allowed to take affect

19   once this challenge is disposed of, I am confident that

20   the meaning would become much more well-accepted.

21               And the Petitioners have invited the Court,

22   and this is on page 87 of their opening brief, to look

23   at their website.     And of course that's outside the

24   record, but to the extent that the Court looks at it,

25   the Court will see that Petitioners refer to their


                                        55
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   bankruptcy practice as providing debt relief.                  We think

 2   that's a natural way of -- of pitching what the services

 3   made available by a bankruptcy attorney are:                  Relief

 4   from one's debts.     So we don't think there is anything

 5   wrong with that term.

 6               But I do want to turn back to why it's not

 7   correct to say that a debt relief agency would ever not

 8   -- not help people file for bankruptcy relief under the

 9   Bankruptcy Code.    That is because, as I understand

10   Petitioners' argument, it's that an assisted person

11   might be a creditor.       That is not correct.

12               The definition of "assisted person" turns on

13   having nonexempt property in excess of a certain amount.

14   Under section 522(l) of the Bankruptcy Code, and indeed

15   under this Court's decision in Owen v. Owen, there is no

16   exempt property until there is a filing for bankruptcy

17   and an assembly of the bankruptcy estate and a filing by

18   the debtor, or someone on the debtor's behalf, filing

19   schedules that specify what property the debtor has and

20   which exemptions the debtor chooses to claim.                  That is

21   only done when there is a debtor.                  Creditors don't do

22   that.   Creditors don't have nonexempt property.                 We

23   don't think a creditor could be an assisted person.

24               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               How about a law firm

25   that represents the biggest companies in the world?                     And


                                        56

 1   so they are never going to consciously, intentionally

 2   seek out or represent a person defined with the

 3   financial limitations of this category.                 But it so

 4   happens that one of their very rich clients comes in and

 5   says, I have a small -- my brother-in-law is running a

 6   small business; help him or her.

 7                Is that firm in violation now because their

 8   advertisements did not include what 528(a) required?

 9                MR. JAY:     Well, first, Justice Sotomayor,

10   if, for example, they do it pro bono, then it wouldn't

11   -- then it wouldn't trigger the definition at all.                   But

12   assuming that the brother-in-law pays for the services,

13   then yes.    I mean, yes --

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So they have to -- for

15   this one brother-in-law, they have to amend -- they're

16   now violated the statute ex post facto somehow?

17                MR. JAY:     Not ex post facto, Justice

18   Sotomayor.    They would become a debt relief agency, and

19   thereafter, advertisements directed to the public that

20   advertise those specific services, and if they don't

21   have a bankruptcy practice at all, or don't advertise

22   the services that are listed in section 528, then the

23   disclaimer requirement doesn't apply at all.                But if

24   they then chose --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:           If they're -- if they're,


                                       57

 1   as the hypothetical suggests, representing only big

 2   companies, they're probably not advertising to the

 3   general public anyway.

 4               MR. JAY:      That -- that may well be.             Well,

 5   they may have a website, Justice Scalia, but big firms

 6   have to deal already with multifarious disclaimer

 7   requirements in every State where they practice, and

 8   firm websites often have a lengthy set of disclaimers;

 9   you know, one required by Texas, and one required by New

10   York, and so on.   This is something that -- that

11   multijurisdictional firms are already familiar with, and

12   they provide these disclaimers without problem.                 And --

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You said that one of the

14   aspects of this that makes it horrible is that they are

15   not limited to saying, "We are debt relief agencies; we

16   help people file for bankruptcy."                 They can say anything

17   else.   But there's no screening -- there is no

18   administrator that a law firm can go to and say, "This

19   is what I think is substantially similar.                 Is it okay?"

20               MR. JAY:      That is true, Justice Ginsburg,

21   and there is of course the safe harbor.                 By using this

22   two-sentence statement, the advertiser is certain that

23   there will be no problem.

24               But I think that -- that a substantially --

25   a substantially similar statement is a permissive


                                       58

 1   standard, and if there would be any constitutional

 2   doubt, it would be to resolve it in flexibility in that

 3   regard.

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, Counsel.

 5                Mr. Brunstad, you have three minutes

 6   remaining.

 7            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.

 8                ON BEHALF OF MILAVETZ, GALLOP &

 9                    MILAVETZ, P.A., ET AL.

10                MR. BRUNSTAD:         Thank you.

11                Justice Ginsburg, your example about the

12   woman who is in need of medical attention falls squarely

13   within the statute.      The lawyer would be prohibited from

14   advising her to incur debt to get needed medical

15   attention, and the government, in trying to articulate a

16   way around that during the course of the argument,

17   articulated no less than five different standards.

18                The conduct would have to be fraudulent or

19   unethical or abusive or criminal or improper.                None of

20   those are in the statute, and it's impossible to know

21   which one.    Chief Justice Roberts, you are absolutely

22   right:    What this statute does is it's basically trying

23   to interfere with the attorney-client relationship, and

24   even moreso on the side of "or pay an attorney. "

25                And Justice Breyer, here's how it works.


                                       59

 1   The client comes to -- the prospective client comes to

 2   the lawyer and is in trouble.           And may not know whether

 3   the client has to file for bankruptcy or not.                 So there

 4   is a conversation that happens.             And in that

 5   conversation, it may be decided that the best thing for

 6   the client to do is to file for bankruptcy, and of

 7   course, the client will have to know:                 How am I going to

 8   pay for this?

 9              Well, there are two ways.                  One, the client

10   can pay the attorney in full, up front, or the attorney

11   can take payment over time.          However, this all happens

12   before bankruptcy, so there is no involvement of the

13   Court at this point.     If the attorney accepts payment

14   over time, which many do, because it's very expensive to

15   file for bankruptcy now and most debtors don't have the

16   wherewithal, the attorney, by saying, I take payment

17   over time, and the debtor accepting that, the debtor

18   would be incurring debt in contemplation of bankruptcy.

19   Incurring debt to the attorney.             The attorney would be

20   proscribed, under the statute, from actually giving that

21   particular advice.

22              JUSTICE BREYER:           What the attorney says is,

23   Here's what we will do; when we file for bankruptcy, I

24   will ask the Court to approve my own fees as something

25   that is continuing after bankruptcy.

 1                MR. BRUNSTAD:        Exactly.

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:          And he says, This is what

 3   they will be.

 4                So what is the harm --

 5                MR. BRUNSTAD:        Because you can't --

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:          -- since that's what he has

 7   to do, of making him tell his client that that's what he

 8   has to do?

 9                MR. BRUNSTAD:        Because you can't advise the

10   client in advance to incur that debt.

11                JUSTICE BREYER:          No, you -- you can't?       This

12   prevents you had from saying, What I'm going to do is

13   ask the bankruptcy judge to approve what I just said?

14                MR. BRUNSTAD:        Well, that has to happen

15   anyway under section --

16                JUSTICE BREYER:          Of course.       And so what's

17   wrong with the law that tells the lawyer that's what he

18   has to tell the client?

19                MR. BRUNSTAD:        Because there, in that

20   situation, you would be advising the client to incur the

21   debt.   In other words, be advising the client to incur

22   the debt, not the actual incurrence of the debt.

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:          I don't read the

24   hypothetical that you have given as coming within the

25   statute.   I think what -- what it means:              Incurred debt

 1   to pay an attorney, I don't think it means debt to the

 2   attorney.   You are not worried about the attorney

 3   cheating himself.

 4               MR. BRUNSTAD:           Well, except debt --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Making himself an

 6   additional creditor.       That's ridiculous.

 7               MR. BRUNSTAD:           But debt is --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:             What it talks about is

 9   inducing the client to -- to borrow money from somebody

10   else to pay the attorney.           You know, and that seems to

11   be perfectly reasonable.

12               MR. BRUNSTAD:           I think it includes both,

13   Justice Scalia.   For example, you couldn't advises your

14   client to borrow $1,000 from your mother.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:             That's right.

16               MR. BRUNSTAD:           And you couldn't -- and you

17   also, I think, advise a client to basically borrow money

18   from you, the attorney.         You're extending services on

19   credit; that's incurring a debt.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why -- why would you worry

21   about the attorney, you know, hurting himself?

22               MR. BRUNSTAD:           Because the statute --

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:             It makes no sense.

24               MR. BRUNSTAD:           It's at least unclear,

25   Justice Scalia, and that is the heart of the problem.

 1   It's very unclear.

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, Counsel.
