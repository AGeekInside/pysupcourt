 7                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EVAN TAGER

 8                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9              MR. TAGER:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10   and may it please the Court:

11              The barriers to interstate commerce imposed

12   by the flow control ordinances in this case are even

13   more severe than those resulting from the ordinance this

14   Court struck down in Carbone.              As in Carbone, no local

15   waste can leave the counties for processing.                  In

16   addition, now that Respondent's landfill is up and

17   running no local waste can leave the counties for

18   disposal either.    The issue here is whether Carbone is

19   inapplicable to this outright embargo merely because

20   Respondent's own the facilities to which the haulers are

21   required to bring the waste.             The answer is no, and the

22   reason is that the concerns underlying the Commerce

23   Clause are implicated whether interstate commerce was

24   being obstructed for the benefit of a public enterprise

25   or a private one.

 1               The whole point of the Commerce Clause was

 2   to promote the national economy and to put an end to

 3   parochial barriers to interstate trade.                 This Court has

 4   consistently held that embargoes, local processing

 5   requirements, and other barriers to interstate commerce

 6   violate the Commerce Clause because such laws inevitably

 7   prompt resentment, retaliation, and ultimately --

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:             I guess in many thousands

 9   of municipalities throughout the United States it's

10   fairly common to have a locally owned electricity

11   distribution company, or an electrically -- or a gas

12   distribution company.      And I thought it was fairly

13   common for a municipally owned pipeline, gas pipeline,

14   or electricity distribution to say, if you live in our

15   town you've got to buy from us; you've got to buy from

16   the local community.      And I guess that's been going on

17   for about 110 years.

18               And yet I've never seen anybody think or

19   write or anything that that violated the Commerce

20   Clause.   But of course, there could be somebody in

21   another State who'd like to sell electricity to the

22   people in our town.     They can't do it because the town

23   says, we own the company and you got to buy from us.

24               Now, if we agree with you are we saying that

25   all those gas companies, distribution companies, et

 1   cetera, are behaving unconstitutionally?

 2               MR. TAGER:        The first point of clarification

 3   on that is the question -- the question is does strict

 4   scrutiny apply.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:              No, I'm not interested in

 6   tests.   I'm interested in just the outcome.                   I just

 7   raise the question.

 8               MR. TAGER:        Yes.        I am not, I am not sure

 9   that it's correct that in all of those municipalities

10   you hypothesize that they are actually pairing their

11   provision of local --

12               JUSTICE BREYER:              Well, I used to teach the

13   subject and I can't say you're wrong.                    But I knew that

14   it was a fairly common thing to have a certification

15   that gave you a -- as a company, it would give them a

16   local area in which they had an exclusive monopoly.                       And

17   that was common and it was called a service area, and in

18   the local town, the service area, I never even heard of

19   a company trying to come in and sell from abroad,

20   because I thought that this certificate gave them an

21   exclusive right to provide the local electricity service

22   or the natural gas service.              I mean, it's a fairly

23   obvious thing.    And I might be wrong and I mention that

24   my memory -- I've never focused directly on it.                    Just

25   everybody I read and everything I read, I assumed the


                                         5

 1   constitutionality of this.          But of course, memory is

 2   fallible, including mine.          Therefore, I raise the

 3   question.

 4               MR. TAGER:       Well, if the utility is -- if

 5   the utility is privately owned --

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:             No, no.         I'm not talking

 7   about that because I guess that would be trying to

 8   attack Carbone.   Far be it from me.

 9               But I know at least there are these things

10   called municipal gas utilities and municipal electricity

11   companies; and during the New Deal that was thought to

12   be quite a good thing, and that's years ago.                   In all

13   that time when people were attacking New Deal agencies,

14   I've never seen an attack based on this ground.

15               MR. TAGER:       Well, I think that the same

16   logic would apply as in --

17               JUSTICE BREYER:             Yeah, I think it would.

18   The same logic would apply.

19               MR. TAGER:       And it would apply to all of the

20   cases this Court has ever held.              In every single case

21   involving an embargo or a local processing requirement

22   or a local needs requirement, if you just substitute "in

23   public ownership" you'd have the exact same case --

24               JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, the fact is there is

25   a difference between public ownership and giving an


                                        6

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   exclusive franchise to a public company.                   And the public

 2   ownership means that the people of the State have

 3   decided to have their own little nationalized industry,

 4   which again people don't like, many.                   But I never knew

 5   there was anything in the Constitution that forbid it.

 6              MR. TAGER:       Well, I think that the whole

 7   point of the Commerce Clause was to stop these kind of

 8   --

 9              JUSTICE BREYER:             Nationalized industries?

10              MR. TAGER:       Well, to stop the idea that

11   everything can be localized.

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, but you don't

13   even have to get into the theory.               What happens in a lot

14   of municipalities of course is that they decide, well,

15   we're going to run the waste treatment facility and

16   we're going to tax the people in the municipality to

17   support it and the service is going to be free.                  Now, is

18   that a violation of the Commerce Clause?

19              MR. TAGER:       If they're only providing it for

20   free and not barring you --

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Yes.

22              MR. TAGER:       -- from engaging in interstate

23   commerce, in the event, for example, that you found

24   there to be some additional benefit from engaging in an

25   interstate transaction, I think we would have -- the


                                       7

 1   Commerce Clause would be implicated.                      But as a practical

 2   matter, they would be able to accomplish much the same

 3   thing because most people would take the free service.

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Well, I don't understand.

 5   You know, as far as the impact on out of State

 6   competitors are concerned, it's exactly the same.                      The

 7   State or the municipality runs its own waste disposal

 8   facility.   There is no charge for dumping the waste

 9   there.   The cost of it is entirely covered by taxes.

10   Okay.

11               Now, the people you're representing, out of

12   state people who would provide dumping grounds for this

13   waste, they would charge 9 dollars a ton or whatever

14   they would charge.      It would be more than what the

15   municipality is charging.

16               Now, why isn't that a restraint on

17   interstate commerce, discrimination against interstate

18   commerce?

19               MR. TAGER:         Well, it's market participation

20   if all they're doing is public collection and bringing

21   it --

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Oh, I'm sorry.        You have to

23   dump your waste in the municipal garbage dump.

24               MR. TAGER:         If you parrot the Flow Control

25   ordinance I think it's exactly the same.

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Okay, so that's fair.     Even

 2   if they support it entirely by taxes?

 3                 MR. TAGER:       Yes.

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             So that they're not

 5   competing in the marketplace in any way, they're not

 6   getting any money from the people who are dumping

 7   garbage.     They get money from the whole tax base.

 8                 MR. TAGER:       The impact on the interstate

 9   market is the same, and I think that --

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Oh, it is indeed.

11                 MR. TAGER:       -- the Court's Commerce

12   Clause --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             I didn't think you'd be

14   willing to go that far, but you'd say that that violates

15   the Commerce Clause.

16                 MR. TAGER:       But I don't think I -- let me be

17   clear.   We don't need to win that case in order to win

18   this case, because in this case --

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, I'm not so sure.

20                 MR. TAGER:       This case is almost on all fours

21   with Carbone.    All you've done is transfer the

22   ownership.    As you know, in Carbone that facility was

23   destined to be owned within less than 2 years from the

24   time the Court issued its opinion.

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But in the majority


                                          9

 1   opinion, as opposed to the dissent, at least as I read

 2   it, on almost every page it uses words like "local

 3   operator," "local enterprise," "local proprietor,"

 4   "local business," doesn't speak, as the dissent did,

 5   about a municipal facility.             It seems great care was

 6   taken in the majority to not characterize that transfer

 7   pledge as a municipal facility.

 8              MR. TAGER:         Well, two responses to that,

 9   Justice Ginsburg.    First, there were other references

10   where the opinion said "the town's facility."                   Indeed,

11   the Flow Control witness himself referred to it as the

12   town's facility.

13              And the other response is, to call someone a

14   proprietor doesn't mean that they're private.                   In this

15   case, they're charging $81 -- or $86 a ton.                   Every ton

16   that comes in, they make more money.

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               I'm sorry.    At least as I

18   read the Carbone opinion, it didn't deal with the

19   public-private distinction.             It seemed to assume it was

20   a private entrepreneur.         And it didn't take a position

21   one way or another whether there would be a distinction.

22              MR. TAGER:         Well, I don't think the Court

23   affirmatively decided the issue.                I think the

24   distinction didn't matter to the majority.                I think the

25   majority is focusing on the consequences of putting up

 1   barriers to interstate commerce, of putting up embargoes

 2   and local processing requirements.                 And you could take

 3   almost any one of the Court's cases and just substitute

 4   in public ownership.      Take, for example --

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But not -- you know, you

 6   have a whole string of commercial products, but you have

 7   recognized, too, that garbage disposal has for long been

 8   considered a municipal responsibility, a municipal

 9   function.

10                And you also say that the total, the -- what

11   is it -- cradle to grave, if the county took over all of

12   the garbage disposal business, the hauling from the

13   garbage generator to the plant, and then there wouldn't

14   be any commerce problem, right?              But if it does

15   something less, there is?

16                MR. TAGER:      Well, there were two questions

17   embedded there.   Let me see if I can take them in order.

18   The idea that it is a traditional local function, I

19   don't think can support any kind of meaningful test in

20   this case.   The Court has rejected that very - that very

21   standard in Garcia and the Tenth Amendment cases, and

22   prior to that in the intergovernmental tax immunity

23   cases, and the reason it did so is it found that it was

24   unworkable to try to determine what is a traditional

25   government function in any particular case.                The Court


                                       11
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   found that it was in a total line-drawing morass.                      And

 2   so it said we're throwing that out.

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, there is still at

 4   least the obvious distinction, that one of the main

 5   purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause is to prevent

 6   protectionism.    Protectionism is when a state favors its

 7   own producers.    And you could see, indeed a big argument

 8   in Carbone was, you aren't favoring your own producer;

 9   well, we are at least favoring one.                      But now where the

10   municipality is running it itself, no one is favored.

11                 So I don't think it was an object of the

12   Commerce Clause to prevent a State from favoring its own

13   government.

14                 MR. TAGER:      I don't know whether the framers

15   considered it but I do know --

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, it's about --

17                 MR. TAGER:      -- protectionism wasn't the only

18   thing that they were concerned about.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, is there something

20   here that is not protection?             Because Carbone was still

21   perhaps viewing it most favorably, an extreme case of

22   protection, only one individual was protected.

23                 MR. TAGER:      No.       First of all, what was

24   being protected was this plan.               The town had to fund its

25   transfer station, a transfer station that it was going

 1   to take possession of less than two years after this

 2   Court decided the case.

 3                 So the protectionism that was going on there

 4   was really protection of their investment in their

 5   scheme.

 6                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           But it was also

 7   protectionism -- I mean, I didn't agree with this at the

 8   time, but I mean there, it -- you have to admit that

 9   there was protectionism of the one licensee, the person

10   who constructed the plant and was going to sell it to

11   the town for a dollar.        That, so far as we know, that

12   person or that company was in it for the money.

13                 And so for the period of the five years

14   prior to the transfer to the town for the dollar, that

15   particular entity was being protected so it could make

16   money, and therefore, make it worthwhile for that

17   company to sell its, its real estate to the town for a

18   dollar.   Surely that entity was being protected

19   handsomely.

20                 MR. TAGER:      But it would be equally

21   protected, Your Honor, if the government owned the

22   facility but said you keep all the tipping fees until

23   it's paid off and take a nice profit on top, too.

24                 This distinction --

25                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, that's -- that's a

 1   third case but that's not the question we have here, is

 2   it?

 3                 MR. TAGER:      Well, the case you have here is

 4   are you going to adopt a new formalistic particular

 5   distinction between public and private ownership, when

 6   in the past this Court has concluded that a lot of these

 7   other distinctions were unworkable.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, so, you say

 9   formalistic as if it's a bad thing.                      But the, the

10   distinction, say in the First Amendment, if the private

11   contractor the day before the municipality bought the

12   facility for a dollar had fired an employee because of

13   his or her political views, you wouldn't argue that that

14   is state action just because the next day it was going

15   to be controlled by the public entity.                     And yet the next

16   day, that type of action would be subject to First

17   Amendment scrutiny.      It may be a formalistic distinction

18   but in many areas of the law it makes all the

19   difference.

20                 MR. TAGER:      Well, I just think you are going

21   to be walking into so many line-drawing problems because

22   if that example is one, are you going to require 100

23   percent public ownership, or a majority interest, 50-50?

24   Once you go down this road, I think it is just opening

25   up a huge can of worms when the focus ought to be what

 1   is the impact on interstate commerce?                     What we have here

 2   now that the landfill is up and running is an absolute

 3   embargo.   No waste generated in this town, in these

 4   counties, excuse me, can leave the State, period, end of

 5   story.

 6               It is no different, in effect, it is no less

 7   likely to breed resentment and retaliation than --

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   It is kind of

 9   formalistic on the other side because you, I thought you

10   agreed that if the municipality did it through tax

11   revenues and there was no formal flow restriction and

12   yet it only made sense to dump your waste at the free

13   facility, you seem to suggest that would be okay.

14               MR. TAGER:         Well, I'm glad you reminded me

15   of that point.   I meant to make it earlier.                    In West

16   Lynn Creamery this Court said that these kind of things

17   make a difference.      There are certain ways you do things

18   and certain ways you can't do things.                     If you place an

19   embargo, that's traditionally been regarded as subject

20   to strict scrutiny.       If you try to do the same thing by

21   making it free and providing public -- public -- public

22   collection, that's okay.

23               And -- and what the Court cases say is do it

24   the right way and we'll worry about the consequences

25   later.

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Here, I take it the reason

 2   they want to do this is because they wanted their

 3   municipal facility to charge a higher price for the

 4   non-recyclable rubbish and that will encourage people to

 5   segregate the rubbish and thereby have more cyclable --

 6   recyclable rubbish, and therefore overall pay less.

 7                 And that's why they want to do it, and of

 8   course that's not going to work.                If somebody comes in

 9   from out of State and charges a lower price for all of

10   the non-recyclable rubbish or you know, for all rubbish,

11   it just won't work.      It is rather like electricity,

12   interestingly enough, where municipalities would do the

13   same thing.    They want discriminatory rates in order to

14   push out the possibility of poorer people getting

15   electricity.    This they want to do the same thing but

16   they want to do it for rubbish, for, to encourage

17   recycling.

18                 MR. TAGER:      Several answers to that,

19   Justice Breyer.

20                 One, the same argument was made in Carbone.

21   It doesn't matter who owns the facility.

22                 Two, this is an argument about why they

23   might survive strict scrutiny, it's not a -- I know you

24   don't like hearing about that -- but the question here

25   is do we apply strict scrutiny or not.                   And that goes to


                                        16
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the strength of their interest.                And then of course the

 2   question turns on, can it be met in nondiscriminatory

 3   ways?     The answer is "very well."               Since Carbone was

 4   decided, the municipalities have been living with no

 5   flow control, virtually every one in the country, yet

 6   recycling has gone up in the, in that intervening

 7   period.

 8                 Indeed the best way to accomplish recycling

 9   is to charge volume-based fees to, to the -- between the

10   haulers and the, and the generators.                      That's not what is

11   going on here.    They're just charging it at the disposal

12   point.    So there are plenty of communities all -- excuse

13   me -- plenty of communities all over the country that

14   are charging what's known as a batch fee where you pay

15   for each -- you pay -- you get a label, like you put on

16   a bag; you can't dispose of the bag without the label,

17   the label costs a certain amount of money.                      None of

18   these people have flow -- none of these communities have

19   flow control but there's a direct straightforward way.

20                 They can also impose regulations directly on

21   the generators and directly on the haulers to make sure

22   they're doing these things.              So it is hardly a reason

23   for creating a brand-new public-private distinction.

24                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            It sounds to me as though,

25   if we accept your argument that, going back to

 1   Justice Breyer's first question, every municipal utility

 2   in the United States is going to fall.

 3                MR. TAGER:       Well -- I'm not an expert on --

 4   on that industry.

 5                JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, but you know, you know

 6   that there are plenty of, of communities that don't have

 7   municipal utilities and seem to get natural gas.               They

 8   seem to get electricity.          The lights go on.      And

 9   therefore by parity of reasoning to what we have just

10   heard, there just wouldn't be the justification for,

11   let's say, embargoing the importation of electricity and

12   gas by private entities from outside.

13                So that if you win on this argument, no more

14   municipal lifelines.

15                MR. TAGER:       I didn't hear the last part.

16                JUSTICE SOUTER:            No more municipal

17   pipelines.

18                MR. TAGER:       Well, I think they can have the

19   plant.   They just -- assuming that is --

20                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, they'd like to run

21   them as --

22                MR. TAGER:       They'd like to have a monopoly,

23   and --

24                JUSTICE SOUTER:            -- an exclusive monopoly,

25   and in that sense they won't, they won't be around

 1   anymore because the Commerce Clause will, will declare

 2   them unconstitutional.

 3               MR. TAGER:      Well, but that's excluding that

 4   -- as I understand it --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:           You would say that they can

 6   do it so long as they charge less than out of State

 7   people --

 8               MR. TAGER:      Yes.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- and therefore people buy

10   their services because they're cheaper.                So long as they

11   don't prohibit the importation, if they run the

12   municipal facility on tax revenues, and therefore charge

13   very little for the electricity or whatever they're

14   providing, that's perfectly okay for you.               Right?

15               MR. TAGER:      Absolutely.

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:           So long as they don't

17   prohibit anybody from out of State.

18               MR. TAGER:      Yes.

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:           Then where does your

20   argument about formalism go?           Isn't it a formalistic

21   distinction whether the utility does its financing

22   through or its collection through taxes, or through a

23   user fee?

24               You said, you said distinctions on -- I

25   thought you said distinctions like that were purely

 1   formalistic --

 2              MR. TAGER:       Well --

 3              JUSTICE SOUTER:            -- for purposes of the

 4   Commerce Clause, and therefore the distinction I suppose

 5   wouldn't count.

 6              MR. TAGER:       Well, I think what I was talking

 7   about, the public-private distinction, it is different

 8   in kind from saying there are certain kinds of conduct,

 9   some kinds of Government conduct that are permissible

10   like a subsidy, for example, take your South-Central

11   Timber versus Wunnicke case.           The Court said in that

12   opinion you can't impose contractually on the people who

13   buy the timber the obligation to process it in the

14   State; but what you can do is you can subsidize it, so

15   they can't want to do it.         So this is something that has

16   --

17              JUSTICE SOUTER:            There's some, then I guess

18   you are saying some formalistic distinctions, some

19   distinctions that don't make any difference economically

20   but are formalistically different are okay.

21              MR. TAGER:       Well, I'm not sure that one is

22   completely formalistic.       The Court said there, that

23   gives people a choice.      They can still take it out of

24   the State if they want to, and they may have good reason

25   to.

 1                Going back to the trash argument, the trash

 2   example, you could provide it for free; but a consumer

 3   might say, you know what, I'd like to have more days of

 4   pickup than you're providing me.               Or I think their

 5   trucks of this private company are a lot nicer; I'd

 6   rather have a van stopping in front of my house than

 7   your beaten up municipal truck.              So a case like Wunnicke

 8   establishes that that's the way it works.               That it's

 9   okay to have alternatives.          What you can't have is

10   forcing people to do this through regulation.

11                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, I -- is there a

12   distinction between the question Justice Breyer put to

13   you, the hypothetical of a municipal electricity

14   company, and this case?        In this case you have private

15   haulers, you have private waste dumps at the end, you

16   just have a public, a publicly owned and mandated

17   processing center in the middle.

18                It would be as if in the electric case you

19   have private electric companies that generate the power,

20   private electric companies that distribute the power,

21   but they all have to go through a Government-owned

22   transformer at the key.        It seems that's the case you

23   have here.

24                MR. TAGER:      Yes.       That's why --

 4   way you answered Justice Breyer.

 6   Honor.

 8              MR. TAGER:          But what, what I was trying to

 9   get back to was --

10              JUSTICE BREYER:               Like it --

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               But, but then, but then

12   Justice Breyer is going to say well, you --

13              MR. TAGER:          He'd changed the hypo.

14              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               -- that you, that you can

15   bar it altogether but you can't regulate it just a

16   little bit --

18              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               -- actually is greater

19   than the sum of it.

20              JUSTICE BREYER:               I actually point out that

21   California, I think, wants to own the grid and privatize

22   the rest of it.   And there are -- I mean, it --

23   Justice Kennedy is totally right.                  There are all kinds

24   of combinations and permutations.                  There, there could be

25   distributors who are in fact regulated private companies

 1   and local distributors who are owned by the city, and I

 2   guess there, there is one generator, at least, company

 3   that's owned by the -- that's a -- TV -- with TVA.

 4   They, they make their own.

 5                So there are all kinds of permutations and

 6   combinations.    And I think we're getting at, when we

 7   take that aspect of the permutation and combination and

 8   say that aspect of it which is owned by a Government

 9   says:    "Our way or the highway."              You know, that's what

10   they say.    "Buy from us."         Period.

11                And if you're in a certain region, I've

12   always thought they could do that.                  And I have to admit

13   I never really looked it up; I've just never came across

14   a case that says to the contrary.

15                MR. TAGER:       I, I haven't seen a case either

16   way.    It's my, my way of seeing this case law is that

17   there's -- that the rule is simple:                      if you are doing

18   something to interfere with the free flow of interstate

19   commerce, you're subject to strict scrutiny.                      And maybe

20   in that situation, maybe it survives strict scrutiny.                       I

21   don't know that they would in this day and age, when

22   getting, getting gas or other kinds of power to a

23   commercial establishment, for example, is not very

24   difficult and would not necessarily tear up the

25   infrastructure, or whatever.             I think they might --

 1                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           What I guess we really

 2   don't know is whether Justice Breyer's parade of

 3   horribles are cases in which the municipality was able

 4   to provide the service more cheaply if it subsidized it,

 5   in which case there's no burden on commerce, or were

 6   they accompanied by prohibitions against competition, as

 7   Justice Scalia pointed out.             I don't know.

 8                 MR. TAGER:      I think it's hypothetical.

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It's a quite different

10   assumption.

11                 MR. TAGER:      I think his hypothetical assumed

12   a ban.   But I certainly agree with you, Justice Stevens,

13   that if they do it simply by competing, then that's

14   perfectly acceptable.

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, what is your

16   authority for the proposition that we use strict

17   scrutiny?

18                 MR. TAGER:      I draw it from the entire line

19   of cases, from the local processing cases, the embargo

20   cases, the local --

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Can you give me one case

22   of it being strict scrutiny?

23                 MR. TAGER:      For?

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I mean, I just didn't

25   realize that that phrase entered into our Commerce

 1   Clause jurisprudence.     Correct me if I'm wrong.

 2              MR. TAGER:       Well, I was using it as a

 3   synonym for the "virtually per se unconstitutional"

 4   rule.

 5              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            That is to say, if it

 6   discriminates?

 7              MR. TAGER:       If it discriminates, or some of

 8   the earlier cases didn't use the term --

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But certainly on burden

10   cases we don't require that.

11              MR. TAGER:       Well, not the burden that we

12   talk about in the price context.              But in the earlier

13   cases they referred, cases like Minnesota versus Barber

14   and some of the other, earlier cases, refer to it as

15   being burdens on commerce, but clearly what they meant

16   was there are certain kinds of regulations, and I think

17   it's easier to just categorize them, embargoes, local

18   needs requirements, local processing requirements,

19   things likes that, which basically so obstruct

20   interstate commerce as to require the virtual per se

21   rule.

22              Indeed, Pike itself has that very statement.

23   That's sort of the classic case in which you invoke that

24   high level of scrutiny.

25              If the Court has no further questions, I'd

 4             ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL J. CAHILL

 5                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 6              MR. CAHILL:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 7   please the Court:

 8              No decision of this Court has held that

 9   public service is comparable to private enterprise for

10   purposes of dormant Commerce Clause analysis.                  Here the

11   only entity that benefits from these laws is the

12   government itself.

13              JUSTICE ALITO:             All the local processing

14   cases, would they have come other differently if those

15   facilities -- the milk processing plant, the shrimp

16   processing plant, and so forth -- had been publicly

17   owned?

18              MR. CAHILL:           I think, Your Honor, they would

19   be different.    In each of those cases the laws in

20   question operated to protect a private entity or group

21   of entities.    In Dean Mills, for instance, it was a

22   group of private milk pasteurizers within a five-mile

23   radius of the town -- the city of Madison.                  In none of

24   those cases was the government itself engaged in

25   providing the service to the public.

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, it might be a good

 2   revenue device for the government to say, yeah, let's

 3   have our own pasteurizing plant, we'll make it a

 4   criminal offense for anybody to use a facility other

 5   than ours and we'll charge triple the price.

 6               MR. CAHILL:        Your Honor.

 7               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            That's not a burden on

 8   interstate commerce?

 9               MR. CAHILL:        That might be.           In our case

10   that is not the case here.          What we use is a user fee.

11   We have a limit.   There's a limit to a user fee.               We can

12   --

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Suppose the user fee were

14   ten times what it is?

15               MR. CAHILL:        We can only charge something

16   that's reasonably related to the cost of what, of the

17   service that we provide.

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Why is that?

19               MR. CAHILL:        In Evansville Airport, Your

20   Honor, this Court held that -- versus Delta Airlines --

21   that a user fee is constitutionally limited; there has

22   to be a relationship between the cost of a service and

23   the amount that's charged.

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:            So don't call it a user

25   fee.   Call it something else.

 1                 MR. CAHILL:       Your Honor, if we --

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Call it a tax ripoff.

 3                 (Laughter.)

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Then you can charge

 5   whatever you want, so long as you don't call it a user

 6   fee, right?

 7                 MR. CAHILL:       In New York, Your Honor, you

 8   either have to call it a user fee or a tax or something

 9   else.

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Call it a cable TV

11   franchise fee.    I mean, isn't that the way

12   municipalities used to make a lot of money?                  They

13   charged outrageous amounts to give the cable franchise

14   and then grant a monopoly in exchange.

15                 MR. CAHILL:       I don't know what cable

16   franchises base their, base their amounts on.                  I do know

17   that in our case the cost to tip a ton of waste is

18   directly related to the value of the services that we

19   provide to the public.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                To get back to the

21   public-private distinction, what is the answer to

22   Mr. Tager's point that that's difficult to -- what if

23   you have a 50 percent publicly owned, 50 percent

24   privately owned company?          Is that covered by the

25   Commerce Clause cases or not?

 1              MR. CAHILL:         Your Honor, I think that the --

 2   they would not be -- it would not be unconstitutional

 3   under the Commerce Clause cases.               I think that the

 4   distinction is that when government is actually in the

 5   transaction, when it's taking the risks, when it's

 6   spending public money, when it's providing a service

 7   directly to the people, it's a public, it's a public

 8   service.

 9              JUSTICE SOUTER:             But at the same -- exactly

10   that -- that avoids the problem.               At exactly the same

11   time, it's protecting the private 50 percent interest.

12   Why isn't the better answer that in fact that would be

13   subject to Commerce Clause analysis and that would fall,

14   that if the government wants to do this the government's

15   going to do it the way the government's doing it in your

16   case, it's going to be a 100 percent government.                     If it

17   doesn't, it's protectionism.

18              MR. CAHILL:         Your Honor, I agree with you.

19   We don't have 50 percent ownership.                     We don't have any

20   private ownership anywhere.            There are, however,

21   government agencies in other contexts where there is a

22   private partner.   That's a case that isn't here today.

23   But the question was what if there was, and I don't

24   think the answer is automatic one way or the other.

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:             You know, there's a general

 1   agreement throughout the world nowadays that sovereign

 2   immunity, which usually applies to governments, doesn't

 3   apply when the government is engaged in a commercial

 4   activity.     Now, why shouldn't something similar apply to

 5   government regulation which ends up discriminating

 6   against out of State businesses, when the government is

 7   engaging in a commercial activity it is subject to the

 8   restrictions of the Commerce Clause?                      Why isn't that a

 9   reasonable rule?

10                 MR. CAHILL:        I think it is a reasonable

11   rule.     But I don't think that we're engaging in

12   commercial activity in this particular case.                     If we were

13   to offer our services to citizens to whom we do not have

14   a governmental responsibility, then I think we're

15   entering into the realm of competition with the private

16   sector.

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, I suppose any

18   private entity can choose its market.

19                 MR. CAHILL:        Pardon me, Your Honor?

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I suppose any private

21   entity can choose its market.               You're a market

22   participant.     You're saying, we're going to serve this

23   class of consumers.       That's your privilege.                But what

24   you do is you have a market participation which is

25   sanctioned by the criminal law.                You've built this trash

 1   utopia where everybody sends wonderful trash and you

 2   enforce use of that by the criminal law.                So you're

 3   engaging as a market participant, but you're taking an

 4   extra advantage by using the criminal law to enforce, to

 5   enforce its use.

 6               MR. CAHILL:        Your Honor, I don't -- I agree

 7   with you that we're providing a service here, and we do

 8   use the law to require that haulers and generators

 9   participate in the service that we -- in the system that

10   we've created.   We need to have -- to achieve the goals

11   that we're trying to achieve.             We've asked our public to

12   separate their wastes and we've asked our haulers to

13   collect it in a way that's consistent with the programs

14   that we've established.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You could do that by

16   requiring all trash pickup to segregate recyclable and

17   non-recyclable, and if it's going to cost each

18   householder just as much trouble then there could be

19   competition and you would have achieved your goal.                  No?

20               MR. CAHILL:        No, Your Honor.          There is no

21   competition between our program and -- that's offered by

22   the private sector.     What we do is different than what

23   the private sector offers and there's no place else for

24   it to go.   The haulers are required today to comply with

25   the program and to coordinate their activities with the

 1   separation done by the residents and the facilities that

 2   the authority has putting to.

 3               We do things -- we have three different,

 4   three basic differences between what we do and what the

 5   private sector would do.         The first one is to step in

 6   and take some of the risk for proper disposal.            When the

 7   haulers make the decision about where the garbage goes,

 8   there's a liability that attaches to the waste.            If it

 9   goes to the wrong place it's going to follow, follow

10   back both to the hauler and to the person who generated

11   it.   We have had some bad experiences with people making

12   bad decisions about where waste goes in the 1980s and

13   the public asked us to set something up so that they

14   could trust who was making the disposal decisions.            So

15   as a government we've stepped into that problem.            We've

16   stepped into the shoes of the generator, and we're

17   trying to set up a place --

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You could do that by law.

19   You could do that by law.          You could specify that only

20   certain waste facilities can be used.

21               MR. CAHILL:        I think not, Your Honor.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You don't have to run the

23   business in order to assure that, do you?

24               MR. CAHILL:        I think we do.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why?

 1                 MR. CAHILL:       Because we don't have the power

 2   as a local government in New York to talk to landfills

 3   in Ohio or Pennsylvania about how they should run their

 4   facilities.    The only way that we can be sure that it

 5   goes to the right place, that's engineered the right way

 6   and built the right way and run the right way is to

 7   offer to do it ourselves.           And that's what we've --

 8                 JUSTICE ALITO:         But none of that -- in

 9   answer to my earlier question, I thought you said none

10   of that really matters, right?               The only thing that

11   matters is that this is a publicly owned facility.                 You

12   could be selling hamburgers or renting videos and it

13   would come out the same way.

14                 MR. CAHILL:       I think why public ownership

15   matters is that it's not discriminatory.                 I think the

16   strict scrutiny test should not apply when government

17   owns --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           So your answer is yes?

19                 MR. CAHILL:       Yes.

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It doesn't matter?

21   Hamburgers are just as good?

22                 MR. CAHILL:       Well, hamburgers, Your Honor,

23   if the government was going to be the sole purveyor of

24   hamburgers in a community, I think they'd have to have a

25   very, very good reason.         If they had such a good reason,


                                        33

 1   then yes, government could do that.

 2                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, that's just a

 3   question of New York law, isn't it?

 4                MR. CAHILL:       Of --

 5                JUSTICE SOUTER:           I don't know, I don't know

 6   what municipalities can do in New York.                 You say they've

 7   got to have a good reason.          I assume you're referring to

 8   New York law for that purpose.

 9                MR. CAHILL:       I am not, Your Honor.          I have

10   no idea --

11                JUSTICE SOUTER:           What are you referring to,

12   then?

13                MR. CAHILL:       The concept, the concept that

14   government might be, might find it necessary to get into

15   the hamburger business.        I can't --

16                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Then essentially it's just

17   a political check on it.         When you say there's got to be

18   a good reason, politically people would get mad if you

19   didn't have a good reason; is that basically it?

20                MR. CAHILL:       That's one reason.          It would

21   also --

22                JUSTICE SOUTER:           But there's no Commerce

23   Clause reason?

24                MR. CAHILL:       I think there's no Commerce

25   Clause reason.

 2                 MR. CAHILL:        I think there's no Commerce

 3   Clause reason.

 4                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Cahill, you started to

 5   tell us three reasons why it was important that you

 6   regulate.     You gave us one.           Mention the other two.

 7                 MR. CAHILL:        The other two are, Your Honor,

 8   that we are fulfilling national objectives in trying to

 9   establish the system that reduces the amount of waste

10   that we generate and recycles as much as possible.

11   That's not necessarily something that the private sector

12   would do.     A landfill is not built to discourage the

13   amount of waste that comes through it.                    Our system is

14   designed to try to change the habits of our citizens and

15   increase recycling --

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, but it's basic

17   Commerce Clause analysis that a State has no interest in

18   what happens to the product out of State.                      Baldwin

19   versus Seelig.

20                 MR. CAHILL:        Your Honor, I think --

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You can't say we want --

22   we're enacting this law to affect what happens in other

23   States.     That's just contrary to the Commerce Clause.

24                 MR. CAHILL:        We are not attempting to

25   regulate what goes on in other States.                    We

 1   are attempting --

 2                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But I thought that was

 3   just the answer you gave to Justice Stevens on your

 4   point two.

 5                MR. CAHILL:         We are attempting to protect

 6   our own citizens by reducing the liabilities that they

 7   may incur if that waste is shipped anywhere outside of

 8   the counties.   We hope to give them a better solution

 9   for disposal than they would get from the marketplace.

10   To the extent that liability crosses state lines, we are

11   trying to protect our citizens from that liability --

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Whether they want the

13   protection or not?

14                MR. CAHILL:         Well --

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:             And whether a private

16   individual can come and offer them the same protection

17   for less money or not?

18                MR. CAHILL:         Yes, Your Honor, that's true.

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:             We're the government and

20   we're here to help you?

21                MR. CAHILL:         Yes.

22                JUSTICE SOUTER:             But isn't that almost a

23   fourth point?   I realize you didn't get the third point

24   out yet.   But isn't -- I remember your brief and isn't

25   there sort of a fourth point?               And that is, I will

 1   assume that the government does have some basic health

 2   and safety objectives and the objective to protect its

 3   citizens here.

 4                 MR. CAHILL:       Yes.

 5                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           If the government tries to

 6   pursue these policies solely by private inducement,

 7   trash haulers may say, we don't want to deal on those

 8   terms, we can haul somewhere else, in another county,

 9   another State, what-not.

10                 By taking on the job itself, the government

11   in effect is guaranteeing that to the extent it can

12   protect its citizens, induce respect for environmental

13   policy, and so on, it will do so without any cessation

14   of service?    There's kind of an assurance of service

15   plus the objectives that the government gets by running

16   the plant itself.    And isn't that sort of the nub of all

17   of your points?

18                 MR. CAHILL:       Yes, Your Honor, that's true.

19   That is the essence of government.                  We are there and we

20   are going to have to stay there.                Whether -- where a

21   private entity might decide to go out of business

22   tomorrow, government is going to be there to continue to

23   do what we set out to do.

24                 But this leads me also to my third point,

25   which is that we're attempting to implement a

 1   comprehensive solid waste plan.                With the passage of

 2   Federal legislation on these environmental matters

 3   touching on waste in the 1970s, with the Resource

 4   Conservation and Recovery Act, and With the

 5   Comprehensive Environmental Response and Liability Act,

 6   there was a new message sent to the country, which to

 7   generators meant, you better think about what you're

 8   doing with this stuff.         You better make a -- you better

 9   watch where it goes and you better be careful because

10   liability could attach to you.

11              And RCRA told government, States and

12   localities, it was their responsibility to come up with

13   plans to find new ways to manage solid wastes.                That's

14   what we've done.     Any time a government comes together

15   to put a plan together to dispose of solid wastes,

16   whether like ours it uses several different technologies

17   to try to address different parts of the waste stream,

18   you have to have the cooperation of the people who

19   collect the waste.      If the people who collect the waste

20   could drive its away to anywhere they please, the plan

21   is no plan; the plan is just a suggestion.                The haulers

22   --

23              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Who mandated this plan?

24   The State of New York?

25              MR. CAHILL:           The State of New York.

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But the State of New York

 2   can't mandate what happens to interstate commerce.

 3               MR. CAHILL:          No, Your Honor, it cannot.

 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              If you say the Congress of

 5   the United States has authorized discrimination against

 6   interstate commerce, then of course it can do that.

 7   That has happened.

 8               MR. CAHILL:          That is not our position, Your

 9   Honor.   We're not saying that RCRA or any of these

10   statutes authorize discrimination against interstate

11   commerce.   What the Federal statutes did do, however,

12   was recognize that the states do have the sovereign

13   power to act, and they expected the states to act in

14   this way.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Let's take one of these

16   classic discrimination cases involving milk.                I think

17   what you're telling us is that if Wisconsin adopted a

18   law requiring all milk to be pasteurized at a facility

19   owned and operated by the State of Wisconsin, that would

20   be perfectly okay.

21               MR. CAHILL:          That would not discriminate

22   against interstate commerce.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:              That's right.    And it would

24   really advantage Wisconsin dairy farmers, wouldn't it,

25   and really disadvantage out of Wisconsin dairy farmers,


                                         39

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   and you think that the Commerce Clause doesn't speak to

 2   that.

 3              MR. CAHILL:        No, I do think the Commerce

 4   Clause speaks to it, Your Honor, but I just -- our

 5   position is it just doesn't require strict scrutiny.                   I

 6   think the Pike test is a very good test to get to the

 7   bottom of why Wisconsin would want to do such a thing,

 8   and it would also be a good test to show just what the

 9   adverse impact on interstate commerce was, and what

10   precisely the benefits of, to Wisconsin there might be.

11              I think the Pike test --

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So then, the

13   Commerce Clause would become the vehicle by which we

14   would develop federal law about what's appropriate for

15   municipal governments to do and what's not appropriate?

16   We could decide it may be appropriate to run waste

17   facilities but not to run milk pasteurization.                   I don't

18   know how we would do that.

19              MR. CAHILL:        I don't know how you would do

20   that either, Your Honor, but you would be led into that

21   by accepting the petitioner's argument that public

22   services and private sector services are comparable

23   under the Commerce Clause.         To go back to your example,

24   earlier, Justice Scalia --

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, if we accepted


                                      40
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that argument, we would treat the public services just

 2   like we treat, you know, the legislation favoring

 3   private companies.      You're the one that's arguing for

 4   special treatment based on public ownership.

 5                 MR. CAHILL:        I think we are not, Your Honor.

 6   I think public ownership and public services are unique

 7   and they're different, and they should be subject to

 8   Commerce Clause scrutiny, but not --

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But the whole point

10   is these are not unique.           The whole point is there are

11   private companies that provide these kinds of services.

12   Maybe water, maybe electricity, maybe those are or are

13   not unique.    But you can't say that this is a unique

14   service being provided by government.

15                 MR. CAHILL:        I think the approach that

16   Oneida-Herkimer has taken is in fact unique.                  It is

17   tailored to our local situation.                 It's not something

18   that the marketplace would provide if the government was

19   not there.    And if the Petitioner's idea that any

20   government service could be challenged under the dormant

21   Commerce Clause simply because there's a private entity

22   out there that says they could do the same thing were

23   accepted, the definition of discrimination would be

24   changed from differential treatment of economic

25   interests to differential treatment of government or

 1   economic interests.      And whether we use the taxing power

 2   or police power to support a public enterprise, it would

 3   be subject to challenge.

 4                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           But the challenge here

 5   isn't gauging this business, the question is whether you

 6   can require everybody in the area to go through the one

 7   facility and pay a tipping fee.

 8                 MR. CAHILL:       Yes.

 9                 I would like to close, I think, because I'm

10   running out of time, with just the admonition or

11   requirement that we are, in providing a public service,

12   still subject to the Constitution and we must deal with

13   the part private sector fairly.               But if we do deal with

14   the private sector fairly and we don't favor anyone in

15   state or anyone out of state, we should be judged under

16   the balancing test of Pike, so that the Court, if the

17   court below found the benefits of our system

18   substantially outweigh any incidental burdens that are

19   placed on it by commerce, placed on commerce by the

20   system.   Thank you.

 1                 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 2              MS. HALLIGAN:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 3   please the Court:

 4              As you suggested, Justice Breyer, the theory

 5   that petitioners would have the Court adopt here is in

 6   fact a novel one.    What they are suggesting is that

 7   there is discrimination sufficient to trigger near fatal

 8   scrutiny every time the government takes over, to the

 9   exclusion of all private actors both in state and out of

10   state, a government service, that that is sufficient to

11   trigger strict scrutiny.          That is completely

12   inconsistent with the way that this Court has defined

13   what constitutes discrimination for purposes of the

14   dormant Commerce Clause.

15              The Court has said, and it has stressed

16   repeatedly in its precedent, that discrimination is the

17   differential treatment of in state and out of State

18   economic interests, not government interests, in a way

19   that benefits the former and burdens the latter.             That's

20   from Oregon Waste System.

21              JUSTICE STEVENS:              Let me ask you a sort of

22   simple question.    Is there an interstate impact on, of a

23   municipal rule whether it is milk, or garbage, or what,

24   that says all of this product must be processed within

25   this city before it can go out of State?

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 MS. HALLIGAN:          There may well be an

 2   interstate impact.

 3                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Doesn't that have a burden

 4   on interstate commerce?

 5                 MS. HALLIGAN:          It may well, and that is

 6   something that is appropriately judged under the Pike

 7   standard.

 8                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Isn't that exactly what we

 9   have here?

10                 MS. HALLIGAN:          I think that you do have that

11   here, and you should judge it under the Pike valency

12   test, not under the near fatal scrutiny that's, that's

13   --

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But Pike doesn't apply to

15   discrimination.    Pike applies to burdens.

16                 MS. HALLIGAN:          Yes, Your Honor.     And where

17   you have --

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It seems you are

19   conflating the two.

20                 MS. HALLIGAN:          Respectfully, I disagree,

21   Your Honor.    Where you have the government taking over a

22   service entirely, that doesn't constitute discrimination

23   because there is no local private interest that is

24   advantaged, and no burden that is shifted to out of

25   state interest.    That is where the dormant Commerce


                                         44

 1   Clause is primarily --

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:            So long as the government

 3   enters the commercial market, it can, it can create

 4   Fortress California?     MS. HALLIGAN:                 We're not asking

 5   for a rule that broad, Your Honor.                What we are

 6   suggesting is that where you have a publicly owned

 7   operation, a government operation, and it does not

 8   disproportionately benefit in state or local interests,

 9   as against out of state interests -- But it always does.

10   It benefits the people of the State, who make the money

11   from the money from the, from the very expensive

12   hamburgers that are sold by the State of California.

13              MS. HALLIGAN:          If --

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:            It always benefits the

15   State of California.

16              MS. HALLIGAN:          Well --

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:            And you're saying so long

18   as it doesn't benefit one particular malefactor of great

19   wealth in the State of California, it is okay.

20              MS. HALLIGAN:          No, Your Honor --

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't see the distinction

22   as far as the harm to the national market is concerned.

23              MS. HALLIGAN:          If you were to have

24   government action, for example, someone suggested could

25   the government sell hamburgers.             I believe Justice Alito


                                      45

 1   suggested that, and that was to operate to the

 2   disadvantage of out of state interests, even if it only

 3   advantaged one in state interest, we would agree that

 4   that would be appropriate for treatment under strict

 5   scrutiny.   But that's not what you have here.

 6               What both the district court and the circuit

 7   court in fact found here is that the primary burden of

 8   these local ordnances in fact is on local residents.

 9   And so the political process check that this Court has

10   found critical in cases like Minnesota versus Cloverleaf

11   and Wunnicke is very much precedent here.               This is not

12   an attractive proposition that these localities have

13   entered into.

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What would you do with

15   Justice Alito's question?          Dean Milk versus Madison:

16   All milk must be processed whether been 20 miles of

17   where it's --

18               MS. HALLIGAN:          It's --

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- produced.

20               MS. HALLIGAN:          Yes.

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Held discriminatory

22   against interstate commerce.            Could -- under your view,

23   could your city require all milk be pasteurized within

24   your city at a government owned, city owned facility?

25               MS. HALLIGAN:          If that rule imposed no

 1   disproportionate benefits on out of state --

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           No, but Justice Scalia

 3   says it always does because it benefits the locality.

 4                 MS. HALLIGAN:         It's different if it benefits

 5   --

 6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You have -- by criminal

 7   laws --

 8                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           You -- I'm sorry.   We're

 9   looking at the interstate aspect from the wrong point of

10   view.

11                 I'm a home owner.            I have two choices.    I

12   either send it to the local facility or I can ship it

13   over to New Jersey.      You're telling me I can't ship it

14   to New Jersey.    Doesn't that burden an interstate

15   transaction?

16                 MS. HALLIGAN:         This is very different from

17   those kinds of export bans.             Those export bans did one

18   of two things.

19                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           This is an export ban.

20                 MS. HALLIGAN:         The export bans that this

21   Court has struck down either created local --

22                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Your case involves an

23   expert ban.    All the trash has to be processed in your

24   tipping facility.

25                 MS. HALLIGAN:         It does, and it does, and to

 1   the extent that's what you are characterizing as an

 2   export ban, that's certainly correct.                    What the Court

 3   has found problematic about export bans are either that

 4   they are put in place to create local to correct

 5   economic opportunities, for example the timber cases or

 6   the shrimp cases.

 7              That's not what you have here.                     There's no

 8   allegation that the purposes of these statutes is to

 9   foster or promote local industry.                 In fact, the only

10   plaintiffs in this case are local haulers themselves.

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, there is an

12   allegation that you charge above market rates to pursue

13   particular economic goals that the municipality has.

14              MS. HALLIGAN:            For a different basket of

15   services, Your Honor.       A basket of services that

16   includes a wider range of, of goals that the private

17   sector has no Interest in providing.

18              To return, to return to the question of

19   whether or not this is an inappropriate benefit for the

20   citizens, I would argue that there is a meaningful

21   distinction between government taking an action which

22   benefits the citizens as a whole, which we would hope

23   any government law would -- any law passed by a

24   government would do, as opposed to a law that benefits a

25   local private economic interest and is intended to do

 1   so.

 2               For the dormant Commerce Clause to reach

 3   that far would be unprecedented.               It would implicate not

 4   only electricity but under Petitioner's theory it would

 5   implicate, I would think for example government

 6   decisions to provide prison and correctional services

 7   through a public system as opposed to a private one.

 8   What about school bus services?              Car insurance --

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 If only facilities

10   on your side of the case that are traditional municipal

11   services, but then this seems to be at the borderline.

12   I mean, on the other side, they have the hamburger cases

13   or the milk processing cases.             How do we decide whether

14   this is one of the traditional governmental services,

15   the police, the prisons, whatever, or is it one of these

16   that looks more like regular market participation?

17               MS. HALLIGAN:          Two answers if I can, Your

18   Honor.   First of all, I think this Court has answered

19   that question with respect to waste management more than

20   a hundred years ago in the California Reduction case.

21   It was clearly held there the provision of waste

22   management services is an essential function that

23   governments appropriately provide.

24               So that's been answered here.                With respect

25   to this question about hamburgers and other services


                                       49
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that look commercial, I think there are two checks on

 2   those kinds of ordinances.           First of all, I think it is

 3   very likely that in most circumstances if you were to

 4   say that hamburgers will be sold at a government

 5   operated facility, that that would disadvantage local

 6   interests significantly, and there would be a political

 7   process check.

 8                 Secondly the Court has been clear that it is

 9   not bound by formalistic distinctions in the Commerce

10   Clause arena and so it will look for discrimination that

11   is protectionist in nature whether it is, as the Court

12   has said, forthright or ingenious.                  So if case were to

13   present itself, and the facts in the facts in this case

14   no whiff of that protectionism, where you were to

15   believe that the motive of a government entity was, in

16   fact, to favor some local private interest, then strict

17   scrutiny might be appropriate.

18                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Is that what it turns on,

19   the motive?    If the motive were to keep the jobs at the

20   plant in New York, rather than in some facility outside

21   of New York, that would be, that would make a

22   difference?

23                 MS. HALLIGAN:         No, I think this Court has

24   held the purpose alone cannot cure an inappropriate

25   means that is used.      But what we are arguing is that


                                        50
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   here you have both a very legitimate purpose, as my

 2   co-counsel outlined for you; you also have appropriate

 3   means.   It is not inappropriate under the dormant

 4   Commerce Clause for the government to step in and take

 5   over provision of a service.            Petitioners themselves

 6   agree that, in fact, the government could take over

 7   waste management services from soup to nuts.                  They

 8   suggest that there is some difference of a

 9   constitutional magnitude because some aspect of that is

10   contracted out to the private market, and would argue

11   that actually turns the dominant Commerce Clause on its

12   head.

13               One final point, if I could make.                  Several

14   of you asked about whether or not there are other

15   mechanisms that the localities could use to further

16   these goals, goals which are set forth in both Federal

17   and State laws.

18               First of all, under the Pike test, there is

19   no least restrictive alternative test.                  So it is not

20   required that the localities demonstrate that there is

21   no other option that might meet these goals.                  The Second

22   Circuit concluded and rightly so I think on page 20a of

23   the appendix to the petition that there was no other

24   option that presented itself in the record that the

25   counties could address, or could use to address their

 1   liability concerns and to encourage recycling across a

 2   very wide range of products.

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:               There is no determinative

 4   element in the Pike test whatever.                   It is a totality of

 5   the circumstances test, right?

 6              MS. HALLIGAN:             Yes, Your Honor.

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:               That's wonderful.

 8              (Laughter.)

 9              MS. HALLIGAN:             And we suggest that that is

10   the appropriate test here.

11              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Ms. Halligan, how do you

12   answer something in the Petitioner's brief that says

13   there's no difference between this case and Carbone

14   because these transfer stations are constructed and

15   operated by a private company?

16              MS. HALLIGAN:             I think that that distinction

17   is essential here.      It is essential because of the

18   purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause.                   These are

19   publicly owned facilities.            The facility in Carbone was

20   privately owned and as you suggested, Justice Ginsburg,

21   the opinion is replete with careful references to that.

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Where do you, where

23   do you come out on the 50-50 facility?

24              MS. HALLIGAN:             I think that's a hard

25   question, Your Honor.        And I think there the kind of

 1   approach that the Court took in a case like Westland

 2   Creamery and Hunt versus Washington Apple is helpful.

 3               If it appears to the Court that the motive

 4   is protectionist then it is appropriate to apply strict

 5   scrutiny.   Whether that line is 50 percent, 55 percent

 6   --

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I thought you

 8   said earlier motive was not the test, in response to I

 9   think it was Justice Alito.

10               MS. HALLIGAN:          Yes, Your Honor.         I'm saying

11   you should look as you have -- and I see my time is up.

12   If I may continue -- you should look as you have, in all

13   of the dormant Commerce Clause cases at the context that

14   is presented.   So if there is 100 --

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you.   Thank

16   you, Counsel.

17               Mr. Tager you have three minutes remaining.

18               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EVAN TAGER,

19                    ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

20               MR. TAGER:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

21               The first point I'd like to make is I'd like

22   to ask the Court to review Reeves versus Stake which is

23   a market participant case.          But what is significant

24   there -- that's the cement plant case -- there's two

25   significant things about that case which I think are of

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   interest.

 2                 First, the Court's footnote 1 is an

 3   interesting historical footnote about how South Dakota

 4   had elected to make a lot of these different industries

 5   state-run industries, so the hypotheticals we've been

 6   discussing are not completely off the wall.

 7                 If you can do it for waste you can do it

 8   for, in that case coal.          They wanted to do it for

 9   stockyards but I think the legislature rejected the

10   government's proposal.         So the hypos are right on point.

11                 Secondly, the Court made a point there in

12   rejecting the argument, the constitutional argument that

13   the state was not prohibiting competing cement

14   companies.    And I think the inference from that is that

15   it had, there would have been a Commerce Clause problem.

16                 Second, Mr. Cahill's user -- user fee point.

17   I just want to remind the Court that in addition to

18   paying for the recycling and everything, they were using

19   the user fee to pay off the bond for their failed energy

20   recovery facility.      So, if you start focusing on what

21   you use it for, it is a very slippery slope.

22                 On his point about protecting the generator

23   from liability, we've addressed that at great lengths in

24   our briefs.    But one other point I want to make is he's

25   wrong about their ability to determine whether other


                                         54
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   facilities that the haulers want to use are safe for

 2   environmental purposes.          That's exactly what the city of

 3   New York does.   Because it doesn't have its own disposal

 4   facility, its got very stringent requirements for where

 5   the waste can be taken.

 6                Fourth, Justice Souter, I believe you were

 7   raising an inquiry about the political process and

 8   whether that's adequate to protect the out of State

 9   interests.

10                And I'd like to refer you to the West Lynn

11   Creamery decision where the Court said the people whose

12   oxen are being gored by a tariff are the local residents

13   as well, but a tariff is the prototypical Commerce

14   Clause violation.     The political process is simply not a

15   good answer to our argument.

16                In terms of your other question about --

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:             A tariff is also imposed by

18   a State, isn't it?      As opposed to --

19                MR. TAGER:        Yes.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Money goes to a State.

21                MR. TAGER:        It would go to a State.       I

22   suppose it could be done by a subdivision, though.

23                On Ms. Halligan's point about California

24   Reduction, I just would like to remind the Court that

25   that was a case of flow control to a private company.

 1   So Carbone, to the extent that case was concerned at all

 2   with the Commerce Clause, and it didn't say that it was,

 3   it was a taking case, I think, it has been overruled to

 4   the extent it had any Commerce Clause implications.

 5              Finally, I would like end with the point

 6   that Carbone has been the law for 13 years --                may I

 7   finish?

 8              If the Respondents have a problem with

 9   Carbone, Congress can fix it.            That's one of the unique

10   things about the Commerce Clause that is different from

11   other constitutional provisions.

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

13   The case is submitted.

14              (Whereupon, at 12:08 p.m., the case in the
