 7                ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY E. MAGUIRE

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                MS. MAGUIRE:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                This case is about who gets to decide the

12   facts that trigger a mandatory minimum sentence.               Any

13   fact that entitles a prosecution by law to a sentence

14   more severe than a judge could otherwise impose must be

15   found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

16                Under Harris, the government is entitled --

17                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Counsel, could you

18   address an issue that's very important to me, the one of

19   stare decisis.   And so that -- hone in on that.

20                MS. MAGUIRE:      Yes, Justice Sotomayor.             I do

21   not believe that stare decisis poses a problem for the

22   Court in this case because Harris was a plurality

23   opinion.   And while four of the Justices found that --

24   I'm sorry, five of the Justices voted to uphold

25   McMillan, only four of the Justices found that McMillan


                                      3

 1   was consistent with Apprendi.

 2                 And so we have a plurality opinion, and, for

 3   our constitutional position, we do not believe that

 4   Harris --

 5                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Well, the problem is,

 6   whether you're right or wrong -- and you're absolutely

 7   right, it was a plurality opinion -- your adversary says

 8   States have passed laws relying on it, the Federal

 9   system is now structured around it, why isn't the damage

10   as great as they claim -- potential damage, I should

11   say.

12                 MS. MAGUIRE:     Well, first of all, I would

13   just note that, even though McMillan was decided in

14   1986, there is nothing in the legislative history that

15   indicates that Congress referred on McMillan when it

16   passed 924(c).

17                 In addition, 924(c) is silent as to who

18   should be the fact-finder that triggers the mandatory

19   minimum.    And, finally, in the McMillan case, that was

20   not really a Sixth Amendment case --

21                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Address, please, the

22   practical consequences.

23                 MS. MAGUIRE:     Certainly.

24                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         How many -- how many

25   Federal courts are you aware are already charging the


                                      4

 1   924(c) facts to a jury, notwithstanding the -- the fact

 2   that it's not required?

 3                MS. MAGUIRE:     Yes, I -- I would say that

 4   there is little to no practical effect, if the Court is

 5   to adopt a rule, because the majority of the Federal

 6   courts are already -- and Federal prosecutors are

 7   already -- alleging these facts in the indictment and

 8   proving them to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.           And I

 9   think that this case is the exact example of that.

10                It was alleged in the indictment.          It went

11   to the jury, the jury got a special verdict form, so

12   there is no difficulty in implementing this rule --

13                JUSTICE ALITO:       But isn't your position that

14   a decision of this Court is not entitled to stare

15   decisis protection, if there isn't a majority opinion in

16   that case?

17                MS. MAGUIRE:     Yes, Your Honor.       I do not

18   believe that Harris has precedential value because it is

19   a plurality opinion.    In our --

20                JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, I can think of some

21   pretty important decisions of this Court that were not

22   the result of a majority opinion.           Do you want us to

23   adopt that as a blanket rule?

24                MS. MAGUIRE:     No, Your Honor, but I would

25   note that, in constitutional questions like this one,


                                     5

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   stare decisis is at its weakness -- weakest.           I would

 2   also --

 3                 JUSTICE ALITO:       All right.     Constitutional

 4   decisions of this Court not decided with the majority

 5   opinion, no stare decisis effect.            That's your argument?

 6                 MS. MAGUIRE:     Well, and also, Your Honor,

 7   what I think is significant in this case, in terms of

 8   the issue of stare decisis, is that McMillan was not a

 9   Sixth Amendment case.      McMillan was decided more on due

10   process grounds.    And the only discussion of the Sixth

11   Amendment in McMillan comes in the last paragraph, when

12   it talks to the fact that the defendant has no right to

13   jury sentencing.

14                 And so, for those reasons, we do not believe

15   that stare decisis poses a problem.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         You haven't distinguished

17   McMillan.    You've distinguished Harris.         How do you

18   distinguish McMillan?      Your -- your only grounds for

19   distinguishing that is it was not a

20   Sixth Amendment case, even though the opinion refers to

21   the Sixth Amendment?

22                 MS. MAGUIRE:     Well, Your Honor, it does, in

23   fact, refer to the Sixth Amendment in the very last

24   paragraph.    But what McMillan was mostly concerned about

25   was a due process claim --


                                      6

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:         I don't care about

 2   "mostly."   The issue is whether McMillan was a

 3   Sixth Amendment case, in part or in whole.          And I don't

 4   know how you can say it wasn't.          We -- we don't decide

 5   cases on -- on what a case mostly says.          We decide on

 6   what it says.

 7                MS. MAGUIRE:     That's absolutely --

 8                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Ms. Maguire, you don't --

 9   you don't have to take the position that there's no

10   stare decisis effect.     In a unanimous -- a recent

11   unanimous decision of this Court, obviously, would carry

12   more weight than one that has a plurality opinion, so

13   you don't have to say -- it isn't a question of yes or

14   no, it's a question of the degree of respect that we

15   would give to our former decision.

16                MS. MAGUIRE:     I think that that is exactly

17   right, Justice Ginsburg.      And, in fact, the other

18   factors that the Court considers when looking at stare

19   decisis is what were the margins of vote on the previous

20   cases, and McMillan was decided on a 5-4 decision,

21   whereas Harris, as we've noted, was a plurality

22   decision.

23                Both opinions were found over spirited

24   dissents.   They have been criticized by this Court and

25   the lower courts, and, in all of those instances, we


                                     7

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   believe that stare decisis is at its weakest --

 2                 JUSTICE ALITO:        Well, I think it's important

 3   for this Court to have a consistent doctrine of stare

 4   decisis.    The doctrine can't be, "We will overrule

 5   decisions that we don't like, but we will stick with 


 6   decisions that the majority does like."            So I'm still 


 7   looking for your understanding of what stare decisis 


 8   means in constitutional cases. 


 9                 Now, with the suggestion of 


10   Justice Ginsburg, I gather that your position is, if

11   it's a narrow decision, then it's -- stare decisis has

12   less weight; is that it?        Now, what other factors?      So

13   it has less weight.      Why isn't it controlling, though?

14   Why does it have insufficient weight here?

15                 MS. MAGUIRE:      Because, Justice Alito,

16   another thing that you look -- look to, when you are

17   considering stare decisis, is whether or not the rule is

18   workable, whether or not the prior decision was badly

19   reasoned, and those are other factors that the Court can

20   consider.

21                 And, if you look at this Court's Sixth

22   Amendment jurisprudence, as it has developed since

23   Apprendi, then in Booker, then in Blakely, then in

24   Cunningham, what we are asking for today is a logical --

25                 JUSTICE KAGAN:        But why is this not


                                       8

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   workable?   I mean, you can -- you can argue about

 2   whether it was right or wrong.           You can argue about

 3   whether it has created some incongruity in the system.

 4                 But haven't the last number of years

 5   suggested that it's perfectly workable?               Everybody knows

 6   what they are supposed to do; everybody does it.               Why --

 7   why is this not workable?

 8                 MS. MAGUIRE:     Well, the Harris rule is not

 9   workable on a practical level because what happens under

10   the Harris rule is the government is entitled to a fact

11   that drives a more severe punishment that never goes to

12   the jury.   If -- if -- and what we are asking here is

13   that the court find that, where there is a fact that

14   triggers a mandatory minimum, that that fact be found by

15   the jury.

16                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Now I understand --

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              That sounds like --

18   that sounds like an argument that it's wrong, and that

19   is, of course, the first step in -- in the stare decisis

20   analysis.   It doesn't sound, to me, responsive to

21   Justice Kagan's question is, in what sense is it

22   unworkable?

23                 MS. MAGUIRE:     Well, I think it becomes

24   unworkable in the drug cases, Your Honor, and in the

25   9841 statute because what you have there is you have, in


                                      9

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   some circuits, people alleging drug weight, but, in 


 2   other circuits, you have they called this mixing and 


 3   matching.    And, as long as the statutory maximum does 


 4   not exceed 20 years, the prosecutors are not alleging 


 5   the drug weights in the indictment. 


 6                 And that becomes unworkable and quite 


 7   confusing to the courts.       And the lower courts have 


 8   criticized the Harris rule, primarily in cases like 


 9   Krieger and others that we -- are cited in our amicus 


10   brief, that the rule is somewhat unworkable.

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Why wouldn't that be a

12   problem if -- if the question had to be decided by the

13   jury?   Why does -- why does requiring it to be decided

14   by the jury eliminate that -- that problem of the -- of

15   the mixing or not mixing?

16                 MS. MAGUIRE:     Well, asking it to be found by

17   a jury solves the problem because it -- it allows the

18   fact to go to the jury, the jury finds it.           And we have

19   a long history in this country that jury verdicts drive

20   punishment.    And so the idea is that the punishment that

21   somebody is open to should be driven by the jury

22   verdict.

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          You mentioned drug

24   weight.    Let's -- so you're making -- your argument

25   would mean that drug weight also has to be found by the


                                     10

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   jury because that can -- the length of the sentence can

 2   depend on the -- the drug weight.

 3               MS. MAGUIRE:       If the drug weight is going to

 4   trigger a mandatory minimum, Your Honor, yes, we would

 5   say that, under our rule, that that would have to be

 6   alleged in the indictment and proved to the jury beyond

 7   a reasonable doubt, which, as our amicus briefs point

 8   out, is being done already in the majority of circuits

 9   throughout the country.

10               And so this is not going to put -- put any

11   additional burden on the prosecutors to be doing this.

12   And, fundamentally, what it does is that it levels the

13   playing field because what it does in trial situations

14   is it allows a defendant to know exactly what it is that

15   the government is going to prove.

16               The government then has to bring in those

17   witnesses at the time of trial, so that they can be

18   cross-examined on this fact that is going to trigger the

19   mandatory minimum in their case.            And so it helps level

20   the playing field in that regard.

21               JUSTICE ALITO:         Now, if you were defending a

22   case involving drug weight and your client maintained

23   that he or she had nothing to do with these drugs, how

24   would you proceed?    Your argument would be:         They're not

25   my drugs, but if they were my drugs, they weren't --


                                     11

 1   they didn't weigh more than one kilo.

 2                  MS. MAGUIRE:     Well, Justice Alito, those are

 3   strategical questions that come up in every trial case

 4   that we have.    And you have to decide, as a trial

 5   lawyer, what your theory of the defense is going to be.

 6   It's simply going to be, I wasn't there; or you may

 7   decide to challenge the drug weight.

 8                  But those -- those strategic decisions exist

 9   whether or not the Court adopts this rule or doesn't

10   adopt the rule --

11                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But the question was

12   what -- what strategic decision do you think the lawyer

13   should make?

14                  MS. MAGUIRE:     Well, any strategic decision a

15   lawyer makes is going to depend on the individual facts

16   of the case.    For example --

17                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So you -- but -- but

18   Justice Alito has a real problem.             What -- don't you put

19   the defense in a very difficult position?

20                  MS. MAGUIRE:     You don't put the defense in a

21   very difficult position because, in fact, if you adopt

22   our rule, we believe that you are protecting the

23   defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury because this

24   is a fact that is going to be triggering a mandatory

25   minimum.

 1                And, if the government has to prove it, they

 2   then have to bring in the witness to the trial, who is

 3   then subject to cross-examination, which is a far

 4   more --

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But -- but isn't it

 6   difficult for you to say he had nothing to do with the

 7   drugs, plus the drugs didn't weigh more than a certain

 8   amount?

 9                MS. MAGUIRE:     I don't believe that that is

10   difficult, and I believe that those are decisions that

11   you make in every case.      For example, in the case -- in

12   this case -- in Mr. Alleyne's case, our theory --

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I think that I am hearing

14   that, in every case, you are going to want witnesses --

15   you are going to insist on a jury determination of the

16   amount.   That's kind of what I'm hearing.

17                MS. MAGUIRE:     That is the rule,

18   Justice Kennedy, that we are asking the Court to adopt,

19   that if there's a fact --

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Justice Alito says why

21   doesn't that put defense counsel in a very difficult

22   position?

23                MS. MAGUIRE:     Well, it doesn't put defense

24   counsel in a difficult position at all because those are

25   the same decisions that you make, whether or not you

 1   adopt this rule or you don't adopt this rule.

 2                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, we're not getting

 3   far with this.   But one answer you could say is that, in

 4   order to preserve the constitutional right, you want us

 5   to have a bifurcated trial.            I thought you were -- might

 6   say that.

 7                MS. MAGUIRE:       No, we are not -- we are not

 8   asking for a bifurcated trial.             We are just asking that

 9   if there's one --

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             That's good because that's

11   an extra problem.

12                (Laughter.)

13                JUSTICE KAGAN:         Ms. Maguire, could I take

14   you to a different kind of question?

15                MS. MAGUIRE:       Certainly.

16                JUSTICE KAGAN:         Let's assume that there were

17   a statute, and it said carrying a gun is an offense and

18   that the range is 5 to 10 years.             I realize it goes up

19   further in the real word, but let's just say 5 to 10

20   years.   And Congress said, in setting the penalty within

21   that range, the judge shall consider whether the

22   defendant brandished the gun and whether the defendant

23   discharged the gun.      Now -- and that's all the statute

24   said.

25                That would be constitutional; is that not


                                      14

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   right?

 2               MS. MAGUIRE:     Yes, Justice Kagan, that would

 3   be constitutional because it doesn't have the mandatory

 4   effect.

 5               JUSTICE KAGAN:       Okay.     So it's

 6   constitutional for the judge to say, seven years because

 7   you brandished, nine years because you discharged.

 8               So what makes it unconstitutional, what

 9   makes it a violation of the Sixth Amendment, when, now,

10   Congress just provides something extra in the statute?

11   It says not just you shall consider brandishing and

12   discharging, but, if you find brandishing, you get 7; if

13   you find discharging, you get 9.

14               MS. MAGUIRE:     Okay.      What makes that

15   unconstitutional is because you are stripping the judge

16   of all authority, and, by operation of law, you are

17   telling that judge that you must impose this sentence.

18               JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, that seems right as a

19   definitional matter, as a descriptive matter.        But I

20   guess the question I'm having difficulty with is why

21   does that matter for purposes of the Sixth Amendment?

22   The jury is doing the exact same thing, which is the

23   jury isn't doing anything in either of my examples.

24               So the only difference between example

25   number one, which you said was constitutional, and


                                   15

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   example number two is that, now, Congress is giving

 2   further instruction to the judge, but nothing more is

 3   being taken away from the jury; is it?

 4                 MS. MAGUIRE:     Well, yes, it is because, in

 5   your second hypothetical, where it is the mandatory

 6   minimum, which is exactly what we have in this case,

 7   this notion that somehow Congress is channelling

 8   discretion is a fiction because what it does is it tells

 9   the judge, you must impose seven years, and you cannot

10   even consider what is authorized by the jury verdict in

11   this case.

12                 And the jury verdict in this case authorized

13   a range of five years as the bottom.              And so what

14   happens is, when you have Congress coming in and saying

15   that, if you find this fact on a mere preponderance

16   standard, you must impose seven years, then you are

17   stripping the defendant of the benefit of the full jury

18   verdict in this case, which authorized a range that had

19   a lower floor than that called for by the Federal

20   statute.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Ms. Maguire, could -- could

22   you repeat the first sentence you uttered in this

23   argument?    I -- I hesitated to jump in so early, but

24   could you repeat it verbatim?            Maybe you had committed

25   it to memory.   Good -- good counsel often does that.

 1                 (Laughter.)

 2                 MS. MAGUIRE:     Thank you, Justice Scalia.

 3   It's -- my very first sentence was, "This case is about

 4   who gets to decide the facts that trigger a mandatory

 5   minimum sentence." 


 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         No, that wasn't it. 


 7                 (Laughter.) 


 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              It started, 


 9   "Mr. Chief Justice." 


10                 (Laughter.)

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         I think what you said was

12   who has to decide a fact which causes a defendant to be

13   subject to a penalty that he would not otherwise be

14   subject to?    And the fact is that, in the case of a

15   mandatory minimum, the defendant could have been given

16   that mandatory minimum.       It was up to the judge.

17                 So this mandatory minimum does not increase

18   the penalty to which the defendant is subject.                He's

19   subject, in Justice Kagan's example, to any penalty

20   between one years -- one year and 10.                The judge, even

21   without the statute that she mentioned, could have given

22   him seven years because he -- he brandished a gun.

23   There -- there is really no -- no increase in the

24   penalty to which he is exposed.

25                 And I thought that is what Apprendi


                                     17

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   addressed, any increase in the penalty to which you are

 2   exposed, so that when you decide, I'm going to rob a

 3   bank -- you know -- you know, when you go in, you are

 4   going to get between one and 10 years, and, with a

 5   mandatory minimum, you get between one and 10 years.

 6                So what's the complaint, as far as Apprendi

 7   is concerned?

 8                MS. MAGUIRE:     The complaint is that -- and

 9   why we believe that the rule we are asking the Court to

10   adopt, Justice Scalia, is a natural -- it follows the

11   logic of Apprendi, is because, in both cases, you have

12   judicial factfinding that's leading to a more harsh

13   sentence.   In your --

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:         It isn't leading to a more

15   harsh -- more harsh sentence.           That's the whole point of

16   Apprendi.   Does it lead to a sentence which is greater

17   than the judge would otherwise be authorized to impose?

18   And, in the case of a mandatory minimum, it never is.

19   The judge could impose that, if he was a hanging judge.

20   You know, you have some hanging judges; you have some

21   bleeding heart judges.

22                And -- and what a mandatory minimum simply

23   says is -- you know, we don't care what kind of a judge

24   you are, at least this much.            But it doesn't expose the

25   defendant to any greater penalty.           He's -- he's at risk


                                    18

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   between one and 10 years.

 2                MS. MAGUIRE:      Well -- and I think,

 3   Justice Scalia, that's -- that's a false presumption.        I

 4   think that's the position of the government, that,

 5   somehow, mandatory minimums channel discretion within a

 6   range.   That is a fiction because a judge is being

 7   told, you must impose this, you have no choice, you

 8   cannot go below this.      That is the whole nature of a

 9   mandatory minimum.    And so this --

10                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Do you have any

11   statistics, on at least 924(c), of how often the greater

12   is the sentence than the absolute minimum required by

13   law?

14                MS. MAGUIRE:      Well, Justice Sotomayor, this

15   Court found in O'Brien -- and I think that it's also

16   cited in the Lucas briefs and Dorsey briefs that this

17   Court is holding, that the majority of all defendants

18   convicted under 924(c) are, in fact, sentenced at the

19   mandatory minimum.

20                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          So, in fact, your

21   argument is that fixing a sentence is different than

22   giving a judge discretion because it ignores the fact

23   that a judge might have given you less?

24                MS. MAGUIRE:      That is exactly right.

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:          That seems to me --


                                     19

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So it's depriving you of 


 2   the constitutional right to have a jury decide what your 


 3   sentence could be? 


 4               MS. MAGUIRE:       That is exactly right. 


 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Of having a judge decide 


 6   what your sentence could be? 


 7               MS. MAGUIRE:       That is exactly right.           And 


 8   it's further depriving you -- it is depriving the 


 9   defendant of liberty interests.           It is imposing a 


10   stigma, and it is entitling the prosecutor to a greater

11   and more severe punishment.

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That's -- I'm not

13   sure that that's -- you've emphasized several times that

14   it takes away the discretion of the judge.               That seems,

15   to me, to be a matter between Congress and the Judiciary

16   and not a Sixth Amendment question.

17               MS. MAGUIRE:       Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

18   actually, the language of this Court in Apprendi said

19   that it is unconstitutional for the legislature to

20   remove from the jury the assessment of facts that

21   increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a

22   criminal defendant is exposed.

23               And that is exactly what's happening in this

24   context because --

25               JUSTICE KAGAN:         Well, Apprendi, thought, did it


                                     20

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   both ways.   I mean, that's the best sentence for you in

 2   Apprendi, but there are other sentences in Apprendi

 3   which more go towards what Justice Scalia suggested,

 4   that the question was increasing it above the maximum

 5   that the jury authorized.

 6                So I'm not sure that we can get from the

 7   language of Apprendi -- and I guess the question is, as

 8   a matter of principle, why I -- I completely understand

 9   why a defendant would care about this.           The question is

10   does it -- does it create a Sixth Amendment violation,

11   which is -- you know, the jury has to do this, when --

12   when Congress is decreasing the judge's discretion, but

13   it's -- either way, the jury isn't deciding this.

14                MS. MAGUIRE:     Well, Justice Kagan, we do

15   believe the Sixth Amendment is implicated because we

16   think the history of the Sixth Amendment in this country

17   shows that the role of the jury is the buffer between

18   the citizen meant to protect and the government.

19                And mandatory minimums give the prosecution

20   far much power.   And, in fact, if you do not adopt our

21   rule and -- and make the government have to prove it

22   beyond a reasonable doubt, what happens is then the

23   average citizen does not get the benefit of a jury

24   verdict, and his sentence is not driven wholly by the

25   jury verdict because, in this case, we had a jury


                                    21

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   verdict, the government alleged the fact, we had a

 2   special verdict form, the jury failed to find that fact.

 3               As a result of that, then, the range to --

 4   that Mr. Alleyne should have been exposed was a

 5   five-year mandatory minimum and for the constitutional

 6   argument assuming a maximum of life.               Here, what

 7   happened and at the sentencing hearing was on a mere

 8   preponderance, the judge had to impose seven.               And so we

 9   believe that is where you have the Sixth Amendment

10   problem because the defendant --

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:            But you -- you quoted

12   Apprendi correctly as saying that the jury has to decide

13   any fact which increases the sentence to which the

14   defendant is exposed.       That's the language you quoted,

15   and it's accurate.

16               Why does a mandatory minimum increase the

17   sentence to which the defendant is exposed?               He could

18   get the mandatory minimum sentence, even if there were

19   no mandatory minimum prescribed.             He is exposed to a

20   sentence of one to 10 years.              A mandatory minimum says,

21   you must impose seven years if he brandishes.

22               But the sentence to which he is exposed is

23   one to 10 years.   And the mandatory minimum does not

24   change that at all.      He is at risk for one to 10 years.

25               MS. MAGUIRE:        Well, I understand that that


                                      22

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   may not change the exposure.            What it does, on a 


 2   practical level, is it prevents the judge from even 


 3   considering anything less than the seven years. 


 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:          That's true. 


 5               MS. MAGUIRE:      And that becomes the problem.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:          That's true.     But you must

 7   acknowledge that that's not the theory of Apprendi.

 8               MS. MAGUIRE:      Well, I think the theory of

 9   Apprendi if you -- if you take it out to its logical

10   step, is that, if you have judicial factfinding that is

11   resulting in a more harsh sentence being imposed, then,

12   in fact, you have a Sixth Amendment problem.

13               And so what happens on the mandatory

14   minimums is that, if a judge finds the mandatory

15   minimum, a more harsh sentence is being imposed because,

16   as an example, in this case, the judge could not even

17   consider giving the five-year year floor as a mandatory

18   minimum, which we've already noted is, in fact, how most

19   criminal defendants are sentenced under the 924(c)

20   statute at the mandatory minimum level.

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:          I think the logic of

22   Apprendi is that the jury has to decide it if it

23   increases the sentence to which the defendant is

24   exposed, not if it eliminates some discretion of the --

25   of the Court.   He's exposed.

 1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         How about Booker?    What

 2   did Booker do --

 3               MS. MAGUIRE:     Well, I think --

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- to the logic of

 5   Apprendi?

 6               MS. MAGUIRE:     Justice Sotomayor, what I

 7   believe that Booker did is that Booker indicated that

 8   when you have a fact that drives -- a finding of fact

 9   that drives a mandatory sentence to be imposed, that,

10   obviously, that was the Sixth Amendment problem.

11               Now, I understand and appreciate --

12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Even when the statutes

13   had a higher maximum?

14               MS. MAGUIRE:     That is correct, Your Honor.

15               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Because the jury was --

16   because the judge was constrained within a different

17   maximum?

18               MS. MAGUIRE:     That is correct, Your Honor.

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Is that your argument

20   here?

21               MS. MAGUIRE:     Yes.      And so what I believe is

22   that what Booker indicates is that it is this mandatory

23   effect which may -- and that is why this Court found --

24   extending Apprendi in the Booker case, that, in fact,

25   the guidelines then had to become advisory.        It is the


                                   24

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   mandatory effect of the factfinding that is essential in

 2   these cases.

 3                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         It wasn't a mandatory

 4   minimum case.    Booker was a case in which the maximum

 5   was increased on the basis of judge finding of fact.

 6   The maximum was increased.          So, under the situation in

 7   Booker, the -- the exposure of the defendant was,

 8   indeed, increased on the basis of judge factfinding.

 9   Instead of one to 10, the statute in -- in Booker said,

10   if you brandish a gun, you can get 15.

11                  That's a -- that's a quite different

12   situation from saying, yes, you are still on the hook

13   for one to 10, but, if you brandish, you got to get 7.

14                  MS. MAGUIRE:     Well, Justice Scalia, I think

15   the concern in Booker was the mandatory nature of the

16   guidelines.    And while I would agree with you, that this

17   Court, in its constitutional part of the Booker

18   decision, did, in fact, look to the increase in the

19   maximums, it is the same problem.             You have judge --

20   judicial factfinding that is mandating a particular

21   sentence.

22                  And that is where you have the Sixth--

23                  JUSTICE ALITO:       Why is Booker -- why is

24   Booker entitled to greater stare decisis weight than

25   Harris and McMillan?

 1                MS. MAGUIRE:     Well, I believe that Booker

 2   is -- is entitled to greater weight because it was more

 3   recently decided by this Court, and I also believe that

 4   it is a more recent interpretation of this Court of the

 5   principles held in Apprendi.

 6                I would like to reserve the remainder of my

 7   time.

10               ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

11                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12                MR. DREEBEN:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

13   please the Court:

14                This Court should adhere to its decision in

15   Harris v. United States, which reaffirmed

16   McMillan v. Pennsylvania because those decisions

17   properly respected the fact that a mandatory minimum

18   divests the defendant of the right to judicial leniency.

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Could I go back to a

20   simple question on the stare decisis, the practicality

21   question?

22                What is so impractical about letting a jury

23   decide an issue that sets a mandatory sentence of any

24   kind?   Why -- why are juries incapable of figuring out

25   whether a gun was carried or brandished?              Why are they


                                    26

 1   incapable of figuring out how many -- how much drugs

 2   were sold or whether someone was driven by any of the

 3   factors that States want to commit to judges, but the

 4   Sixth Amendment might require them to submit to juries?

 5                MR. DREEBEN:     Justice Sotomayor, the

 6   government's argument here is not that juries are

 7   incapable of finding facts under the Federal statutes

 8   that involve mandatory minimums.           It's that Congress has

 9   sound reasons for wishing to allocate that factfinding

10   to the sentencing process and that it is not

11   unconstitutional for Congress to do so.

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         But what does that have

13   to do with the needs -- the constitutional need to make

14   sure that juries are driving a fixed sentence of any

15   kind?

16                MR. DREEBEN:     The -- the constitutional

17   question, in my view, Justice Sotomayor, turns on

18   whether there is a right to the mercy of a tenderhearted

19   judge.   That is what a defendant loses when a judge

20   finds a mandatory minimum fact.

21                JUSTICE BREYER:         No, no, it isn't quite.       I

22   mean, the -- the linguistic difference -- I agree with

23   Justice Scalia, and I agree with you.            It turns on the

24   word "exposed."   I mean, if you state Apprendi's holding

25   as it was just stated, this is a different case because


                                    27

 1   you could, in fact, if you were the defendant, have been

 2   sentenced to that anyway.          That's your argument.

 3                  MR. DREEBEN:      Correct.

 4                  JUSTICE BREYER:          Now, let's put it

 5   differently.    There is a fact in the world.              There's a

 6   gun, or there wasn't a gun.             In the Apprendi case, if

 7   the fact turns out to be gun, you could get two more

 8   years.    All right?    We have to go to the jury.            Now,

 9   here there's a fact in the world, gun or not gun.

10                  If it turns out not gun, you get a lower

11   sentence, you could.       And, if it turns out to be the

12   fact, gun, you can't -- the judge cannot put you in that

13   box.   He has to put you in a worse box.               He has to put

14   you in a worse box.       He has to give you more than --

15   more than the three years, two years, or one year.                He

16   has to.   Okay?

17                  Now, from the point of view of the

18   defendant, worse or not -- at least as bad.                From the

19   point of view of Congress, same.              They drew some lines,

20   want a judge to administer them, and they turn on facts.

21   And the sentence very often will turn on those facts.

22                  From the point of view of the judge, same.

23   It's the jury decides or he decides.                In the one case,

24   his discretion is cut off to give a lower sentence.                  In

25   the other case, his discretion is granted to give a


                                       28

 1   higher sentence.

 2               Now, I see tremendous similarities, though I

 3   grant you the words are different, but can you -- can

 4   you just explain --

 5               MR. DREEBEN:        Justice Breyer, yes.

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:            -- why the difference in

 7   the words should overcome the fact that I can't think of

 8   a -- of a difference, other than those words that

 9   happened to be used in Apprendi?

10               MR. DREEBEN:        Well, Justice Breyer, we have

11   a chart in our brief that I think is addressed

12   explicitly to the question that you are asking, and it's

13   on page 36 of our brief.        And it illustrates the

14   difference between an Apprendi situation and a

15   Harris-McMillan situation.          So the government's gray

16   brief.

17               And the point of the chart is this --

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:            What page?   What page?

19               MR. DREEBEN:        This is page 36 of the

20   government's brief.

21               JUSTICE BREYER:            I'm afraid the other side

22   was upside down, and I saw what you meant.

23               MR. DREEBEN:        Okay.      The point of Apprendi

24   is a jury cannot be reduced to low-level gatekeeping.

25   Congress cannot pass a statute that says it is a crime


                                      29

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   to assault someone, and that's punishable by one year in

 2   prison.   But if the crime involves rape, then it's

 3   punishable by 10 years in prison.            Or if the crime

 4   involves attempted murder, then it's punishable by up to

 5   life.

 6                 Congress can't do that because it would

 7   diminish the role of the jury in finding the critical

 8   facts that constitute the crime that sets the

 9   defendant's maximum exposure.            Apprendi protects against

10   that.

11                 In a Harris situation, the defendant is

12   already exposed to the maximum penalty that the

13   defendant incurs under the statute, and that's what the

14   second column illustrates.         The defendant who commits a

15   Section 924(c) crime knows that the defendant faces up

16   to life in prison.

17                 When the mandatory minimum comes along, it

18   doesn't increase the defendant's exposure to the most

19   severe punishment he can get.            It divests the defendant

20   of a degree of judicial discretion.               But the Sixth

21   Amendment does not protect a right to judicial

22   discretion.

23                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          You know, but that --

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:         But --

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:         That's the -- that's the --

 2   you've used all the words, which do make the difference,

 3   in your mind.   But my question --

 4                 MR. DREEBEN:     It's not just in my mind,

 5   Justice --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:         -- is why should those

 7   words make a difference?

 8                 Look, in the one case -- I'll be repeating

 9   myself, but I want you to see it.            In the one case,

10   presence of a fact or not means the defendant goes into

11   a higher sentencing box.       In the other case, presence of

12   a fact or not means that he cannot go into the low

13   sentencing box.

14                 MR. DREEBEN:     And when he cannot --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:         In the one case, he cannot

16   go into the low sentencing box; in the other case, he

17   can't go into the high sentencing box.            I got that

18   difference.

19                 My only problem is why does it make a

20   difference.

21                 MR. DREEBEN:     It matters because the Sixth

22   Amendment protects a right to a jury trial; it does not

23   protect a right to judicial leniency.

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:         No, it's not -- well, you

25   can call it judicial leniency, but you could call the

 1   other judicial harshness.         I mean, what is, in fact, 


 2   turning out --


 3               MR. DREEBEN:        No, because, in -- in the 


 4   other situation, it protects the right of the jury to 


 5   determine the ingredients of the crime that Congress has

 6   determined exposed the defendant --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:            And, here, we have the

 8   ingredients of a crime that Congress has determined that

 9   you have to get the five years.

10               MR. DREEBEN:        Well, we know --

11               JUSTICE BREYER:            I mean, in the one case,

12   you can say all that Apprendi did.                 It never should have

13   been decided -- I mean, some of us thought that --

14   because, in fact --

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I wonder who -- I wonder

16   who that could have been.

17               (Laughter.)

18               JUSTICE BREYER:            All you're talking about

19   there is that you are stopping the judge from exhibiting

20   his otherwise discretion towards harshness, and that's a

21   matter for judges.     I've heard all these arguments

22   before, you see.

23               MR. DREEBEN:        Well --

24               JUSTICE BREYER:            And I've just heard them in

25   the context of harshness, and, now, I don't know why

 1   changing it to leniency makes them somehow more

 2   relevant.   They weren't apparently relevant in the first

 3   situation; so why are they relevant in this one?

 4                MR. DREEBEN:      They weren't relevant

 5   in the first situation because, if there is no cap from

 6   the maximum that a judge could impose based on judicial

 7   factfinding, the role of a jury can be shrunk to what

 8   the Court has called low-level gatekeeping.              That can

 9   never happen under a statute that increases only the

10   mandatory minimum.

11                JUSTICE KAGAN:        Well, is that --

12   Mr. Dreeben, and -- and I think it's -- it's a great

13   question.   Is the jury functioning as a low-level

14   gatekeeper under the Harris rule?            Because I could make

15   the argument that, in fact, it is -- you know, you take

16   a statute, and it says, five and up for carrying, and

17   seven and up for brandishing, right?              And this isn't

18   even a hypothetical.     This is pretty close to this case.

19                It goes to the jury.           The jury says, we

20   think he was carrying, we do not think that he was

21   brandishing, all right?       And then it goes to the judge.

22   And, now, the judge says, you know what, if I had my

23   druthers, I would only give five years.              If I had my

24   druthers, I absolutely would defer to the jury verdict,

25   but I can't defer to the jury verdict because Congress


                                     33

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   has said I have to make this special factfinding, and

 2   the truth of the matter is I think he did brandish, and

 3   so I have to give seven years.

 4                  So the judge is not deferring to the jury,

 5   and he's not deferring to the jury when he would prefer

 6   to do so.   I guess the question is isn't that, in every

 7   practical sense -- doesn't the mandatory minimum

 8   effectively increase the maximum punishment that the --

 9   that the defendant otherwise would get?

10                  MR. DREEBEN:     Well, it certainly doesn't

11   increase the maximum punishment that's authorized under

12   the statute.    And it doesn't prevent the judge from

13   making the exact same finding by a preponderance of the

14   evidence that the jury did not make beyond a reasonable

15   doubt and giving seven years, even if there were no

16   mandatory minimums.

17                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Yes.     But what I'm

18   suggesting is that in the world of judges -- you know,

19   this -- the graph you wrote has this very little

20   difference in the Harris situation between five and

21   seven.   But, in fact, most judges want to give five.          I

22   mean, that's the truth of the matter, that -- you know,

23   nobody's giving a 97-year sentence.

24                  So -- so the action in the criminal justice

25   system is at this lower range.            And, at this lower


                                      34

 1   range, what the mandatory minimums do is effectively

 2   tell a judge that they cannot defer to a jury verdict.

 3                MR. DREEBEN:       Well, it's, first of all, not

 4   entirely accurate that judges do not give higher

 5   sentences than the minimum.            There are plenty of cases

 6   in which they do so.      If the 920 --

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But let's say --

 8                JUSTICE KAGAN:         I know there are plenty of

 9   cases.   All I'm saying is it's not the unusual case to

10   find ourselves in exactly this position, where the judge

11   wants to give five, the jury wants to give five, the

12   judge can't defer to the jury's verdict that it should

13   be five.

14                MR. DREEBEN:       But taking away judicial

15   discretion to treat a fact within the range differently

16   than what Congress wants doesn't infringe the jury trial

17   right.

18                The jury can find facts by a -- beyond a

19   reasonable doubt, but, when the judge is at sentencing,

20   he is not operating under that burden, so the

21   factfinding role of the jury --

22                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But you could say that

23   with reference to the -- to the maximum.             Everything you

24   said could be applied to the maximum, and Apprendi says

25   you can't say that.

 1               MR. DREEBEN:        I don't think that it's quite

 2   true that everything that I said applies to the maximum,

 3   Justice Kennedy, because, as the plurality opinion in

 4   Harris explained, once the court has been confronted

 5   with a defendant who's convicted, the judge's discretion

 6   extends up to the statutory maximum.                He can't use his

 7   factfinding ability to increase the defendant's exposure

 8   to criminal punishment.        Mandatory minimums can never do

 9   that.

10               The defendant is already exposed to the

11   sentence that the judge could give.                And I grant you,

12   Justice Kagan, that some judges might choose to give a

13   lower sentence.   But the fact that they might choose to

14   reflects judicial leniency, tenderheartedness, something

15   that the Sixth Amendment does not speak to.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How about in deference to

17   the jury's finding?      I mean, in this -- this -- this

18   very case, wasn't it so that the judge said, I could

19   just say seven years because it's within the range, but

20   it would be dishonest of me to do that, wouldn't it?                  I

21   have to say seven because it's the mandatory minimum.

22               I think this is a case where the effect

23   is -- is shown graphically, that the judge says, I'm

24   stuck with the seven; I would prefer five.                That's what

 2               MR. DREEBEN:        I think, Justice Ginsburg, 


 3   that the judge said he would be intellectually honest 


 4   and not ignore the fact that the -- the finding of 


 5   brandishing did trigger the mandatory minimum.             He did

 6   not say, I otherwise would have given five.             And I think

 7   that this case --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:            But is it the usual case

 9   that a judge, when faced with this decision, has before

10   him a jury finding?      I -- that --

11               MR. DREEBEN:        It's not the usual case,

12   Justice Scalia.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:            The Petitioner is asking

14   these cases to be thrown out, even if there has been no

15   jury finding.

16               MR. DREEBEN:        Correct.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:            And the judge says -- you

18   know, I have to decide whether he brandished or not; I

19   think he brandished.      But I -- you know, the Petitioner

20   here wants to say, the judge cannot consider himself

21   bound by a mandatory minimum.             It seems to me the

22   unusual case in which you have a jury finding, that the

23   judge must ignore in -- in -- he actually doesn't ignore

24   it, he goes along with it.

25               The jury may well be right, that it's

 1   impossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that --

 2   that the felon brandished a gun, but it's -- it -- it's

 3   quite easy to say that it's very likely he branded a

 4   gun -- brandished a gun, which is what the judge has to

 5   find.   So he -- he's not even ignoring the jury finding.

 6                  MR. DREEBEN:     No, there is no inconsistency

 7   between -- and I think, if you look at the way this case

 8   evolves, it's not even clear that the jury rejected

 9   brandishing.    What's very interesting about this case is

10   it's possibly the best illustration of the unfairness

11   problem that Justice Alito alluded to and that

12   Justice Breyer has written about in his opinions.             The

13   issue at trial in this case was identity.

14                  Was the defendant actually the person

15   sitting in the car, while his accomplice walked up to

16   the victim and -- and put a revolver into his neck and

17   asked for money?    That was the issue at trial.           There

18   was no discussion of brandishing whatsoever.

19                  Nobody focused on it, and it allowed the

20   defendant, after the jury rejected his identity

21   argument, to go to the judge and say, even though the

22   jury has now found that my guy did it, he could not have

23   foreseen that a gun would have been used.

24                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Mr. Dreeben, can I go

25   back to a point you made earlier?             You talked about a

 1   legislature not attempting to supplant the jury's role

 2   on the maximum.   You don't see the same danger -- we

 3   started out in a country where almost all sentencing was

 4   in the discretion of the judge; whatever crime you

 5   committed, the judge could decide where to sentence you.

 6                As Apprendi and its subsequent progeny laid

 7   out, these sentencing changes that have come into

 8   existence have really come into existence the latter

 9   half of the last century.

10                What -- don't you fear that, at some point,

11   the legislature will go back to the old system of

12   supplanting the jury by just saying what it said in

13   924(c)?   Every single crime has a maximum of life.

14                And all the -- and every single fact that's

15   going to set a real sentence for the defendant, a

16   minimum, we're going to let the judge decide by a

17   preponderance of the evidence.

18                The bottom line of my question is, when

19   Apprendi was decided, what should be the driving force

20   of protecting the jury system?          The deprivation of

21   discretion, whether that's permissible or not, or

22   whether a sentence is fixed in a range, whatever it

23   might be, by a jury?

24                MR. DREEBEN:     Justice --

25                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         What's the better rule

 1   to keep both extremes from happening?

 2               MR. DREEBEN:      I think, Justice Sotomayor,

 3   that the Court recognized, in Apprendi, that its rule

 4   was limited and to certain extent could be evaded by

 5   legislatures, if they were inclined to do so.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Mr. Dreeben, I think that

 7   history is wrong.   In fact, the way the country started,

 8   there was no judicial discretion.           There were simply

 9   fixed penalties for crimes.          If you stole a horse, you

10   were guilty of a felony, and you would be hanged.

11   That's where we started.

12               MR. DREEBEN:      Well --

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:          And I would think that the

14   risk involved is whether, if we come out the way that

15   the Petitioner here urges us to do, legislatures will

16   consider going back to -- to where we started from and

17   simply saying, if you brandish, you get seven years,

18   period, with no discretion in the judge.

19               That, it seems to me, is the greater risk.

20               MR. DREEBEN:      Well, Justice Scalia, I agree

21   in part with both you and Justice Sotomayor on history.

22   In fact, if you look at the 1790 Crimes Act that the

23   First Congress passed, many of the set sentences are

24   determinant sentences.

25               Others of the sentences were -- were


                                    40

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   prescribed up to a certain amount of years.        And, within

 2   that, it was well understood that judges would find

 3   facts to graduate the penalties according to the gravity

 4   of the crime.

 5               And what the legislatures have done in the

 6   20th Century innovation of mandatory minimums within an

 7   otherwise authorized range, as you have with 924(c), is

 8   say, we would prefer that judges take into account

 9   brandishing and discharging, as under Justice Kagan's

10   hypothetical statute, but we would like to -- to do that

11   in a uniform manner.

12               We know that they can find, by a

13   preponderance of the evidence, that brandishing exists.

14   We know that many, if not most, judges would consider

15   that worse than simple possession of a firearm in a

16   crime of violence, and we want judges to behave

17   consistently.

18               By proscribing consistency, they are acting

19   in accord with the historical tradition of having

20   determinate sentences, a tradition that this Court held

21   in Chapman v. --

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         I'm sorry, the

23   historical -- you said, earlier, that most of the

24   historical evidence was that determinate sentences would

25   be decided by juries; they found facts, and a


                                   41

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   determinate sentence was given.

 2                  MR. DREEBEN:     And there was no judicial

 3   discretion, which I think makes --

 4                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          So what is the judicial

 5   discretion now?    You find by a preponderance of the

 6   evidence, and a mandatory minimum makes you give seven.

 7   So where is the judicial discretion?

 8                  MR. DREEBEN:     The judicial discretion is

 9   what the defendant is losing.             He is not losing the

10   right to a jury trial because the very same verdict

11   authorizes the judge to find brandishing and impose

12   seven years.

13                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          You think, for a

14   defendant in a constitutional right, that they are

15   more -- that it's constitutional to have a determinate

16   sentence at seven and still constitutional -- and make

17   the jury find it by a -- beyond a reasonable doubt and

18   that it's still constitutional to have a determinative

19   sentence of seven years, but have the jury find it by a

20   preponderance of the evidence?

21                  MR. DREEBEN:     To have the jury find it by a

22   preponderance of the --

23                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Those are equal?   Those

24   are -- those are equal?

25                  MR. DREEBEN:     It's not just my position that

 1   it's constitutional for a -- a judge to find mandatory

 2   minimum triggering facts by a preponderance.           I'm sure

 3   that a legislature could allocate that to a jury, if it

 4   wishes to.

 5                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         No, I know we said it in

 6   Harris.

 7                 MR. DREEBEN:     Yes.

 8                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         The question here before

 9   us today is --

10                 MR. DREEBEN:     Yes.      And I think that -- that

11   not only does it not contradict any decision of this

12   Court to allow the judge to make those findings, it

13   doesn't contradict the principle behind the jury trial

14   right or the right to proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Look, look, here's another

16   way of putting the same point:           With the mandatory

17   minimum, the judge can't go below the five years, okay?

18                 But you say, well, he could have gone below

19   the five years anyway, couldn't he have?           I mean, you --

20   he could have given you the five years anyway -- sorry.

21   He could have given you the five years anyway.           That's

22   your point.

23                 MR. DREEBEN:     Correct.

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:         All right.   He could have

25   given you the five years -- he could have given you the

 1   five years if you'd been -- if you had been convicted of

 2   a different crime.

 3                 MR. DREEBEN:     And that's the difference

 4   between this and Apprendi.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:         But why does that make a

 6   difference?   The best way I thought of putting it is the

 7   heading on page 6 of their reply brief is almost right,

 8   I think.

 9                 I mean, I -- it says it's -- it's permitting

10   judges to find facts by a preponderance of the evidence

11   that compels sentences higher than a set of those

12   permitted by the jury's verdict.

13                 That's exactly what's going on here.

14                 MR. DREEBEN:     Well --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:         And -- and I -- I want to

16   know, what is it?    And the trouble is --

17                 MR. DREEBEN:     That's --

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:         You're just going to say,

19   well, he could have given the same sentence anyway.          And

20   I'm going to say, well, so what, why does that matter?

21                 MR. DREEBEN:     It's descriptively accurate,

22   but it says nothing about the constitutionality of the

23   procedure.    And I think that it's very important to

24   focus not only on the fact that stare decisis is in

25   play, but that Apprendi has been a very history-driven


                                     44

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   area of the law.    Last term, when the Court extended

 2   Apprendi to fines, it has found an ample historical basis

 3   for doing so.

 4                 In this case, by comparison, there is no

 5   historical showing that would justify extending Apprendi

 6   to fines.    Not only is there no direct analogy to a

 7   924(c) type statute, but the three pillars of their

 8   historical argument are extremely weak and strained

 9   analogies.

10                 The first one is simply that, to get a

11   statutory crime that was parallel to a common law crime,

12   but differed, the prosecutor had to charge all of the

13   elements of the statutory crime in the indictment.      That

14   says nothing about mandatory minimum sentencing.

15                 The sentence -- second pillar of their

16   historical argument is the procedure called benefit of

17   clergy, which was a form of what Blackstone called a

18   statute pardon, that allowed a defendant to avoid a

19   capital sentence.

20                 In the First Crimes Act, in Section 31, in

21   1790, Congress said, "Benefit of clergy shall not exist

22   in the United States for any crime punishable by a

23   capital sentence."    Benefit of clergy has never been

24   part of this -- this country's Sixth Amendment heritage.

25   It was abolished before the Sixth Amendment was even

 1   ratified. 


 2                  And the third pillar of their historical 


 3   argument are three late 19th Century cases, Jones, 


 4   Garcia, and Lacy, each of which involve statutes that 


 5   both raised the maximum and the minimum, not a single

 6   one of them spoke about the Constitution.                None of them

 7   purported to define what a legislature could do if it

 8   wanted to raise only the minimum, and that's it.

 9                  And I would suggest to the Court that this

10   kind of Gertrude Stein history, where there's really no

11   "there" there, is not sufficient to overturn the

12   legislative prerogative to make uniform the findings of

13   fact within a range --

14                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Mr. Dreeben, could I take

15   you back to the principles involved?                Let's suppose

16   that, instead of this statute, which is 579, you had a

17   statute which was five for carrying, five up to life, and

18   then, for brandishing, 40.          All right?        And maybe if

19   we're discharging, 60.       All right.            So a very large gap.

20   Is your argument still the same?

21                  MR. DREEBEN:     The constitutional argument is

22   the same.     I think this Court's decision in O'Brien

23   suggests that, unless the legislature were absolutely

24   clear about it, the Court would conclude that those

25   would be deemed elements.

 4   your last word.   Those would be?

 5                MR. DREEBEN:     "Deemed elements."       Under the

 6   decision in O'Brien, where the machine gun finding

 7   raised the minimum to 30 years, the Court held that it

 8   should be deemed to be an element, but --

 9                JUSTICE KAGAN:       But suppose -- suppose that

10   Congress is absolutely clear about it, and you say --

11   and I think that you're right, you've got to be right

12   about this -- it's a constitutional matter, it's the

13   same, but the hypothetical sort of suggests exactly what

14   you said our inquiry ought to be, is that, in a world

15   like that, the jury is, in fact, functioning only as a

16   low-level gatekeeper; isn't that right?

17                MR. DREEBEN:     No.

18                JUSTICE KAGAN:       And that the only reason we

19   see it in the hypothetical a little bit more clearly is

20   because the numbers are a bit more dramatic.

21                MR. DREEBEN:     I wouldn't suggest that the

22   jury is being a low-level gatekeeper in that situation

23   because the jury's verdict alone -- and this is a

24   serious crime -- exposes the defendant to a life

25   sentence.   This is a crime that involves either a

 1   predicate Federal crime of violence or a Federal drug

 2   trafficking crime, plus the use of the gun in it.

 3               And I think Congress could reasonably expect

 4   that the worse the use of the gun, the more extreme, the

 5   higher the corresponding penalty.          And, indeed, if a

 6   924(c) violation is charged by itself, and a defendant

 7   is an armed career criminal, then his sentencing range

 8   goes up to 360 months to life --

 9               JUSTICE KAGAN:       I mean, there's something

10   deeply incongruous, isn't there, where you have an

11   Apprendi rule which says if the maximum is -- you know,

12   if it's five to seven, and then the -- the judge says

13   seven years and a day, we're going to take that out, but

14   as a mandatory minimum that will leapfrog you from five

15   to 40 doesn't get the same result?

16               MR. DREEBEN:     It's not incongruous if you

17   look at it from the point of view of the fact that the

18   jury verdict itself allows a life sentence.          And if the

19   defendant draws the proverbial hanging judge who, in his

20   discretion -- or her discretion, wants to give that life

21   sentence, the defendant knew, from day one, when he

22   committed the crime, that, if the jury finds him guilty

23   of it, he's exposed to a life sentence.

24               And the Court, in Apprendi, said structural

25   democratic constraints will preclude legislatures -- or

 2   sentences to crimes that are higher than what the

 3   legislature deemed --

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So how about in O'Brien,

 5   if the legislature had said 40 years for a machine gun?

 6   Would we -- how do we justify saying, no, that has to

 7   remain an element?    Under your theory, the democratic

 8   process didn't work.

 9               MR. DREEBEN:       No, I think that --

10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So how -- what would we

11   do in that situation?

12               MR. DREEBEN:       In that situation, the

13   democratic process would have concluded that firearms

14   brandishing, discharge, or use of a machine gun is an

15   extremely serious component of this crime.          We know

16   judges will take that into account in sentencing.          We

17   simply want them to take that into account in the same

18   particularly harsh way.

19               And in -- in trying to achieve uniformity

20   among judicial actors, when finding facts at sentencing,

21   which everybody knows that they will do, does not

22   deprive the defendant of a right to a jury trial on the

23   elements of the crime; it deprives him of the right to a

24   judge who might show mercy under a particular set of

25   facts.

 1                And that simply is not the right that's

 2   embodied in the Sixth Amendment.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:          That -- that's -- I don't

 4   know if you can add anything to this, but, remember, I

 5   agree with you about the history, but I just apply it to

 6   Apprendi, too.   So the one --

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:          It is so bad he wants to

 8   extend it.

 9                (Laughter.)

10                JUSTICE BREYER:          I thought -- are you sure

11   it was Gertrude Stein and not Dorothy Parker?          But I

12   think you're probably right about that.

13                But the -- the -- I'm thinking of this as,

14   well, Apprendi, I see what they're thinking.          They're

15   thinking that, once you have to add the extra fact to

16   get above the otherwise ceiling, it's like a new crime.

17   It isn't really a new crime, but it's like a new crime.

18                Okay.   But then I can say, well, once you

19   have to really cut off that five years and less and

20   really send him to jail for five years, hey, that's just

21   like a new crime.    It isn't really a new crime, but it's

22   like a new crime.

23                So why can't I say everything that we said

24   about Apprendi here, except I can't deny what you say,

25   the judge could have given the sentence anyway.          That's


                                     50

 1   absolutely right.   But all the other things, I can say.

 2   Is that true?

 3                MR. DREEBEN:     Well, I agree that you can say

 4   them, Justice Breyer --

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:         But, I mean, are they true?

 6                (Laughter.)

 7                MR. DREEBEN:     Respectfully, no.

 8                We -- the critical point about Apprendi is,

 9   by assigning the role of constitutional element status

10   to a fact that increases the maximum, the Court has

11   preserved the jury trial right against its reduction to,

12   essentially, a formality on a particular subset of

13   elements.   And the relationship of a crime that's

14   covered by Apprendi and the so-called base crime is like

15   a greater included offense and a lesser included

16   offense.

17                Whereas, in the mandatory minimum situation,

18   we know that the judge will be engaged in sentencing.

19   We know that the judge will find facts that extend

20   beyond the elements of the crime to inform himself about

21   how the basic crime is committed.           We also know that

22   different judges may treat those facts differently after

23   finding them by the preponderance of the evidence.

24                The mandatory minimum changes only one

25   thing.   It says, Judge, if you find this fact,


                                    51

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   brandishing or discharge, you will impose the same

 2   sentence as your neighboring judge down the hall, not a

 3   different one based on your different perception of

 4   sentencing philosophy.

 5               So it allows the legislature to intervene

 6   after having defined a sufficiently serious enough crime

 7   and determine how the judges will treat those facts.

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Why is the legislature

 9   being deprived of that right, if they give it to the

10   jury?

11               MR. DREEBEN:      The legislature --

12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          I mean, it seems to me

13   that, whether you give it to a jury or a judge, the

14   legislature protects itself by declaring a minimum

15   sentence.

16               MR. DREEBEN:      There are many ways --

17               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          It determines the

18   sentence, really.

19               MR. DREEBEN:      There are many ways that a

20   legislature could achieve a goal that allows the judge's

21   factfinding to carry more weight.           For one thing, it

22   could extend the maximum punishments and convert

23   everything into an affirmative defense, which this Court

24   said last week is constitutional.

25               The point is whether the defendant has


                                    52

 2   the right to the mercy of a judge.

 8             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARY E. MAGUIRE 


 9                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 


10                  MS. MAGUIRE:     It is the effect of the

11   factfinding that is important, not what it is called.                A

12   mandatory minimum does, in fact, increase the exposure

13   that a defendant is -- is exposed to because his range

14   then goes from five to life, which was wholly authorized

15   by the jury's verdict in this case, to seven to life,

16   and that is an increase.

17                  And we are not talking about a right to

18   leniency, but a right for the judge to consider the full

19   range that the jury authorized.            And I would note the

20   language in Apprendi did, in fact, address this issue of

21   range when it said, "One need only look to the kind,

22   degree, or range of punishment to which the prosecution

23   is, by law, entitled for a given set of facts."

24                  Thank you.

25                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.
