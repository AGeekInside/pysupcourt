 8               ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BEDERMAN

 9                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10               MR. BEDERMAN:            Mr. Chief Justice, good

11   morning and may it please the Court:

12               At the heart of this appeal is a matter of

13   statutory construction.          Respondent received $2.3

14   million in public funds under the Victims Protection and

15   Terrorism Risk Insurance Act.               TRIA provides, and this

16   is at the blue brief, page 11a, that a party electing to

17   receive such funds must relinquish rights with respect

18   to enforcement against property that is at issue in

19   claims against the United States before an international

20   tribunal or that is the subject of awards by such

21   tribunal.

22               The property in question here is the Cubic

23   judgment.   Respondent renounced rights to attach the

24   Cubic judgment because in case B/61 before the

25   Iran-United States Claims Tribunal at the Hague the


                                          3

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   United States has demanded that any awards Iran receives

 2   in its claim against the United States be set off by the

 3   amount of the Cubic judgment.            This can only occur if

 4   the Cubic judgment is released from Respondent's lien

 5   and is remitted to Iran's Ministry of Defense.

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, they could

 7   have agreed that they have a bank account somewhere and

 8   any amounts would be set off by that.                  That wouldn't

 9   make that bank account at issue with respect to their

10   claim.

11              MR. BEDERMAN:          No, in that scenario I agree

12   with you, Mr. Chief Justice, that that would not be

13   implicated, because I think the clear import of the

14   statutory language here that Congress is trying to

15   achieve is that being at issue -- as you'll notice, the

16   statutory provision in 201(c) is disjunctive.                 It refers

17   to claims against the United States -- at issue in

18   claims against the United States before an international

19   tribunal, or that is the subject of an award.                 So I

20   think the disjunctive character of the statute might

21   indicate that the at-issue prong includes a broader set

22   of property than would be indicated possibly by the

23   "subject of an award."

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So it doesn't matter

25   that Iran recognizes that this would be used to set off


                                       4

 1   a judgment it might obtain, because you just said, well

 2   they could -- a bank account could be used to set it off

 3   and that's not sufficient.

 4               MR. BEDERMAN:          Well, the mutual -- let me be

 5   clear.   The mutual position of Iran and the United

 6   States before the Claims Tribunal is that the Cubic

 7   judgment, because it's related to a claim within the

 8   tribunal's jurisdiction -- and I think that's a key

 9   limiting principle here.         The United States would not be

10   entitled to set off amounts in bank accounts that are

11   attributable to other parties or other aspects that are

12   not implicated in claims or defenses before the

13   tribunal.

14               So clearly an examination of the tribunal's

15   jurisdiction and the relevant claims or defenses that

16   are before the tribunal is relevant here.               Petitioner is

17   not espousing a position before this Court that any

18   inchoate property located anywhere in the world would be

19   blanketed with immunity under this provision.               It's not

20   necessary to reach that conclusion in order to find for

21   Petitioner here.

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The United States at some

23   stage told the tribunal in The Hague that the Cubic

24   judgment -- and now I'm quoting -- "has nothing to do

25   with matters before the international tribunal."

 1   "Nothing to do with."

 2                 MR. BEDERMAN:          Yes, that is the language

 3   used by the United States in a memorial before the

 4   tribunal.     The United States has also indicated, and

 5   this is clear in the gray brief at pages 81 in note 32

 6   and the gray brief at pages 83 to 85, and in the

 7   lodgment, that if -- if Iran receives an award in case

 8   B/61 it must be offset or set off, or "recouped" is

 9   sometimes the language used in the correspondence

10   between the two governments before the tribunal, by the

11   amount of the Cubic judgment.

12                 I won't speak for the United States position

13   before the tribunal.        The United States is here to do

14   that, of course, Justice Ginsburg.                   But the only way I

15   can interpret that remark is to indicate that obviously

16   before the tribunal is the issue of the United States'

17   obligations to Iran under the Algiers Accords.                   The

18   Cubic judgment deals, of course, with the private

19   disposition of the contractual relationship between

20   Iran's Ministry of Defense and the Cubic military

21   contractor.

22                 Now Respondents take the position that these

23   two make the matters unrelated.                But if you review

24   carefully the tribunal's jurisdiction as encompassing

25   both claims and counterclaims, and according to the


                                          6

 1   Algiers Accords in the claims settlement declaration,

 2   counterclaims include that which arises out of the same

 3   contract, transaction or occurrence that constitutes the

 4   subject matter of the claim.

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             There is no counterclaim

 6   stated before the tribunal as of this moment.

 7               MR. BEDERMAN:          I'm sorry, I didn't hear the

 8   first.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             There is no counterclaim

10   in the case before the tribunal.

11               MR. BEDERMAN:          That's right.          The United

12   States did not file a formal counterclaim in case B/61,

13   but it has made a demand for a setoff.                  And within the

14   tribunal rules, a setoff can be the subject of notice

15   under Rule 19-3 or an amendment or certainly comes under

16   waiver of objection provision in Rule 30.

17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I was going to ask that

18   question.   In other words, there are cases or at least

19   it is contemplated that there will be cases under the

20   rules, where the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal does

21   determine that there should or should not be an offset.

22               MR. BEDERMAN:          There -- there certainly have

23   been cases, if you are speaking of the tribunal's

24   earlier jurisprudence in terms of offsetting claims.

25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Yes.

 1                 MR. BEDERMAN:         Yes, there has certainly been

 2   ample tribunal precedent which the United States has

 3   relied upon in making this demand for a setoff.

 4                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            But assuming -- assuming

 5   the tribunal takes up some such issue as Justice Kennedy

 6   has mentioned, it will start with the assumption that

 7   the Cubic judgment is in fact a valid judgment.                  It will

 8   not look behind the Cubic judgment as such, will it?

 9                 MR. BEDERMAN:         Of course, the validity of

10   the Cubic judgment does remain on appeal when the Ninth

11   Circuit --

12                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            But that's an entirely

13   separate proceeding.       Assuming the Cubic judgment has

14   not been reversed through the appellate process that it

15   is going through, then the tribunal will take the Cubic

16   judgment as it finds it.

17                 MR. BEDERMAN:         I would assume it would.         And

18   I assume --

19                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.      Doesn't it make it

20   pretty tough to say that the Cubic judgment is at issue?

21                 MR. BEDERMAN:         No, Justice Souter.         If -- if

22   we understand Congress' -- I don't -- I think this

23   matter can be resolved by a straightforward textual

24   approach in looking at TRIA section 201(c).                  Evidently,

25   though, if we are looking at congressional intent here,

 1   it is to protect the United States' litigation position

 2   before the tribunal.        To allow the attachment of the

 3   Cubic judgment would simply be allowing Respondent to

 4   remove a source of money that would be available --

 5                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             I mean, I think we

 6   understand that.     And -- and it's clear that the United

 7   States, in effect, is taking the position that that's

 8   all we need to bear in mind.               But it suggests to me that

 9   the drafting of the statute did not go as far as it

10   might have gone to protect the interests of the United

11   States.

12                 MR. BEDERMAN:          I won't speak, of course, for

13   the United States' position.              The Petitioner's position

14   is that where property has been identified to the

15   tribunal as being related to a claim or defense within

16   its jurisdiction, and the availability of that property

17   affects the relief that can be granted by the tribunal,

18   it is at issue.

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Explain to me why it

20   would effect the relief?           Because suppose Iran doesn't

21   get the proceeds of the Cubic judgment, but instead a

22   creditor of Iran, in this case Elahi, a creditor gets

23   it.     It should still be -- you've paid the -- Iran's

24   bill.     Iran owes money to X.           Why shouldn't the United

25   States equally get the credit whether the Cubic judgment


                                          9

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   in the end is pocketed by Iran or by Iran's creditor,

 2   Elahi?

 3               MR. BEDERMAN:          Well, obviously we await the

 4   tribunal's award in this respect.                And I believe, based

 5   on the tribunal's past precedents, the benefit in terms

 6   of finding a breach of the Algiers Accords as it would

 7   or it must in this case to find in favor of Iran, would

 8   indicate that the benefits accruing for certain setoffs

 9   must ultimately come back to Iran in order to be

10   credited in the way that you suggest.

11               I think it is an improper position to

12   suggest that if a creditor of Iran or Iran's Ministry of

13   Defense in this instance can claim or assert the lien so

14   that somehow it's credited to Iran's account, so to

15   speak, in calculating the setoff of the tribunal.                That

16   has not been the tribunal's jurisprudence in terms of

17   examining the implications of a breach by the United

18   States under the Algiers Accords.                And in a number of

19   cases --

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Would you -- something

21   that I would just like clarification on.                You mentioned

22   that the Cubic judgment is on appeal to the Ninth

23   Circuit.   It has been on appeal since June of '98?

24               MR. BEDERMAN:          Yes, ma'am.

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And there are cross

 1   appeals.   What are the positions taken about that

 2   judgment by the respective sides, and why is it pending

 3   for ten years?

 4               MR. BEDERMAN:          That has been a mystery to me

 5   as well.   In fact, there has been a resolution by Cubic

 6   Defense Systems and Iran's Ministry of Defense and as

 7   soon as the Court renders its judgment in this case,

 8   that matter will finally move to disposition.              It is a

 9   bit odd that the underlying issue of Cubic's objections

10   to the district court's enforcement of the International

11   Chamber of Commerce or ICC arbitral award has pended for

12   so long.   I would have thought, logically, it would have

13   made more sense to have disposed of those issues and

14   then allow the disposition of the liens to be resolved

15   by the Court.

16               Essentially, it is Cubic's appeal

17   challenging aspects of the district court's enforcement

18   under the New York convention of the ICC arbitral award.

19   I think to the extent that there is a counterclaim it's

20   simply that there were some bases for support of the

21   judgment which Iran's Ministry of Defense would have put

22   forward in addition to the district court.              That's what

23   I understand in terms of the ruling of Judge Brewster

24   originally in the district court on this manner.

25               So, yes, it is unfortunate that the


                                       11

 1   underlying validity of the Cubic judgment still remains

 2   open as a matter of appeal.

 3                 But again to return to your point,

 4   Justice Ginsburg, in Cases 815 and 821 before the

 5   tribunal this question of what would be the

 6   implications, financial and otherwise, for the United

 7   States being found by the tribunal to be in breach of

 8   the Algiers Accords because of the failure of not

 9   allowing the export of Iranian property or repatriation

10   of Iranian property to the United States has been

11   explicated.     And, in fact, in already one instance the

12   tribunal has found the United States to be in breach of

13   Algiers Accords obligations.

14                 So again, I can't speak for what a ruling in

15   the tribunal would be.         All I can suggest is certainly

16   the Iranian position before the tribunal would be that

17   in the instance that if Mr. Elahi or any other lienor

18   were successful in attaching the Cubic judgment that in

19   such a situation it should not be credited as a setoff

20   under these circumstances.

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Could -- let's assume

22   that the -- that Iran is able to execute on the Cubic

23   judgment.     Could it take the proceeds out of the United

24   States, given the 2007 blocking order?

25                 MR. BEDERMAN:          Well, I mean, the issue of

 1   the secretary of state's October 2007 designation, which

 2   I think is what you are referring to, is a late

 3   development in this case.         Of course, that occurred

 4   three months after the Ninth Circuit's amended opinion.

 5              My submission to this Court is that the

 6   appropriate disposition, assuming the Court well takes

 7   Petitioner's position that Respondent has actually

 8   relinquished its claim under TRIA, is to remand back to

 9   the district court, because then we would have two new

10   sets of lienors, Mr. Raffi and Mr. Rubin.              It would be

11   before the district court that factual issues like

12   whether the designation of the "Ministry of Defense and

13   Armed Forces Logistics," which is what is actually named

14   in the blocking order, actually covers the Ministry of

15   Defense and Support for the Armed Forces of the Islamic

16   Republic of Iran, who is your Petitioner today.

17              The issue of whether designations cover

18   particular entities or aliases of entities is an

19   intensity factual one; the D.C. Circuit in the National

20   Council of Resistance case, Chief Justice Roberts, an

21   opinion you are well aware of at the D.C. Circuit.

22   These are intensely factual inquiries about whether

23   aliases of particular organizations are covered by

24   designations.

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You mentioned -- you

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   mentioned that there were other claimants or others --

 2   others who would like to execute --

 3               MR. BEDERMAN:          Other lienors.

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- other lienors -- other

 5   attachments.   And so, you said in the end -- well --

 6   well, what would be the effect of those other liens?

 7               MR. BEDERMAN:          My understanding,

 8   Justice Ginsburg, is in both the cases of Mr. Rubin and

 9   Mr. Raffi, as far as I am aware, they have not made the

10   relinquishment election under TRIA as Dr. Elahi has done

11   here.   And because they have not made the relinquishment

12   proviso, they would not be subject to the at-issue

13   question that is now before the Court.

14               Iran's Ministry of Defense has other

15   substantive defenses against their liens, which we

16   appropriately presented before the district court.

17               The only submission I am making to this

18   Court at this time is that it is not necessary for this

19   Court exercising plenary authority to decide whether

20   it's a blocked asset.      That is appropriate for remand

21   because, notwithstanding the U.S. position, I think

22   there are questions of whether your Petitioner is a

23   covered entity under the -- under the designation, and

24   whether in fact it is the beneficial owner, whether

25   Iran's Air Force is the beneficial owner of this claim.


                                       14

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   And there are other substantive defenses that claim

 2   retroactivity, as well.         So, again, I just don't think

 3   it's appropriate --

 4                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But going back to the main

 5   issue, the only reason that this is at issue before the

 6   Iran tribunal is because it might be a setoff in the

 7   event of judgment in favor of Iran?

 8                 MR. BEDERMAN:         Yes.      Whether it is available

 9   for setoff.    And again, I want to be clear that --

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That's the -- that's

11   the only basis for your argument?                 I thought it was a

12   broader suggestion that these are, to some extent,

13   substitute assets for the assets that are at issue?

14                 MR. BEDERMAN:         Well, I mean, that may be one

15   useful analytic in thinking about this.                  I was trying in

16   imagining the interest of the Court in understanding the

17   tribunal's jurisdiction under the Algiers Accords and

18   what the tribunal has already ruled, and that's why I

19   think respectful consideration might be appropriate

20   here, inasmuch as the tribunal, in interpreting its

21   jurisdiction under the Algiers Accords, which is

22   essentially its organic instrument, has made a

23   determination in Case B/66 that the substantive

24   contracts at issue here between Cubic and the Iranian

25   Air Force are at issue in case B/61.

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Can you -- can you

 2   articulate a general test in a sentence or two about how

 3   you decide whether particular assets are at issue?

 4               MR. BEDERMAN:          Yes.      I will repeat the one I

 5   -- I rendered before because I think it is the most

 6   useful analytic, and I -- I take no credit.                 This is

 7   essentially Judge Fisher's analysis in the dissent

 8   below.   As he indicated, that -- that -- where property

 9   has been identified to the Tribunal -- and certainly the

10   Cubic judgment and the proceedings that have occurred in

11   the Federal district court in -- in Southern California

12   and now the Ninth Circuit and now here have been

13   identified to the Tribunal in mutual representations and

14   undertakings by the parties.            Where this property has

15   been identified to the Tribunal as being related to a

16   claim or defense within the Tribunal's jurisdiction --

17   and I think that is the key limiting principle here.

18   That's -- there is a criticism that an expansive reading

19   of TRIA's "At Issue" provision will allow Iran and the

20   United States, as unlikely as it sounds, to mutually

21   collude to cover various properties and assets around

22   the world, I think noting that the -- that the Cubic

23   judgment is within the Court's jurisdiction as

24   understood under the Algiers Accords Claims Settlement

25   Declaration, Article 2, paragraph 3.


                                       16

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              And then the second prong is that the

 2   availability of that property affects the relief that

 3   can be granted by the Tribunal.             And, again, we are not

 4   hypothesizing here.     The Tribunal has already indicated

 5   in cases like Owens Corning, Futura Trading and Computer

 6   Services, that when you have a situation avoiding a

 7   double recovery, that a setoff derived from collateral

 8   proceedings, even absent privity of contract with the

 9   sovereign seeking adjustment and with respect to

10   different causes of action, a setoff is still

11   appropriate within the Tribunal.

12              So it's both an avoidance of a -- of a

13   double-recovery rule and also a notion that a -- a

14   certain offset is -- is related as within the -- the

15   jurisdiction of the tribunal as arising again from the

16   same contract transaction or occurrence.

17              JUSTICE SOUTER:            "At Issue" means related to

18   -- "At Issue" means related to an issue in a separate

19   case.

20              MR. BEDERMAN:          I mean --

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:            That's what it boils down

22   to, doesn't it?

23              MR. BEDERMAN:          Petitioner is not taking the

24   same --

25              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, doesn't it?

 1               MR. BEDERMAN:          No, Your Honor.           I'm sorry.

 2   The Petitioner's position is slightly more modulated

 3   than the United States.        The United States' position

 4   here is all it has to be is relevant.                   I -- I will leave

 5   it to the Court to -- to speak with the United States

 6   about that in a moment.

 7               I think a more nuanced understanding of the

 8   Tribunal's jurisdiction is appropriate here.                   Is -- and

 9   here there is no question, based on the materials that

10   you have not only in the joint appendix but also in the

11   lodgment, that the Cubic contracts have been identified

12   to the Tribunal.   And now the Cubic judgment as an

13   offset has a setoff -- or "recoupment" is sometimes the

14   language used in the diplomatic exchanges and filings

15   before the Tribunal -- has now been identified to the

16   Tribunal.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:            Is it the case that there

18   are two other individuals who have attached this

19   judgment?

20               MR. BEDERMAN:          Yes, Justice Breyer.          I think

21   I spoke about that a moment ago.               That would be --

22               JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.        And is it the

23   case that Iran's position in respect to those

24   attachments is that those attachments, insofar as they

25   are valid and executed, require a setoff from whatever


                                       18

 1   we owe Iran or vice-versa?

 2                 MR. BEDERMAN:         My understanding, if you are

 3   speaking of me characterizing the United States'

 4   position --

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:           No.     I'm saying I take

 6   it from something I have read in this that Iran believes

 7   that if, in fact, it won a judgment and that judgment is

 8   from someone like Cubic --

 9                 MR. BEDERMAN:         Yes.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:           -- who they thought was

11   prevented from delivering planes because of the embargo

12   -- so it was relevant -- that that judgment, which they

13   get if they collect on it, should be deducted from other

14   money the United States owes them.

15                 MR. BEDERMAN:         Yes, and --

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:           -- unless instead of them

17   getting it, the attacher gets it.

18                 MR. BEDERMAN:         It's the --

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:           The attachee gets it.

20                 MR. BEDERMAN:         It's the "unless," I suppose,

21   that, of course, Iran objects to.                 It is that in order

22   for the setoff to be effective within the Tribunal's

23   jurisprudence and jurisdiction, Iran's Ministry of

24   Defense or -- or the --

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Has to get the money for


                                        19

 1   the attaching person.      That's my point.

 2              MR. BEDERMAN:           Yes, sir.

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:             And so that is at issue

 4   before the -- and -- and it is at issue in those cases.

 5   If the person who attaches it gets the money rather than

 6   Iran, Iran will say:      We do not have to have a setoff.

 7              MR. BEDERMAN:           I agree.             If it's at issue --

 8              JUSTICE BREYER:             Isn't that right or --

 9              MR. BEDERMAN:           Correct.             If it's at --

10              JUSTICE BREYER:             And that is the same

11   question that you think would be presented through this

12   attachment, is that right?

13              MR. BEDERMAN:           I thought that's what we were

14   speaking of:   The status of the Cubic judgment and --

15   and Dr. Elahi's attachment of the --

16              JUSTICE BREYER:             Dr. Elahi is one of several

17   persons, is that right?

18              MR. BEDERMAN:           That is correct.            There is a

19   queue of individuals who have lined up to -- to --

20              JUSTICE BREYER:             What I'm trying to get at

21   is Iran's position vis-a-vis the Elahi judgment is the

22   same as its position vis-a-vis the other two attachments

23   on the Elahi judgment.

24              MR. BEDERMAN:           Yes, sir.

25              JUSTICE BREYER:             That if Iran ends up with


                                       20
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the money, you can subtract it from other money the

 2   United States owes them.        But if the attaching people

 3   end up with the money, you cannot.

 4              MR. BEDERMAN:          So it's "At Issue" -- I am --

 5   I am sorry for having been so opague.                  It is "At Issue"

 6   in the sense of "joinder at issue," a legitimate

 7   disagreement between the parties.               And its also "At

 8   Issue," I believe -- I think in the sense that Congress

 9   intended by this provision of saying that the funds are

10   available for a tribunal ruling.              And, therefore, to

11   allow an attachment under these circumstances would

12   frustrate the United States' litigation position.                 So

13   any way you parse what "At Issue" means --

14              JUSTICE BREYER:            You would take the same

15   position if, in fact, this money which is owed to Iran

16   by -- by Cubic -- that is, Cubic, which then Iran got a

17   judgment on -- instead of a judgment in favor of Iran,

18   Cubic had written them a check, and they had taken the

19   check and bought a house in Manhattan, or they had put

20   it in an Iranian bank account, and either Mr. Elahi or

21   one of the other two people sought to attach the bank

22   account or the house or the grocery store, which they

23   might have also have used.         Am I right --

24              MR. BEDERMAN:          Yes.

25              JUSTICE BREYER:            -- or wrong?

 1                MR. BEDERMAN:          Yes, Justice Breyer, you are

 2   correct.    There is a concern, which is a very natural

 3   concern, that the more attenuated you get, can you

 4   attribute a particular property, whether it's a bank

 5   account or a -- or a New York condo --

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:            I don't see why either is

 7   the slightest a bit more attenuated.                      In either case

 8   they are owned by the Ministry of Defense of Iran.

 9                MR. BEDERMAN:          I would certainly concur;

10   and, if I may, I will reserve the balance of my time.

15                  ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

17                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     Mr. Chief Justice,

18   and may it please the Court:

19                The United States does not appear here today

20   in support of Iran, but, rather, in defense of critical

21   interests of the United States before the United States-

22   Iran Claims Tribunal.       In particular, the holding of the

23   Court of Appeals that the United States never unblocked

24   Iranian military assets after the Algiers accords is

25   directly contrary to the position of the United States


                                        22

 1   before the Tribunal, and Iran immediately indicated that

 2   it would use that holding against the United States and

 3   in support of its multimillion-dollar --

 4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But that's not saying

 5   that.   Isn't that -- that issue is moot?

 6                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    Well, Your Honor,

 7   there is now a new and independent reason why the asset

 8   is blocked.    And, in fact, Respondent no longer defends

 9   the holding of the court of appeals on that basis.

10                 It is, we wish to emphasize, essential that

11   this Court vacate that holding and indicate that it is

12   no longer legally valid so that it is not -- that

13   erroneous holding is not used against us in support of

14   Iran's two-million-dollar claim.

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But if we -- if we took

16   the position that you are expressing about what is at

17   issue, we would never reach the second question.

18                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    Well, we -- we

19   think that the Court would not.               It would vacate the

20   decision of the Court of Appeals.                 It would be helpful

21   certainly to the United States if the Court emphasized

22   the natural fact that that would mean that the court of

23   appeals' erroneous holding was not any longer legally --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But it's not our job

25   to help you -- it's not our job to help you in other


                                        23

 1   tribunals.   If a -- if a judgment is moot, it's moot.

 2   We are not going to go back and tell the Ninth Circuit

 3   to revise its opinion just because that's helpful to

 4   you.

 5                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    No.   The -- the

 6   Court would vacate the decision, certainly.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So is it your

 8   position that that -- that is moot?

 9                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                    It is our position

10   that the -- because Respondent has relinquished his

11   right to attach these assets, the decision of the court

12   of appeals should be vacated.             And that would have the

13   affect of rendering inoperative that erroneous -- the

14   other erroneous holding of the court of appeals with

15   respect to blocked assets.

16                It is the position of the United States --

17   and we agree with Respondent on this point -- that as of

18   now, because of the October, 2007, designation, the

19   property of Petitioner is blocked and subject to

20   attachment under TRIA.       And I don't believe there is any

21   need for further proceedings on that.

22                The Secretary of State designated the

23   Ministry of Defense of Iran, and the position of

24   Petitioner in the court of appeals on remand from this

25   Court was that it is the Ministry of Defense of Iran, a

 1   central core constituent part of the Iranian state, that

 2   is the entity that was designated.

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Do I understand correctly

 4   that that means that because it's a blocked asset, then

 5   Dr. Elahi can get it, but Iran itself couldn't get it?

 6               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     Elahi, Respondent

 7   Elahi, could get it if he had not relinquished his

 8   rights to attach --

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Yes.

10               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     -- assets at issue

11   before the tribunal.      As of right now, the asset is

12   blocked and Iran could not repatriate it, as of right

13   now.   Of course, blocking orders can be amended, but as

14   of right now it is frozen and Petitioner cannot

15   repatriate it.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So why isn't the

17   consequence that you are so worried about under the

18   Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act that

19   this is going to hurt your position by the tribunal, the

20   same consequence that is going to come from the fact

21   that these assets are blocked?

22               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     Well, Your Honor,

23   again, the blocking order is the present status of the

24   assets.   It doesn't mean that they could not later be

25   repatriated to Petitioner; whereas, execution by

 1   Respondent against the assets would mean that they would

 2   be forever denied to Petitioner.

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But --

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So why wouldn't the

 5   United States get credit for that, too, on the theory

 6   that I suggested before?

 7               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     Well, you are

 8   right, Your Honor, that is the position of the United

 9   States.   And earlier Your Honor quoted language from the

10   oral argument of the United States that the -- or maybe

11   it was one of our briefs -- that the Cubic judgment

12   is -- that the tribunal doesn't have to --

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             It has nothing to do with

14   matters before the --

15               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     That is in the

16   context of our saying that, whether or not -- in the

17   view of the United States, whether or not Petitioner

18   ever collects that money, the United States is entitled

19   to an offset, and in fact, we believe it's a complete

20   defense to Iran's claim.

21               Of course, Petitioner's argument -- or

22   Iran's argument before the tribunal is that it is --

23   that the United States is entitled to a reduction of

24   liability only if Iran actual receives the assets.                       And

25   that's why the language of the statute is written more


                                       26

 1   broadly when the litigation before the tribunal is

 2   ongoing.    At that point any property that is at issue

 3   before the tribunal is not subject to attachment by one

 4   who has relinquished, and that's because this Court nor

 5   any other lower court in the United States is supposed

 6   to pre-judge the merits of those respective positions.

 7   Iran's position -- and it's on page 85a of the United

 8   States' appendix -- is that the awarded amount, unless

 9   received by Iran, cannot be offset against any relief

10   which the United States may be found to owe Iran.

11                So that is Iran's position.                 That is at

12   issue before the tribunal.

13                The Respondent would have the Court believe

14   that the proceedings in the tribunal are in the nature

15   of an in rem proceeding, that it's a property dispute.

16   They use that term repeatedly in the brief, "a property

17   dispute."    But that is not the nature of the proceedings

18   in the tribunal.    Iran has asserted a claim that the

19   United States violated its obligations under the Algiers

20   Accords.    The remedy it seeks is , and I quote -- this

21   is from -- excuse me -- from the -- let's see -- the

22   remedy they seek -- they seek is the value of the Cubic

23   sale to Canada.    They have said that in the state -- in

24   Iran's reply in statement -- claim 16 that Respondent

25   relies upon, they say that the remedy they seek is not

 1   the asset itself.

 2                Of course, the asset had been dissipated

 3   before Iran ever filed a statement of claim against the

 4   United States.    The remedy is the proceeds of that sale

 5   to Canada.    The proceeds of the sale to Canada, which

 6   are the subject of Iran's claim against the United

 7   States in the tribunal, have been reduced to judgment in

 8   the Cubic judgment.      That --

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I guess this may be

10   the same question Justice Breyer asked.                      I mean, where

11   do you cut this off?       You've got the proceeds from the

12   sale to Canada that presumably go to Cubic, and then

13   Cubic, you know, builds a new facility somewhere with

14   those proceeds and then sells it to somebody else.                         I

15   mean, are those still assets at issue in the claims

16   before the tribunal?

17                MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     Well, I believe

18   that in fact the language of the statute makes it -- the

19   assertions of the parties before the tribunal that

20   define the property that is at issue before the

21   tribunal.    That, again, is so that the courts are not

22   put in a position of adjudicating, prejudging, the

23   merits of the parties' arguments before the tribunal.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, that's kind of

25   a -- that's a broad assertion.               In other words, so long

 1   as you and Iran get together and say this asset is at

 2   issue in a situation where whether it's at issue or not

 3   saves you money and gives money to Iran, that seems to

 4   be a very self-serving legal test.

 5                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     Well, Your Honor, I

 6   don't believe that this Court needs to consider what the

 7   outer reaches are.      In this case, this is -- Iran

 8   characterizes it, and this is at page, again, at page 85

 9   of the U.S. appendix, that the Cubic judgment, quote

10   "constitutes an integral part of the remedy sought in

11   case B/61."

12                 This isn't an offset or a counterclaim.

13   Justice Ginsburg, you previously alluded to the fact the

14   United States did not file a counterclaim.                      And that's

15   because this is not some unrelated counterclaim the

16   United States has against Iran.                This is a critical part

17   of Iran's claim against the United States.                      It defeats,

18   in the view of the United States, Iran's claim entirely.

19   At the very least, it reduces the amount of Iran's claim

20   against the United States.

21                 This isn't somehow unrelated; we're

22   asserting, well, we can use this as an offset because

23   you also owe us money from something else.                      This is in

24   Iran's own statement, and this is the statement that you

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But how is that affected

 2   -- how is that affected depending on whether or not the

 3   judgment is executed or not.              Would the Iran tribunal

 4   have the authority to order Cubic not to satisfy the

 5   judgment, but to just hold the funds?

 6               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                       I -- I don't know.

 7   Cubic is not before the tribunal.                  But what we can ask

 8   is, can we conceive of -- and I think it's relatively

 9   easy to conceive of -- an award of the tribunal that

10   says, the United States owes Iran $2.8 million; if the

11   Cubic judgment is received by Iran, the United States

12   owes Iran nothing.      And clearly, in that circumstance,

13   the Cubic judgment is the subject of the award of the

14   tribunal.

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I don't know that it's the

16   subject of the award.        And it's really not at issue;

17   it's just recognizing that there has been some prior

18   transaction.

19               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                       Well, I guess, Your

20   Honor, you have to think what does it mean for any

21   property -- property to be at issue before the tribunal

22   or the subject of the award?

23               JUSTICE SOUTER:              It means that at the end of

24   the proceeding one side or the other gets the property.

25               MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                       Well --

 1                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            And that is not going to be

 2   the -- what one side or the other gets in this

 3   proceeding is going to be a new judgment.                       And that new

 4   judgment may or may not be satisfied by dealing with the

 5   prior judgment.    But that doesn't mean that the prior

 6   judgment is at issue; it simply means that the prior

 7   judgment may be used to discharge in an appropriate case

 8   an obligation which is determined in the later

 9   proceeding.

10                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     If I may respond.

11   Your Honor, on that view, even the ACMR is not at issue

12   before the tribunal, because the tribunal cannot order

13   the United States to hand over the ACMR to Iran.                       In the

14   A/15 judgment to which Petitioner's counsel alluded

15   earlier, the tribunal recognized that it is not a

16   violation of the United States' obligations under the

17   Algiers Accords not to issue an export license.

18   Therefore, Iran --

19                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       So Iran --

20                 MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:                     -- is not entitled

21   to the ACMR.    It's entitled to its loss, and its loss

22   has been reduced to judgment in the Cubic judgment.

 2                ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

 3                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 4                MR. PHILLIPS:          Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 5   and may it please the Court:

 6                I think the previous 25 or so minutes has

 7   demonstrated one sort of overarching fact, which is that

 8   there is an enormous risk, if this Court decides to

 9   interpret the language of this statute broadly, that it

10   will easily sweep beyond any kind of arrangements

11   between Iran and the United States in ways that

12   fundamentally, obviously, disadvantage the very people

13   that Congress clearly intended to benefit by this entire

14   statutory scheme.

15                This is a scheme that was designed to

16   provide remedies, recoveries, to the victims of

17   terrorism.    And somehow in the scheme of everything that

18   was discussed in the first 25 or so minutes of this

19   argument, the victims of terrorism are completely

20   shunted aside on basic -- on the basis of very technical

21   ways of reading it.

22                But if we go back to the language of the

23   statute, which is in the Petitioner's brief at 11a, it

24   talks about "enforcement against property that is at

25   issue in claims against the United States."              So the


                                        32

 1   notion that we would focus on the word "property," as it

 2   relates to the tribunal and that the tribunal has in

 3   front of it, is a natural consequence of the language of

 4   that provision.    And to me, at least, the best way to

 5   look at the logic is to review how often the United

 6   States has described and Iran has described what was the

 7   property at issue before the claims tribunal and the

 8   B/61 proceeding?    And this is at 65a of the joint -- of

 9   the government's brief:         "The property at issue consists

10   of one air combat maneuvering range system and all

11   necessary subparts."       There is no dispute that the

12   property was within the jurisdiction of the United

13   States.   Now --

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So that if you had

15   these military assets, which are clearly the assets that

16   are at issue in Iran's claim --

17               MR. PHILLIPS:           Absolutely.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Cubic is worried

19   about what to do with it and so they sell them to the

20   Canadians but they keep the proceeds in escrow, under

21   the theory that look we may end up owing this to the

22   Iranians under the tribunal.             Under the setoff, this may

23   not be our assets, which -- I mean the Iranians have a

24   claim to these.    Would those -- would those escrow funds

25   be assets at issue?

 1                 MR. PHILLIPS:         I think they would be because

 2   of the way the Iranians actually pled this.                  They said

 3   give us either back -- give us either the military

 4   equipment that we bought, or give us the economic value

 5   of that.   But that's -- and that's why --

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, why is that

 7   very different from this situation, where you have an

 8   arbitration award saying that you, Cubic, owe the

 9   equivalent of what you should have -- what you would

10   have provided to Iran, if there hadn't been the

11   revolution?

12                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, there are two answers

13   to that.   The first one is remember precisely what the

14   arbitration award is.       The arbitration award is not the

15   value of the asset.      That was asked for; that was

16   rejected by the arbitrator.             The arbitration award is

17   for the value of a separate contract between Cubic and

18   the Canadian government.          You will recall in the award,

19   specifically the arbitrator said with respect to the

20   underlying ACMR contract with Iran, that was mutually

21   walked away from by both parties, and then there was a

22   separate agreement that was entered into between the

23   parties, and that was the basis for the arbitration

24   award saying the value of breach of that secondary

25   agreement is the part that serves as the arbitral award.

 1   That it seems to me ought to be regarded at a minimum as

 2   one step too far removed, because that's not the

 3   property that is at issue before the claims tribunal in

 4   any way that the parties are disputing about it.                     They

 5   accept that number.      And then --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Right.           So what is the --

 7   it seems at the moment, frankly you could read it either

 8   way.   Let's imagine that -- that Cubic sold some jets

 9   that we blocked and they get some money, and they did it

10   under their contract, and they got 2 million dollars.

11   And suppose they said, we owe Iran this money, and they

12   pay Iran the money, and Iran puts it in a bank account

13   or buys the grocery store.           All right?

14                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Right.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Now suppose that happened.

16   It makes it simpler.       And then what happens is three

17   people, including Mr. Elahi and two others who don't

18   accept money, the other two, attach it, on the ground

19   Iran owes us this money.

20                 MR. PHILLIPS:         Right.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:           We want the grocery store.

22   And suppose, further, Iran then says, if they get their

23   money, you cannot subtract it, United States, from what

24   you owe us.    But if we get the money, then you can

25   subtract it.    That's their view.

 1               The United States' view is different.                 Who

 2   will resolve that question?           The tribunal.        So they say,

 3   what is at issue is not who owns the grocery store; what

 4   is at issue is the question of whether we get the money

 5   or you get the money.      What money?             The money that is

 6   the value of the grocery store, or the bank account, in

 7   which case it's identical.

 8               Now I think in that situation it's easy for

 9   me to say that money, the grocery store, or the bank

10   account, of course is at issue before the tribunal.                For

11   the question is, does Iran get it or does the United

12   States get it, in the situation where the two other

13   people -- leaving Elahi out of it -- can attach it.                I

14   can easily read it that way.           I can also read it the way

15   you want.

16               MR. PHILLIPS:         Right.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:           All right?       So now, which

18   do I do?

19               (Laughter.)

20               MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, you clearly -- and I

21   agree with you; there is no question you can read this

22   statute either way.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.       I'll then add

24   that the strongest argument against you, it seems to me,

25   is the whole point of this was not simply to compensate

 1   victims of terrorism.        That's a worthy goal, and that's

 2   one of the points.      But it was to compensate them

 3   consistent with the proper running, in the interests of

 4   the United States, of the Iranian-American Claims

 5   Tribunal.

 6               And so this is just the kind of issue we

 7   don't want to simply take away and let the victim have,

 8   because there is a strong risk the tribunal will rule

 9   against us, and we will have to pay it twice.                  Okay.

10   That's the argument against you.

11               Now, what's the argument for you?

12               MR. PHILLIPS:            Right.        First of all --

13               JUSTICE BREYER:              Yes.

14               MR. PHILLIPS:            A significant purpose of this

15   entire exercise obviously is to provide redress to the

16   victims of terrorism.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:              That's one, but --

18               MR. PHILLIPS:            201(d) is a specific

19   statutory construction provision which seems to suggest

20   that Congress says that if there are doubts about how to

21   apply this particular provision, you ought to put the

22   thumb on the scale in favor of the victim.                  So you do --

23   you will give meaning to section 201(c)(4) of the TRIA

24   if you adopt a position consistent with our position.

25               The reality is that given that there are two

 1   more lienholders in line, none of this has anything to

 2   do with Iran and with the way the tribunal is going to

 3   proceed, because even if you were to say that Dr. Elahi

 4   is not entitled to this, there is no relinquishment

 5   claim with respect to the others, so this money is never

 6   going back to Iran, under any set of circumstances.

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:           That creates the issue,

 8   because the question is whether money that never goes

 9   back to Iran, but rather goes to an attaching person, is

10   money that is or money that is not subtracted from the

11   amount that the United States owes Iran.

12                 MR. PHILLIPS:         But -- but --

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:           And that question is the

14   question --

15                 MR. PHILLIPS:         But Justice Breyer --

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:           -- is the question that is

17   before the commission.

18                 MR. PHILLIPS:         But the problem with this,

19   Justice Breyer, is that this is a relinquishment

20   provision.    It -- it is saying to us in return for these

21   limited resources, 20 percent of the judgment -- and

22   that is only 20 percent of the compensatory judgment and

23   completely lose the punitive judgment -- in return for

24   that you have to relinquish certain rights; and it seems

25   to me that Congress would not have adopted the a

 1   provision that said and the rights you relinquish are

 2   essentially unknowable under any circumstances and

 3   extend to the ends of the earth.               What I --

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:            They are totally knowable.

 5   They are totally knowable.          In order to decide what they

 6   are all you have to do is to look at the issues before

 7   the commission and decide whether those issues concern

 8   specific, concrete property; that is, the property that

 9   you have an interest in.

10               With my grocery store, with my bank account,

11   and with this claim, it is absolutely specific, and Iran

12   has put before the commission the question of whether if

13   you pay the money to an attaching person, we don't get

14   it, or we do get it.

15               MR. PHILLIPS:          Justice Breyer --

16               JUSTICE BREYER:            That's what I gather.     Now

17   you can tell me I'm wrong on that if you want.

18               MR. PHILLIPS:          The parties have been very

19   specific about it, and we cited in a series of

20   quotations about what is the property at issue here; and

21   the property at issue, Justice Breyer is the ACMR system

22   or the economic value of the ACMR system.               What is not

23   at issue in this case is the value of the Cubic

24   judgment.   First of all, there was an effort to bring

25   the Cubic judgment specifically before the tribunal, and


                                       39
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   it was rejected as having no jurisdiction, certainly no

 2   jurisdiction over Cubic and then no jurisdiction over

 3   the United States' part of the Cubic judgment because

 4   that was not a contract between --

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:            They are trying to attach

 6   the ACMR system.

 7               MR. PHILLIPS:          They did --

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:            They are trying to attach

 9   the Cubic judgment.     The ACMR judgment is in Canada.

10               MR. PHILLIPS:          But that's the whole point of

11   this.   The property at issue before the tribunal is the

12   ACMR system, and indeed in 1981 when this was originally

13   brought what Iran wanted was the ACMR system.

14               JUSTICE BREYER:            And that's one piece of

15   property.   The other piece of property that is at issue

16   is the judgment, and the way it's at issue is I take it

17   that two other people are saying, we attach it; Iran

18   says because they attach it, you don't subtract it from

19   the ACMR judgment; and we are saying, even though they

20   attach it, you subtract it, and therefore it's before

21   the tribunal as well.

22               That's my understanding at the moment, and

23   I'm asking you to explain why that's wrong.

24               MR. PHILLIPS:          Justice Breyer, there is no

25   question that the fact that there are subsequent

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   lienholders in line affects the possibility, but I would

 2   have thought it would only affect it in a way that is

 3   positive for me.     Because Iran is saying, look, this

 4   doesn't have any relevance to the -- to the Iran

 5   tribunal if we don't ever get the money; and the reality

 6   is whether Dr. Elahi gets the money or the other

 7   lienholders get the money, Iran is never going to get

 8   the money, which says to me it's not at issue under any

 9   theory of the case in front of the U.S.-Iranian claims

10   tribunal.

11               And so that would be my quickest answer to

12   that; to the extent that you have other lienholders, it

13   simply means that there really is nothing at issue

14   there.   But it still seems to me that the better way --

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Why not?      I mean, the

16   question I raised before, why wouldn't the United States

17   be urging that it gets credit, whether Iran gets the

18   money or whether the people who are creditors of Iran

19   get the money.   In either case, the United States should

20   be able to have --

21               MR. PHILLIPS:            Right, the United States

22   would still have that -- would still have that argument,

23   but it's not a claim against the United States, which is

24   what's required under the statute that we are dealing

25   with here when it's viewed that way.

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But Iran might say in the

 2   tribunal, in responding to the setoff argument, this

 3   claim that we brought against you, the United States,

 4   implicates a breach of obligations that you have that

 5   are un -- somewhat unrelated to what was at issue in

 6   the -- in the -- in the Cubic judgment.                And then the

 7   United States would say, no, that's not true.                So they

 8   would have to examine the Cubic judgment.                So that means

 9   it's at issue before the court.

10               MR. PHILLIPS:         No, I don't think there is

11   anybody whose going to -- well, maybe there is some

12   sense in which examining the Cubic judgment, but I don't

13   think the tribunal has remotely been asked to or will

14   under any circumstances be asked to review the Cubic

15   judgment.

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           There might be in the

17   setoff proceedings.     There might -- there might be an

18   argument that there are two obligations, and there is a

19   setoff or that there is a setoff.

20               MR. PHILLIPS:         Well, I mean, I think there

21   is no question these are for two different obligations.

22   And I think that's why candidly the Court ought to

23   decide that this is not property at issue here, because

24   it is so clearly unrelated to the weapons system itself

25   or to any monetization of the weapons system.               Remember

 1   the Cubic judgment comes from an arbitral award that

 2   doesn't have anything to do with that arms sale.                   It has

 3   to do with a completely separate contractual undertaking

 4   between the Cubic and the Canadian government --

 5               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, I think we might get

 6   --

 7               MR. PHILLIPS:          -- and Iran.

 8               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- substantial -- a

 9   substantial degree of argument on that point.

10               MR. PHILLIPS:          I don't know how there could

11   be an argument on that point, Justice Kennedy.                 If you

12   read the opinion of the arbitrator, it is absolutely

13   clear that the -- that the underlying agreement between

14   Iran and Cubic with respect to the arms sale was

15   mutually terminated by the parties, and a new agreement

16   entered into in order to resell those properties to

17   Canada.   The opinion is crystalline in that regard.

18               And it was on the basis of the violation of

19   that separate agreement that the -- that Cubic was then

20   held to be liable to Iran for the $2.8 million.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 The agreement

22   between who -- between who --

23               MR. PHILLIPS:          Between Iran and Cubic.

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So Iran, I assume,

25   would say, look, we entered into this agreement to take


                                       43

 1   the place of what was at dispute.                 Which is what they

 2   owed us because they didn't ship us the arms that we

 3   paid for.    I don't see that that adds anything to your

 4   argument.

 5                MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, it just says that you

 6   move even further down the road from what are the

 7   properties that are, in fact, at issue before the

 8   tribunal.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Right, so Iran says,

10   look, you are not going to ship us the planes, whatever

11   it is, you are not --

12                MR. PHILLIPS:          Although they wanted that.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You were not going

14   to give us the money, right?

15                MR. PHILLIPS:          And they still want that.

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And we still have a

17   dispute.    So, I tell you what, you are going to sell

18   this stuff to Canada, you are going to get some money

19   from them, and we have got an agreement that that money

20   is ours.

21                MR. PHILLIPS:          Mr. Chief Justice, that --

22   that -- they may have been able to make that argument.

23   That is not an argument they have made.                  The argument

24   they made, which represents the property at issue in the

25   claims, is first, give us back the arms; and then two,

 1   give us the value of those arms, not as they have been

 2   reformulated in a completely separate contract, give us

 3   the value of those arms.          It seems to me the --

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, why would

 5   Cubic enter into a contract with Iran to give them money

 6   if it wasn't taking the place of the money they owed

 7   them in the original agreement?

 8               MR. PHILLIPS:           Well, the question was, they

 9   were going to try to go forward in these arrangements.

10   And it was a, you know, complicated problem because you

11   couldn't tell whether or not you would ever be able to

12   send things back to Iran, et cetera.                     And so, they were

13   perfectly happy to enter into an agreement where they

14   would say, look, we will just do the best we can and see

15   how it turns out.

16               I mean, in reality, the litigation in front

17   of the Ninth Circuit, obviously, on the Cubic judgment,

18   Cubic is screaming loud and clear that they don't think

19   they owe a nickel as a consequence of this arrangement

20   that there had been no breach of anything under any

21   circumstances, and that there is not a penny that's to

22   be owed.   And as counsel said earlier, it's in some ways

23   unfortunate that this has moved in this sequence.                     So,

24   we don't really have --

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Do you know why it

 1   was pending for ten years?

 2                 MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, it was stayed as a

 3   consequence of this other litigation -- as a consequence

 4   of these proceedings in order to allow, I think in

 5   general the Iran claims tribunal to -- to sort out, at

 6   least, some portion of these issues.                      It would obvious

 7   be -- I mean, we have moved -- I mean, we are not a

 8   party.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So the stayed

10   because it was at issue before the Iranian claims

11   tribunal?

12                 MR. PHILLIPS:          Right.        I mean, the truth is

13   just as the issue was a more important issue for the

14   United States prior to the new blocking order, you know,

15   the questions that could potentially have arisen were

16   potentially more important to the claims tribunal at the

17   outset.     As the litigation has played out, it turns out

18   that there's no relationship between the two.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, the -- the other

20   thing -- and I think this counts against you, but maybe

21   you have an answer to it, that there could be a lot of

22   property that was directly at issue in '79 or '80 that

23   Iran didn't get.     And because they didn't get it, all

24   kinds of things happened with property, and you get more

25   of it or you get less of it.              And during the interim


                                         46

 1   years all kinds of things happened.

 2                 And it could be that those transformations

 3   at different times are directly before the tribunal,

 4   irrespective to how much damages you are going to get,

 5   and how much -- we can easily think of cases if we have

 6   three or four hours.        But you see where I am going?

 7                 MR. PHILLIPS:          Sure.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Now, I can understand

 9   Congress in passing this statute having one of two

10   possible things:     One is say we are just going to cut an

11   arbitrary line here because it's a compromise, and what

12   we will do is, you can go ahead, victim, and seize

13   anything you want, as long as it doesn't narrowly fit

14   within this.    That's a somewhat arbitrary line but a

15   compromise.

16                 MR. PHILLIPS:          But it also provides

17   protection for victims, right, and those are the people

18   who are the most --

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:            The other way to look at it

20   is to say, well, what we that had in mind here is we

21   will pay these victims something; you know, they are

22   going to get something right from Congress right now,

23   because they are hurt.         But in return from that, we

24   don't want you taking action that will really affect our

25   liability to Iran.      And if it's the second, then we

 1   needed broader definition; if it's the first, we don't.

 2               MR. PHILLIPS:           Justice Breyer, I think the

 3   Hague cases are the place to look in terms of trying to

 4   understand this, because what it's what -- Hague, that

 5   line of cases all involve efforts to seize consular

 6   properties of Iran and all arose prior to the Accords,

 7   and every one of those courts of appeals has concluded

 8   that each of those properties is beyond the ability of

 9   the courts to attach all of those properties.

10               And -- and it seems to me that what Congress

11   was concerned about was having inconsistent claims

12   potentially arise in both the district -- in federal

13   court in the United States and in front of the claims

14   tribunal.

15               So where you have a situation where the

16   claims tribunal says, look, that's a consular property

17   that belongs to the Iranian government, you should

18   return it, and have the United States have to show up in

19   front of that tribunal and say, oh, excuse me, but

20   unfortunately, we have been forced to sell that property

21   under a federal court order and the embarrassment that

22   arises from that.    That seems to me so clearly what

23   Congress had in mind, or at least is clearly covered by

24   this and the case law or all the case law up to this

25   point that has dealt with it has consistently ruled in

 1   favor of the United States and Iran in that context.

 2   But there is no reason to go beyond that context in

 3   order to deprive the clear victims of terrorism of a

 4   meaningful remedy.

 5              And I think, Justice Breyer, just to be

 6   clear about this, we got money back, to be sure.                   A

 7   substantial portion of the money we got back came from

 8   the values of the properties that the United States

 9   seized from Iran that they've used, they have leased out

10   embassies and stuff like that.                And that is not property

11   that comes out of the United States' fist.

12              So it's not reasonable to assume, as the

13   government does, that simply because these moneys were

14   paid out, that there is some huge relinquishment that is

15   required there.   It seems to me that it makes much more

16   sense for this Court to narrowly construe this.

17              I guess the last thing I would say in that

18   regard is, that insofar as we can tell, this case will

19   affect one party -- actually, I guess the other two

20   lienholders behind us.         But realistically, there are no

21   cases in the pipeline.         There is no other litigation

22   that is on going out there.              This is a singular -- I

23   mean, it's kind of unusual for this Court, but this is

24   the only case that we can figure that this applies to.

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, but the point

 1   is, depending on how it comes out, once you give a

 2   argument to the Iranians that they can raise with the

 3   claims tribunal that will affect far more than your one

 4   single case.     We -- the argument would be the United

 5   States is not living up to the obligations it undertook

 6   in the Algiers Accords.

 7               MR. PHILLIPS:            Right.        And,

 8   Mr. Chief Justice, that -- I understand why the

 9   government filed in support of Certiorari at the earlier

10   stages of this proceeding.            But after the intervening

11   blocking order that takes the -- I mean, that issue is

12   off the table.

13               We are no longer defending the Ninth

14   Circuit's view that the United States breached the

15   original Algiers Accords in the context of this case.

16   Nothing in the blocking order that is in place now and

17   would prevent Iran from getting this remotely violates

18   the Algiers Accords.        And as far as I know, no one is

19   making that argument at this stage.                       So all you have is

20   a relatively clean -- issues.               Does the blocking order

21   apply here in stopping the payment of these funds to

22   Iran?   There the answer seems to me unquestionably yes.

23               And then the second question is, do we adopt

24   a rule to the detriment to a single terrorist victim in

25   a way that deprives him of an opportunity to get back

 1   fair redress in the absence of some clear indication

 2   from Congress that it intended that result where it

 3   would affect no one else and where Congress has said

 4   specifically in a rule of construction, put your thumb

 5   on the scale in favor of the victim of terrorism?

 6   That's what we are asking the Court to do in this case.

 7   It provides no problems to the United States in its

 8   claims tribunal litigation.            It's only an issue of

 9   money.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  What provision --

11   can you cite me the provision where the Congress said

12   put your thumb on the scale?

13              MR. PHILLIPS:           Yes.      It's 201(d)(4), the

14   Petitioner's brief at 11a.

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  11a.   And how does

16   that -- the title of the section says statutory

17   construction.   I just don't see what follows as

18   statutory construction.

19              MR. PHILLIPS:           Well, I think what you have

20   to do is give the language some credit.                   And our way --

21   what we think Congress intended there was to say, tip

22   the scale in favor of the victims of terrorism, which is

23   the underlying purpose of the statute.

24              I will confess, the language is not nearly

25   as clear as I would like it to be, but I will also

 1   recognize that the -- the Government of Iran's position

 2   renders that language as total dead letter --

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You don't see any --

 4               MR. PHILLIPS:          -- alternative it seems to me

 5   you ought to give it -- again, give the tie to the

 6   victims under this --

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You don't see any

 8   problem with Congress telling us how to conduct

 9   statutory construction?

10               MR. PHILLIPS:          No, I think Congress does --

11   is entitled to suggest, if it's -- if you have ambiguity

12   in our language, which way to come out as a matter of

13   policy.   No, I don't think that's -- no, I don't think

14   that's dictating -- that's certainly not dictating a

15   result in this particular case.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Phillips, one piece

17   of -- I don't -- you have agreed that the United States

18   could recoup from Iran the amount paid to the victims,

19   including Dariush Elahi, including the 2.3 million.                      How

20   would the United States go about recouping from Iran the

21   money it has paid to the victims of Iran's terrorism?

22               MR. PHILLIPS:          You mean in the situations

23   where the United States has subrogate -- right to

24   subrogation?

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Yes.          How would that

 1   work?     How would -- how would the United States --

 2                 MR. PHILLIPS:          Well, I think it would almost

 3   certainly work as a matter of diplomacy and not as a

 4   matter of adjudicated resolution.                  I think what they

 5   will say is, these are rights, these are amounts of

 6   money that we have had to pay.                And if we are ever to

 7   normalize relations with the Government of Iran, we are

 8   going to expect the Government of Iran to recognize

 9   those payments and to make some kind of retribution to

10   the United States under those circumstances.

11                 And again, all it does is it shifts the

12   burden of these injuries from the victims, who are in

13   the least best position to deal with them, and put them

14   in the United States, which is in a position of at least

15   some hope of being able to resolve them diplomatically

16   in a way that the United States can, in fact, be

17   recompensed.

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You said this is a one of

19   a kind case.    Are there no other victims who have

20   successfully sued Iran?

21                 MR. PHILLIPS:          There are, but the problem is

22   you have to back into the situation of property that is

23   at issue in the claims tribunal.                 The claims tribunal

24   was created in '81.       It's not a lot of that property

25   around.    We're talking 25 years later.                  So, they have

 1   pretty much played out their course.

 2                 There were the Hague noted cases, and the

 3   Elahi case.     The others are going to be resolved without

 4   regard to these provisions.              And so, the reality is what

 5   the Court says today will affect my client, but as far

 6   as I can tell no one else.            And certainly, the only

 7   interest the United States has at this stage in this

 8   litigation is its own financial interest.                   And it would

 9   seem to me, that's not a basis on which to interpret the

10   statute.

11                 If there are no further questions, I urge

12   the Court to affirm.

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, Mr.

14   Phillips.

15                 Mr. Bederman, you have two minutes left.

16         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. DAVID J. BEDERMAN

17                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

18                 MR. BEDERMAN:          If I can make just a few

19   points.     In response to Respondent counsel's assertion

20   that in the International Chamber of Commerce arbitral

21   award there's been so form of novation here, which makes

22   the connection between the ACMR and the Cubic judgment

23   somehow attenuated.       I think that's -- by the

24   tribunal's -- the panel's discussion, this is at the

25   joint appendix at page 47.


                                         54
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              The panel makes very clear that under the

 2   sales contract credit has to be given to Iran for its

 3   advance payment.    Here you have a breakout of the

 4   salvage value of the ACMR.           All that the panel was

 5   indicating was that Iran was not entitled to specific

 6   performance here, to make that ruling is not a finding

 7   of a novation in the sense which would respond to

 8   counsel using that phrase.           So, I don't see the

 9   attenuation here.

10              Speaking to the assertion that, again, the

11   enormous risk presented by this case of the broad

12   construction of the congressional intent, I think if you

13   look carefully at the language at the blue brief at 11a

14   of the statutory construction provision -- that was part

15   of the colloquy between the Chief Justice and

16   Respondent's counsel.       And if you read this, it

17   completely reserves, if not begs the question of whether

18   the Cubic judgment is, quote, an asset otherwise

19   available under the section for attachment.

20              So, I think it completely doesn't answer,

21   one way or the other -- a finger on the scale, as

22   Respondent's counsel has evocably said, or some form of

23   command by Congress to this Court.                  It simply reserves

24   that question for the Court's analysis.

25              In response to Justice Ginsburg's last


                                        55
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   question to Respondent's counsel, the one thing I would

 2   point out to you again, is another clue in the statute.

 3   If we look at the Victims Protection Act, which was the

 4   predecessor statute here, section 2002(c), what Congress

 5   wanted to protect is the right of the United States to,

 6   quote, pursue these subrogated rights as claims or

 7   offsets of the United States in appropriate ways.

 8              So, again, Congress has contemplated the

 9   notion that there will be a process of setoffs either

10   before the Iran U.S. claims tribunal or in some other

11   context, which I'm not sure I can imagine beyond what

12   response counsel has said.         So, to suggest that the

13   broad remedial thrust of TRIA, which Petitioner is not

14   denying -- it's not our place to deny that -- is

15   nonetheless tempered by these carefully crafted

16   provisions in the statute.

17              We would support, obviously, reversal of the

18   lower court's opinion.

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

20   The case is submitted.

21              (Whereupon, at 12:09 p.m., the case in the

22   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
