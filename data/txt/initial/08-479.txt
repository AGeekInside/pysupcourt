 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   We will hear

 4   argument first this morning in Case 08-479, Safford

 5   Unifed School District v. Redding.

 6              Mr. Wright.

 7             ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W. WRIGHT

 8                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9              MR. WRIGHT:          Mr. Chief Justice, may it

10   please the Court:

11              The search of Savana Redding in this case

12   was constitutional because Mr. Wilson had reason to

13   suspect that she possessed contraband which posed a

14   health and safety risk.         Therefore, searching any place

15   where she might be reasonably hiding that contraband was

16   constitutionally permissible.

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Any place, even

18   though he had perhaps no reasonable suspicion to suspect

19   that she was hiding the contraband in her underwear?

20              MR. WRIGHT:          Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice,

21   as long as he had reason to suspect, which we believe

22   the evidence does show, he was entitled to search any

23   place where the contraband might be reasonably hidden.

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Any place?   I mean,

25   prison inmates, for example, are subject to much more

 1   intrusive searches.     Are you suggesting that would have

 2   been justified in this case?

 3              MR. WRIGHT:         No, Your Honor.           I'm -- I'm

 4   suggesting that where it might be reasonably hidden is

 5   based on an administrator's experience and certainly is

 6   proven out by the reported cases that we've cite in the

 7   reply on pages 8 and 9, which are that students often

 8   will secrete items in and under their clothing.                 That is

 9   not an uncommon thing to happen, although these kind of

10   intrusive searches are rare.

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:             But I -- I think you're

12   really caught in -- in a dilemma here.                 Your answer

13   suggests that you would not have allowed a cavity search

14   in this case.

15              MR. WRIGHT:         That's correct, Your Honor.

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:             But people have been known

17   to secrete contraband in -- in bodily cavities.                 What is

18   the -- what is the principle under which you would allow

19   a strip search but disallow a cavity search?

20              MR. WRIGHT:         The principle is, Your Honor,

21   is that the common experience with schoolchildren, as --

22   as school officials have a relation to schoolchildren,

23   is such that they might hide things, and they do hide

24   things, in and under their clothing.

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Was there --

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              MR. WRIGHT:          But --

 2              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Was there prior

 3   experience in this particular school?                    Were there prior

 4   occasions on which students had been strip-searched and

 5   contraband found?

 6              MR. WRIGHT:          Your Honor, I don't know, and

 7   that's not in the record, but I can tell that you that

 8   that would not be the threshold requirement under this

 9   Court's prior rulings to justify the search.

10              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But you -- I thought your

11   answer to Justice Scalia was that in the -- in the

12   school's experience, children do hide contraband in

13   their underwear but not in their body cavities.

14              MR. WRIGHT:          Yes, Your Honor.            To be more

15   specific, in the nationwide school experience, based on

16   the reported cases that we see, which are contained in

17   the reply at pages 8 and 9, we find that they hide them

18   in and under clothing, but I don't know of any case of

19   which I'm aware where there would be items secreted in

20   body cavities.

21              And I -- and I feel, Your Honor, that that

22   is a bright-line area because that -- that is -- that is

23   something that the Court can clearly say is off limits.

24   And --

25              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Let me ask you about


                                         5

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   another bright-line rule that I think you're assuming.

 2   You -- you said in the course of describing the

 3   justification for this search that one -- one of the

 4   points of justification was that there was a health and

 5   safety risk.     And I assume from the way you put it that

 6   you are grouping every drug, prescription or over the

 7   counter, as posing a health and safety risk; is that

 8   correct?

 9              MR. WRIGHT:           Yes, Your Honor.

10              JUSTICE SOUTER:                Why -- why should we accept

11   that -- that blanket assumption?                 I mean, at some point

12   it gets silly.    Having -- having an aspirin tablet does

13   not present a health and safety risk, and yet that's an

14   over-the-counter drug, and presumably you would have

15   gone through the same search for -- for an aspirin that

16   was conducted here.

17              MR. WRIGHT:           For the very same reasons this

18   Court noted in T.L.O. 25 years ago, Your Honor, and that

19   is that the school officials have deemed, in their

20   judgment, that this is an important rule with regard to

21   health and safety.      So --

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:                Oh, and I agree with you,

23   and I -- I don't have any question with this kind of a,

24   let's say, a -- a broad swath of judicial hands-off in

25   determining what is a risk and what isn't.                 But at some


                                          6

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   point it becomes sufficiently questionable that I do

 2   think we have to raise it.         And if your rule would

 3   criminalize -- I shouldn't say "criminalize" -- would

 4   put aspirin in the contraband category and justify the

 5   kind of search that went on here, I think we've reached

 6   the questionable point.        And I -- my question to you now

 7   is, why haven't we?

 8              MR. WRIGHT:         Well, Your Honor, if -- if an

 9   administrator in their judgment, in their reasonable

10   judgment, believes that any -- any drug poses a

11   potential health and safety risk, because they have the

12   custodial and tutelary responsibilities for those kids

13   -- and it's not like a criminal issue where they're

14   trying to prosecute; this is a case where they're trying

15   to protect -- because they have those kinds of

16   obligations to provide for the safety of children, to

17   provide an orderly educational environment, it is best

18   for this Court to defer to their judgment when they

19   believe that certain rules are important and not

20   second-guess those rules.

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Had it been --

22              MR. WRIGHT:         So long --

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Had it been the case that,

24   as I recall, someone had -- well, students were popping

25   ibuprofen, weren't they?

 1                MR. WRIGHT:       Yes, Your Honor.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I guess they might pop

 3   aspirin as well.   I'm not aware that one gets a high on

 4   either one of those.      Somebody in -- in the school had

 5   gotten almost fatally ill about a year before this

 6   incident; isn't that right?

 7                MR. WRIGHT:       Precisely, Your Honor.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:           On over-the-counter drugs.

 9                MR. WRIGHT:       On a prescription medication

10   that --

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:           A prescription, not over-

12   the-counter.

13                MR. WRIGHT:       -- that a student brought to

14   school and that a student ingested, another student

15   ingested, and then was airlifted out in an ICU in a

16   near-fatal experience.

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What was --

18                MR. WRIGHT:       But just 7 days --

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What was -- what was the

20   drug involved in that case?

21                MR. WRIGHT:       I don't know, Your Honor, and

22   it's not in the record.

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But it certainly was not

24   ibuprofen?

25                MR. WRIGHT:       Again, I don't know, Your

 1   Honor.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You said it was a

 3   prescription drug.

 4                 MR. WRIGHT:        It was a prescription drug.

 5   And -- and 7 days before this event, Your Honor, just 7

 6   days before, the student informant Romero had taken a

 7   prescription drug.      Again, I don't know what the type of

 8   drug was, but he became violently ill, which caused he

 9   and his mother to come talk to the administrator.                 So we

10   had those two recent events.

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Yes, but he -- he was not

12   the one who identified Redding.                It was her classmate.

13                 MR. WRIGHT:        Her friend Marissa Glines, yes,

14   Your Honor.

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And on that classmate's

16   say-so -- was the classmate ever asked, well, when did

17   you get this pill?      Where did she give it to you?

18                 MR. WRIGHT:        Where -- the question, where

19   did this pill come from, was asked by the administrator.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I mean, what place.    I

21   mean, the child is caught with the pills.                 She blames it

22   on her classmate.     She says:           She gave them to me.     Did

23   the school ever bother to ask when in time she gave

24   them, where in location she gave them?

25                 MR. WRIGHT:        No, but that's clear from the


                                          9

 1   record, Your Honor.     The reason for that is Jordan

 2   Romero said to Mr. Wilson that morning:                 I just received

 3   this pill from Marissa Glines.              The plan is that a group

 4   of these kids are going to take these pills at noon.                   So

 5   it's contemporaneous.

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But it's contemporaneous

 7   with the -- with the student who blamed the other child.

 8   I'm asking if there's any link other than one child

 9   caught with the pills blurts out that it was someone

10   else?   The tip from the young man had nothing to do with

11   Redding; it had to do with Glines.

12               MR. WRIGHT:        But the tip from the young man

13   goes to Glines, and the young man's tip becomes reliable

14   when Glines produces the fistful of pills that he said

15   she would have, plus other pills.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Maybe it becomes reliable

17   as to her, but it has nothing to do with Redding.

18               MR. WRIGHT:        But, Your Honor, then it ties

19   in with the -- with the contraband -- excuse me -- the

20   planner that was laid open before Mr. Wilson when he

21   subsequently searches Savana Redding, and she admits to

22   him that that was her planner, but she denies any

23   knowledge of the contents.          So did Marissa Glines.        So

24   --

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Did the school know what --

 1   what particular pills it was searching for?

 2                 MR. WRIGHT:       Not --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Did it know that -- what --

 4   what the threat was was ibuprofen or aspirin or -- or

 5   some prescription drug?

 6                 MR. WRIGHT:       Not comprehensively, Your

 7   Honor.   What they knew was there was IBU 400s in an OTC

 8   pill that was later identified.               But he also knew there

 9   was a variety of pills.         What Mr. Wilson did not know --

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           How did he know it was an

11   OTC pill?

12                 MR. WRIGHT:       Because he --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Just by looking at it?

14                 MR. WRIGHT:       -- called poison control.

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Okay.

16                 MR. WRIGHT:       And -- and once that was

17   assessed --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           What was in it?    Did he say

19   --

20                 MR. WRIGHT:       It was Naprosyn 200 milligrams.

21                 And -- and, Your Honor, what -- that's a

22   good point because what Mr. Wilson doesn't know is what

23   other pills might be out there.               He knows there's a

24   variety of pills, but he doesn't know of what type.                He

25   doesn't know what amount.

 1                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Have you ever made -- has

 2   your side of the case ever made the argument that it

 3   needs this sort of blanket classification rule, any drug

 4   over the counter or prescription, because when a, a pill

 5   is found, they're not pharmacists, they don't know what

 6   it is, and therefore they've got to have a blanket rule

 7   or they simply cannot act effectively?                       I did not see

 8   that argument in the briefs.              Has that argument been

 9   raised at any point?

10                 MR. WRIGHT:        Precisely, Your Honor.               We have

11   argued that our administrators are not pharmacologically

12   trained?

13                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Where did you argue it?             I

14   mean, I want to know whether that argument is in the

15   case.

16                 MR. WRIGHT:        It's in the briefs.

17                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Is it?           I don't remember

18   it.     Do you remember a page?           Do you have a page

19   reference offhand?

20                 MR. WRIGHT:        I don't have one offhand, Your

21   Honor.

22                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            But you say it's in your

23   brief?

24                 MR. WRIGHT:        I'm fairly -- fairly certain

25   it's in the brief.

 1                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Okay, I'll go back.

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              In the case, this case,

 3   the school nurse -- the pills were given to the school

 4   nurse and she identified what they were.

 5                MR. WRIGHT:         Precisely.               And she called

 6   poison control to figure that out, though, Your Honor.

 7                JUSTICE ALITO:           Mr. Mr. Wright, could I ask

 8   you this question.      There may be an issue as to what the

 9   assistant principal could reasonably infer from the

10   facts that were known by him, whether he could

11   reasonably infer facts that would create a reasonable

12   suspicion that there were drugs hidden in the

13   plaintiff's undergarments.            Is that a question for --

14   for the finder of fact in a case like this, so that it

15   can't be -- there can't be summary judgment for either

16   side unless no reasonable factfinder could find to the

17   contrary?

18                MR. WRIGHT:         The problem with that is, Your

19   Honor, it wouldn't comport with the notion that we need

20   to shield administrators from lawsuits and legal

21   liability.

22                JUSTICE ALITO:           No, not on the question of

23   qualified immunity.       On the issue of whether there is a

24   Fourth Amendment violation.

25                MR. WRIGHT:         Whether or not that would be a

 1   factual determination, as to whether he could reasonably

 2   suspect that the pills would be there?

 3              JUSTICE ALITO:           Right.

 4              MR. WRIGHT:         I think -- I think it could

 5   lend itself to that, Your Honor, but I would prefer that

 6   the Court -- we would ask the Court and it's our

 7   position that the Court would lay down a bright line

 8   rule such that it wouldn't end up in a factual dispute,

 9   and that bright line rule is this.                 Once you had reason

10   to suspect a student is possessing any contraband that

11   poses a health and safety risk, then searching any place

12   where that contraband may reasonably be found is

13   constitutional, and --

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Any contraband, like the

15   black marker pencil that -- that astounded me.                That was

16   contraband in that school, wasn't it, a black marker

17   pencil?

18              MR. WRIGHT:         Well, for sniffing.

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Oh, is that what they do?

20              MR. WRIGHT:         It's a permanent marker.

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:             They sniff them?

22              MR. WRIGHT:         Well, that's the -- I mean, I'm

23   a school lawyer.   That's what kids do, Your Honor,

24   unfortunately, Your Honor.          But --

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Really?

 1              MR. WRIGHT:         But the point was is that the

 2   rule -- the rule, Your Honor, is -- is grounded in the

 3   notion that when there's a health and safety risk

 4   because these people are charged and tasked with the

 5   responsibility to keep these kids safe, they have to

 6   have the opportunity to act flexibly, immediately, and

 7   effectively when they're dealing with these risks.

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But there has to be -- I

 9   mean, some -- the stark difference between this case and

10   T.L.O., in addition to the intrusiveness of the search,

11   was there was a teacher said:             I caught those girls;

12   they were smoking in the bathroom.                 Here we have nothing

13   but this Glines identifying her classmate.                And nothing

14   is done to check her veracity, nothing is done to follow

15   up on it at all.   And the search is quite different from

16   the search of a purse that doesn't touch the child's

17   person.

18              MR. WRIGHT:         Your Honor seems to be

19   concerned about the reliability of the tip in this case.

20   Your Honor, I would submit to you to that student tips

21   are the very thing that officials rely on probably the

22   most.

23              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But an official could

24   follow up to see whether this child -- whether there is

25   a basis for what she said.          But there were no questions

 1   asked at all.

 2                 MR. WRIGHT:       There was additional

 3   corroborating evidence, Your Honor.                      There was -- there

 4   was suspicion by direct implication and there was

 5   suspicion by circumstantial corroboration.                      These two

 6   kids could, in Mr. Wilson's mind -- he believed that

 7   they were working together to conceal other types of

 8   contraband.

 9                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, the school could keep

10   records on its students, like the police keep records on

11   confidential informants.          So if -- unless this student

12   had a proven record of having accurately ratted out a

13   certain number of classmates in the past, she couldn't

14   be believed.

15                 MR. WRIGHT:       Except that, Your Honor,

16   there's a different incentive here.                      Students can be

17   disciplined if they -- if they tell tales.                      And so if

18   she tells a lie she faces the risk of discipline.                      In

19   addition to that, there was evidence that these kids

20   were friends, and he had reason to rely on that.                      He had

21   reason based on their association at the opening dance.

22   He had reason to believe that because --

23                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           What discipline did the

24   tipster receive?    What discipline was the erroneous

25   tipster given?

 1                 MR. WRIGHT:        Oh, there was no discipline

 2   that I know of in the record, Your Honor.                  It's not in

 3   the record and I do not know.

 4                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Was she subject to a civil

 5   suit by the plaintiff in this case?

 6                 MR. WRIGHT:        Was the person Marissa Glines,

 7   the person who gave the tip?

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Yes.

 9                 MR. WRIGHT:        No, Your Honor.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Could I come back to your

11   distinguishing a strip search from a cavity search.

12   What would you require before you would allow a cavity

13   search?

14                 MR. WRIGHT:        Nothing at all.          A bright line

15   rule.     I would not allow it.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            No cavity search in school,

17   no matter what?

18                 MR. WRIGHT:        We're not even clinically

19   trained to do that, Your Honor.                I would submit that if

20   a child has something stuffed up one of their cavities

21   -- and I assume we mean private parts, the very private

22   parts -- that the first thing to do would be to send

23   them to the hospital.        I mean, we just don't have that

24   clinical training.

25                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Your basis -- your basis

 1   for saying that, I guess, is just sort of the practical

 2   one, we don't know how to do that type of thing.                So far

 3   as the legal principle on the basis of which you

 4   justified this search, you could justify that search,

 5   too, couldn't you?

 6              MR. WRIGHT:           On the legal basis I could see

 7   that, Your Honor.     I could see that result.            But

 8   practically --

 9              JUSTICE SOUTER:               But if -- if we hold in

10   your favor in this case and the next school district

11   says, all right, we're going to have classes in body

12   cavity searches, then there would be no legal basis, if

13   we accept your principle, for saying that's out of

14   bounds as a matter of the Fourth Amendment; isn't that

15   correct?

16              MR. WRIGHT:           I see your concern.      That's to

17   be left up to the local governments, Your Honor.                As you

18   have mentioned, this Court has mentioned, in Ingraham

19   and Wright --

20              JUSTICE SOUTER:               So it would not -- it would

21   not be out of bounds under the Fourth Amendment?

22              MR. WRIGHT:           Technically, but it will be

23   controlled by the community.              It would be controlled by

24   the local board.    The community would never --

 1   in the Ninth Circuit in border search cases a body

 2   cavity search can be conducted without a warrant?                  I

 3   thought a warrant was required under the Ninth Circuit

 4   rule.   I could ask the government.

 5                 MR. WRIGHT:       I just know that there has been

 6   concern expressed over body cavity searches, even in the

 7   prisoner environment and even in the border environment.

 8   I can say to this Court you will not restrict or in any

 9   way inhibit the discretion of an administrator by saying

10   you can't go there on a body cavity search, nor would

11   they want to, nor are they clinically trained to.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Can I ask just a

13   follow-up on your answer to Justice Kennedy's earlier

14   question about whether the informant was subject to

15   civil suit.    When you said no, did you mean she hadn't

16   been sued or that she could not be sued?

17                 MR. WRIGHT:       I'm sorry, Your Honor.           That

18   she had not been sued.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Okay.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            There's one aspect of

21   this considering the reasonableness of the school

22   administrator's behavior.           In addition to not following

23   up with Glines, after Redding was searched and nothing

24   was found, she was put in a chair outside the vice

25   principal's office for over 2 hours and her mother

 1   wasn't called.    What was the reason for that

 2   humiliating, putting her in that humiliating situation?

 3              MR. WRIGHT:          Your Honor, that is not a

 4   matter of the record, but the inference is that the --

 5   that the investigation was still ongoing because there

 6   was a group of kids, and at that time the administrator

 7   was making efforts to try to make sure that he had

 8   gathered all the drugs that might be on campus.                And in

 9   any event that wouldn't --

10              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But how were they

11   investigating her when they did nothing but put her in a

12   chair outside the vice principal's office?

13              MR. WRIGHT:          Well, Your Honor, I can see

14   where it might have been more reasonable in that sense

15   to have let her go back to class, but it certainly is

16   not a standard that would affect the constitutionality .

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:              I assume a school can

18   assign a student to study hall.               That's not considered a

19   government seizure.      Isn't that an obvious part of the

20   parental supervision that a school exercises, sit here

21   and stay there.

22              MR. WRIGHT:          That's exactly right, Your

23   Honor.

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Schools do that all the

25   time, don't they?

 1               MR. WRIGHT:         Yes.       In fact, there was a

 2   Ninth Circuit on the docket at the time, the Smith

 3   versus McLaughlin case, where the plaintiff argued the

 4   very thing, that she was detained for hours.                  And the

 5   court recognized there -- I believe there was a

 6   concurrence by Judge Kozinski -- that that's entirely

 7   appropriate, that's where they are.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  When was the -- when

 9   was she detained there in relation to the lunchtime

10   period, which was when the other student had said that

11   all the kids were going to take these pills?

12               MR. WRIGHT:         I believe it went through the

13   lunchtime period, Your Honor, the detainment.

14               In addition, Your Honor, I would like to

15   point out also that trying to restrict any more the rule

16   that I've laid out, as the United States Government has

17   suggested, respectfully, would cause more problems.

18               JUSTICE BREYER:             But aren't there things

19   here that are a little extreme?               I mean, if she's to be

20   believed, then she was really naked, and the two

21   administrators deny that, but you have to take her side

22   of the facts.    So taking her side of the facts, why

23   couldn't the school administrators just do what they

24   said they did?    That is, you leave her in her underwear,

25   tell her:   Go shake her underwear.                 No reason to do any

 1   more than that.     Or if she is really embarrassed about

 2   that, say:     Go put on a swimming suit, you know.               Shake

 3   the swimming suit, no problem.                People see you at the

 4   beach all the time.       Or call your mother.

 5                I mean, you know, we can think of another --

 6   a number of things that seem a lot less restrictive than

 7   her version of what went on here.

 8                MR. WRIGHT:         May I offer two principles?

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:             Yes.

10                MR. WRIGHT:         First, this Court has

11   recognized that the least intrusive means is not a

12   threshold prerequisite to a constitutional --

13                JUSTICE BREYER:             I know, but I mean, here

14   she is embarrassed if -- if what she says happened

15   happened.    There seems no reason for that, and it seems

16   so easy.    Put on your gym clothes, okay?                I mean, she

17   does that every day.        It is just such obvious

18   alternatives to having her be really naked.

19                MR. WRIGHT:         Very true.

20                JUSTICE BREYER:

21                So that's what I -- I don't see any basis

22   for saying to the school administrator, you know, you

23   can do that.    You can just turn her naked.                I mean, it

24   just embarrasses her.        What's the need for it?

25                MR. WRIGHT:         In the record, Your Honor, she

 1   did -- she did have her underpants on and her brassiere

 2   still on.

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:            I know, but she says in the

 4   record that they went further and required her to be

 5   partly naked beyond just her underwear.                     They say --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, I suppose you could

 7   say that about any strip search, couldn't you:                     That

 8   there is never a need for a strip search?                     You could

 9   always give the -- you know, the suspected felon, you

10   know:   Here, change into this suit.                    And -- and we

11   haven't adopted some such rule, have we?

12               MR. WRIGHT:        No, Your Honor.               You have

13   specifically said the fact that other reasonable

14   alternatives are available doesn't mean that the

15   alternative that was used or the actual search that was

16   done was unreasonable.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay.       So that was my

18   question.   My question was:           Why wasn't it?           I wasn't

19   asking about the law.      I was asking:                 Why didn't they

20   choose one of these alternatives?

21               MR. WRIGHT:        I'm sorry, Your Honor.               I don't

22   -- I can't answer that question for Mr. Wilson, but I'm

23   sure that in the heat of the moment that that issue

24   wasn't thought through.        And, of course, he wasn't

25   involved in the search because he's a male.                     Only the

 3   Honor.

 7                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID O'NEIL

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 9              AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING REVERSAL

10              MR. O'NEIL:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

11   and may it please the Court:

12              Intrusive body searches in the school

13   context implicate fundamentally different expectations

14   of privacy than other -- other kinds of searches.                  For

15   that reason, they require greater justification under

16   the Fourth Amendment.

17              In the government's view, the best way to

18   give effect to that greater showing is to adhere to the

19   basic reasonable suspicion standard of T.L.O., but to

20   elaborate on that standard in two ways.                First --

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Before you get

22   started, do we have to reach the underlying merits or

23   can we just decide the qualified immunity issue?

24              MR. O'NEIL:        The government agrees with the

25   parties and all amici in this case that this Court


                                      24

 1   should address the substantive Fourth Amendment issue.

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Should -- should,

 3   but must?

 4               MR. O'NEIL:       This Court could decide the

 5   case on qualified immunity grounds alone.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, one of the defendants

 7   doesn't have qualified immunity.

 8               MR. O'NEIL:       That's exactly right, Justice

 9   Scalia.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:           So don't we have to, for

11   that defendant at least, decide the constitutional

12   question?

13               MR. O'NEIL:       Well, this Court could remand

14   on Monell grounds for a hearing on that, which was not

15   addressed in --

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What would be, Mr.

17   O'Neil, the basis for the Monell claim?                    That would be

18   against the school district?

19               MR. O'NEIL:       That's correct.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What would the plaintiff

21   have to show to establish a claim under Monell?

22               MR. O'NEIL:       The plaintiff would have to

23   show that this search was conducted pursuant to a -- an

24   official policy or that the vice principal was a person

25   who was acting with that authority.                    There are a number


                                      25

 1   of grounds that -- that the plaintiff could establish

 2   the Monell claim on the basis of, but in this case the

 3   Ninth Circuit did not address that.                     And, therefore, we

 4   believe that this Court should not review in the first

 5   instance, but if the Court were inclined to remand on

 6   that ground to allow the Ninth Circuit to address it

 7   before this Court reaches that.

 8                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You -- you criticized the

 9   Ninth Circuit in your brief for having a sliding scale

10   standard, which is a bad thing in your view.                    But it

11   seems to me that your standard comes close to that.                      You

12   call yours a differential level standard or something

13   like that?

14                MR. O'NEIL:       No, Justice Kennedy.              Our

15   standard is one of greater specificity in the

16   information, not a standard that rises and falls

17   depending on the level of intrusiveness.

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:           You -- you have to, under

19   your standard, have reason -- a reasonable suspicion

20   specifically that -- that the student is hiding the

21   contraband in the student's underwear?

22                MR. O'NEIL:       That's correct, Justice Scalia.

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Now, if -- if you have a

24   reasonable suspicion that the student has drugs and you

25   search every other place, you search in the student's

 1   pack, you search the student's outer garments, and you

 2   have a reasonable suspicion that the student has drugs,

 3   don't you have, after conducting all these other

 4   searches, a reasonable suspicion that she has drugs in

 5   her underpants?

 6                 MR. O'NEIL:       No, Justice Scalia, we believe

 7   that you don't --

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           All right.

 9                 MR. O'NEIL:       -- without -- without --

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Your logic fails me.

11                 MR. O'NEIL:       Well, Justice --

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           You -- you reasonably

13   suspect the student has drugs.               You've searched

14   everywhere else.    By God, the drugs must be in her

15   underpants.

16                 MR. O'NEIL:       Well, Justice Scalia, you

17   posited that the teacher began the search with

18   reasonable suspicion.       And in that case, if you searched

19   the obvious places like a wallet, a pocket, a desk, a

20   locker, and you didn't find it in those places, the

21   logical conclusion would not be that it must be in the

22   student's underwear, but perhaps that the information

23   that you had --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That sounds like you

25   --

 2   underwear.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That sounds to me

 4   like the sliding scale that you reject from the Ninth

 5   Circuit.

 6                 MR. O'NEIL:       No, because we believe that

 7   where you have reasonable suspicion that there is

 8   contraband in the underwear, then you could go directly

 9   to that location, and you wouldn't have to work from the

10   outside in.    But, Justice Scalia, it takes --

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Oh, surely not.   You

12   are saying if you have reasonable suspicion that it's in

13   the underwear, you shouldn't even bother searching the

14   pack or the pockets.       You should go straight to the

15   underwear.    That can't be right.

16                 MR. O'NEIL:       Well, to take T.L.O. as an

17   example, Justice Scalia, in that case the Court believed

18   that there was reasonable suspicion that the student had

19   cigarettes in her purse because that was the obvious

20   place to find them.      Now, if the -- if the school

21   principal in that case had searched the purse, searched

22   the student's pocket, searched the locker, searched the

23   desk, I don't think this Court would have said that

24   there was reasonable suspicion to believe that the

25   cigarettes were in --

 1                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Now, what specifically do

 2   you think is missing here?            They need -- the school

 3   needed to have a direct statement from Marissa Glines

 4   that -- that Redding had the -- had the pills in her

 5   undergarments; is that correct.

 6                 MR. O'NEIL:        The particularized suspicion

 7   could come from information from students that reliably

 8   adverted to the location of the contraband.               That's the

 9   --

10                 JUSTICE ALITO:          But you have to have direct

11   evidence that the -- the -- it can't be based on

12   inferences?

13                 MR. O'NEIL:        No --

14                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Is that the distinction you

15   are drawing?     The location has to be supported by direct

16   evidence.     Somebody has to say that that's where it is.

17                 MR. O'NEIL:        No, Justice Alito.       We believe

18   that if teachers were aware of the general practice and

19   it was common knowledge that students did hide

20   contraband in this way and -- that would be relevant to

21   the totality of the circumstances in determining whether

22   this student was following that practice.

23                 But we don't believe that the examples that

24   were provided in Petitioners' reply brief establish

25   anything like that practice.              Petitioners cite 8 cases


                                         29

 1   over the course of approximately 30 years in which

 2   contraband was found in those locations.

 3              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But you are -- you are

 4   saying basically there is -- there is no general

 5   understanding that people carry ibuprofen in -- in their

 6   undergarments.

 7              MR. O'NEIL:        That is -- that is true.             There

 8   was no experience at this school.               There was no

 9   reasonable -- no reason to suspect that based on

10   experience in the world.        And, in fact, by the time the

11   officials had conducted their -- this search, they had

12   searched Marissa, who was Respondent's friend.                 And they

13   had conducted a search of her pockets and her wallet and

14   they had found pills in her pockets and her wallet.                 But

15   they had not found pills in her underwear.

16              So even if that had been a suspicion that

17   one might have had even before beginning the search,

18   they certainly wouldn't have had that suspicion by the

19   time --

20              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But if your --

21   accepting your argument that there may be no reasonable

22   suspicion based on Marissa saying this is the person who

23   gave me the drugs, does the fact that she said kids are

24   going to -- the kids are going to take these drugs at

25   lunchtime, a specific time, does that present a

 1   difference in the level of concern that the school

 2   should have?

 3               MR. O'NEIL:        We believe that the schools may

 4   take seriously any information they receive and must

 5   take seriously any information they receive about the

 6   presence of prescription pills on campus.               And the fact

 7   that the teacher believed that these pills were going to

 8   be consumed at lunch as part of an event that obviously

 9   wasn't simply intended to get rid of the students'

10   headaches, we believe that that would give rise to

11   reasonable suspicion to initiate some search.

12               But we believe that without some

13   particularized suspicion or some specific indication

14   that this, the location, was a likely one to contain the

15   drugs, that this search was excessively intrusive.               And

16   this is not a new standard.            This is essentially the

17   same standard this Court adopted in the Montoya De

18   Hernandez case for intrusive body searches in other

19   contexts.   It has proved workable in that context and we

20   believe that it would prove workable here.

21               We believe that it is also better than the

22   alternatives of a higher level of suspicion, which does

23   not bear any necessary logical correlation to the

24   likelihood that the --

 1   specifically that Savana Redding has pills someplace on

 2   her person and she's going to distribute them at lunch

 3   in the cafeteria, would this be a different case?

 4                 MR. O'NEIL:         It may well, Justice Alito.              In

 5   that circumstance it would likely be the reasonable

 6   thing for the teacher --

 7                 JUSTICE ALITO:           What is the difference

 8   between that situation and this situation?                    The

 9   differences are slight.           Wouldn't that at least be a

10   question that has to be decided by the trier of fact?

11                 MR. O'NEIL:         That may present a triable

12   issue.    Here --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Excuse me.       That

14   wouldn't -- that wouldn't satisfy the test you've just

15   given us.     I thought you said there had to be specific

16   indication that she was carrying it in her

17   undergarments.      And what Justice Alito posed was not

18   that, just specific indication that she had it on her

19   person.     Is that enough?         Do you want to revise your

20   test so it's not just specific indication that it's in

21   her undergarments, but specific indication that it's on

22   her person?     That's enough?

23                 MR. O'NEIL:         No, Justice Scalia.             We believe

24   that there must be information beyond that.                    And I may

25   have misspoke, and I think the answer to that question

 1   is that in that circumstance, a teacher would almost

 2   certainly ask, well, where on her person is it?            And if

 3   the student doesn't know, then, yes, Justice Scalia,

 4   that would not satisfy the standard that we would urge

 5   this Court to adopt.

 6              JUSTICE ALITO:            I mean, the student says,

 7   she has -- she has crack someplace on her person, and

 8   she's going to distribute it to kids during the lunch

 9   hour, and so they search her -- her garments, and they

10   don't find it.   And you're saying that they cannot then

11   go ahead and search her undergarments --

12              MR. O'NEIL:         The nature of the contraband --

13              JUSTICE ALITO:            -- because --

14              MR. O'NEIL:         The nature of the contraband

15   could be relevant in the totality of the circumstances

16   to the suspicion that the student has -- is hiding it in

17   some illicit place as -- Justice Souter, as you noted,

18   certainly there is no practice anywhere, that I'm aware

19   of, of hiding ibuprofen in underwear.

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:             So there is a sliding scale

21   for the dangerousness of what you're looking for?

22              MR. O'NEIL:         No.      It simply means that it's

23   relevant to whether in the totality of the circumstances

24   that school official could have reasonably suspected

25   that the student was hiding it.

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                How is a school

 2   administrator supposed to know?               Marissa says:     She gave

 3   me these pills.    What are they?             I don't know.     And so

 4   how is the -- if it depends whether it's a dangerous

 5   drug like crack or a relatively -- not harmless, but a

 6   different one like ibuprofen, the search depends on

 7   that, how is the school administrator supposed to know?

 8                 MR. O'NEIL:       My point was simply with a drug

 9   like crack there is a more common understanding that a

10   drug like that can be hidden in a student's -- in

11   underwear.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So what is the

13   school administrator supposed to know when he sees a

14   white pill and doesn't know if it's something terribly

15   harmful, even deadly, or if it's prescription strength

16   ibuprofen?    You say in the former case he can search

17   undergarments, in the latter case he can't.                  So how is

18   the administrator supposed to know what he's dealing

19   with?

20                 MR. O'NEIL:       Well, we believe that, as I

21   said, school administrators have to take seriously all

22   medication like this on campus.               My point was simply

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I'm sorry, your

 2   answer to me was they have to take it seriously.                 My

 3   question to you is, what is the administrator supposed

 4   to do?   He sees a white pill; nobody can tell him what

 5   it is.   Is he allowed at that point to search the

 6   undergarments or not?

 7               MR. O'NEIL:        No.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 He's not?

 9               MR. O'NEIL:        He is not.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Even if it turns out

11   to be -- you know, I don't know, some very deadly drug?

12               MR. O'NEIL:        Mr. Chief Justice, we do not

13   believe that this Court should get in the business of

14   deciding that searches are okay for, for example,

15   heroin, but not okay for cocaine.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 That's what you just

17   told us we should do, in answer to Justice Alito's

18   question.

19               MR. O'NEIL:        No, I simply -- the point was

20   simply that if there is some common understanding that a

21   type of contraband is generally secreted in a certain

22   way, and the example is crack, and there is a known

23   understanding that crack can be hidden in that way, that

24   that would be relevant to the totality of the

25   circumstances.

 1                JUSTICE SOUTER:           And I don't see why your

 2   answer might not be different if, under the Chief

 3   Justice's question, he didn't know it was ibuprofen.

 4   All he knew was that it was a white pill.                 He's not a

 5   pharmacologist, he doesn't know what's in it.                  Wouldn't

 6   the reasonableness of the -- wouldn't the scope of

 7   reasonable search at least potentially be greater for

 8   the undifferentiated white pill than for the known

 9   ibuprofen?

10                MR. O'NEIL:       It may, Justice Souter, but I

11   think that the question would be whether the school

12   official has some reason to believe, based on a

13   practice, that -- that pills, for example, are hidden in

14   a student's -- can be hidden in a student's underwear.

15   Again, the example was crack, and that is a situation

16   where there is an understanding that that is -- can be a

17   place in which suspects will hide that type of item.

18                But, again, there was no indication in this

19   case whatsoever and no basis for the school official to

20   suspect that that was a likely location.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

22                MR. O'NEIL:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 1              MR. WOLF:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 2   please the Court:

 3              We agree with the Federal Government that

 4   before conducting an intrusive strip search a school

 5   needs to have location-specific information.                    And while

 6   this case can begin and end with that well-accepted

 7   proposition, it's also important to recognize that a

 8   school needs greater -- a greater degree of suspicion to

 9   conduct a strip search than to conduct an ordinary

10   backpack search.

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   I don't think the

12   case can begin and end with that because we have the

13   separate issue of qualified immunity.                    Can we take that

14   off the table?

15              I mean, we have got six to five in the Ninth

16   Circuit, disagreement throughout in this case, and yet

17   you say the rule is so clearly established that you can

18   make these school officials personally liable.

19              MR. WOLF:        Your Honor, I don't think a head

20   count of the judges is the standard by which this Court

21   measures qualified immunity.             That's what this Court,

22   you know, held, for instance, in Groh v. Ramirez.                    But I

23   do understand that it sort of gives one pause.

24              It says:        Well, what did they miss here?

25   And what they missed here is that this search violated

 1   the clearly established point that in order to conduct

 2   an intrusive search of one's body, the searching

 3   official needs to at least reasonably believe that the

 4   object is located underneath the undergarments.                    The

 5   Fourth Amendment does not account -- it does not

 6   countenance the rummaging on or around a 13-year-old

 7   girl's naked body --

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   What if --

 9                MR. WOLF:        -- without any suspicion.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   What if what Marissa

11   has is heroin?   The school administrator recognizes

12   heroin.   She says:      This is what the student gave me?

13   Search the undergarments or not?

14                MR. WOLF:        The nature of the infraction --

15   no.   The nature of the infraction, as T.L.O. would put

16   it, is a nonstarter in this case, because we don't even

17   have the suspicion to get underneath Savana's

18   undergarments, even if you had -- regardless of the

19   substance.

20                Now, in T.L.O., the question was whether

21   there were drugs to be found.                There was marijuana in

22   that case.   And this Court set a relatively low

23   standard, that you need more than a hunch, and you need

24   particularized suspicion.             Now, that's where the Court

25   set the balance for ordinary searches for drugs.

 1              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I'm not quite sure where

 2   we are in your answer to the question of the Chief

 3   Justice's question.     He asked you a hypothetical case.

 4   And you said that's a nonstarter because in this case.

 5   And the hypothetical is that there is a very

 6   dangerous drug, meth, that's going to be distributed and

 7   consumed that afternoon.

 8              Does that make a difference in the

 9   permissibility of the search and the reasonableness of

10   the search and the scope of the search?

11              MR. WOLF:       No, it does not.             It does not in

12   this case, because without a suspicion that you're going

13   to find the object --

14              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             So you don't mind our

15   judging this case as if they were searching for meth?

16              MR. WOLF:       Your Honor --

17              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             That's the way -- we

18   should -- we should judge this case as though they were

19   searching -- the fact that it was -- is it ibuprofen,

20   have I got that?   The fact that it was ibuprofen is

21   irrelevant; we can consider this case as if it were

22   meth?

23              MR. WOLF:       I think we all understand that

24   this -- that this case, you know, involves ibuprofen.

25   But our argument --

 1              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               I don't think I understand

 2   that based on your answer.            I'm -- I'm asking you -- you

 3   said that the nature of the drug makes no difference,

 4   It's a nonstarter.

 5              MR. WOLF:         Not in in this case, correct.

 6              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Insofar as the rule that

 7   we -- that's because in this case you don't think

 8   there's a reasonable suspicion to begin with.                 But that

 9   doesn't answer the hypothetical.                 We're trying to

10   announce a rule.   And your rule, your submission, as I

11   understand you and as I understood the government, is

12   that the nature of the substance they're searching for

13   is irrelevant.

14              MR. WOLF:         I think it's irrelevant when

15   you're making distinctions between drugs.                 If -- if the

16   question is whether you can strip search a child for

17   gum, for instance, because that might prohibit school

18   policy, I would --

19              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               So that goes back to my

20   earlier proposition that you don't mind our deciding the

21   case as if this were a search for meth that was going to

22   be consumed at noon?

23              MR. WOLF:         That's correct, Your Honor.

24              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Thank you.

25              MR. WOLF:         Why?        Because in this case there

 1   was no suspicion -- and I think Justice Alito was

 2   perhaps getting to this -- there was no suspicion that

 3   these objects were going to be found inside Savana's

 4   undergarments.   And without that suspicion you cannot

 5   conduct such an intrusive search.

 6              JUSTICE ALITO:             Well, to play the devil's

 7   advocate on that, why couldn't the assistant principal

 8   reason as follows:      that he has information from -- from

 9   Ms. Glines that Ms. Redding has drugs.                    He has

10   information from another student that drugs are going to

11   be consumed during the lunch hour.                   Putting those two

12   together, he reaches the -- he suspects that the person

13   who has the drugs has the drugs on his or her person so

14   that they can be distributed at lunch.                    And then having

15   searched every other part of -- having searched Ms.

16   Redding's outer garments, what's left are her

17   undergarments.   So therefore there's a reasonable

18   suspicion that the drugs are -- are located there.

19              MR. WOLF:         Justice Alito --

20              JUSTICE ALITO:             What's wrong with that?

21              MR. WOLF:         Justice Alito, I don't think that

22   accurately describes the record.                 Even if it did, it

23   wouldn't satisfy this Court's standard.                    Two things

24   about the record:     one, I think the hypothetical

25   supposed that she had drugs, and in fact what the record

 1   reveals is that it was allegedly Savana provided these

 2   drugs at some point.         It's not that she currently had

 3   them on her.

 4                 Second, that they searched every other part,

 5   and it's an important -- it's an important point in this

 6   case.     Where did Marissa have her planner?                   It was in

 7   the desk.     Did they search the desk here?                   No.   We know

 8   that.     It's not in the record, as Mr. Wright said, but

 9   they have lockers in the school.                  Did they search any

10   locker?    No.

11                 Can students keep drugs anywhere else on

12   school grounds?      Perhaps, probably so.                 Did they search

13   everywhere?      They absolutely did not.                  But I want to get

14   back to the legal answer, too, which is that this Court

15   said in T.L.O., and it's on page 342 of T.L.O., that a

16   search is reasonable only when there are reasonable

17   grounds for believing that it will turn up evidence.

18   There were no reasonable grounds for believing that this

19   search would turn up evidence, none at all.

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             You're saying the whole

21   search, not just the search of the undergarments.

22   You're saying they couldn't even have searched her

23   backpack, right?

24                 MR. WOLF:       I think they could have searched

25   her backpack.      And what --

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why?

 2                MR. WOLF:       What that speaks to is the low

 3   degree of the suspicion and the nonspecific suspicion

 4   that's needed to conduct an ordinary search.

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:             So you want a sliding

 6   scale?

 7                MR. WOLF:       It's not a sliding scale, Your

 8   Honor.   This is a two-step framework, and that is it.

 9   We have ordinary searches, backpacks, pencil cases, book

10   bags, that kind of thing; and then you have a search

11   where you require a 13-year-old girl to take off her --

12   take off her pants, take off her shirt, move around her

13   bra so she reveals her breasts, and the same thing with

14   her underpants to reveal her pelvic area.

15                JUSTICE BREYER:             I mean, I think there's a

16   dispute in the record about that.                  So -- so we have, I

17   mean you would have the right to prove your version,

18   obviously.   But suppose you fail to prove that and that

19   the jury or judge, or whoever is deciding this fact,

20   concludes the school board's right on that; all they did

21   was ask her to strip to her underwear, period.                  Nobody

22   saw anything else.

23                Now, what's your view of that one?                 I mean,

24   let's also imagine that this is sufficient to prove --

25   to -- what happened was Marissa opens a planner, and in

 1   the planner there's some small knives, a cigarette

 2   lighter, and a cigarette.             And who gave you the planner?

 3   Well, Savana gave it to me.               And they find some pills.

 4   Let's imagine those pills are cocaine or something like

 5   meth or something.       And she says well, where did you get

 6   those?     Savana gave them to me.

 7                 Okay.    That seems to be possibly reasonable

 8   suspicion to think Savana has some of these pills.                    And

 9   they're going to distribute them at lunchtime.                    At that

10   point they go look, whatever they did here.                   But then

11   they bring Savana in to the nurse and the nurse and the

12   female official say:         All right, Savana, strip to your

13   underclothes and shake your underclothes.                   That's what

14   happens, period.

15                 Now, is that latter part a violation of the

16   Fourth Amendment?

17                 MR. WOLF:       It is, Your Honor.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:             Because?

19                 MR. WOLF:       It is because that is an

20   intrusive, traumatic search.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:             All right.       But it would be

22   okay to say, change into a swimming suit or your gym

23   clothes?    Hey, your gym clothes are in the locker,

24   they're about the same size, shape; go do that.

25                 MR. WOLF:       It -- it might be different if

 1   they asked Savana to go into the other room and to

 2   change where you're not revealing your body to

 3   any government official.

 4              JUSTICE BREYER:             No, they didn't -- she

 5   didn't reveal her body beyond her underclothes.              She --

 6   that's the hypothetical that I'm trying to work out

 7   here, because I'm not certain.

 8              MR. WOLF:       Right.

 9              JUSTICE BREYER:             I'm trying to work out why

10   is this a major thing to say strip down to your

11   underclothes, which children do when they change for

12   gym, they do fairly frequently, not to -- you know, and

13   there are only two women there.              Is -- how bad is this,

14   underclothes?   That's what I'm trying to get at.               I'm

15   asking because I don't know.

16              MR. WOLF:       Right.

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Wolf, one thing

18   should be clarified.      I don't think there's any dispute

19   what was done in the case of both of these girls.                It

20   wasn't just that they were stripped to their underwear.

21   They were asked to shake their bra out, to -- to shake,

22   stretch the top of their pants and shake that out.

23   There's no dispute, factual dispute about that, is

24   there?

 1              JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, I thought there was,

 2   because I thought on page 135 of the record the official

 3   said they didn't see her naked, and so I thought that

 4   there was --

 5              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             There was no dispute that

 6   they asked her to shake her pants and her bra.                Nobody

 7   said that they touched -- the school officials didn't

 8   touch her, that's a given.         But they did ask her to

 9   shake out her underwear.

10              MR. WOLF:      That's right, Justice Ginsburg.

11   Everybody --

12              JUSTICE BREYER:            My question -- my question

13   has to do with accepting --

14              MR. WOLF:      Yes.

15              JUSTICE BREYER:            What they said on page 135

16   of the record, and this is a genuine problem I'm having.

17   I'm trying to figure out, if that's so, and to repeat it

18   -- you heard what I said, there's no reason to repeat

19   it.

20              MR. WOLF:      Yes.

21              JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay.       I want to know why

22   that search, if that's what happened, would violate the

23   Fourth Amendment, assuming reasonable suspicion to think

24   she possessed meth or cocaine at that time.

25              MR. WOLF:      Yes.        And it still would violate


                                      46
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the Fourth Amendment, and the question is why.                   Because

 2   even that slightly less invasive search still implicates

 3   legitimate and serious implications of privacy.                      The

 4   National Association of Social Workers, for instance,

 5   filed an amicus brief in this case, and what they showed

 6   is that -- or they cited studies showing that when a

 7   child undergoes a strip search -- and Justice Breyer,

 8   your -- your hypothetical involves a strip search --

 9   that that produces long-lasting and traumatic

10   consequences for a 13-year-old child.

11               Now, why does that matter?                   Because the

12   Fourth Amendment requires a balancing.                   On one side you

13   have legitimate expectations of privacy, and on the

14   other side you have the governmental need to conduct

15   that search.   So --

16               JUSTICE BREYER:            Maybe the psychologists --

17   "strip search" has a lot of meanings.                   And do the

18   psychologists focus on the situation with the child

19   involved, you know, this is an -- my hypothetical, is

20   that what they're talking about?

21               MR. WOLF:       I believe it is, Your -- Justice

22   Breyer.   And I believe that we cite such a study in --

23   in our brief, the red brief, where we say that it

24   doesn't require a student to take off his or her

25   undergarments so long as the shirt and the pants are

 1   taken off, that that produces trauma.

 2               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Let me -- let me just, not

 3   so much change the facts, but -- but emphasize a couple

 4   of different aspects of the facts.

 5               Assuming Justice Breyer's hypothetical of a

 6   moment ago and assuming the following thought process on

 7   the part of the principal -- I -- strike that.

 8               I will vary the facts in one way.                 Let's

 9   assume, following your categorical rule that the -- the

10   principal doesn't know whether it's ibuprofen or not.

11   He just knows that there's a pill and one of the other

12   kids said this person has got pills on -- on her person.

13   The principal says, I know as a matter of reliable fact

14   that one student got sick, violently sick, within the

15   past week or so on some pill; we don't know exactly what

16   it was.   We also know within a reasonable period of time

17   from where we are now that there have been kids who died

18   from ingesting dangerous drugs.              I've got suspicion that

19   some drug is on this kid's person.                 My thought process

20   is I would rather have the kid embarrassed by a strip

21   search, if we can't find anything short of that, than to

22   have some other kids dead because the stuff is

23   distributed at lunchtime and things go awry.

24               Is that the basis?              Is that thought process,

25   that reasoning, the basis for a -- a reasonable strip

 1   search?

 2               MR. WOLF:      And to make sure I understand,

 3   it's that there's reasonable belief -- there's a

 4   reasonable belief that a student has drugs on his or her

 5   person?

 6               JUSTICE SOUTER:            That's right.

 7               MR. WOLF:      And by his or her person,

 8   presumably it could be the pockets or it could be in the

 9   backpack that he or she is holding?

10               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Somewhere between the

11   surface of the clothes and -- and the body.

12               MR. WOLF:      Right.         And in that instance it

13   still would not be appropriate.              There needs to be

14   suspicion that the object is located underneath the

15   clothing.   And if that isn't there, then you can't

16   search there.   Now that should be --

17               JUSTICE SOUTER:            You -- you say that the --

18   the point of my question, this is what I'd like you to

19   focus on -- you're entirely right, I would accept that

20   argument and I think that argument is entirely right, if

21   the stakes are lower.      If the risk of a mistake is going

22   to be less traumatic.      In the hypo that I gave, the risk

23   of the mistake may well be violent sickness or death.

24   And the thought process in the principal's mind is, the

25   reasonableness analysis in the principal's mind is


                                       49

 1   better embarrassment than violent sickness or death.

 2   What's wrong with that reasoning under the Fourth

 3   Amendment?

 4                MR. WOLF:       Well, I mean, to start, that's

 5   not what T.L.O. said.        T.L.O. said that there needs to

 6   be a reasonable --

 7                JUSTICE SOUTER:             I'm -- I'm saying it.

 8                (Laughter.)

 9                JUSTICE SOUTER:             We -- We've got a new case.

10                (Laughter.)

11                JUSTICE SOUTER:             And I'm saying to you, why

12   isn't that a -- a reasonable thought process within the

13   concept of Fourth Amendment reasonableness?

14                MR. WOLF:       Because in order to conduct that

15   intrusive search, it seems like it that case you would

16   have to be doing guesswork, if you will, about where

17   those pills are located.

18                JUSTICE SOUTER:             You've got reasonable

19   suspicion that they are somewhere on the person.

20                MR. WOLF:       That's right.                And presumably, if

21   they're -- if it doesn't show up in a pocket search,

22   then you can do a strip search; and if you don't find it

23   in the strip search, you could do a body cavity search;

24   and if it's not in the body cavity search --

25                JUSTICE SOUTER:             And with those stakes in

 1   mind, why isn't it reasonable?               In other words, there --

 2   there is a sliding scale of risk which is inherent in my

 3   hypo, and why isn't that a sound basis for a -- a Fourth

 4   Amendment analysis?

 5                 MR. WOLF:     Because -- it all comes back to

 6   the balancing of the Fourth Amendment.                      And here, where

 7   you're conducting a traumatic search without a belief

 8   that you're going to find it underneath the

 9   undergarments, it --

10                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           I don't have a belief; I

11   simply have a reasonable suspicion.                      That's what I've

12   got all along the way.        And it seems to me, when -- when

13   you take the position that you -- you were taking, you

14   are saying, better to have the risk of violent sickness

15   or death than the risk of embarrassment.                      Isn't that

16   what you're saying?

17                 MR. WOLF:     No, it's not what I'm saying,

18   Your Honor.    There are many things that -- that this

19   principal could -- or the assistant principal could have

20   done here that would have mitigated any risk, and at the

21   same time not caused the trauma of -- the trauma

22   associated with a strip search.               Sit the child down --

23                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Some search is -- is

24   reasonable, I take it?

25                 MR. WOLF:     But -- absolutely.

 1                JUSTICE SOUTER:             All right.       Now the -- we

 2   get to the point as in prior hypos, in which it does --

 3   they find nothing in the pockets.                  They find nothing in

 4   the pocket book or other garments.                   The only thing

 5   that's left is a strip search, and that's where you draw

 6   the line.    Why do you draw the line there, on the risk

 7   analysis?

 8                MR. WOLF:       Well, the hypothetical supposes

 9   they have searched everywhere.                And I suppose if you

10   have -- if you are certain that somebody possesses a

11   drug and you have searched everywhere, perhaps you have

12   generated location-specific information.                  I would

13   readily agree to that.

14                But in this case, they certainly did not

15   search everywhere.

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Do you agree with Mr.

17   O'Neil when he said if the drug had been cocaine, and

18   it's well known that cocaine is carried in underwear,

19   that then this would not run afoul of the Fourth

20   Amendment?   He gave an example of a drug where there was

21   a custom of carrying it in a certain way.

22                MR. WOLF:       Right.         I think if it were

23   readily known that this student had previously been

24   suspected of -- to use the term that's used in the court

25   of appeal cases -- "crotching" that drug, well, then,


                                         52

 1   perhaps that would have been appropriate.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             It has to be that

 3   student.     It can't be that it's customary among

 4   students?

 5                 MR. WOLF:      And it may be that if this

 6   becomes so customary, that that somehow differently

 7   calibrates the equation here, but it -- it's sort of

 8   strange credulity to think that you would have loose

 9   pills concealed against a student's genitalia.                   That's

10   what you'd have to think was the custom here.

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            As -- as I understand your

12   - your presentation, you qualify as a strip search any

13   search that requires the outer garments to be taken off.

14   So it didn't really matter whether they required her to

15   shake out her bra or stretch the elastic of her

16   underwear?

17                 MR. WOLF:      It certainly added to the trauma

18   -- trauma, Justice Scalia.

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But is a strip search and

20   -- impermissible along the lines you say, to require the

21   student to even take off the outer garments?

22                 MR. WOLF:      That's -- that's right.             That's

23   what the studies say, and that seems like a reasonable

24   calibration to me.      You know, anything --

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Just to combine it

 1   with -- with your answers to Justice Kennedy, you are

 2   saying it's unreasonable to take off the outer garments

 3   even if your suspicion, reasonable suspicion for

 4   justifying the preliminary search is that the student

 5   has heroin?

 6                 MR. WOLF:      Without any location-specific

 7   information, that's correct, and anything else would

 8   send a shudder down the spines of little boys and girls

 9   around this country.

10                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, let me ask you this

11   about spine shuddering.

12                 (Laughter.)

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Let's go back to Justice

14   Souter's question.      We assume that there's meth,

15   something very dangerous, going to be smoked at noon,

16   there's very strong suspicion of this student.              The

17   assistant principal says I'm going to give you a choice:

18   we're going to engage in an intrusive search, same sex

19   people, like what went on here; or we're going to call

20   the local police department, we'll have probable cause

21   to book you and they will search you at the jail house.

22   Which do you choose?

23                 Would the school administrators be violating

24   their duty if they did that?

25                 MR. WOLF:      If -- if they called in the

 1   police officers?

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            They give the student the

 3   choice.     They say we'll do it here with a nurse right

 4   here, where you know everybody, and there's nothing

 5   wrong' or we'll call the police, and they'll do it down

 6   at the police station.

 7                 MR. WOLF:      I don't think that would violate

 8   the Fourth Amendment, Justice Kennedy.

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But --

10                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Which -- which would be

11   the less traumatic of the two choices for the student?

12                 MR. WOLF:      Well I'm not sure that there's a

13   lesser or more traumatic.            Both -- both are fairly

14   traumatic.

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But wouldn't the

16   police --

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You think it's less

18   traumatic, or it might be less traumatic to have

19   uniformed police officers take the person to the police

20   station and conduct the search there?

21                 MR. WOLF:      Well --

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You want us to decide the

23   case on the fact that that's probably less traumatic for

24   the student?

25                 MR. WOLF:      I'm saying both are remarkably

 1   traumatic.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:            The police would require --

 3                MR. WOLF:      I'm not putting them one above

 4   the other.

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:            The police would require

 6   probable cause, wouldn't they, not just suspicion?

 7                MR. WOLF:      They would require probable

 8   cause.

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            In the hypothetical wasn't

10   there a probable cause?

11                MR. WOLF:      Well if there's probable cause

12   and they want to call the police officers in, then they

13   can do that.   But that's not what happened here.                  What

14   this school official did was act on nothing more than a

15   hunch, if that, that Savana was currently concealing

16   Ibuprofen pills underneath her underpants for other's

17   oral consumption.    I mean there's a certain ick factor

18   to this.

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, you've made

20   that point several times.           In fact the issue here covers

21   the brassier as well, which doesn't seem as outlandish

22   as the underpants, right?

 2   different, because this Court has --

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Maybe I'm -- maybe

 4   I'm not articulating this.             You keep focusing on the

 5   fact that it's unlikely that the pills would be

 6   concealed in her underpants.               That doesn't go to the

 7   brassiere at all.

 8                 MR. WOLF:       Well it -- the brassiere I think

 9   as well.     I mean there -- there was nothing in this

10   record that even the principal or assistant principal

11   said I suspect that it was there.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:             It's not like you have any

13   studies on this.      But I mean, I hate to tell you, but it

14   seems to me like a logical thing when an adolescent

15   child has some pills or something, they know people are

16   looking for them, they will stick them in their

17   underwear.    I'm not saying everyone would, but I mean,

18   somebody who thinks that that's a fairly normal idea for

19   some adolescent with some illegal drugs to think of, I

20   don't think he's totally out to lunch, is he?

21                 MR. WOLF:       Well --

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:             Do you have any studies on

23   this?   I doubt it.

24                 MR. WOLF:       No, but neither -- neither do

25   they.

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:            So what am I supposed to

 2   do?     In my experience when I was 8 or 10 or 12 years

 3   old, you know, we did take our clothes off once a day,

 4   we changed for gym, okay?            And in my experience, too,

 5   people did sometimes stick things in my underwear --

 6                 (Laughter.)

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Or not my underwear.

 8   Whatever.     Whatever.     I was the one who did it?                   I don't

 9   know.     I mean, I don't think it's beyond human

10   experience, not beyond human experience.

11                 MR. WOLF:      Yes, but the "not beyond human

12   experience" --

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, what are they

14   supposed to do?

15                 MR. WOLF:      But the "not beyond human

16   experience" standard is not the standard that governs

17   whether the Fourth Amendment is violated.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:            No, no, but it's supposed

19   to be what's reasonable.

20                 MR. WOLF:      Right.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:            And a teacher is there

22   thinking what's reasonable?              And I've already got the

23   thing sort of away from -- I see your point.                      I'm not

24   quite talking about that.            I'm worried about what to

25   write in this as a general standard.                      And so am I

 1   supposed to say, look, school -- school officials who

 2   think that children could hide things in their underwear

 3   when they know they're not supposed to have them, is

 4   that school official really unreasonable except in a

 5   special case?   That's what's bothering me.

 6              MR. WRIGHT:         Well, it -- it is unreasonable,

 7   and at the end of the day, it has to be unreasonable.

 8   To think that -- for school officials to think that this

 9   student was hiding -- this honor student was hiding

10   pills underneath her undergarments based on nothing in

11   the record that supports that, not a single thing.               What

12   does the school official know?              That there was an

13   accusation that Savana had provided pills at an unknown

14   time and at an unknown location, that Savana's backpack

15   search yielded nothing, not only pills, but no suspicion

16   that she possessed pills underneath her undergarments.

17              JUSTICE ALITO:           Is that a question of law or

18   is that a question that goes to the trier of fact,

19   whether you could infer reasonable suspicion about the

20   presence of the pills in those locations?

21              MR. WOLF:       That seems like a factual

22   question to me, Justice Alito.              I mean, there's nothing

23   in the record to -- to indicate otherwise.              And we

24   haven't moved for summary judgment here, but all

25   inferences are resolved in our favor when Petitioners

 1   have moved for summary judgment.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Is probable cause a jury

 3   question too?

 4                MR. WOLF:     Whether something rises to the

 5   level of probable cause?

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes, probable cause in the

 7   ordinary criminal investigation cases.                  Is that a jury

 8   question?

 9                MR. WOLF:     It strikes me as a factual

10   question, Your Honor, that may or may not -- I -- I

11   don't know the answer to that --

12                JUSTICE ALITO:         In a 1983 action, wouldn't

13   it be a jury question?

14                MR. WOLF:     I think in this case it certainly

15   is a jury question, without anything else in the record

16   that that -- that that is a reasonable inference, and

17   without it being self-evident -- and I would actually

18   argue that it was self-evident that those pills were not

19   located there and that that's not a reasonable

20   inference.

21                But if there is some doubt about that -- and

22   I was hearing some doubt from Justice Breyer and perhaps

23   other members of this Court -- well, that strikes me as

24   a factual question.      And if that's a factual question to

25   be resolved by a jury, there must be a principle behind

 1   that, which is that if it is not a reasonable inference

 2   that those objects were located there, then it would be

 3   an unreasonable search.          And if that's true, then

 4   qualified immunity, at least at this stage, was properly

 5   denied.

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't think it's a

 7   question.     You can -- even -- even in a 1983 action, I

 8   don't think the courts allow a jury to decide whether

 9   there was probable cause for an officer's search or

10   seizure.     That's new to me.

11                 MR. WOLF:      Well, whether something was a

12   reasonable inference or not, it might strike one as a

13   reasonable inference --

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Did the Ninth Circuit --

15                 MR. WOLF:      -- and another as not a

16   reasonable inference.

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Did the Ninth Circuit

18   treat this as a jury question?                I'm looking at page 38a.

19   They were quite definite that that was a Fourth

20   Amendment violation.

21                 MR. WOLF:      Right, because for the Ninth

22   Circuit, this -- it was self-evident to the Ninth

23   Circuit that the --       that there was not a reasonable

24   inference.     And without that reasonable inference, there

25   was no reason to treat it as a jury question, but if

 1   there were a reasonable inference, then it strikes me as

 2   something that might be -- that might be better suited

 3   for determination by the jury.

 4               Thank you.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, Mr. Wolf.

 7            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W. WRIGHT

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9               MR. WRIGHT:         Thank you, Your Honor.

10               The reality is that we've gotten past the

11   reasonable at its inception prong, and we're now on the

12   scope.   And I think everyone concedes that.                     And, as to

13   the scope, I can tell you that if they found uncut

14   heroin or small-caliber bullets in this case, they would

15   have to reach the same results.               And that is

16   unacceptable in the school setting.                      There's too much at

17   risk here when you're talking about the custodial and

18   tutelary responsibilities this Court has time and again

19   recognized as the most important elements in upholding

20   the three search cases, student search cases, that this

21   Court has upheld.

22               The other thing about the government's

23   proposal is -- is really troubling.                      It's because they

24   do not justify why they would pass a rule that would so

25   much stunt the administrator's discretion to respond,

 1   even in the most serious situations that confront the

 2   health and safety of kids.           These -- these principles

 3   are principles that have been restated by this Court.

 4   You need the flexibility to act immediately and

 5   effectively to keep kids safe.

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Unless the people feel

 7   differently.

 8              MR. WRIGHT:          That's right.

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Some school districts have

10   rules against --

11              MR. WRIGHT:          Absolutely.

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:              -- simply forbidding strip

13   searches on any -- right?

14              MR. WRIGHT:          There is an amicus brief that

15   cites 189 school districts which have substantially

16   limited strip searches, which proves the Ingraham v.

17   Wright theory, which is that it will be taken care of at

18   the local level.

19              But administrators, for now, need a

20   bright-line rule.    And as to the scope, that bright-line

21   rule is if you have reason to suspect that a student is

22   processing contraband that poses a health and safety

23   risk, then searching any place where that contraband may

24   be reasonably hidden is constitutionally permissible.

25   And in any event, Mr. Wilson in this case certainly

 1   could have believed that the Constitution permitted it,

 2   Mr. Chief Justice, and so immunity is a foregone

 3   conclusion in my opinion.

 4                 But I would ask the Court to rule on the

 5   constitutional question in the affirmative because it

 6   would further the interests of judicial economy.                There

 7   would not be any more Federal action in this case.

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Yes, there would.

 9   There's a Monell claim against the school district

10   because there is no qualified immunity.

11                 MR. WRIGHT:       That's correct, Your Honor, but

12   if you ruled in the affirmative on the constitutional

13   question --

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Yes.

15                 MR. WRIGHT:       -- the case is over.

16                 The additional issue, Justice Alito, on the

17   factual question is I understand you're not talking

18   about immunity, but the reality is we've got to be able

19   to make decisions, and if we get sued on factual

20   questions because somebody questions whether or not it's

21   reasonable for us to search where contraband may be

22   reasonably located, then we're going to end up in court

23   anyway on those factual questions, which is going to --

24   you know, deter officials from acting immediately and

25   effectively in those situations.                So, I do not think it


                                        64

 1   is a factual question.      And the District Court and the

 2   first three-panel-judge court did hold as a matter of

 3   law that this search was constitutional.

 4              Thank you, Your Honors.
