 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Case 07-1216, Philip Morris v.

 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. SHAPIRO:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10   and may it please the Court:

11               We are here today because the Oregon court

12   failed to follow this Court's directions on remand and

13   because the ground it gave is not adequate to show a

14   forfeiture of due process rights.

15               This -- this Court vacated after finding

16   that the Oregon Supreme Court applied the wrong

17   constitutional standard, and it remanded with directions

18   to apply the standard that the Court laid out.                But the

19   Oregon court didn't do that.            It never even addressed

20   the constitutional issue.          The Oregon court, of course,

21   refused to follow this Court's direction because it

22   believed there were mistakes in another paragraph in our

23   instruction request dealing with what the court referred

24   to as "unrelated issues."

25               But that isn't what this Court mandated.


                                        3

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   And the specific forfeiture theory adopted here for the

 2   first time after nine years of appellate litigation is

 3   completely inadequate to avoid this mandate.

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Shapiro, we are

 5   dealing with a State supreme court, and our bottom line

 6   always reads "for further proceedings not inconsistent

 7   with this opinion."     And it was my understanding that a

 8   State court can resolve a case on an alternate State law

 9   ground, if there is such a ground in the case.

10               MR. SHAPIRO:         Yes, Your Honor.            We believe

11   that this disposition is quite inconsistent with what

12   the Court mandated.     The Court heard arguments in this

13   case about the "correct in all respects" rule, but it

14   still mandated an application of the constitutional

15   standard, including the prohibition on punishment for

16   harm to non-parties, and that standard simply was never

17   applied.   We say that is inconsistent with this Court's

18   opinion.

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:             But it seems to me the

20   problem with the argument is that to say it is

21   inconsistent with the opinion we implicitly have to say

22   that the Oregon Supreme Court has to confront State law

23   issues in a certain sequence, and that if it does not do

24   so those issues are waived, as it were, not only by the

25   court but by the party who raised it.                   And the


                                        4

 1   difficulty, I think, with your position here is that on

 2   the assumption, which I do make, that the -- that the

 3   issue, "correct in all respect" issue, was properly

 4   raised by the other side, if we accept your position, we

 5   in effect are saying the other side is not going to have

 6   an opportunity to argue that before the Oregon Supreme

 7   Court.   And that's, it seems to me, kind of a steep hill

 8   for you to climb.

 9               MR. SHAPIRO:          Well, we don't say that the

10   court can never adopt a State law standard after remand

11   from this Court, but we say that this disposition is

12   inconsistent --

13               JUSTICE SOUTER:              I know you are saying that

14   but why -- why does the disposition that you are asking

15   for not entail what I just said, and that is, in effect

16   you cut off the claim by a party raised before the

17   Oregon Supreme Court, not considered by the Oregon

18   Supreme Court, and you cut off that claim simply because

19   the Oregon Supreme Court chose to approach the issues in

20   the case in a certain sequence?               What business do we

21   have to do that?

22               MR. SHAPIRO:          Well, because the preservation

23   issue was debated before this Court and it adopted a

24   specific order here saying on remand now consider the

25   constitutional standard, which is the prohibition on --

 1                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             I know the language that

 2   you are referring to.

 3                 MR. SHAPIRO:         Yes.

 4                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             But the referring to that

 5   language simply skips over the issue that I am trying to

 6   raise.     Isn't there a problem that we should be

 7   concerned with if we accept your position in cutting off

 8   the claim made by one party to the case which was never

 9   heard by the Oregon Supreme Court?

10                 MR. SHAPIRO:         Well, Your Honor, this is very

11   similar to what occurred in the Sullivan case in this

12   Court, where the issue of preservation was debated

13   before this Court at the cert stage in the cert papers,

14   and the Court said:       We sub silentio passed on the

15   adequacy of the State ground when we CDRed the case.

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Didn't -- did the

17   Court -- suppose the -- what is it called -- "correct in

18   all respects" had been raised and decided by the Oregon

19   Supreme Court in the first instance.                      Suppose it had

20   said, well, we don't have to deal with whether

21   Instruction 34 was right or wrong in this particular,

22   because it was wrong in other respects.                      Suppose that

23   had been the first time around what the Oregon Supreme

24   Court said.    Would that have offended any Federal due

25   process?    Would that have been an appropriate

 1   disposition for the Oregon Supreme Court to make?

 2               MR. SHAPIRO:           Well, that takes us to our

 3   second and principal argument, which is that that ground

 4   would not be adequate under this Court's criteria for

 5   adequacy.   And we say that there are really three

 6   reasons why that would not be an adequate ground for

 7   forfeiting this constitutional right.                       It's an ambush.

 8   It was a surprise ruling that we couldn't anticipate.

 9   It is an exercise in futility because, even if we

10   submitted a perfect instruction that complied with that

11   rule, we would have been rejected anyway by the trial

12   court that simply believed that this instruction wasn't

13   required by the --

14               JUSTICE SOUTER:               Isn't the place to make

15   that argument in the Oregon Supreme Court?

16               MR. SHAPIRO:           Well, no.              The Oregon Supreme

17   --

18               JUSTICE SOUTER:               Wouldn't it have been

19   appropriate to -- to hear the -- the issue that they are

20   raising and for you to make the reply that you have just

21   made?

22               MR. SHAPIRO:           Your Honor, this Court has

23   said repeatedly that adequacy is a Federal law question

24   for this Court to decide.

25               JUSTICE SOUTER:               I realize it's a Federal

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   law question and in approaching that question, I keep

 2   asking the question which I think I have now put to you

 3   three times and have yet to hear an answer on the merits

 4   on:   Why is it appropriate for us to have a rule here

 5   that cuts off the right of a party that properly raised

 6   an issue in the Oregon Supreme Court and has yet to be

 7   heard on the merits in the Oregon Supreme Court?

 8               MR. SHAPIRO:           Well, there are two reasons.

 9   First under the adequacy decisions of this Court,

10   including Lee v. Kemna, if it takes years and years

11   after the trial to articulate a forfeiture rule like

12   this that counts heavily against the adequacy of the

13   State ground.     This Court held that in Lee v. Kemna very

14   recently.

15               And then secondly, this is a point that was

16   argued to this Court four separate times now and when

17   the Court remanded with explicit directions to apply the

18   constitutional standard that's something that had to be

19   done on remand.     The Court did not invite the lower

20   court to get into the question of whether this request

21   was made.   The Court found that the request was made.

22               JUSTICE SOUTER:               Maybe -- maybe this Court

23   insufficiently appreciated the significance of the issue

24   which is now before us.          And I still want to know, is

25   there a good reason on the merits why it is fair for us


                                          8

 1   to cut off the right of the other side to raise an issue

 2   that they raise or to argue an issue that they raised in

 3   a timely fashion?

 4               MR. SHAPIRO:           Yes, there is a good reason,

 5   because this is -- adequacy is ultimately a Federal

 6   question for this Court to decide.                   The issue was

 7   debated here four separate times at great length.                     The

 8   Court remanded for a specific decision by the lower

 9   court.   That wasn't done.           And if we turn to the

10   adequacy doctrine --

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Excuse me.        What -- what

12   issue was debated here four times?

13               MR. SHAPIRO:           Whether or not there was an

14   adequate State ground because of the "correct in all

15   respects" rule.   That was debated in the merits brief,

16   in the cert oppositions twice.                It was debated again in

17   the cert opposition this time around.                     But the Court has

18   never accepted it.

19               JUSTICE STEVENS:               But the State court hadn't

20   ruled on it at that time.

21               MR. SHAPIRO:           That's correct.

22               JUSTICE STEVENS:               So how do we rule on it as

23   a matter of first impression?

24               MR. SHAPIRO:           Well, because, Your Honor, the

25   Court considered, just as it did in Sullivan, it


                                          9

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   considered these issues in the cert papers and then

 2   remanded the case for a different issue to be decided by

 3   the lower court.

 4                But we don't hesitate from debating the

 5   adequacy issue.

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Did our opinion decide that

 7   -- that question?    Did our opinion say that that

 8   question was decided against your opponent?

 9                MR. SHAPIRO:         No.      What the Court said in

10   Sullivan was that it was a sub silentio determination.

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How could we have

12   determined it when the Oregon Supreme Court itself

13   hadn't made any determination?

14                MR. SHAPIRO:         Because the parties debated

15   this extensively in their briefs.

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But we don't decide

17   questions, particularly questions of State law, that may

18   have a Federal check.       But we don't decide them in the

19   first instance.

20                And there's one point, Mr. Shapiro, that I

21   think affects this concern of fairness to the parties

22   who raised this "correct in all respects" from the

23   beginning.   This Court had not clarified, had it, until

24   the Williams case itself, the rule about harm to others.

25   In State Farm we were talking about harm to


                                        10

 1   nonresidents.    So if I recall correctly, Williams was

 2   the first time we ever clarified that harm to others

 3   included people within the same State; is that correct?

 4               MR. SHAPIRO:          Yes.       That's true.

 5               This -- this, as the Court expressed it, was

 6   a slight extension of the previous decisions.                  But Your

 7   Honor, if the Court feel that this adequacy issue hasn't

 8   been dealt with previously by this Court, it's presented

 9   squarely here.    It is a Federal question, which this

10   Court says has to be decided by this Court.                 And we

11   don't hesitate from --

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I suppose one reason

13   -- one reason to think it may not have been decided is

14   that, unlike the other situations you have discussed, it

15   would not have been a bar to our consideration of this

16   case the last time because, just as you raise the

17   question in your second question presented that whether

18   the award complies with due process, we may have thought

19   there might have been an adequate and independent State

20   ground on a procedural question, but we were going to go

21   ahead.   We granted cert on the substantive question on

22   whether the damages award was unconstitutional.

23               MR. SHAPIRO:          Well, Your Honor, if -- if

24   we're not right about the decision resolving the

25   adequacy issue already, we're happy to turn to it now

 1   and address it as we do in our briefs.                      This is not an

 2   adequate State ground under this Court's decisions.                        The

 3   first reason for that is that this is a futile gesture

 4   that the State court requires of us.

 5                JUSTICE STEVENS:            I want to ask you about

 6   that.   That's the thrust of your argument:                     It would

 7   have been futile to comply with the specific, drafting a

 8   perfect -- perfect instruction "correct in all

 9   respects."   But I have to think the trial -- the record

10   is subject to the reading that the trial judge thought

11   the issue had already been adequately taken care of,

12   rather than it would be an incorrect instruction.

13                MR. SHAPIRO:         Well, the trial judge asked,

14   is there any authority that requires me to give this

15   instruction on harm to non-parties?                      And we said, in our

16   view it's the BMW case.         And she said, well, if there is

17   not an authority right on point I'm not going to give

18   this instruction.    She said that very clearly.                    So if we

19   submitted a separate piece of paper, it would have made

20   no difference; and if we had taken out the two mistakes

21   --

22                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Where in the record is the

23   portion of the colloquy about the instructions most

24   clearly stated in your view, on your side of that issue?

 1   instruction conference.        This begins on page 17a, where

 2   Mr. Beaty starts discussing the second prong of this

 3   paragraph.   He says -- he quotes the language, and the

 4   judge -- the judge says:         "Well, I think that that's

 5   covered by giving an instruction that punitive damages

 6   are not compensatory."       And he says:               No, no, that is

 7   not -- "That is not the point of this instruction."

 8   This is pages 17 and 18a.

 9                JUSTICE STEVENS:           But that's exactly the

10   point I make.   I think the trial judge was saying, I

11   think it's already covered, which is different from

12   saying, no matter how you phrase it, I won't give it.

13                MR. SHAPIRO:        Well, she said she just

14   disagreed with the idea that there should be protection

15   against punishment for harm to non-parties.                   And she

16   said unless there's a case requiring that, I'm not going

17   to give that instruction.          And she said --

18                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Didn't she also say that

19   she was going to give, and ultimately did give an

20   instruction, to the effect that punitive damages are

21   punitive, they are not for the compensation of this

22   person or any other person, and to -- she then turned to

23   Philip Morris's counsel and said:                What about that?       And

24   Philip Morris's counsel said okay.

25                MR. SHAPIRO:        What he was saying when he

 1   said okay was:     I understand your ruling and I'm not

 2   going to continue to argue a point that I've already

 3   lost.    But he pressed that point --

 4                JUSTICE SOUTER:             It doesn't sound like much

 5   of an objection.

 6                MR. SHAPIRO:          Well, the -- the State courts

 7   both held -- both of the appellate courts held our

 8   instruction was rejected.            And this Court said it was

 9   rejected, too, in its opinion.                And that's exactly

10   right.   You can't antagonize the trial judge by arguing

11   and arguing after your position has been rejected.

12                JUSTICE BREYER:             But -- but the -- the

13   problem that I am having at the moment is that they did

14   -- from your point of view, is that they -- the other

15   side listed 28 cases in which they said the Oregon

16   courts have followed this rule that the instruction has

17   to be good as a whole.

18                Now, I have looked up those 28 cases, and

19   they do -- they do say that.              They do say it, or they

20   imply it, or they apply it.              They are not completely on

21   point, but they are not completely out of point, either.

22   And -- and so I suppose what happened is that the judge

23   there just looked at this instruction on 32(a).                     It

24   looks like sort of it's all together.                     It really does

25   look like it's all together, the (1) and the (2).                        And

 1   he ran his eye down the page and he said, well, here are

 2   two other ways in which it's no good, and so that's the

 3   end of it.     You can't raise your objection.                   Maybe you

 4   should have had four instructions instead of one, but

 5   you did just have one.

 6                And under Oregon law, unless every part of

 7   it is right, the judge is correct in not giving it, even

 8   if he never mentions the other part.                      And that 28 -- it

 9   does seem as if that's what those 28 cases do say.                      So

10   what do we say about that?

11                MR. SHAPIRO:          The -- the reason we say that

12   those 28 cases did not give us reasonable notice that we

13   had to submit a separate piece of paper or change

14   another paragraph in the instruction request is that

15   none of them dealt with a situation where you have

16   separately numbered requests --

17                JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, I mean -- please, I

18   -- I don't want to appear skeptical, but I am.                     And --

19   and that's because I have looked up in some of those

20   cases, and then I sort of looked at the -- which doesn't

21   -- most of them don't give you the instructions, so it's

22   a little hard to say.        But then I looked on page 32(a)

23   of this appendix and looked at what your instructions

24   looked like.

25                And -- and if I were sitting there as a


                                         15

 1   judge, I would think, well, gee, that looks like a

 2   single thing there.     They have it indented, and they

 3   have a (1) and a (2), and it just looks like it's one

 4   ball of wax.   So can I really fault this Oregon court

 5   for just doing what I said?

 6               MR. SHAPIRO:         Well, I -- I think so, because

 7   the pattern instruction here told both parties to

 8   include all their paragraphs pertaining to punitive

 9   damages in one numbered instruction, 34.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, they had some other

11   handbook that says beware of that.

12               MR. SHAPIRO:         Yes.

13               JUSTICE BREYER:            Because you are going to

14   run into this rule that says if there is any part of a

15   single instruction that is wrong, goodbye, even if the

16   trial judge never mentioned it.

17               MR. SHAPIRO:         But that handbook came out in

18   2006.   And after all, that was a practice tip.           It was

19   not a State court ruling saying you had to organize your

20   instruction this way.

21               We had separate paragraphs, separately

22   numbered.   They dealt with different issues.           One was

23   the Constitution and the other was the State statute.

24   And there's no Oregon case that said that in that

25   situation you have to break it out into a separate piece

 1   of paper.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought the notion was

 3   one issue, one charge.         And it wasn't in just one

 4   practice manual.     There were a few cited in the brief

 5   that the charge should be limited to one issue, one

 6   point of law.

 7                 MR. SHAPIRO:         Well, the pattern instructions

 8   told us to put every point pertaining to punitive

 9   damages in Instruction No. 34.                Both sides did that.

10   And the Court was working with plaintiff's instruction,

11   taking their --

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:            I mean, it would be pretty

13   odd.     Did the person who wrote that read these 28 cases

14   or some share thereof?         And if you were going to do that

15   -- it wasn't you, I know -- why -- why wouldn't you

16   just, if you have one instruction, copy the -- the model

17   instruction?     Then you won't make errors in the other

18   parts.

19                 MR. SHAPIRO:         Well, you see, the -- the

20   pattern -- the pattern instruction didn't include the

21   due process point.

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:            True, but you could add

23   that to the pattern.

24                 MR. SHAPIRO:         That's what we tried to do,

25   and the -- the judge invited us while dealing with the

 1   other side's instruction to go through this one by one.

 2   She -- she was asking us:           Now, what's your next

 3   addition?

 4                And we -- we got to the due process point,

 5   and she said:    What is your authority?                    And we told her,

 6   and she said:    I don't think that instruction is

 7   necessary.

 8                It was separately argued.                     It was separately

 9   decided by the State courts in the prior decisions,

10   decided by this Court as -- as a separate matter, and

11   that is exactly how the trial court approached this.

12   Her request was to go through this item by item.

13                She wasn't taking an all-or-nothing approach

14   to this instruction.       She started with plaintiff's

15   document and asked what from our menu of additions

16   was necessary.

17                JUSTICE BREYER:            I'm not speaking of this

18   from the point of view -- I mean I -- when I read that

19   petition for cert, I thought this is a run- around, and

20   I'm not sure that I think that now.                      That is, the reason

21   is because I put myself in the position of not the trial

22   judge.   The person to put yourself in the position of is

23   the Oregon Supreme Court justice.                 And what he is doing

24   is he's reading that instruction.                 And -- and what can

25   you say in response to what -- what he might have

 1   thought?

 2                 He knows this rule.              The rule is if the

 3   instruction is -- is unfavorable in any part, if it's

 4   wrong, you are out.

 5                 MR. SHAPIRO:         Well --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:            He knows that rule, because

 7   there have been a lot of cases on it.                     And then he reads

 8   your instruction, and as I looked carefully -- I didn't

 9   know this the first time when it was here, but he said

10   because it's right in paragraph 1 -- I mean it's wrong

11   in paragraph 1, where he was wrong -- I don't have to go

12   to the rest of it.

13                 MR. SHAPIRO:         Yes.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Now we send it back, so he

15   says:   Okay, now I've got to go to the rest of it.

16                 MR. SHAPIRO:         You know, Justice Breyer, this

17   is very similar to what was at issue in the Flowers case

18   which reached this Court.            The Alabama Supreme Court had

19   said if you intermix different appeal points in your

20   brief, we are not going to consider any of them if there

21   are any errors to be found in any of the paragraphs in

22   their brief.

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But I thought the whole

24   thing about -- this is the NAACP case you that you were

25   discussing?

 1                MR. SHAPIRO:          Yes.

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              -- that this was

 3   something that the Alabama Supreme Court really sprung

 4   at the last minute, that it was not like this rule.

 5   There were not 28 cases in the Alabama Supreme Court

 6   applying the rule.      It seemed to be quite a novel rule.

 7                MR. SHAPIRO:          Well, what -- what the State

 8   argued there was that for 60 years the "correct in all

 9   respects" rule was in effect in Alabama, and they cited

10   dozens of cases applying it.              But this Court unanimously

11   held that that approach was pointless severity.                Even

12   though the State supreme court there said, we can't

13   disentangle these arguments, it's too complicated, it's

14   too much of a burden on the State supreme court, this

15   Court unanimously found that was pointless severity.

16   And at that point --

17                JUSTICE STEVENS:             There was a basis for

18   questioning the good faith of the court in that case, I

19   think.

20                MR. SHAPIRO:          Well --

21                JUSTICE STEVENS:             And I don't think that's

22   true here.

23                MR. SHAPIRO:          I -- I -- we don't question

24   the good faith of the court, but we say that this is

25   pointless severity, a rule that this Court has applied


                                         20

 1   more recently in Lee v. Kemna where there was no issue

 2   of bad faith.    The Court thought that it was pointlessly

 3   severe and unnecessarily severe to insist on a perfect

 4   proposal in that case.

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:               The best you have come up

 6   with -- and I think you have researched this pretty

 7   thoroughly -- and the best you have come up with to find

 8   a case where they didn't apply the rule is that George

 9   case, right?    "George," I think, is the name of it.

10              And there, there is an alternative ground

11   which is that the judge had to -- had to give the

12   instruction himself, and it's a criminal case.                  And we

13   Shepardized it and it has only been cited twice.                  And --

14   and so I'm slightly at sea, to tell you the truth.                  And

15   -- and what is the standard I'm supposed to use to

16   decide whether that State ground is adequate as a matter

17   of Federal law or not?

18              MR. SHAPIRO:            Well, there is an earlier case

19   that is interesting, State v. Brown, which comes several

20   years before, and it's cited in our brief.                  In that case

21   an imperfect instructional request was made, and the

22   Court still found that there was a duty to give the

23   instruction based on due process.                  And the reason was

24   that the parties during the charge conference had

25   debated the issue.      It was a fair-enough exposition for


                                         21
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the trial court to understand the need for the charge.

 2               And here this really is much like the

 3   Osborne case.   You know, in the Osborne case the

 4   defendant didn't make any instructional proposal, and

 5   this Court still reversed and required a new trial with

 6   the correct instruction.         It said due process required

 7   that.   And the Court said that we -- that the party had

 8   sufficiently brought this to the attention of the trial

 9   judge for Federal adequacy purposes even though no

10   instruction was -- was proposed.

11               The lawyer there merely moved to dismiss the

12   proceeding, never proposed an instruction, but this

13   Court required a retrial with a correct set of

14   instructions to the jury.          That's an a fortiori case, I

15   think; and also the Flowers case, I believe, is a

16   fortiori.   There really was a strong and compelling

17   State interest there in having the lawyers break their

18   arguments up into separate headings and subheadings so

19   the appellate court could follow the argument.

20               But here there wasn't any burden placed on

21   the trial judge at all by our request.                  She was going

22   through these one by one, and she asked us:                  What's your

23   next point that you want added?              We proposed it.      It was

24   on a silver platter.      She didn't have to retype it.                 She

25   could have simply read it to the jury in that form.                     It


                                       22

 1   didn't have to be edited or amended.                      There literally

 2   was no burden on the trial judge at all.                      And so we --

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             She didn't get to the --

 4   the other grounds, because I think it was all about that

 5   paragraph and whether that paragraph was adequate under

 6   our then precedent.       And I don't think that -- that the

 7   -- the incorrect portions of the charge that have now --

 8   are now before us were -- were even reached then.

 9                 MR. SHAPIRO:         She did look at the illicit

10   profits point.     And she said:            I'm not going to give

11   that; that's unnecessary.            She did -- she didn't address

12   the "may versus shall" issue because she was working

13   with plaintiffs' proposal.            So all -- really she just

14   had before her our request for this due process

15   instruction.     She analyzed it separately, it was debated

16   before her.

17                 And this is much more specific than what the

18   lawyers did in the Osborne case.                 They didn't even

19   propose an instruction.          We served it up on a silver

20   platter.     She could have used it, and indeed there was

21   no work for the trial judge at all because she was

22   simply telling the lawyers, make this change, make that

23   change that we've discussed, so there is zero burden on

24   the court.

25                 And you have to ask in this situation, what


                                         23

 1   is the legitimate State interest that would support this

 2   massive forfeiture of a very important due process

 3   right?   The plaintiff says the State interest here is

 4   that it promotes affirmance of jury verdicts whether or

 5   not there has been a due process violation.                      But think

 6   about that.    That's hardly a State interest.

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:            The State interest in the

 8   rule in general, I take it, is to require the lawyers,

 9   if they are going to object to the instructions that the

10   judge is going to give, to produce an instruction that

11   is a correct instruction of the law.                      That's -- that's

12   why, I guess, they have this rule.

13                 MR. SHAPIRO:         Oh, yes.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:            And -- and you'd better get

15   it right, because if you don't get it right, you're

16   going to lose your ability to claim that the judge was

17   wrong in refusing to give any part of it.

18                 Now, if that's the reason they have that

19   rule, that would seem to apply as much in this case as

20   in any other case.      Why wouldn't it?

21                 MR. SHAPIRO:         Well, please recall that in

22   both Osborne and in the Lee case, there was a general

23   State purpose of that kind that supported the rule, but

24   the Court said it was an exorbitant or unnecessarily

25   severe application of the rule.                And that's what we


                                         24

 1   contend here, that this is exorbitant, it serves no

 2   legitimate purpose.     It is truly a game of gotcha that

 3   just nullifies the defendant's due process rights.

 4              And that precedent I think would be of great

 5   concern in various fields of law.                This is a rule of law

 6   that will apply in civil rights cases in the future,

 7   criminal cases, all sorts of cases.

 8              So I -- I think if this Court does apply its

 9   own criteria here, it will see that this is an exercise

10   in futility, it was an ambush as a practical matter.                 We

11   didn't have any reason to think we had to submit this

12   again on a separate piece of paper.

13              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Could you just tell me,

14   well, why was it an exercise in futility?               That's what I

15   don't quite understand.

16              MR. SHAPIRO:          Oh, because the judge had

17   ruled as a matter of substantive law that she wasn't

18   going to give this instruction.              It wouldn't matter if

19   we separated it.

20              JUSTICE STEVENS:             But she said she thought

21   it was already covered.        That's what I -- on that very

22   page you pointed me to.

23              MR. SHAPIRO:          Well, she -- she said that was

24   all she was going to say about the point.               And we said,

25   well, that doesn't cover our point, because we want

 1   protection against punishment for harm to non-parties.

 2   And she said:     I'm not going to give that instruction; I

 3   deny the rest of your request, No. 34.

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And where is this

 5   colloquy?    I mean, we went through the parts, she said I

 6   think it's covered and it was okay.                       You seem to be

 7   saying more than ws included in that colloquy.

 8                MR. SHAPIRO:          Well, I -- I think if -- if

 9   you look at the whole colloquy, that's the gist of it.

10   I -- I have paraphrased it, but --

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              You've made it much

12   clearer than it was.

13                MR. SHAPIRO:          Perhaps --

14                (Laughter.)

15                MR. SHAPIRO:          -- perhaps I did.             But I -- I

16   would just point out that in Osborne the lawyer didn't

17   make it clear at all.        The lawyer didn't even propose an

18   instruction.

19                We proposed a good instruction that this

20   Court has quoted from emphasizing our language,

21   saying -- saying it correctly captures the due process

22   principle.     So that is enough to satisfy Federal

23   criteria of -- of adequacy, and that is sufficient to

24   preserve the point.       There is no dispute that this is

25   preserved for appellate purposes in Oregon.

 2   I would reserve the balance of our time.

 6               ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. PECK

 7                 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 8              MR. PECK:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10              This Court's constitutional mandate in this

11   case is conditioned in several significant respects, and

12   it invites the discretion and judgment of a State court

13   that's applying it.      First of all, it says that States

14   have flexibility in coming up with a procedure to

15   address this procedural due process issue.

16              It also says that it has to be an

17   appropriate case; there has to be a significant risk of

18   juror confusion, and a request.               There's no indication

19   in the opinion that this Court intended to federalize

20   the State procedure over how that request occurs.

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   You don't dispute

22   that it's a Federal question whether that procedure is

23   adequate and independent?

24              MR. PECK:        I do not, but I also submit that

25   it is more than adequate.           Exist -- what the Oregon

 1   Supreme Court decided was that the existing procedure

 2   permitting a limiting instruction to be requested -- in

 3   Oregon it's Rule 105, same language as in the Federal

 4   rule -- and such a request has to be timely, it has to

 5   be specific, it has to be on the record.                   And Oregon

 6   precedent says that when we mean specific, the proponent

 7   has to give us the exact language -- this is part of the

 8   party presentation principle -- the exact language that

 9   they are asking us to use.

10                And that means that we also apply our

11   traditional 92-year-old rule that requests for

12   instruction must be clear and correct in all respects.

13                JUSTICE STEVENS:           The problem --

14                JUSTICE BREYER:           I would say the 28 cases

15   are not quite as clear as I suggested.                  That is, I

16   couldn't find in those 28 cases really a comparable

17   situation.

18                MR. PECK:     Well --

19                JUSTICE BREYER:           In each instance it seemed

20   as if one of two things was the case:                   Either, A, where

21   the instruction was in error, it really was the matter

22   brought up in the first place, or the court said, but he

23   gave the essence of the instruction he wanted anyway.

24                Now, which of those cases do you think -- I

25   am leading up to, what of -- what of those cases do you

 1   think is your best support, because I couldn't -- they

 2   are not perfect.

 3                MR. PECK:       I would look first at

 4   Reyes-Camarena, which is a 2000 -- a 2000 decision

 5   involving the death penalty.              And there, there were two

 6   parts of this request, in a single request.               The request

 7   asked for a mitigating factors instruction, which the

 8   court found was correct on the law and -- and would have

 9   been given had it been asked for separately.

10                But it also asked the jury to consider

11   sympathy for the defendant, which they found to be

12   contrary to Oregon law, and therefore, it was not error

13   for the trial court to have refused this.

14                JUSTICE BREYER:             What -- what you can't tell

15   from that is what was the part of the sympathy

16   instruction that they thought was wrong, and was the

17   part that they thought was wrong really part and parcel

18   of the part that the -- that the appellant was

19   complaining about.

20                MR. PECK:       Well, the court, though, did cite

21   a prior decision that talked about a sympathy

22   instruction and claimed that this one was no different

23   than that.   It was contained in a single instruction.

24   It makes clear, the opinion does, on that.

25                Owings v. Rose is that another case which


                                         29
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   both parties have cited.           And in Owings, it's very

 2   clear.     There you have two different parts of an

 3   instruction that are offered at the same time, and --

 4   and one part is right.         And this -- this one deals with

 5   third party liability.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:            But I remember that,

 7   because they said on that one -- some floor covering

 8   thing, wasn't it, that they had some liability for bad

 9   floors or designing the floors wrong --

10                 MR. PECK:      If --

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:            If that's the case, what

12   they said was:     Don't worry about it because basically

13   he did give you the instruction that you wanted, though

14   in a different way --

15                 MR. PECK:      But --

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:            -- and besides that, they

17   added --

18                 MR. PECK:      And besides that --

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:            You're right.

20                 MR. PECK:      -- this was an alternate ground.

21                 Then in Hotelling v. Walther, a 1944 case,

22   the proposed instruction consist -- consisted of three

23   separate sentences, and the Court does reprint that

24   instruction.     And each of those sentences has a

25   different legal proposition in it.                   And it was only the


                                         30
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   last sentence, the third proposition, that the Court

 2   found to be in error, and therefore, found that there

 3   was no error in failing to give this instruction because

 4   it was not clear and correct in all respects.

 5                I -- I think that that --

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:            In the last one, what I

 7   have here is that the court said the so-called requested

 8   instruction was never requested at all --

 9                MR. PECK:      But --

10                JUSTICE BREYER:            -- at all.

11                MR. PECK:      But I do not believe that that

12   was the --

13                JUSTICE BREYER:            What is the -- what is the

14   -- I will go look at that again.                But what is the

15   standard?    I mean, remember, I think what your brother

16   said at the end is correct.             Imagine that yours is a

17   death case and we have said as a matter of Federal law

18   that this execution is unconstitutional, and then we

19   send it back.    And the court then says:                 Oh, we forgot;

20   there are a couple of matters of State law here that bar

21   the Federal consideration of the death question.                   And

22   here they are.    And then they come up with just this.

23                Is this -- is this a situation where you

24   would be equally -- that's my problem.                   And so, put

25   yourself in my shoes and -- and tell me what you would

 1   do if this is the death case and not the case that you

 2   have?

 3              MR. PECK:       Well, you know, it's -- it's hard

 4   to get my arms around your hypothetical, because I don't

 5   know the grounds on which --

 6              JUSTICE BREYER:             I'm just imagining that

 7   what has happened is that the instruction that they have

 8   given for the defendant in the death case violates

 9   Federal law, and then we send it back, and what happens

10   is that the State court says, oh, it may violate Federal

11   law all right, but it's -- the Federal court is blocked

12   from considering it because there are these two other

13   State grounds that mean that the lawyer --

14              MR. PECK:       I understand.

15              JUSTICE BREYER:             Okay.

16              MR. PECK:       But -- but the question would be

17   then, why would that be a situation like this, where the

18   trial judge -- contrary to your assumption,

19   Justice Ginsburg -- the trial judge did find that there

20   were other parts of the instructions offered by Philip

21   Morris that were incorrect on the law, and the illicit

22   profits was one of them.

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why didn't the trial judge

24   just stop there?   I mean, if this is the ruling in the

25   State --

 1                MR. PECK:     Justice --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- once the trial judge

 3   found that one of the other instructions was bad, he

 4   could have just said, I throw the whole thing out.                    Why

 5   did he go to all the trouble of going into this, the

 6   governing one?

 7                MR. PECK:     This is -- this is a process.

 8   Counsel in the case in a trial in Oregon can offer

 9   instructions every -- a proffered instruction up to the

10   point when the jury is instructed under their law.                    So

11   Philip Morris had the opportunity to correct it.                 The

12   practical nature of a charge conference is that the

13   parties come in with their proposed instructions.                    The

14   plaintiffs followed the pattern instruction, which by

15   the way does not require enumeration.

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:           You -- you are

17   acknowledging that the trial court did not apply the

18   rule --

19                MR. PECK:     The -- it's not a rule of trial

20   procedure.   It's a rule of appellate review.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, I -- yes,

22   that's exactly right.      And I think the purpose for the

23   rule is to avoid confusion about the ground of decision

24   for the trial court.      If you have got two errors, and

25   she says the instruction's no good, on appellate review


                                       33

 1   you don't know which basis was at issue.                  There is no

 2   doubt here the basis on which the trial court was

 3   ruling, is there?

 4               MR. PECK:        I believe there is -- there --

 5   first of all the trial judge rejected this instruction

 6   on multiple grounds, and made it clear that the illicit

 7   profits request was contrary to the Oregon statute that

 8   sets up the criteria.        She found other parts confusing

 9   and contradictory.      But -- and -- but there are two

10   things that I think are significant here.

11                You have to look at what was discussed

12   here.   The trial judge, if you turn to 21a of the joint

13   appendix:   "We are not here to punish for other

14   plaintiffs' harms.      We are here to punish, if we are

15   here to punish at all, for the conduct that caused harm

16   to Jesse Williams on or after September 1, 1988."                 This

17   sounds very much like an acceptance of the rule that

18   Philip Morris was advocating.

19               On 19a she says:              "These punitive damages

20   are not designed to compensate for other plaintiffs who

21   are not here. " On 20a there is a colloquy; she

22   expresses her belief that the risk is adequately guarded

23   against, suggests language to express that, and asks:

24   "Does that get you where you need to be?"

25               That's when Philip Morris's counsel says


                                         34

 1   "Okay."   She had every reason to believe that she had

 2   satisfied it.     She then follows up.

 3               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Do we give any weight in

 4   the case to the fact that the instruction that the

 5   Petitioners now request and the rule had not really been

 6   announced clearly as of the time of this trial?                 It's

 7   not exactly a new rule, but let's -- for our sake we

 8   will call it a new rule.           Does that have any weight?

 9               MR. PECK:        I don't think it does.

10               JUSTICE STEVENS:              But it does in our cause

11   and prejudice jurisprudence.              In habeas, which is also a

12   civil action --

13               MR. PECK:        I understand.

14               JUSTICE STEVENS:              -- we say there is an

15   overarching Federal principle that allows; because of

16   cause and prejudice, we can consider the Federal issue.

17   We do that all the time.           Those cases weren't raised by

18   the Petitioner, but it seems to me they're quite

19   relevant here, especially when you consider the

20   importance of the constitutional issue, which was not

21   really -- let's face it -- clear to counsel on either

22   side of the aisle or to the trial judge.

23               MR. PECK:        Well, here's the reason why I

24   think in the context of this record, and -- and this

25   litigant, it is not significant.                 And that is, if you

 1   look at 21a, the appendix in our -- our merit brief,

 2   there we have Philip Morris in another smoker trial in

 3   Oregon offering up a requested instruction on this

 4   issue.   This is in 2002, so it's well before this

 5   Court's decision in this case.

 6               It's even before State Farm v. Campbell, and

 7   the requested instruction says, one sentence: "You are

 8   not to impose punishment for harms suffered by persons

 9   other than the plaintiff before you."

10               JUSTICE STEVENS:              But the trial judge didn't

11   have the benefit of -- of the ruling that this Court has

12   subsequently made on that point.                 The trial judge in

13   fact here said:     Now, if you can give me a case, then I

14   will give you an instruction; you can't give me a case.

15   And she was right.

16               MR. PECK:        But she -- but that's actually

17   not the same issue that she asked that on.                   Counsel

18   cited page 17a of the joint appendix for that question.

19   And if you look at the bottom of 16a, her question:

20   "Let me stop first and go back to the proportionality

21   point you are making. " This is the ratio point, the

22   second guidepost of BMW v. Gore.                 She says:    "Is there

23   case law that says the trial court shall, in order to

24   have a constitutional instruction, tell the jury about

25   proportionality?"     And this is where he says:                It's


                                         36

 1   addressed post-verdict.          She asks:           Is there any case

 2   law; and she says:      No, I'm not going to go there.               I'm

 3   not going to go where no judge has gone before, because

 4   she did not want to be reversed.

 5                 So she is trying to be careful, and I think

 6   you have to credit the Oregon --

 7                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, but I -- it sounds

 8   to me like that you are confirming my concerns.

 9                 MR. PECK:      No.      I -- I think that what she

10   said is as to the proportionality issue.                  On the other

11   issue, she even returns to it later when Philip Morris

12   bring up a different issue with respect to punitive

13   damages.

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Oh.      Oh, you're -- you are

15   saying that if our law had been clear at the time, that

16   she still wouldn't have given the instruction?

17                 MR. PECK:      No.      I'm saying that she thought

18   she was complying with that.              She stated on the record

19   that:    We are not here to punish for other plaintiffs'

20   harms.     Later on that other issue, if you look at 28a --

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So your -- your contention

22   is, is that this trial court and the counsel in the case

23   had all the guidance necessary to give the correct

24   instruction --

25                 MR. PECK:      She --

 1              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- before -- before we

 2   even announced the rule?

 3              MR. PECK:      She seemed to accept -- she

 4   accepted the point before you announced the rule, and

 5   the Oregon Court of Appeals ruling in the Estate of

 6   Schwarz case where they offered that one-sentence

 7   instruction, reversed the verdict, in part because that

 8   instruction they said should have been given.                So they

 9   anticipated this Court's rule.             I think --

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 To move -- to move

11   from the trial court to the appellate court, if you are

12   correct that there is this routine, clear rule of State

13   procedure, why would the appellate court say, in its

14   head, well, I could rely on that, but I want to decide

15   this complicated, difficult rule of Federal

16   constitutional law instead?

17              MR. PECK:      Well, in fact, the -- the court

18   thought it was relying on it.            In each of the previous

19   iterations in the Oregon Court of Appeals and in the

20   Oregon Supreme Court, they cited this rule, "clear and

21   correct in all respects," in order to reject the "harm

22   to others" instruction because they said it was

23   inconsistent with State law.

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So you think we just

25   made a mistake in going ahead and reaching the Federal


                                      38
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   procedural rule that we reached because it was barred by

 2   this adequate and independent State ground that the

 3   Oregon courts had relied upon?

 4               MR. PECK:      No.      What I'm saying is that they

 5   went further then, and this is what gave this Court the

 6   authority to rule on that substantive issue.                 They said

 7   that that request was inconsistent with the Oregon

 8   statute.   And they did so -- on page 48a of the

 9   petition, where they say:          "In Williams 1, the Court of

10   Appeals concluded that the instruction was incorrect

11   under State law.   We agree."

12               And then again on page 52a, they note that:

13   "That is not correct as an independent matter of Oregon

14   law respecting the conduct of juri trials and

15   instructions" --

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But then I think

17   your --

18               MR. PECK:      But --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But I think your

20   answer -- go ahead with your but.

21               (Laughter.)

22               MR. PECK:      But then they went on to say:

23   "And nothing in due process requires us to look at this

24   differently."   That's where they made their error.                   That

25   was the constitutional mistake that the Oregon court


                                       39
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   made.   They thought they were wrong on a State ground.

 2   They thought there was no Federal issue addressing that,

 3   and so they decided that they didn't have to reach any

 4   other State law issues.        And they ignored the well

 5   preserved objections that Mrs. Williams made to the

 6   other parts of this unified instruction on punitive

 7   damages.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I'm sorry.   I

 9   still don't see that answer.            You are saying they said

10   yes, there was this rule of Oregon law, but you can

11   still reach -- there might still be a Federal due

12   process issue, so we just can't rely on that.                And if

13   that's true, then that seems to me to be a concession

14   that this is not an adequate and independent State

15   ground that would bar consideration of a Federal

16   constitutional issue.

17               MR. PECK:      What was not an adequate on

18   independent State grounds was their decision that the

19   Oregon statute which permits you to punish a misconduct

20   in order to deter others from doing that allowed

21   punishment for harm to non-parties.

22               That part was their interpretation of the

23   statute, and if there were no due process equation here,

24   that would have been an independent State ground.                It

25   was wrong as a matter of due process.

 1               But there are other grounds, other mistakes,

 2   substantive mistakes, avoiding law in this instruction.

 3   And any trial court that gave instruction number 34,

 4   which was objected to as a whole, would have committed

 5   reversible error because they failed to follow the

 6   Oregon statute.

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I guess I think it's

 8   the more routine practice for a court, if you have a --

 9   again, as you argue -- a clear procedural rule that bars

10   addressing the substantive issue, to go ahead and rely

11   on that.   Now, if the procedural rule is difficult and

12   of uncertain application, maybe you go ahead and say,

13   well, we we're going to decide on the merits anyway.

14               But it seems to me, under your presentation,

15   it's the other way around.           It's a clear and easy

16   procedural rule, difficult Federal and State intertwined

17   constitutional rule, and yet the court says, well, I'm

18   going to do the hard work rather than the easy work.

19               MR. PECK:       I think it was natural for the

20   court to do that.    That was the issue presented to them

21   by Philip Morris.    And courts do not reach out to do

22   other issues.   They reach -- they were being solicitous

23   of Philip Morris, and they were addressing the arguments

24   that Philip Morris made.          And when they decided that

25   that inured to Mrs. Williams benefit, not to Philip

 1   Morris's benefit, then they said we don't need to

 2   address your other questions.               And I think have you to

 3   look at the Oregon Supreme Court noting in their own

 4   decision that there was no futility here.                       In fact, the

 5   last time we were here Philip Morris said the reason

 6   they needed this instruction was because of what was

 7   said at closing argument.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:            What are the elements?

 9   Imagine -- I'm trying to get help, if I were to try to

10   put pen to paper on this.            Suppose they win in this.

11   Then we will be back at the State law issue that I

12   thought was going to be there, which was the issue of --

13   you are talking about the colloquy.                       Did they give the

14   essence of the Federal mandated instruction, or didn't

15   they?     And then look how cooperative the judge was, et

16   cetera.    But that isn't before us now.

17                 What is before us now is something that

18   blocks our consideration of that or anybody's

19   consideration of that.         And imagine this is not your

20   case; imagine it is the most, you know, striking case,

21   that's why I used a death example, and we go through

22   exactly the same thing.          And then the court does exactly

23   the same thing, the State court, that happened here.

24   And now what are the words that distinguish whether the

25   court is in essence, to be colloquial, giving everybody


                                         42
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the runaround or whether the court is applying a -- an

 2   absolute, clear, you know, fair, standard of State law?

 3   Which really they should have gone into first and saved

 4   everybody a lot of trouble.

 5                MR. PECK:     I think the easiest way to look

 6   at this --

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes.

 8                MR. PECK:     -- is imagine that the statute of

 9   limitations, which now bars any such suit in Oregon,

10   were brought today, after this Court's decision in

11   Williams, and imagine that Philip Morris is the

12   defendant, and at the end of the trial they offer their

13   number 34 as it was before saying, "This Court said that

14   they had made the right choice in asking for this

15   instruction."

16                A trial court clearly would engage in

17   reversible error if they gave that instruction because

18   it materially departs from Oregon law.                  At the same

19   time, they could deny that instruction.                  They could deny

20   that instruction, and the Oregon Supreme Court would not

21   violate the mandate of this Court's decision by saying

22   that that is a correct decision on the part of the trial

23   law court because it was not clear and correct in all

24   respects.

25                And that is part of what distinguishes this.

 1   This is still a rule that has to apply to its

 2   instruction --

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:              Well, what they say is --

 4   look at the two errors they found.                  One is in saying

 5   "may" instead of "shall," and the other is in saying

 6   "illicit profit" instead of "profit."                    And they are

 7   pretty picky.    So, this is very picky, they say.                  And

 8   not only are they being picky, but they are being picky

 9   after the event.    And they could have raised it first,

10   and they have 28 cases supporting them, but none of

11   these cases is right on point because the subject matter

12   is, you know, closer bound up.               And so they put all this

13   together and say it's an unreasonable application of a

14   rule that was there.       And you say --

15              MR. PECK:        I would urge you, Justice Breyer,

16   to look at the original case in 1916, the Sorenson case.

17   There the court was face with a question:                   If there is

18   the kernel of a correct instruction in there, is that

19   adequate to ask the court to give that instruction or

20   should we insist on what they thought at the time was

21   the majority rule in the United States, that we should

22   insist on an instruction that is clear and correct in

23   all respects, and that the -- that the counsel has the

24   responsibility to provide that?               And they decided to go

25   with the clear and correct rule.                That was the debate


                                        44
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that they had, and that debate informs this one.

 2              JUSTICE BREYER:            Sorenson was the agent and

 3   the principal, the broker who was selling some land.

 4              MR. PECK:      Right.

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:            And I think in that case

 6   they also said, "By the way, you've got basically the

 7   instruction that you wanted, and you overlooked" -- no,

 8   that was the case where they said, "You overlooked in

 9   your instruction an important allegation of fact," which

10   allegation was that the guy had been rehired as a

11   broker.

12              MR. PECK:      And there's a similar distinction

13   that makes Osborne irrelevant, which counsel suggested

14   was a -- an exemplary here.

15              In Osborne, an element of the crime had not

16   been instructed upon.     That's why there didn't have to

17   be the offer of an instruction.             But the party

18   presentation principle puts the onus on counsel to do

19   so, and Philip Morris showed, in 2002, well before this

20   Court's decisions that they know how to do it when they

21   want to.

22              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Peck, are you -- are

23   you asserting that our remand order was in error?           After

24   all, it did say, "We remand this case so that the Oregon

25   Supreme Court can apply this standard we have set

 1   forth."

 2                 MR. PECK:      And I -- I'd contend, Your Honor,

 3   that the --

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:            We didn't say it was in

 5   error.     I mean, there is nothing wrong with that.

 6                 (Laughter.)

 7                 MR. PECK:      Well, I think --

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            If you say it's in error,

 9   my next question is going to be --

10                 MR. PECK:      I think the Oregon Supreme Court

11   read that decision --

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- can -- is it up to a

13   State court to sit in judgment about whether our remand

14   orders are in error or not?

15                 MR. PECK:      Well, I'm prepared to say that

16   the Oregon Supreme Court took that remand order to mean

17   that they had to have in place -- this was a procedural

18   due process decision -- that they had to have a

19   procedure that was fair, outcome neutral, applied --

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            If that's what they took it

21   to mean, they were just wrong.                I mean, that's not what

22   it says.

23                 MR. PECK:      Well, if you look --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            The opinion concludes, "As

25   the preceding discussion makes clear, we believe the

 1   Oregon Supreme Court applied the wrong constitutional

 2   standard when considering Philip Morris's appeal."                  And

 3   it goes to the constitutional issue we are talking

 4   about.

 5              MR. PECK:       When considering --

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:             "We remand so that the

 7   Oregon Supreme Court can apply the standard we have set

 8   forth," which has nothing to do with the issue we have

 9   been discussing this morning.

10              MR. PECK:       Your Honor --

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:             So it was wrong?

12              MR. PECK:       No, it was not wrong.           I don't

13   think it was wrong, and here's the reason I don't think

14   it was wrong:   You corrected the Oregon Supreme Court

15   when that thought that due process does not inform the

16   analysis on harm to non-parties.               You corrected that

17   substantive error, and that part is what they got wrong.

18              Much of this opinion said that they got lots

19   of other things right.       And so Oregon looked at it and

20   said, "Okay, we got that issue wrong, but there are

21   other problems with this instruction that are adequate

22   and independent grounds for --

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:             That's very nice, but

24   that's not what we remanded for.

25              MR. PECK:       You did not remand for that, but

 1   when this Court decides a constitutional issue of one

 2   part, it doesn't necessarily tell the court anything

 3   different.   What -- the essence of this Court's opinion

 4   is that where there's a significant risk of jury

 5   confusion, the State has to provide a procedure and has

 6   flexibility in providing that procedure.                There is no

 7   indication that the procedure for limiting instructions

 8   does not satisfy that.

 9                JUSTICE SOUTER:           The problem that I think we

10   all have is how do we guard, in effect, guard against

11   making constitutional decisions which are simply going

12   to be nullified by some clever device raising a

13   procedural issue or an issue of State law when the case

14   goes back?   Is there any way for us to ensure against,

15   in effect, a bad faith response to our decision except

16   by purporting to require the State courts to follow a

17   certain order of battle in the decision of issues before

18   them so that when the case gets to us, we can be assured

19   that there is no lurking issue that has not yet been

20   decided as a matter of State law that in effect could

21   then be resurrected to nullify our decision?               Is there

22   any way to guard against that except by telling the

23   State courts what the sequence is in which they have to

24   make decisions?

25                MR. PECK:     I believe there is.           And I


                                       48

 1   believe that it would be error to suggest to the State

 2   supreme court that they must, even though prudent,

 3   follow a specific sequence, simply because that would

 4   mean that they would have to necessarily decide every

 5   State law issue in the case --

 6                JUSTICE SOUTER:            I -- I see the problem.        I

 7   mean, that's why I raised the question, how can we

 8   ensure --

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But we do that all the

10   time in cause and prejudice cases.                  We do it all the

11   time --

12                MR. PECK:      Yes.

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- because of the

14   importance of the constitutional right.

15                MR. PECK:      I understand that, but I think

16   the adequate and independent State law ground provides

17   all the protection.      You assume, and I think properly

18   so, that State supreme courts will operate in good

19   faith.    Even in Flowers, after the fourth trip to the

20   U.S. Supreme Court, were -- Alabama Supreme Court was

21   still trusted to apply the decision.

22                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       Your -- your answer

23   is there is -- there is no way to guard against it

24   except --

25                MR. PECK:      Except --

 1                JUSTICE SOUTER:            -- by reviewing the good

 2   faith of what the court does on remand.

 3                MR. PECK:      Well, by -- by accepting that if

 4   the rule that has been imposed was invoked properly by

 5   the party that invoked it at the right time --

 6                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes.

 7                MR. PECK:      -- that it IS firmly established

 8   and regularly followed, then it should satisfy the

 9   Court --

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But it serves very little

11   interest.    Nothing the trial judge would have done,

12   nothing the plaintiff's counsel has done below, nothing

13   that the intermediate clause would have done, would have

14   -- would have been different if they had submitted what

15   they call the "correct in all respects" rule.

16                If they had filed the "correct in all

17   respects" rule and submitted that rule -- if she had

18   said, judge, I want to type a little piece of paper,

19   everything would have been the same.

20                MR. PECK:      I suggest that it would be

21   different.    I think the Oregon Supreme Court decided,

22   when they decided that there was no futility in offering

23   another one, that it would be different.                 And the fact

24   of the matter is that --

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I excluded the Oregon

 1   Supreme Court from my list of -- of participants who

 2   would have done something differently.

 3                MR. PECK:      But -- but -- but the fact of the

 4   matter is, if after closing arguments which was the

 5   trigger that Philip Morris urged upon this Court for

 6   needing this substantive rule, if after -- if after that

 7   Philip Morris's counsel had returned to the judge -- you

 8   know, they said a few things that we think would tell

 9   the jury to punish for harm to others.                   We don't think

10   the instruction is adequate.             We will give you the same

11   instruction, that one-sentence instruction like we gave

12   in Fink v. Schwarz.      I believe the court would have

13   given that instruction.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 There is, of course,

15   another way to protect our constitutional authority in

16   this case.   We are talking about procedures for

17   addressing the substantive due-process challenge to

18   a punitive damages award.           That is the second question

19   presented here.

20                If we went and granted that question and

21   considered that issue, we would have protected our

22   authority to reach that question despite the procedural

23   objections alone.     Why don't we just do that?

24                MR. PECK:      Well, Your Honor, of course, the

25   last time we were here you had a full briefing and even


                                        51
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   some argument on that.        And I -- I believe that we are

 2   prepared to stand on that briefing and argument.

 3              We do not believe the Due Process Clause is

 4   an exercise in elementary school mathematics.                    It does

 5   not tell you something about this.                  Here you have to

 6   look at the enormity of the misconduct.                    And that did --

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   I'm not asking you

 8   to argue here today the second question presented.

 9              MR. PECK:        I understand.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   But if we have some

11   concern, if there is something malodorous about the fact

12   that the Oregon Supreme Court waited until the last

13   minute to come up with this rule that was before it all

14   the time, which was a State court rule that you would

15   expect the State court to be addressing as a matter of

16   course, then -- then we -- we can avoid having to

17   address what we do in a situation, having to

18   characterize the nature of that -- that consideration,

19   simply by saying:    Look, we are going to go ahead with

20   the questions presented.          We can decide it in this case;

21   and to avoid having to reach that, we will go ahead and

22   do it.

23              MR. PECK:        Well, it's -- it's certainly

24   within this Court's power to do that.                    Philip Morris had

25   made a very harsh accusation in this case of bad faith


                                        52

 1   on the part of the Oregon Supreme Court.                   There was no

 2   sandbagging here.     The Oregon court did not act in that

 3   way.

 4              Mrs. Williams raised the State-law issues at

 5   every opportunity, which is something that Philip Morris

 6   denied in their petition but then conceded in their

 7   merit brief.   And the fact is it was before the Oregon

 8   Court of Appeals.     It was before the Oregon Supreme

 9   Court, and we even raised it before this court.

10              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                You -- in answer to the

11   Chief Justice, you are not suggesting that we should go

12   ahead and decide the second question when there has been

13   no briefing on it?

14              MR. PECK:         I am not suggesting that you

15   decide the question, but I recognize the Court has the

16   power to do so.   Mapp v. Ohio came to this Court as a

17   First Amendment case and came out as a Fourth Amendment

18   case.

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I -- I thought --

20   Mr. Peck, I thought you just told me that there has been

21   full and adequate briefing on that question.

22              MR. PECK:         I believe we had full and

23   adequate briefing.      We may not have had an opportunity

24   to fully argue the case, and it's up for you to decide

25   whether or not you -- you have enough on that.

 1                 I thank you.

 4                 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO

 5                      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 6                 MR. SHAPIRO:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 7   Justice Breyer asked about these various cases from

 8   Oregon, whether they provided guidance and a warning

 9   here.   And counsel referred to three cases, Reeve,

10   Owings and then Sorenson.           If you look at those cases,

11   you will see there were simple instructions proposed on

12   a single topic that were infected with an error

13   throughout.

14                 And the court said if there is any valid

15   proportion of this instruction, it was covered by

16   something that was said to the jury already.                 So there

17   was no harm in not giving that instruction.

18                 That is certainly not our case.               We have a

19   separately numbered paragraph dealing with the

20   Constitution, which is quite apart from the statutory

21   factors.

22                 Now, counsel referred to the charge actually

23   given by the court as if it provided some protection

24   against punishment for harm to nonparties.                 If you read

25   that instruction, far from providing the protection that


                                        54

 1   the -- this Court said was obligatory, it invited global

 2   punishment.     It told the jury they could return any

 3   punitive-damage award up to one hundred million dollars.

 4   Lo and behold, they come up with eighty million dollars,

 5   right within the suggested range of this charge.               And

 6   there was no --

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Which portion of the

 8   charge specifically are you referring to?

 9                 MR. SHAPIRO:         This is page 37a of our joint

10   appendix.     The -- the court concludes the amount of

11   punitive damages you assess may not exceed the sum of

12   one hundred million dollars.              And that, of course, was

13   the zone of reasonableness that the jury inferred from

14   this, suggesting a global punishment to the jury with no

15   protection.

16                 Now this Court said that that protection has

17   to be provided.     The Court said the State must insist,

18   that the State must give assurance, and it's an

19   important constitutional right, as Justice Kennedy said.

20   I don't think the State court --

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:            What is your response to

22   the Chief Justice's suggestion that maybe we should

23   reach the issue of due process on the amount?

24                 MR. SHAPIRO:         We wouldn't oppose that

25   because this is clearly excessive under what the Court


                                         55

 1   said in State Farm:     Where there is substantial

 2   compensatory damages, one to one is something of a norm.

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I wasn't asking to

 4   you argue it, either but I mean I suppose the procedure

 5   the parties would prefer, if we were interested in that,

 6   would be for us to grant the second question and then

 7   have the normal briefing in consideration.

 8               MR. SHAPIRO:         Oh, that -- that -- yes,

 9   certainly, that -- that -- that is true.                  I -- I would

10   comment, too, on Justice Breyer's question about what is

11   the ultimate test here.

12               The Court has stated various criteria and

13   opinions over the last century, but the -- the key ideas

14   are?   Was it an ambush, something that couldn't be

15   anticipated?

16               JUSTICE BREYER:            I mean I will tell you my

17   subjective reaction going through these 38 cases is they

18   are not quite in point, but they really take away the

19   idea of the bad faith, particularly because the first

20   time what the judge said, which I didn't understand its

21   significance then, but the judge said:                  Well, since the

22   first part of that paragraph was in -- was in error

23   anyway, I don't have to reach the question of whether

24   there were other mistakes under State law in the rest of

25   the instruction.   They did say that the first time, I


                                       56

 1   think.

 2                MR. SHAPIRO:         Oh, yes, but this is the first

 3   time the Court has ever taken this "correct in all

 4   respects" rule and extended it to a completely different

 5   topic, U.S. constitutional law in a separately numbered

 6   paragraph.    And we had no notice that this had to be

 7   broken out on a separate piece of paper.                     If we did, we

 8   would have broken it out on a separate piece of paper.

 9   It's just like Lee against Kemna where the Court said --

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What about this point

11   that was made that in 2002 that is exactly what Philip

12   Morris did, give one simple, precise instruction?

13                MR. SHAPIRO:         Well, no, that instruction was

14   not harm to nonparties.         That was harm for out-of-State

15   injuries.    It was a different issue.                   And it's true the

16   lawyers there did break up their instructions

17   differently, but the pattern instruction --

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Is it -- is it true that

19   they gave one simple sentence stating their position on

20   -- on what harm to others, how that --

21                MR. SHAPIRO:         No.      That's not true.            That

22   case did not accept our instruction.                     It did not.     It

23   accepted the State Farm instruction, which said that

24   there can't be punishment for out-of-State harm.

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But -- but was the

 1   instruction stated in a -- in a single paragraph, but

 2   all the other requests to charge were broken out?

 3               MR. SHAPIRO:         Yes.       This -- this State Farm

 4   instruction was broken out.            That's an option for

 5   lawyers.   But under the pattern instruction, it's quite

 6   proper to put them all in one instructional basket.

 7   That's what the form instructions said, and that's what

 8   both parties here did.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

10   The case is submitted.

11               MR. SHAPIRO:         We thank the Court.
