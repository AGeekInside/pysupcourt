 6                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. HORNE

 7                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                  MR. HORNE:    Mr. Chief Justice and may it

 9   please the Court:

10                  I'd like to start picking up on a question

11   asked by Justice Ginsburg on the Rees case.

12   The Rees case is pre-AEDPA.            If there is one thing that

13   Congress had in mind when it passed AEDPA, the

14   Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, it is

15   that the death penalty process needs to be speeded up,

16   and habeas should not result in undue delays to give

17   effect --

18                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         You -- you don't think that

19   AEDPA would alter the outcome of Rees?                Do you think

20   Rees would come out the other way after AEDPA?

21                  MR. HORNE:    Well, I think that Rees didn't

22   really deal with our issue, which is competence to -- to

23   aid counsel.

24                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         That's a different point.

25                  MR. HORNE:    Yes, I agree, Your Honor, but I


                                       3

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   thought it -- it would be relevant to point out that it

 2   was pre-AEDPA.

 3                  And then, on that point, this Court has said

 4   several times that habeas should not be used to grant

 5   indefinite stays.    In fact, there -- even pre-AEDPA, in

 6   the Barefoot case, this Court said that habeas is not a

 7   time to retry a case and even less is it a time to grant

 8   indefinite stays.

 9                  So the sentence with, "even less," followed

10   the sentence with, "not."         So it was even less than not

11   that it should grant permanent stays.

12                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Tell me how you define

13   indefinite stays, meaning are you okay with the six

14   months to a year stay, for a court to try to get someone

15   back to competence, assuming that there is a claim in

16   which the defendant's information is necessary?

17                  MR. HORNE:    Yes, Your Honor.       We agree with

18   the Ohio position.     In the -- in the American

19   Psychiatric brief, I think it's page 10, note 20, they

20   said that up to 90 percent of the cases are solved in 6

21   to 9 months.    And I think that, if this Court set a

22   standard of no more than a year for the successive

23   stays, that would give some guidance to the courts.

24                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So how do you deal with

25   Justice Kagan's earlier question of what difference does


                                       4

 1   it make if the person's still necessary -- or the

 2   information -- potential information is still necessary,

 3   what makes it unnecessary after a year?

 4                  MR. HORNE:    Because I think the -- the

 5   consequence of AEDPA is that a balance has to be drawn

 6   between the fact that there has to be finality.            In

 7   fact, the -- this Court has said the purposes of AEDPA

 8   include finality, comity, federalism, and reduction of

 9   delays in death sentence cases.            There needs to be a

10   balance between that and the -- the need to have a

11   competent defendant, if we can have one, in a case where

12   the testimony is necessary.

13                  This Court has said several times -- I was

14   going to mention also the Heinze case, where this Court

15   thinks that -- very clearly, that stays cannot be

16   indefinite.    So -- so I think it would be very helpful

17   for this Court to give a guideline to the courts and say

18   the way to balance this is that, if they get the time in

19   which 90 percent of the cases are -- are --

20                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         But those cases didn't

21   establish a limit on how long states needed to take to

22   adjudicate claims.     They just said a district court

23   should put in conditions that move things along --

24                 MR. HORNE:    Yes.       That's correct,

25   Your Honor.

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           -- that -- that require

 2   defendants to press their claims within a reasonable

 3   time that required periodic updates, that required

 4   monitoring by the court, but it didn't set an artificial

 5   end time.   It just said you can't just do an open-ended

 6   stay and not give conditions to comply with.           Why should

 7   this be treated differently?

 8                MR. HORNE:    Your Honor, we think it would be

 9   helpful -- and we agree with Ohio on this -- we think it

10   would be helpful if the Court gave some kind of a

11   standard, so that there would be some guidance and

12   uniformity, and so that -- so that courts did not get

13   around this Court's --

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           How -- how would you

15   define that standard?     What standard do you suggest?

16                MR. HORNE:    The standard we would suggest

17   would be that -- that 6 to -- 6 to 9 months would be the

18   standard, and certainly no more than a year; that it

19   would be in months and not years, including not just the

20   first stay, but any successive stays.

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:         In all cases?

22                MR. HORNE:    In all cases.         In all cases

23   where a stay was appropriate.           Now, in the record-based

24   case, no stay is appropriate.

25                JUSTICE BREYER:         What if the -- it might be


                                     6

 1   unusual, but you can't try a person who's not competent.

 2   You can't try him.

 3                MR. HORNE:     That's correct, Your Honor.

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:          So what about -- and now,

 5   he's been tried, and he's been convicted and been

 6   appealed and gone through the procedures.            But some case

 7   could arise where, in habeas, they made like a prima

 8   facie showing or a -- convinced the judge that there

 9   really is a very good chance here, or maybe even I think

10   it's probable that the basic trial was unfair, to the

11   point where it's like not having a trial.

12                What about in that situation, if it ever

13   arises?   I mean, should we leave the door open just for

14   that possibility?

15                MR. HORNE:     I think the answer to that is

16   no, Your Honor, because the assumption -- once -- once

17   the conviction has occurred, the presumptions shift.           In

18   the criminal trial, all the presumptions are in favor of

19   the defendant.   The case has to prove -- the state has

20   to prove its case --

21                JUSTICE BREYER:          I have that.   That's why I

22   put in the possibility that, on the basis of what's

23   presented to me, the judge, I think I have so much

24   without this defendant's testimony here suggesting it

25   was unfair, that maybe the presumption should shift

 1   back.   I'm -- that's what's worrying me in the back of

 2   my mind, that there could be such a case.          There have

 3   been in history.

 4                MR. HORNE:     Well, this Court said in Daniels

 5   that the presumption is that the conviction was valid,

 6   and it becomes the burden of the petitioner to overturn

 7   that -- or the burden of the prisoner to overturn

 8   that --

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:          Which he can't do, if he's

10   not competent.

11                MR. HORNE:     Sorry.

12                JUSTICE ALITO:        If there is a time limit --

13   if there is a time limit of 6 to 9 months --

14                MR. HORNE:     Yes.

15                JUSTICE ALITO:        -- at what point does it

16   begin to run?    Does it begin to run at the time when the

17   petitioner moves for a stay, even if no effort was made

18   prior to that to restore the petitioner to competency?

19                MR. HORNE:     I would believe the time would

20   begin to run with the treatment because the basis for

21   the 6 to 9 months was what was in the amicus brief

22   against us by the American Psychiatric Association

23   indicating that, in 6 to 9 months, almost 90 percent of

24   the cases are cured.     So we -- we needed to have some

25   basis to suggest a standard to the Court.

 1               JUSTICE ALITO:       No, but my question is this:

 2   Suppose that no effort has been made by counsel to

 3   provide -- to obtain treatment for the petitioner to

 4   restore the petitioner to competency prior to the point

 5   when a motion is made to stay the proceeding.             The 6

 6   to -- month period would still begin to run at the time

 7   when the motion for the stay is made?             Or would it begin

 8   to run at some earlier point or some later point?

 9               MR. HORNE:    Your Honor, I would think, if

10   the motion is made and the other requirements are shown,

11   that it -- that the prisoner's testimony is essential,

12   then -- and that it's not a record-based case, then I

13   would think the 6 to 9 months would begin to run when

14   treatment begins because that's our basis for the

15   standard we are suggesting.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              When treatment

17   begins after some sort of initial hearing, right?

18               MR. HORNE:    That's correct, Your Honor.

19               When the court -- if the court grants the

20   motion for the temporary stay, and presumably treatment

21   would begin right away, or perhaps treatment has been

22   ongoing, but from that point on, we suggest a 6 to 9

23   months standard.

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          In which cases would you

25   say the defendant's ability to assist counsel is

 1   necessary?   On what issues?         You say that -- that if --

 2   the assistance has to be necessary to a fair

 3   adjudication.

 4                MR. HORNE:    Yes, Your Honor.

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          In what cases would that

 6   be so?

 7                MR. HORNE:    We have difficulty coming up

 8   with cases at that stage of the proceeding, Your Honor,

 9   because presumably the information the prisoner would

10   have would be known to others, especially if it's newly

11   discovered evidence, that would typically be from

12   outside, such as a -- somebody admitting -- somebody

13   else admitting to the crime, DNA evidence, something of

14   that sort.

15                It -- it appears to us highly unlikely that

16   the prisoner has information that he didn't disclose

17   earlier when he was competent in the state proceedings

18   and in the post-conviction proceedings at the state

19   level, so we think it would be very, be a very rare

20   case, Your Honor.

21                But we are prepared to admit that, if a

22   showing were made that his testimony is necessary, that

23   a 6 to 9 month temporary stay be granted, as long as --

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Why is it -- I don't

25   mean to be nit-picking, but why is it 6 to 9 months?              8

 1   months -- I mean, why isn't it 6 months?                Or 9 months?

 2   I don't understand why there's --

 3                MR. HORNE:      We had to find something to

 4   suggest to the Court, and so we took it out of the --

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So 6 months?   Or 9

 6   months?   What does it mean to be 6 to 9 months?

 7                MR. HORNE:      Oh, I agree, Your Honor.             Then

 8   it should be 9 months because that's the point at which

 9   the American Psychiatric Association says almost

10   90 percent of the cases are solved.

11                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And if it isn't solved

12   after 9 months, then what?

13                MR. HORNE:      Then the case proceeds --

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             If competency cannot be

15   restored?

16                MR. HORNE:      Correct, Your Honor, then the --

17   then the case proceeds, which was the --

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Based on the record.

19                MR. HORNE:      Based on the record -- well, if

20   it's record based, there should be no continuance at

21   all.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, I don't really

23   understand why the American Psychiatric Association said

24   6 to 9 months, too.      I mean, 90 percent are cured within

25   9 months, right?

 1               MR. HORNE:     Yes, Your Honor.        That's

 2   correct.

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:          So you don't have to follow

 4   them in that non sequitur, it seems to me.

 5               MR. HORNE:     No, we don't, Your Honor.        We --

 6   we're just suggesting there should be a guideline, and

 7   we had to find some basis for the guideline.

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Because they are not

 9   lawyers, right?   They are psychiatrists.

10               MR. HORNE:     That's correct, Your Honor.

11               (Laughter.)

12               JUSTICE ALITO:        Well, what happens if, after

13   9 months, mental health experts come in and they say

14   there's a 90 percent chance of restoring the petitioner

15   to competency in another 9 months or another 3 months or

16   another month.

17               MR. HORNE:     Your Honor, we're suggesting

18   that the Court should draw a line to guide the other

19   courts, so that -- so that -- because once you allow one

20   additional period, there can be successive additional

21   periods, and then it becomes an indefinite stay.

 2   for.    And once we make it clear, it shouldn't go on

 3   forever.   And -- and why can't we trust them to do their

 4   job?

 5                 MR. HORNE:     Well, this Court in Heinze said

 6   that pre-AEDPA, the courts had discretion to grant

 7   stays, but AEDPA circumscribe -- circumscribes that

 8   discretion, and so I think this Court needs to give

 9   guidance to the courts as to the --

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:          You mean it shouldn't be

11   indefinite. The object of this is you're trying to give

12   -- like you would with any witness who's not around at

13   the moment, you're trying to produce a hearing that will

14   reach a result with this witness.             And if you think,

15   after a reasonable period of time, that witness will

16   recover and be available, fine.            And if there is no hope

17   of that, forget it.      I mean -- you know, something like

18   that.

19                 MR. HORNE:     I understand, Your Honor.        Our

20   suggestion is -- is that the Court give a guideline.              I

21   understand Your Honor's position.

22                 I do want to save some time for rebuttal.               I

23   just wanted to make one quick point about this -- that

24   the -- that the witness has to be essential to the case

25   being made.   It was suggested in the Ohio case that --

 1   that if there were a possibility that he could be

 2   helpful, that that would be sufficient.

 3               But the -- the American Psychiatric

 4   Association and the ABA both agree that there has to be

 5   a particularized and substantial case made that the

 6   witness is necessary or -- or they also use the word

 7   "essential or necessary," and we think that that -- that

 8   standard should prevail.

 9               And I'd like to reserve time for rebuttal.

17               MS. O'CONNELL:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may

18   it please the Court:

19               The United States agrees with Ohio and

20   Arizona on the general framework for when no stay is

21   allowed and for when a limited stay is allowed in

22   Federal post-conviction proceedings.             I'd like to

23   provide the Court with a practical example of how a

24   limited stay might work, since that seems to have been

25   of some concern.

 1                 An analogous Federal statute is 18 U.S.C.,

 2   Section 4241, the Federal competency hearing statute

 3   that the Court cited or provided a CF citation to in

 4   Rees.   That provides the framework for how a district

 5   court determines competency for a prisoner to stand

 6   trial and could provide a framework for how a district

 7   court should proceed with competency hearing in a case

 8   where it would be appropriate.

 9                 Under Section 4241, the criminal defendant,

10   if he is found incompetent, the district court may give

11   an initial period of up to 4 months for him to be

12   treated to determine whether he can come back to

13   competency.

14                 If he cannot regain his competency at the

15   end of that 4-month period, then the court can grant an

16   additional reasonable extension of that time if the

17   doctors say that there is a reasonable probability that

18   this prisoner can be restored to competence.

19                 That could provide a framework, if that's

20   what this Court is looking to do, for showing district

21   courts how they could enter a limited stay.

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, what's a reasonable

23   extension?

24                 MS. O'CONNELL:       Well --

 1   months?

 2               MS. O'CONNELL:          I think we agree on the

 3   outer end that --

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I was with you.     It seemed

 5   to me you had something really, really clear and solid,

 6   until you said, "reasonable extension."

 7               MS. O'CONNELL:          Well, but this is what

 8   district courts do.      They do it whenever a competency

 9   motion is filed in a Federal criminal trial, and we

10   agree with the -- the outside limit of about a year.              It

11   depends on the -- the interests at stake -- the

12   interests at stake in the state in proceeding with its

13   judgment and the interests in finality and whether the

14   doctors think that there's actually a chance that this

15   prisoner could be restored to competence if they work a

16   little harder.

17               If the -- if the evidence is crucial or

18   necessary or there's some indication that we want to --

19   to work hard to get this information from the prisoner,

20   we would go for a little bit longer.               But at some point,

21   that attempt to restore the prisoner to competency has

22   to end and the -- and the proceedings should move

23   forward based on the best evidence that's available.

24               JUSTICE KAGAN:          But, Ms. O'Connell, where

25   does that outer limit come from?             You suggested looking


                                      16

 1   to that statute as an analogy, but there would be no

 2   outer limit in application of that statute, would there?

 3                MS. O'CONNELL:       There's not.    But -- but at

 4   some point, we do give up, and the district courts have

 5   discretion to determine how long that would be, and --

 6   and, again, we -- we propose an outer limit of about a

 7   year, but it's up to the district court in that

 8   particular circumstance, to see how hard they want to

 9   work to try to get that evidence into the proceeding.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Is that any different from

11   what the defendants are arguing here?

12                MS. O'CONNELL:       Well --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:         They're saying, you know,

14   give a -- give a temporary stay and extend it as long

15   as -- as you need to.

16                MS. O'CONNELL:       Well, the --

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:         So you're taking their

18   position.

19                MS. O'CONNELL:       No.    The difference between

20   our position and that position is that if, after a

21   reasonable period of time, the prisoner cannot be

22   restored to competence, the claim should move forward

23   without him, using the best evidence that's available.

24               That's because, when we arrive at

25   post-conviction proceedings, we have a conviction and a


                                    17

 1   sentence that have been affirmed on direct appeal and


 2   are presumed to be valid, and although it's a valid


 3   consideration for the district court to take into


 4   account whether the prisoner is competent and could


 5   assist his counsel has a role in these proceedings,

 6   there's no right for the prisoner to be competent during

 7   the post-conviction proceedings.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               You said shortly

 9   after a reasonable period of time.               I thought you were

10   saying after a year.    I think it's -- it's some guidance

11   to say no more than a year.          It's really no guidance to

12   say after a reasonable time.

13               MS. O'CONNELL:        Yeah.     We -- we think the

14   outer limit should be presumptively about a year.               It's

15   not to say that the United --

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           You're talking about a

17   very narrow range of cases because I take it your

18   principal position is it -- it would be unusual that the

19   defendant needs to be competent in order for the lawyer

20   effectively to represent him on habeas.               So under what

21   circumstances do you think competency matters, so that

22   the lawyer should not be expected to go on without a

23   competent client?

24               MS. O'CONNELL:        Justice Ginsburg, we think

25   that it would not be an abuse of discretion for the

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   district court to allow the defendant to try to regain

 2   his competence and help his lawyer with the proceedings

 3   if there is some opportunity for him to present evidence

 4   or to present new claims in his proceeding.                 That may be

 5   the case.   It will often be the case for a Section 2255

 6   petitioner.

 7                 It is his first round of Federal

 8   post-conviction proceedings.               It may be his first

 9   opportunity to present an ineffective assistance of

10   counsel claim.   And in those circumstances, if he has

11   something that -- if the lawyer has something that he

12   wants the prisoner's assistance with or may need

13   testimony from -- from the prisoner, we think the

14   district court has discretion to allow a stay -- a

15   limited stay to allow the prisoner to regain his

16   competence.   But --

17                 JUSTICE ALITO:         So it's not limited to cases

18   where the review is restricted to the record?

19                 MS. O'CONNELL:         Right.         In those cases, we

20   think that no stay is appropriate, that it would be an

21   abuse of discretion to enter a stay.                 AEDPA doesn't

22   tolerate delay without a justification, and if it's a

23   record-based claim, like a state prisoner, where he's

24   barred by Section 2254(d) in Pinholster from bringing in

25   new evidence and that the review is strictly limited to


                                       19

 1   the state court record, then there is no role for the

 2   prisoner to play.

 3                  And it would be an abuse of discretion for

 4   the district court to stay the proceedings in an effort

 5   to bring him back.

 6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              What is the standard

 7   when the district court is deciding whether to stay the

 8   proceedings?    We've heard a number of them, plausible

 9   basis in the record, truly plausible, Iqbal.                  Which --

10   which -- what is the government's position on the

11   appropriate standard?

12                  MS. O'CONNELL:       We -- we think that the

13   district court has discretion to grant a stay when the

14   prisoner's participation could be -- he could provide a

15   useful source of evidence or guidance in the

16   proceedings.

17                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              "Could"?

18                  MS. O'CONNELL:       Yes.

19                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Your standard is

20   "could provide"?

21                  MS. O'CONNELL:       Yes.     In those

22   circumstances, we don't think the district court would

23   abuse its discretion by allowing him an opportunity to

24   regain his competence.

25                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         "Could provide" means might

 1   provide; is that it?     Might?

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         So just a possibility --

 4                 MS. O'CONNELL:       Right.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         -- that's all it takes?

 6                 MS. O'CONNELL:       If there is an opportunity

 7   for this prisoner to present new claims or new evidence

 8   in his Section 2255 proceeding, that we don't think it's

 9   an abuse of discretion for the district court to allow

10   him that opportunity.

11                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         But you cap it by saying

12   as long as the discretion is not exercised for more than

13   a year?

14                 MS. O'CONNELL:       That's right.     We think it

15   has to be just a limited stay.           We -- the United States

16   would be opposed in any circumstances to a stay that's

17   conditioned only on the prisoner's ability to regain his

18   competence.   At some point, if he can't, we move

19   forward.

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Would that standard have

21   been met in both of these cases?            Meaning, Carter's

22   claim -- and the one that concerns me the most is why he

23   was excluded from trial and what if he did or did not do

24   with his attorneys afterwards.           And Gonzales is a

25   slightly different case.       But would your position be


                                     21

 1   that, in both cases, there was enough?

 2               MS. O'CONNELL:       Not just that there was

 3   enough, but that the Federal court would be prohibited

 4   from considering further information --

 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         No, no, no.      My question

 6   was, on the facts of both of these cases, was there a

 7   basis for granting the stay with respect to --

 8               MS. O'CONNELL:       No.

 9               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- their conditions?

10               MS. O'CONNELL:       No.    Because both -- all of

11   the claims involved in these two cases are limited to

12   the state court record and Federal post-conviction

13   proceedings under Section 24 -- 2254(d) and Pinholster.

14               This prisoner could not provide any new

15   evidence to his client that could be introduced at court

16   or that could be relied on by the Federal court.

17               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Neither Carter or

18   Gonzales?

19               MS. O'CONNELL:       That's right.

20               JUSTICE BREYER:         Why would we, in this kind

21   of case, as opposed to, say, some other case, where a

22   witness is missing and it's crucial?             The district court

23   does have authority to grant stays.             And we haven't

24   said, but no longer than a year.          Why do we say, but if

25   they do it in a reasonable time?

 1                  If they abuse their discretion, there is

 2   mandamus, or there are other ways of controlling the

 3   discretion.    Why are we suddenly here, in this case,

 4   imposing a fixed number of days?

 5                  I mean, the reason, of course, that the

 6   Psychological Association says 6 months to 9 months is

 7   they have different studies.              In some places, it's 6

 8   months; in some places, it's 9 months.              And -- and so

 9   why are we picking a number out of a hat here, when we

10   don't elsewhere?

11                  MS. O'CONNELL:       Well, the Court doesn't have

12   to do that.    We're -- we were suggesting a year as the

13   outer limit, just because that is sort of what the amici

14   say is sort of the outer limit for when people will be

15   restored to competency, if they are going to be able to

16   be restored; but the Court doesn't have to -- to set an

17   outer limit.

18                  I mean, it -- it -- but it -- what we are

19   most --

20                  JUSTICE BREYER:         It should, but it should be

21   something like reasonable or -- or don't abuse your

22   discretion or -- I mean, at the moment, I'm just not

23   seeing why this is different than 10,000 other kinds of

24   instances where we set that kind of limit, rather than

25   days.

 1                 MS. O'CONNELL:       Well, perhaps it isn't.         But

 2   to -- to go along with that analogy, if a different

 3   piece of evidence or a different witness were

 4   unavailable, we wouldn't allow the district court to

 5   hold up the proceedings indefinitely to wait for that

 6   witness.   And so it should be no different when the

 7   petitioner --

 9   you're not suggesting that don't abuse your discretion

17   competence.

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Why should the Court do

19   that?   Why should it provide any guidance if, as you

20   say, in both of these cases, the review is limited to

21   the record, and we would never get to the question of,

22   if it weren't reviewed, limited to the record, then

23   what?

24                 MS. O'CONNELL:       That would be a perfectly

25   appropriate -- also a perfectly appropriate way to

 7                ORAL ARGUMENT OF LETICIA MARQUEZ

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 9                MS. MARQUEZ:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                I'd like to begin by correcting a statement

12   by the United States.      Mr. Gonzales is not precluded by

13   2254(d) or Pinholster.     Mr. Gonzales has identified

14   several ineffective assistance of counsel claims that

15   would be ripe for review under this Court's decision in

16   Martinez and, therefore, would be available in district

17   court.   And we would also be able to present new

18   evidence.

19                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Ms. Marquez, could you tell

20   me, if it were the case that somebody was limited to the

21   state court record, what's your best example of a case

22   in which, nonetheless, a stay would be appropriate; in

23   which, nonetheless, consultation with the client was

24   necessary for a full and fair adjudication?

25                Because I have been trying to think of


                                    25

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   examples, and -- you know, I'm not doing very well,

 2   quite honestly.    So what's your best one?

 3                  MS. MARQUEZ:     Well, in our particular case,

 4   we -- we raise several claims in habeas -- in habeas

 5   proceedings.    We raise guilt claims, and we also raise

 6   sentencing claims.     And it is often the case with our

 7   clients that, at their direction, they choose not to --

 8   not to pursue or do not want to pursue sentencing claims

 9   and want to only pursue guilt claims.

10                  So those are claims that are strictly on the

11   record.   And under the ABA guidelines, the client is the

12   ultimate decisionmaker as to where the particular

13   representation is going.        So that is a huge,

14   all-encompassing decision that a client needs to make as

15   to the ultimate outcome of his or her case.

16                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Well, that is that

17   you're -- that seems like almost a due process argument,

18   that in every single case, you have to grant a stay.

19   You're -- you're parting from the Respondent in Carter,

20   and you are making a broader argument.

21                  MS. MARQUEZ:     Well, no, Your Honor, where it

22   does -- just an example of where, if there is a client

23   in -- in that particular situation --

24                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         No incompetent client,

25   presumably, can help you make those decisions.           So tell


                                      26

 1   me, are you saying that, in every single case, the

 2   client is entitled to a stay?

 3                  MS. MARQUEZ:     No, Your Honor, we're not

 4   saying in every single case.

 5                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So why does that

 6   situation give you an entitlement, if it's not in every

 7   single case?

 8                  MS. MARQUEZ:     The -- that situation goes

 9   with the ABA guidelines and what an attorney's duties

10   are to maintain communication with the client.            And

11   that's just but one reason why we need a -- a competent

12   client.   But to answer your question --

13                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         Excuse me.   If the client

14   is incompetent, you -- you bring both claims, right?

15   You -- you both -- you both challenge the guilt, and you

16   challenge the sentence.

17                  MS. MARQUEZ:     That -- that is if a client is

18   incompetent.    I suppose, if that's -- if we were forced

19   to do so, we would.

20                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         So why -- why -- why is

21   it -- it is unfair to prevent -- to stop everything, so

22   that the client can tell you not to bring one of those

23   things?   I don't know why that's unfair.

24                  MS. MARQUEZ:     That's just but one -- one

25   reason why we would need a client.

 1                 But to answer Justice Kagan's question,

 2   we -- we -- there are several claims.             Ineffective

 3   assistance of counsel claims are -- are necessary for --

 4   for us to be able to talk to our client.             And -- and

 5   especially in this case, where there was an antagonistic

 6   relationship between his -- the client and the trial

 7   lawyer, that would put the situation in context, and we

 8   would able to -- be able to identify those facts.

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Why couldn't you use the

10   transcript?   Everything -- all -- all the exchanges

11   between the defendant -- defendant and the trial judge

12   are in the transcript.

13                 MS. MARQUEZ:     Well, in -- there -- there

14   are -- transcripts are -- are available and -- but there

15   are situations that are not transcribed.             In -- in

16   ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the

17   interactions between the lawyer and the client at the

18   prison, at the jail --

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         But you can't get that in,

20   right?   I mean, aren't you limited to the record?              So

21   what -- what use is it --

22                 MS. MARQUEZ:     Well --

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         -- to -- to find out these

24   little -- little secret things that your client knows,

 1               MS. MARQUEZ:        Well, as this Court held in

 2   Pinholster, not all Federal habeas claims fall within

 3   the scope of 2254(d).       And there are situations where we

 4   would be granted an evidentiary hearing.

 5               In this particular case, we have not yet

 6   been briefed our 2254(d) claims.             We are at the stage

 7   where we're going to brief merits claims, and in

 8   addition to that, we are going to brief evidentiary

 9   development in this case, where we would have to assert

10   what -- what facts need to be developed and, also, the

11   diligence standard.

12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            What in the record could

13   plausibly, certainly be seen, that would suggest that

14   your defendant has information that could be valuable?

15   Assume it's not the ABA standard, but the plausibility

16   standard or the certainty standard or something.

17               MS. MARQUEZ:        Well, there was -- there is

18   information in the record that the trial judge and our

19   client had an antagonistic relationship.             And there was

20   comments -- the trial prosecutor was interviewed -- or

21   said on the -- on the record that the judge and the

22   defendant, Mr. Gonzales, snarled and snapped at each

23   other.

24               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Well, that, you can see

25   from the record.

 1                  MS. MARQUEZ:     Right.

 2                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          What would plausibly

 3   give rise to a belief that there was some ex parte

 4   exchange between the judge and the defendant?                 Is there

 5   anything to suggest that in the record?

 6                  MS. MARQUEZ:     Well, we would -- we would

 7   suggest that the actual relationship itself, we would

 8   have to know where -- where this relationship went awry

 9   or why it is that Mr. Gonzales and the trial judge were

10   basically at each other's throats.                 The intensity --

11                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Do you have anything to

12   suggest that there had been an ex parte exchange that

13   would account for that snarling?

14                  MS. MARQUEZ:     We currently have not been

15   able to get that information from our client as to -- to

16   sit down to -- with our client and say, what happened in

17   this situation?

18                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          The district judge in

19   this case explained why he concluded that there was no

20   issue that couldn't be fairly adjudicated on the basis

21   of the record.    What was wrong with his -- his

22   explanation?    He looked at the case carefully, and he

23   said, there's nothing that can't fairly be adjudicated

24   on the record.

25                  MS. MARQUEZ:     Well, first, initially, the --

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the district court judge agreed with -- with

 2   Mr. Gonzales that there was a need for Mr. Gonzales to

 3   be competent at his habeas proceeding.                 And we actually

 4   began a course of -- of a competency determination.

 5   And -- and that is a longer record.                 Also, our client

 6   went into -- was treated at the state mental hospital.

 7                 However, the -- we believe the trial -- or

 8   the district court judge was in error when he made that

 9   finding.   The -- the trial judge did not have -- or the

10   district court judge did not have all the evidence

11   before it when -- when the district court looked at the

12   particular claims.      We were just asked to identify.              We

13   did not put forward a -- a complete briefing on that

14   issue.    And the --

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel?   I'm

16   sorry --

17                 MS. MARQUEZ:       The judge decided it just on a

18   motion.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                If -- if we think

20   it's necessary to set some objective limit on how long

21   an inherent authority could be exercised, is there any

22   reason to adopt any limit, other than the one that the

23   psychiatrists have suggested, which is, I gather, most

24   people, if they're going to, will recover competence

25   within 9 months?

 1                  MS. MARQUEZ:      Excuse me, Your Honor.

 2                  No.   We -- a year or 6 months, just by

 3   listening to the questions from the Court, seems to be

 4   problematic.    We suggest that this is all within the

 5   district court's discretion.

 6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So if we're looking

 7   for a little more guidance than that and feel the need

 8   for an objective standard, other than abuse of

 9   discretion, you don't have any number that has any basis

10   in psychiatric evidence or anything else, besides the

11   9 months?

12                  MS. MARQUEZ:      Well, Your Honor, we -- we

13   would suggest that the Court look to -- to this decision

14   in Rhines, where -- and my answer is we can look at a

15   year.   And possibly, if -- if the client is not

16   competent at the end of that year, then explore other

17   options, such as next friend or -- or perhaps

18   proceeding.

19                  But what we would do is direct the Court to

20   this Court's decision in Rhines, where stays were --

21   district courts are allowed to -- to stay proceedings,

22   so that the petitioner could -- could go back to State

23   court and exhaust.      And in -- in that decision, the

24   Court was specific as to guidelines for the district

25   court to assert its discretion, 30-day updates, make


                                       32

 1   sure that clients are not -- are not being dilatory in

 2   seeking these stays, and so forth.

 3               And the -- and there has not been a problem

 4   with Rhines stays.    The district courts have been able

 5   to handle those stays.

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Counsel, in this case,

 7   the district court denied a stay.            If this is an

 8   equitable power, how can you be comfortable that the

 9   Ninth Circuit, as an appellate court, overrode the

10   district court's equitable discretion?

11               MS. MARQUEZ:       We believe that the district

12   court was -- abused its discretion, but first, did not

13   apply the correct standard, which is essential

14   communication.   The district court erroneously decided

15   that Mr. Gonzales was not essential -- or his

16   communication was not essential to the proceedings.

17               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           But you're not claiming

18   that that issue is always in the district court's hands

19   to start with?

20               MS. MARQUEZ:       Yes, Your Honor.

21               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So please identify for

22   me what -- how we establish or set a standard so that

23   appellate courts are not overriding that at whim?

24               MS. MARQUEZ:       Well, we would -- we would

25   urge the Court to adopt the district -- or the Ninth

 1   Circuit essential communication standard, where you

 2   first have a finding of competency and then a

 3   determination of whether that client's communication is

 4   essential to the proceeding.

 5                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Oh, you're flipping it.

 6   You're saying, first, you give a stay for competence.

 7   You've determined competency first and not essentiality

 8   first?

 9                  MS. MARQUEZ:     Well, that's how the cases

10   are -- are being raised.        Always, there is a question of

11   competency, and then the courts are looking to whether

12   or not there is essentiality.

13                  I would also like to address the -- the

14   argument that the AEDPA somehow -- or AEDPA -- somehow

15   forecloses any types of stays.            The Congress recognized

16   the need for finality to be balanced against a firm

17   regard for due process and full Constitutional

18   protections.    So we are --

19                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Nobody here thinks

20   today -- no one's arguing that it prevents any kind of

21   stay today, right?

22                  MS. MARQUEZ:     I -- but I would just -- I was

23   just letting the Court know that the AEDPA does not

24   foreclose stays.    I thought I heard --

25                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              No.   I didn't

 1   understand -- I thought everybody was focusing on

 2   limitation on stays.   And surely, AEDPA is pertinent

 3   when it comes to recognizing the need for those limits,

 4   right?

 5               MS. MARQUEZ:     Exactly, Your Honor.

 6               Also, I would like to address the Court's --

 7   or the government's concern as to whether or not these

 8   cases -- or Rohan decisions, would open the floodgates

 9   to district court stays.     The -- we've pointed out in

10   our briefs on page 32, 33, the -- the few stays that

11   have actually been granted.         The district courts have

12   been handling these motions.

13               And unless there's any further questions --

14               JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, if there -- if the

15   Court were to point to some guideline as to the maximum

16   length -- or the presumptive maximum length of a stay,

17   what -- because that's the period within which there's a

18   good chance in most cases of restoring the petitioner to

19   competency -- at what point would that begin to run?

20   Would there be any obligation to begin the treatment

21   prior to the -- to the time when the motion for a stay

22   is -- is filed?

23               Now, could many years go by with the same

24   attorney representing a client, and then at the very

25   last minute -- and no effort is made to obtain treatment


                                   35

 1   that would restore the petitioner to competency, and

 2   then at the very last minute, a motion to make -- a

 3   motion for a stay is entered, and then this period of

 4   time -- 6 months, 9 months, a year, whatever it is --

 5   would begin to run?

 6               MS. MARQUEZ:        I believe there's an

 7   obligation for counsel to continue to try to effectively

 8   communicate with his client.              And once that attorney

 9   gets to a point where that incapacity forestalls that

10   attorney from being able to move forward on his case,

11   then that attorney is, at that point, under a duty to

12   raise this claim with the district court.

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, is he under duty to

15   if he doesn't?   That's the import of the question.

16               MS. MARQUEZ:        Well, that's -- that's the

17   million dollar question.        I would think that the --

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, that's why I'm

19   asking.

20               (Laughter.)

21               MS. MARQUEZ:        I -- I think the ABA

22   guidelines on ethical duties guide attorneys to -- to

23   make that decision.      And yes -- I'm sorry -- if there is

24   dilatory action on the part of the attorney, that is

25   something for the district court to consider in issuing

 1   its stay.

 2                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, here, the -- the

 3   motion -- when was the motion made?               The motion for a

 4   competency determination and a stay?

 5                 MS. MARQUEZ:     The motion in this case was

 6   made when we -- the stay was lifted in district court,

 7   and we were ordered to do -- to do merits briefing.

 8                 JUSTICE ALITO:       And when was that?        Do you

 9   remember the date, roughly?

10                 MS. MARQUEZ:     That -- that was in 2000 --

11   February 2006.

12                 JUSTICE ALITO:       And when was the initial

13   habeas petition filed in district court?

14                 MS. MARQUEZ:     It was filed in July 2000.

15                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Of 2000?

16                 MS. MARQUEZ:     Yes.

17                 JUSTICE ALITO:       So why wasn't there -- then

18   there was no obligation to do anything between 2000 and

19   2006?

20                 MS. MARQUEZ:     The counsel was attempting to

21   communicate with the -- with Mr. Gonzales the entire

22   time.    At that point, the case was stayed in district

23   court for Rhines and Ring and Summerlin determinations.

24   And --

25                 JUSTICE ALITO:       It was only after 6 years of


                                     37

 1   being unable to communicate with him, that the attorney

 2   said maybe there's a competency problem here?

 3               MS. MARQUEZ:     No.       We -- we were having

 4   difficulty with the client the entire time, since we

 5   started -- since we first got on the case.             And after --

 6   and we just thought he was a difficult client.             And

 7   after we -- we filed the amended petition, which was

 8   basically a notice pleading, the -- within a month of

 9   that, we first got in contact with mental health

10   experts, saying, there's something wrong with this guy,

11   and sought to put together his mental health history.

12               At that point, Mr. Gonzales was back in

13   state court, exhausting issues and raising Ring claims.

14   In -- in that court -- because we were stayed in

15   district court -- in that court, his post-conviction

16   counsel raised ineffective assistance -- I'm sorry,

17   competency issues -- and it was -- and it was an

18   incompetency to assist in post-conviction -- stay

19   post-conviction -- and that claim was denied.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              So did -- did he

21   begin treatment prior to the district court order on

22   Federal habeas?

23               MS. MARQUEZ:     No.       It was not until the

24   district court ordered -- or, actually, the district

25   court ordered him transported back to -- or transported


                                   38

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   to the state mental hospital.            And there, he was to be

 2   evaluated, to finally determine competency.

 3                 And while there, he was -- he was treated.

 4   And while he was being treated, he was starting to

 5   regain competency, at least to some extent.               Then

 6   treatment stopped.

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Treatment stopped because

 8   he -- he said there were side effects?

 9                 MS. MARQUEZ:     Because he had back pain.             And

10   then we began briefing on what the course of treatment

11   should be, if any.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, so how -- what

13   is this 9 months or 1 year?           The amount of time he's

14   under treatment or the amount of time from the district

15   court determination?

16                 MS. MARQUEZ:     I believe he was at the state

17   mental hospital for about 6 months, and he was being

18   evaluated.   And as -- inadvertently, then, the state

19   mental hospital began treatment.

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          The million dollar

21   question:    Assume we say you have to spend a reasonable

22   time trying to get someone to competency.               And, here,

23   there appears to have been efforts to do so.               And your

24   client is saying, I can't be treated because the drugs

25   make me sick.   So when does all of this end?


                                     39

 1                MS. MARQUEZ:      Well, first, our client did

 2   not say he couldn't be treated because -- that he

 3   couldn't be treated.     It was just these specific drugs.

 4   And we were on a course of -- of trying to figure out

 5   what, if any, other regimen was available.           And we


 6   believe that it is within the district court's --

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Well, that time has


 8   passed by now, hasn't it?        That that -- they stopped


 9   treating him?


10                MS. MARQUEZ:      They -- they quickly

11   transported him back to DOC, and he is not being treated

12   currently.

13                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          No one's continuing to

14   monitor him or trying to treat him?

15                MS. MARQUEZ:      No, Your Honor.      And we are --

16   we do not have -- he will not see us, and we do not have

17   access to medical records because we do not have a

18   current release.   And the district court did not grant

19   us an order to get those records on a consistent basis.

20   So we have no access to our client whatsoever.

21                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          I'm a little confused as

22   to -- I think the Ninth Circuit remanded, so that

23   treatment could be had.       So why has it stopped?

24                MS. MARQUEZ:      Well, we haven't moved forward

25   in district court.    We've been here appealing the

 1   decision -- or the State has appealed the decision.

 2                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

 4   remaining.

 5                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. HORNE

 6                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 7                  MR. HORNE:    Thank you, Your Honor.

 8                  I -- I need to disagree with

 9   the Solicitor General on one point about the standard.

10   The standard has to be essentiality.                The witness has to

11   be essential.    In fact, you heard my friend representing

12   Gonzales emphasize essentiality.             And it was emphasized

13   in their -- in their responsive brief, at pages 1, 2, 9,

14   10, 11, 12, 21, 30, and 39.            On all of those pages, they

15   said the witness' testimony must be essential.

16                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       General, could I ask you,

17   you have been arguing on two different axes.                One is how

18   tight the standard should be to grant any stay at all,

19   and the other is what limits there should be on how long

20   a stay can be if a stay is warranted.

21                  And I'm just curious, if I forced you to

22   prioritize, in terms of the state's interests in

23   effective habeas adjudication, which is more

24   important -- you know, cranking up the standard or

25   making sure that there is a time limit in place?

 1                 MR. HORNE:    Well, I think the first -- the

 2   first priority is that there should be no indefinite

 3   stay.   And the second priority is that there should be

 4   no stay in a records-based case.            Those are the two

 5   prongs of the Ninth Circuit decision, which we think --

 6                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       But ordered in that way,

 7   that, for you, the time limit is the more important?

 8                 MR. HORNE:    The time limit is -- is crucial,

 9   but I have to say no stay on a records-based case is a

10   matter of pretty clear law that is --

11                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Yes, I know.     But, really, I

12   said, if I forced you to prioritize between the two.

13                 (Laughter.)

14                 MR. HORNE:    I would say it can't be

15   indefinite.   That would be the first priority.           But I

16   think it's also clear from this Court's very definite

17   statements in a number of cases that -- that there

18   cannot be a stay in a records-based case.            Now --

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Opposing counsel said

20   that there is an exception for ineffective assistance of

21   counsel under our decision in Martinez.

22                 MR. HORNE:    Your Honor, in this case, the

23   district judge specifically found that there is no

24   possibility for a case of ineffective assistance of

25   counsel, that those were waived by the -- by -- when the


                                     42

 1   case was sent back to the State for additional

 2   post-conviction relief proceedings, that claim was

 3   waived.    It's in the district court's order, Appendices

 4   B and C to our -- to our petition.

 5                 And even the Ninth Circuit didn't argue

 6   that.   The Ninth Circuit argued that there was an issue

 7   as to whether there was prejudice by the judge.               But

 8   there is a very detailed analysis, again, in the

 9   district court's order, showing that every time that

10   claim was made and was claimed -- made a number of times

11   in the State proceedings, it was clear that those were

12   on-the-record comments.

13                 There was nothing secret.             There was nothing

14   ex parte.   Those were on-the-record discussions that

15   were being complained about.             And the district court

16   judge found that if there was something secret, then

17   those have been waived by -- by the petitioner because

18   he didn't bring it up in the numerous case -- times that

19   it came up at the State level, and he was talking only

20   about on-the-record comments by the trial judge.

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, General,

22   counsel.

23                 The two cases are submitted.
