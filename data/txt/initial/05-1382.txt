 5   Federation of America.

 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 8                   ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 9              GENERAL CLEMENT:            Mr. Chief Justice and may

10   it please the Court:

11              This case presents the same basic

12   constitutional question concerning the Federal

13   Partial-Birth Abortion Act as the first case.               Of

14   course, the Ninth Circuit in the decision under review

15   here went much further in invalidating the Federal act.

16   If I could begin by talking about whether what we're

17   talking about here is medical necessity or just some

18   marginal effect on the risks.            I think in order to

19   fairly understand the argument that respondents are

20   making in this case, their argument has to be a matter

21   of simply marginal risks, because one illustration of

22   this, as I indicated in the first argument, if a doctor

23   really believes that a D&X procedure is the way to go in

24   a case then there's no ban on the procedure as such.

25   What the act bans is the infliction of the D&X procedure


                                       3

 1   on a living fetus.

 2                 So if a doctor really thinks the D&X

 3   procedure is the way to go, he can induce fetal demise

 4   at the outset of the procedure.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:             But the problem with this

 6   is that there -- well, some doctors absolutely agree.                 I

 7   mean, you know, my list over here, in which I have

 8   hundreds of references from this thing, is doctor after

 9   doctor who takes the other position, and they say:

10   Look, all that we're doing here is trying to remove the

11   fetus in a single pass.          The fetus is going to die

12   anyway.     It's not viable.         We're trying to remove it in

13   a single pass, and the reason we're trying to do that is

14   if we don't, there may be bone fragments left inside the

15   womb.     There may be fetal parts left inside the womb.

16   Every time you make another pass, it turns out there's

17   an added risk of scarring or hurting the inside of the

18   womb.     If you try to induce demise through a drug

19   before, there is serious risks of introducing drugs into

20   the system.     If the woman has uterine cancer, it's a

21   serious problem of not trying to get the child out as

22   quickly as possible.        If you have preeclampsia or

23   eclampsia, where you're in a situation where the woman

24   will be dead in five minutes or 10 minutes, there could

25   be such a situation.        The doctor thinks only one thing:


                                          4

 1   Get it out as fast as possible.              All right.

 2               Now, I know there are doctors who think the

 3   contrary.   There's lots of testimony of the doctors who

 4   think roughly along the lines I've taken.                     That was true

 5   in Stenberg as well.      So I think the issue is not that

 6   you don't have support -- you do -- but that the support

 7   is contraverted, and therefore, what do we do in that

 8   case?

 9               GENERAL CLEMENT:             Well, Justice Breyer, let

10   me take as a point of departure the specific risks that

11   you associated with the injection that induces fetal

12   demise, because if there isn't a significant risk to

13   that injection, then all the other benefits that are

14   associated with the D&X procedure don't matter because

15   they can perform the D&X procedure.                     Now if you look

16   through the record on this point, I think you will not

17   find any testimony that supports a significant risk from

18   that injection.   Yes, there are risks because there are

19   risks from any medical procedure, but the risks are not

20   significant.

21               JUSTICE BREYER:             Is there a definition in

22   the law of significant risk, other than doctors saying,

23   I've been trained to try to save life and I want to

24   perform the safest possible way?               Is there some legal

25   definition of what's a small risk, a big risk, a giant

 1   risk?

 2                GENERAL CLEMENT:             With all respect, I think

 3   if a single injection that doesn't take any particular

 4   risk other than the fact that it's an injection, if that

 5   counts as a significant risk, then we might as well

 6   strike the word "significant" from the discussion in

 7   Stenberg.    And Then I think what you have is that it's

 8   very clear that their position is one of zero tolerance

 9   for any marginal risk to maternal health.

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, my question is the

11   same as Justice Breyer's.            Is there anything in the

12   literature, including medical literature, that talks

13   about significant or minor risks?                  I mean, you fill out

14   forms when you go to the dentist about risks.                  Now,

15   if -- if the chance of death is one out of 100, is that

16   significant?    I mean, I don't know.

17                GENERAL CLEMENT:             Well, it's a very

18   difficult question to evaluate in the abstract, Justice

19   Kennedy.    And I think it actually, that question,

20   though, has direct bearing on this case, because

21   Congress after all found that there was some risks with

22   the D&X procedure.      The most prominent one that I would

23   point to is the risk of cervical incompetence because

24   the D&X procedure does -- it does require additional

25   dilation, which can be associated with risks of losing


                                          6

 1   future pregnancies.     And that was born out, although not

 2   at a level of statistical significance, in the Chasen

 3   study by a plaintiff practitioner, where 2 of the 17

 4   women who had the D&X procedure and were available for

 5   follow-up care had an early pre-term pregnancy in the

 6   follow-up.

 7                So I think those risks are born out in the

 8   only study that's available.            And I think the question

 9   becomes, now, if D&X were some life-saving procedure for

10   something that there was no other known cure for, you

11   might think, well, those are the risks you run.            But

12   when there remains available the D&E procedure, which

13   has been well tested and works every single time as a

14   way to terminate the pregnancy, then I think risks that,

15   if you were talking about a life-saving treatment for

16   some life-threatening condition with no known cure,

17   those risks might not be significant in that context.

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, but there is a risk

19   if the uterine wall is compromised by cancer or some

20   forms of preeclampsia and it's very thin, there's a risk

21   of being punctured.

22                GENERAL CLEMENT:           There is a risk, Justice

23   Kennedy, but I think that, first of all, that even in

24   those limited circumstances, that the marginal risk

25   between the D&X procedure and the D&E procedure are


                                        7

 1   really as far as I can tell nonexistent.                Even in that

 2   condition, unless there's some reason not to put the

 3   injection in, if the doctor really thought the D&X

 4   procedure was the way to go, he could begin, as

 5   Dr. Carhart does in every single case after the 17th

 6   week and start off with a digoxin injection or potassium

 7   chloride injection, induce fetal demise, and he has

 8   nothing to worry about from this statute.

 9               And I think the very fact that they are

10   attributing significant risks to a single injection

11   shows that at bottom their position is a zero tolerance

12   position.   And that's a legitimate position, I suppose,

13   but it's completely inconsistent with this Court's

14   precedence, most notably the Casey decision.                Because if

15   all you needed to do is point to some marginal risk,

16   then this Court should have struck down the 24-hour

17   waiting period in the Casey decision, because the

18   plaintiffs there said the 24-hour waiting condition has

19   imposed significant risks.          They were backed in that

20   point by an amicus brief by ACOG.                But this Court didn't

21   say, well, you know, you're right, there's marginal

22   risks, we're going to apply a zero tolerance rule.

23               This Court instead upheld the 24-hour

24   period, even though it required overruling Akron I's

25   contrary decision and this Court pointed, of course, to


                                        8

 1   Akron I as an exemplar of the pre-Casey decisions that

 2   put too little weight on the legitimate countervailing

 3   interest that the government has in this area.

 4               And so with respect, I think that the

 5   argument they are making is effectively an argument for

 6   returning to Akron I and Thornburgh, where the rule of

 7   law was that there would be no interference between a

 8   doctor and the doctor's patient and the doctor's best

 9   judgment as to how to treat the patient.                This Court of

10   course consciously moved away from that in Casey and

11   expressly repudiated the language in Akron I and

12   Thornburgh to that effect.

13               JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I follow up on a

14   question the Chief Justice asked you during the last

15   argument?   We got into the government's construction of

16   the statute to narrow it to intentional situations.

17   Would you explain a little more exactly what situations

18   you would exclude and what you would include in your

19   interpretation of the statute?

20               GENERAL CLEMENT:            Well, justice Stevens, let

21   me answer it this way and maybe if you want me to take

22   you specifically to the text, I can do that.               But I

23   think the bottom line would be that under our view of

24   the statute, the most important thing is for those

25   doctors, like Dr. Cranen or Dr. Vivicar, who try to do


                                        9

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the D&E procedure every time, and they succeed 99 or 100

 2   percent of the time.      Well, in the 1 percent of the

 3   cases where they inadvertently deliver the fetus past

 4   the anatomical landmark, we would say they are not

 5   covered by the statute because they would not satisfy

 6   what is really a compound mens rea requirement in the

 7   statute, which requires that the delivery of the fetus

 8   be intentional and deliberate and for the purpose of

 9   committing the overt act of killing fetus.              And in those

10   cases, of course, the intent of the doctor performing

11   the D&E isn't to deliver the fetus at all; it's to

12   deliver a fetal arm or a fetal leg as part of the

13   dismemberment procedure.         So they would not be covered

14   by the mens rea requirement of the statute.

15                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Would you measure the mens

16   rea at the outset of the procedure when they begin the

17   dilation a day or two before the actual operation is

18   performed, or is it at the time of beginning the

19   operation?

20                GENERAL CLEMENT:           I think you could measure

21   it from either time point.          I think the better view is

22   actually that it would be measured from the beginning of

23   the surgical operation, though the evidence of their

24   intent at the beginning of the dilation would be very,

25   very relevant.   The reason I would say that is I think


                                       10
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   if somebody tries to dilate and then gets an extreme

 2   amount of dilation at the point they start the

 3   procedure, I think the intent of Congress would still be

 4   for them to do a dismemberment procedure at that point,

 5   rather than an intact removal.

 6                But if this Court thought that the

 7   constitutional line mattered on the answer to that, then

 8   you could start from the beginning of the dilation

 9   because I think in fairness the differences between the

10   two procedures are probably most manifest in the

11   dilation regimen.    I also think, though, the record

12   supports the notion that there are differences even once

13   you begin the procedure as to how you manipulate the

14   fetus.    I mean, Dr. Chasen for example, who is trying to

15   do the intact removal, says that after he has one leg

16   removed he effectively tries to reach back up and swing

17   the second leg across so he can remove the entire fetal

18   body.    If you're -- obviously if you're performing a

19   dismemberment D&E you're not trying to swing the second

20   leg across; you're simply continuing to pull or twist on

21   the first extremity that prevents itself.

22                So I think there are differences even at the

23   procedural level.    So I think that it would probably be

24   most consistent with Congress's intent to measure it

25   from the beginning of the surgical part of the


                                        11

 1   procedure.     But if you, as I say, in order to save the

 2   statute, I think it's amenable to the contrary

 3   interpretatio.

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:             I think you're wrong about

 5   -- you're probably wrong about this.                       But just before

 6   you leave, I mean, this is why it's so hard for me to

 7   get into the medical procedure.                I heard you as saying,

 8   perhaps wrongly, that well, the doctor can always use a

 9   lethal injection to kill the fetus.                       All right?   That

10   rang a bell.     So I look up and see what the lower courts

11   said about that and what they said is that nearly

12   everyone agrees it is not always possible to kill the

13   fetus by injection.

14                GENERAL CLEMENT:             Oh, but can I respond to

15   that specifically?

16                JUSTICE BREYER:             He says It is not always

17   possible -- what?

18                GENERAL CLEMENT:             Can I respond to that

19   specifically?

20                JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, he then goes; he

21   tells you why.     He says there is a Dr. Knorr who says

22   you can't do it when the woman has a prior surgery,

23   pelvic inflammatory disease.              And then another one says

24   they are not considered appropriate candidates because

25   of medical illness or cardiovascular disease, etcetera.

 1   So there's a list of medical situations where they

 2   couldn't use a fetal injection.

 3              GENERAL CLEMENT:             Justice Breyer, if I could

 4   respond to that.

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:             Yes.

 6              GENERAL CLEMENT:             I mean, there are certain

 7   situations where the injection is contraindicated.                      I

 8   think they'd be relatively rare situations.                     And I

 9   think, you know, you could imagine I suppose that the

10   statute might pose a problem if you could identify

11   particular conditions where a D&X was particularly

12   useful, and those were also situations where an

13   injection would be contraindicated.                     I think, you know,

14   the universe of that may be zero, it may be one in a

15   million; I don't know, but it's very small.

16              Another point that's made in the record

17   which I think is important is they suggest well, you

18   know, maybe, maybe if you can't do the injection into

19   the heart of the fetus, then you're only going to be

20   successful something like 92 percent of the times.                      I

21   think though for purposes of the mens rea requirement

22   would certainly take care of any concern that the

23   physician would have --

24              JUSTICE BREYER:             It's bothering me, why I'm

25   using this as an illustration is that there are so many

 1   of these things.     Of course there are special cases.                  We

 2   are only talking about a few, rare special cases.                  And

 3   as soon as you tell me that what's supposed to happen is

 4   that the judges are supposed to start deciding whether

 5   this is one of these unusual cases or not, rather than

 6   relying upon significant medical opinion, as this doctor

 7   is now illustrating, I don't see how it's going to work.

 8   At least I don't see how it's going to work without some

 9   people suffering serious illness as a result of mistakes

10   by the judge.

11              GENERAL CLEMENT:               Justice Breyer, I wish we

12   were talking about just a few rare cases because I think

13   if we were, there would be, the statute would be

14   amenable to not being applied in those rare cases.                 But

15   this is one thing that I think my colleagues on the

16   other side of the podium will agree with me on, is that

17   their doctors don't think that this is a safer procedure

18   in rare cases.     They think it's a safer procedure every

19   single time.     And that's why doctors like Dr. Chasen and

20   Dr. Frederickson try to do the D&X procedure every

21   single time, and they don't do it because they are

22   indifferent to health, I suppose.                  In their best

23   judgment they think that's the better way to go.

24              And it's just a question ultimately of

25   whether you're going to defer to individual doctors'


                                         14
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   judgments, even when it's very much of a minority

 2   judgment; I mean anything you want to say about this

 3   procedure it is the heterodox procedure, not the

 4   orthodoxy.   Most ob-gyns are going to do the D&E

 5   procedure, not the D&X procedure.                 Even in the Nebraska

 6   case three of the four plaintiffs don't try to do the

 7   intact removal, so I think that just gives you, just a,

 8   know you, anecdotal observation that you are talking

 9   about the rare procedure, the heterodox procedure.

10                And so the question is when you have a

11   perfectly safe alternative, and you have some doctors

12   who like to do is it a different way, can Congress

13   countermand the doctors'          judgment or do the doctors get

14   the final word?

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Suppose the doctor has the

16   intent, the good faith intent to perform a standard in

17   utero D&E, and he knows because of what's happened in

18   the last three months, with women with this particular

19   shaped fetus and particular position of the fetus, that

20   the chances are 50 percent, 60 percent that it's going

21   to be an intact delivery, at which point he is presented

22   with the problem.

23                Does he have the prohibitive intent?

24   Because aren't you, don't you have an intent to commit

25   the, most likely consequences of your acts?

 1                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           I don't think so.       I mean

 2   that might be a situation -- I don't know that that's a

 3   realistic hypothetical, I mean, let me just say that.

 4   If that turned out to be a realistic hypothetical, that

 5   might be an example of where this question I talked

 6   about with Justice Stevens might matter.                  Which is in

 7   that case it might matter whether or not the intent was

 8   measured --

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, that's important to

10   me because you seem to think that there is a standard

11   D&E.   In reading the medical testimony it seemed to me

12   that D&Es ought to result in result in intact deliveries

13   quite without the intent of the doctor.                  Now maybe

14   that's wrong.

15                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           With respect, Justice

16   Kennedy, I don't think that's born out in this record,

17   it's the other way, which is doctors who want to perform

18   a D&X, often, in a majority of the cases end up

19   performing a D&E.     But the doctors that set out to

20   perform a D&E, in Dr. Vibhakar's case she says a hundred

21   percent of the time, she ends up with dismemberment.

22   Dr. Creinen says it's 99% of the time that he ends up

23   with dismemberment.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And I gather your

25   submission is that we can tell who is setting out to


                                        16

 1   perform which, by the dilation protocol.                    Those were the

 2   record references that you gave earlier?

 3                 GENERAL CLEMENT:            Yes.       And you can, you

 4   can, you can tell you can tell from the fact that a

 5   doctor, like one of the plaintiffs in the Nebraska case,

 6   Dr. Fitzhugh, says, that, well, I don't do the intact

 7   removal because if I wanted to do that I would have to

 8   do a second round of dilation with a second round of

 9   laminarias.     And of course, that second round of

10   laminaria is also a medical procedure.                    Like the

11   injection, every medical procedure has some risks, risks

12   of infection.    If you looked at Dr. Creinen's testimony,

13   this is at 174 A to 177 A in the Eighth Circuit petition

14   appendix, he says that he doesn't like to do a second

15   round of laminaria dilation because it's painful to the

16   patient.   And that's his testimony.

17                 So there are countervailing indications

18   here.   And as I say, this idea of trying to prohibit a

19   practice that involves further dilation is not an

20   irrelevant concern from a health standpoint, because one

21   of the things that Congress heard was that there were

22   risks to future pregnancies from cervical incompetence.

23   And that's a particularly important concern because

24   first of all, the plaintiff's experts aren't in a very

25   good position to evaluate that risk because they provide


                                         17
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   abortion services, not follow-up services.                       So they're

 2   not in a good position to judge that risk.

 3              Second of all, the only study we have here

 4   points out that there is a greater incidence of that

 5   preterm delivery in the group that had a D&X procedure.

 6   Now again they say, they are going to come up and say

 7   well it's not statistically significant.                       But the

 8   numbers I think are striking.               They had 17 women in the

 9   group that had a D&X and came back.                       Two of them had a

10   preterm pregnancy.      The D&E group was much larger, 45,

11   and two of them had a preterm delivery.                      Now I think as

12   a commonsense manner, if you know that you were going to

13   be in a room with 17 people where two people were going

14   to have something bad happen to them, or in a room with

15   45 and two -- bad things were going to happen to two, I

16   know which room I'd like to be in.                   And all I'm pointing

17   out --

18              JUSTICE BREYER:               Yes, once you're making a

19   point of that study, I think it was also the case that

20   the ones that had the intact were older or rather

21   further along in pregnancy; isn't that true?

22              GENERAL CLEMENT:               That's right.

23              JUSTICE BREYER:               Therefore the risks were

24   greater.

25              GENERAL CLEMENT:               Well if I could just --


                                         18
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:           And therefore since the

 2   risks were greater, the other side says that this

 3   actually shows it was safer.             I mean, I don't know how

 4   to evaluate that.

 5                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           I think it's even more

 6   complicated than that, Justice Breyer, because in fact,

 7   you're right that the D&X patients were at a further

 8   gestational age, but the D&E patients were actually

 9   older.    And so I think --

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I missed that.

11                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           Right.          But it happens

12   that, the D&E patients were on average two years older,

13   which I think also would be associated with greater

14   risk.    So I think it's a wash.             But I still think the

15   Chasen study net is quite helpful to our side.                     For one

16   thing, this is a study put together by one of the

17   plaintiff practitioners, a plaintiff in the Southern

18   District case, based on a study of his own practice.

19   And of course one of the intuitions about the D&X

20   procedure is because you remove it intact it's going to

21   be a faster procedure and there is going to be less

22   blood loss.

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            General Clement --

24                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well, what did he find

25   when he studied that?       It was exactly the same for those

 1   two procedures.     I'm sorry.

 2                JUSTICE GINSBERG:              Because your time is

 3   running out I did want to ask you about a feature of

 4   this legislation that hasn't come up so far, and that is

 5   perhaps stimulated by Stenberg.                But up until now, all

 6   regulation on access to abortion has been state

 7   regulation and this measure is saying to the states,

 8   like it or not, the Federal Government is going to ban a

 9   particular practice and we are going to take away the

10   choice from the states, in an area where up until now

11   it's, it's been open to the states to make those

12   decisions.   How should that weigh in this case?                 And it

13   is something new.

14                GENERAL CLEMENT:             Well, I mean I don't think

15   it should figure in this Court's decision.                  I mean

16   principally because the other side in neither case makes

17   a challenge based on the Commerce Clause, and I suppose

18   there is two reasons for that.                That legal reason that

19   they don't bring the challenge is because there is a

20   jurisdictional element that I think would address the

21   challenges as a doctrinal matter.                  The practical reason

22   I think is because this isn't the only instance in which

23   the Federal Government has gotten involved to address

24   issues related to the abortion context.

25                JUSTICE GINSBERG:              Well I know, when it is a


                                         20

 1   question of funding --

 2                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well but also access to

 3   clinics, in the the face act, which is also --

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           The bes example where

 5   government has gotten involved in overriding what the

 6   states want to do is Casey.             It seems rather odd for

 7   this Court to be concerned about stepping on the toes of

 8   the states.

 9                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well -- it's certainly

10   true that abortion has been dealt with at a Federal

11   level one way or another since 1973.                     So I think that's

12   also part of the backdrop, but I also think, I mean, you

13   know, the Federal Government gets involved in this

14   issue, you know, depending on your perspective, for good

15   or for harm.    It's there to protect access to the

16   abortion clinics --

17                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           General Clement, That

18   brings up a question I was intending to ask you.                     I

19   notice the finding says nothing about interstate

20   commerce but the statute says any physician who in or

21   affecting interstate commerce performs the procedures.

22   Does that mean that the procedure is performed in a free

23   clinic, as opposed to a profit organization, it would

24   not be covered?

25                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           Justice Stevens, I don't


                                        21
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   think we have taken, the Federal Government hasn't taken

 2   a definitive position on that.               I think it could be

 3   interpreted either way.         I think my understanding is the

 4   face context, a free clinic would be covered.                   There's

 5   not a jurisdictional element in the face statute.                   So

 6   there may be differences as, in application.

 7                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           But how could the Commerce

 8   Clause justify application to a free clinic?                   I don't

 9   understand.

10                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well, I think by, I mean,

11   you know, the Court's precedents in other areas has

12   suggested it's just not a matter of whether the ultimate

13   service is provided in commerce but in order to get the

14   services they have to take --

15                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Activities that --

16                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           Yes.       Exactly.   I don't, I

17   mean, that hasn't been briefed up in this case.                  If it

18   had been we'd probably have a definitive position one

19   way or another.    But I don't think the constitutionality

20   in this facial challenge where that hasn't been a

21   feature of the challenge turns on the answer to that

22   question one way or another.

23                 I think in regards to the Chasen study the

24   last thing I would say about it though is that it's

25   important because most of the arguments on the other


                                        22
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   side are intuitive arguments.              They are intuitive

 2   arguments, that they would be less passive, so that will

 3   be more safe.    And what I think is telling is that the

 4   same intuition would lead to the notion that it would be

 5   quicker and there will be less blood loss.                 And when

 6   that was actually tested in a controlled study, it

 7   turned out not to be the case.

 8                The last thing I'll say about the Chasen

 9   study is there was this indication that the two most

10   serious complications were associated with the D&E

11   procedure.    But one thing that I think is important to

12   understand about the Chasen study is it is a

13   retrospective study of Dr. Chasen and his partner's own

14   practice.    Now what they do in every case is they set

15   out to perform a D&X procedure, and so what they are

16   studying and what they call the D&X procedures, that

17   cohort are the times when they tried to do a D&X

18   procedure and they were successful.

19                The D&X cohort from this study, is you know,

20   are those circumstances where he and his partner tried

21   to do a D&X procedure, weren't successful and did a D&E

22   procedure.

23                Now why is that significant?                Because it

24   shows as Chasen noted in his article that in those

25   situations that were D&Es and they were associated with


                                        23
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   serious complications there was nothing he could have

 2   done about it.   He could have performed a D&X, he tried

 3   to perform a D&X and it wasn't successful, so he ended

 4   up performing a D&E.      And so I really think on balance

 5   the Chasen study ends up supporting our position,

 6   because the first time you have any kind of controlled

 7   study what you find is that some of the intuition turns

 8   out not to be true, and the safety benefits from these

 9   are a wash, and the one sort of loose end from the study

10   is the threat that you do see from the greater dilation.

11   Now it's not statistically robust, but I think that it

12   does bear out one of Congress's concerns.

13              JUSTICE BREYER:             Could you address the

14   question I asked respondent's counsel in the last case

15   about the availability of other facilities?                     Because

16   there are alternate methods but some of these require

17   hospitalization, and my understanding is the hospitals

18   aren't always open.

19              GENERAL CLEMENT:             Right, I -- I --

20              JUSTICE BREYER:             So it doesn't make much

21   sense to say well, there is an alternate procedure if

22   you can't be admitted to the facility.

23              GENERAL CLEMENT:             Sure.           And as I tried to

24   indicate in rebuttal, that's really not a concern

25   because, the difference is whether some clinics will


                                       24

 1   only offer the D&X and the D&E and will say that

 2   basically you've got to go to a hospital to get the

 3   induction procedure.       But that doesn't really, I don't

 4   think matter, because the point is anybody could can got

 5   a D&X who is at a clinic can also get a D&E.             In every

 6   single case the doctor that can perform the D&X can also

 7   offer the D&E.    And since the D&E is what the district

 8   court in the Nebraska case described as the gold

 9   standard of Casey, I think every woman in every case is

10   going to have that option of a safe, of a safe pregnancy

11   option.   And again one way to illustrate that is Chasen.

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But then you pin your

13   whole case on the availability of D&E even though D&Es

14   sometimes inadvertently turn into intact D&Es.

15               GENERAL CLEMENT:             Well, but, Justice

16   Kennedy, I think we have our answer to that, which is

17   the best reading of the statute requires the intent at

18   the outset of the procedure, and therefore nobody -- in

19   the 99 percent of the cases that Dr. Crainer sets out to

20   performs a D&E and succeeds, there's no issue in the

21   world because everybody would look at that and say

22   that's a D&E.    In the one case --

23               JUSTICE BREYER:             How do you do that, because

24   I looked at that part of the statute and, comparing it

25   with the statute in Cathcart, the relevant part forbid a


                                        25

 1   doctor from doing this for the purpose of performing an

 2   abortion that the doctor knows will kill the fetus.

 3   That's the language basically, right.                   And in this one

 4   it says you can't deliver past the fetal trunk for the

 5   purpose of performing an overt act that the doctor knows

 6   will kill the fetus.      So I look at those two sets of

 7   words.   I mean, I've simplified them slightly, but I

 8   don't see the difference.

 9               So if the one in Cathcart is viewed as too

10   vague, why is the other one here not too vague?

11               GENERAL CLEMENT:            Well, Justice Breyer, it's

12   because of the addition of the anatomical landmark

13   language to the Federal statute.

14               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, I'll grant you that

15   in respect -- if what Cathcart was worried about I guess

16   was you didn't know what the words "significant

17   substantial portion of the child," that tends to be

18   cured.   But if what Cathcart was worried about was the

19   fact that a doctor who sets out to perform a D&E will,

20   making a pass, think he'll have the fetus dismembered

21   and, lo and behold, it doesn't dismember, so the bottom

22   portion of the fetus descends outside the womb.                  And

23   there he is and now what happens?                If that's the

24   concern, then I guess you'd agree that that same concern

25   exists here.

 1              GENERAL CLEMENT:             Well, only with the

 2   caveat, though, is that I think this Court really didn't

 3   have to confront the second concern because it had the

 4   first concern.   And if you thought that a leg, which

 5   this Court did, was a substantial portion, and that was

 6   the, that was the act that induced fetal demise, either

 7   way it was covered no matter what your purpose was,

 8   because the doctor's purpose in removing the leg was to

 9   induce fetal demise.

10              Here the compound mens rea requirement works

11   with the anatomical landmark language, so that what you

12   need to satisfy the statute is the deliberate and

13   purposeful intent to remove the fetus past the navel

14   with the purpose of performing an overt act that will,

15   will lead to fetal demise, which is not covered when you

16   don't even have the intent to take it out of the -- past

17   the anatomical landmark in the first place and you're

18   trying to do something that's going to take place in

19   utero.

20              If I could reserve the balance of my time

21   for rebuttal.

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, General

23   Clement.

 1                   ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

 2               MS. GARTNER:          Mr. Chief Justice and may it

 3   please the Court:

 4               In Casey, this Court reaffirmed that the

 5   government cannot ban pre-viability abortions.           Despite

 6   Casey, Stenberg suggested that there is a narrow

 7   category of pre-viability abortions, intact D&Es, as

 8   this Court understood that term in Stenberg, that can be

 9   banned so long as the ban contains a health exception.

10   But I'd like to leave the health exception question

11   aside for a minute and turn to the scope of the law that

12   Congress has enacted here.

13               The question is whether Congress can enact a

14   pre-viability abortion ban that does not track the

15   hallmark of intact D&E abortions as this Court

16   understood that term in Stenberg and by doing so to ban

17   a substantially greater array of abortions than would be

18   banned had the law faithfully tracked the language in

19   the Stenberg opinions about what constitutes an intact

20   D&E.   And I'm referring both to the majority opinion in

21   Stenberg and in the dissents.

22               It is our position that this Court must

23   reject Congress's effort to exploit the limited license

24   that this Court seemingly granted in Stenberg because to

25   allow such an expansion of pre- viability abortions that


                                        28

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   can be banned would set the stage for continued

 2   legislative efforts to ban other iterations of the

 3   classic D&E method of abortion until truly there would

 4   be nothing left at all of Casey's holding that it is

 5   unconstitutional to ban pre- viability second trimester

 6   abortions.

 7                The government in this case has conceded

 8   that the act bans more abortions than merely the intact

 9   D&E as this Court understood it in Stenberg.             But I want

10   to highlight for the Court how the language of this act

11   departs from the hallmarks of intact D&E and how these

12   departures place doctors at risk of prosecution for the

13   very facet of D&E abortions, and by that I mean all D&E

14   abortions, that enhance their safety.

15                There is three respects in which the act

16   departs from the hallmarks of intact D&E as understood

17   in Stenberg.    First, the act does not require breach

18   extraction of an intact fetus to the head, one of the

19   primary hallmarks that this Court understood in

20   Stenberg.    Instead, the act applies once the fetus is

21   extracted past the navel, a far more frequent occurrence

22   than extraction to the head.             And in fact the government

23   in its briefing both in their initial brief and in their

24   reply concedes that in any of what the government calls

25   standard D&Es a living fetus can be extracted past the


                                        29
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   fetal navel before demise occurs.

 2               In addition, the act does not require the

 3   fetus to be delivered intact at the end of the

 4   procedure, another component of what is considered to be

 5   a hallmark of intact D&E in Stenberg.

 6               In fact, the word intact appears nowhere in

 7   the statute and again the government concedes that some

 8   non-intact D&Es would violate this law as drafted.                 In

 9   fact, the government contends that one of the

10   "advantages," in its words, is that the law would ban

11   more than intact D&E.      And finally, the act does not

12   require that the fetus be extracted in a breach

13   presentation at all, even though in Stenberg the Court

14   thought of the breach extraction as one of the hallmarks

15   of intact D&E.

16               Now this --

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Do you -- I think

18   this question was asked earlier, but I want your

19   position.   How often does the vertex delivery occur in a

20   D&X procedure?   I --

21               MS. GARTNER:         Your Honor, two, two doctors

22   in particular, Dr. Chasen and Dr. Hammond, testified

23   that they have used in their practice the vertex

24   presentation to treat women who, as Ms. Smith indicated,

25   the fetus suffered from a serious lethal anomaly that


                                       30
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   involved a greatly distended abdomen.                    The fetus

 2   presented in a head-first presentation.                    The head

 3   delivered through the dilated cervix, but the only way

 4   to complete the procedure was to reduce the size of the,

 5   of the abdomen that was, that was anomalous in size

 6   because of the underlying fetal condition.

 7                 In those cases, those doctors testified that

 8   that was absolutely the safest way to terminate the

 9   pregnancy for the woman.          The only alternative way would

10   have been abdominal surgery, which, which all the,

11   virtually all of the doctors, even the government's

12   doctors, agreed carries far greater risks for the woman

13   than a vaginal surgical abortion.

14                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Miss Gartner, with regard

15   to your argument that the statute here did not track

16   what you have described as the characteristics, the

17   hallmarks, I think the answer from the other side is

18   that the, the theory of this statute is a theory of a

19   clear line between a legitimate abortion and

20   infanticide.    And if that is the theory, then whether

21   it's a breach delivery or a non-breach delivery is

22   irrelevant.    What would your answer be to that?

23                 MS. GARTNER:        Well, two answers, Your Honor.

24   First of all, the clear line that this Court drew in

25   Stenberg was essentially the line at intact delivery to


                                        31

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the head followed by an act that results in fetal

 2   demise.   Very clearly what this Court understood in

 3   Stenberg could -- was, was an intact D&E and several

 4   members of the court suggested that that would be

 5   constitutional to ban.

 6                In addition, the government today seems to

 7   suggest --

 8                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, we said that that

 9   would be an appropriate line.              But the question here is

10   is it really essential to an appropriate line that we

11   talk, that we describe it as a, as a breach delivery or

12   a non-breach delivery.

13                MS. SMITH:       Your Honor, I would agree that

14   of the three hallmarks that the Court recognized in

15   Stenberg, the breach delivery is probably the least, the

16   least central; that the other two hallmarks, the

17   extraction to the head followed by a completely intact

18   delivery after demise, were absolutely the hallmarks

19   that everyone on this Court understood in Stenberg, and

20   those, those lines, are nowhere in the statute that

21   Congress enacted.

22                Today General Clement seems to be arguing

23   that there is a different line that's protected in this

24   statute, a different line than the Court recognized in

25   Stenberg, and the line is about where the fetus is when


                                        32
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   demise occurs.   But, but this Court in Stenberg

 2   understood that even in a classical D&E, a standard D&E,

 3   as the government calls it, part of the fetus is outside

 4   the woman's uterus when fetal demise occurs.                    The Court

 5   recognized that fetal demise occurs even in a standard

 6   D&E when, after a part of the fetus is drawn out of the

 7   women's uterus, resistance is met, disarticulation

 8   occurs, and after that fetal demise.                    So even in a

 9   standard D&E the line that the government today is

10   offering up, the line of inside or outside the uterus,

11   would be violated in any D&E --

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I understood the

13   statute here to apply only when the, in the words of the

14   statute, that the partially delivered infant is killed

15   after passing the anatomical landmark.

16               MS. GARTNER:         Well, that's right, Your

17   Honor.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So we just say your

19   hypothetical about extraction of the leg it seems to be

20   would not be covered by the statute.

21               MS. GARTNER:         Absolutely, Your Honor, that's

22   right.   But what I'm saying is that some part of the

23   fetus, no matter what, is outside the women's uterus,

24   whether it's an intact D&E, a non-intact D&E --

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:            But we don't talk about a


                                       33

 1   leg dying.   We talk about the fetus dying, I think, and

 2   I think that's not the leg.

 3                MS. GARTNER:          I think the important point is

 4   that the government acknowledges that in a standard D&E,

 5   what it calls standard D&Es, the fetus can be extracted

 6   past the anatomical landmark.               So the anatomical

 7   landmark isn't a bright-line decision between intact

 8   D&Es and non-intact D&Es.            But in Stenberg this Court

 9   drew that line between intact D&Es and non-intact D&Es.

10   It suggested --

11                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Where does the

12   government concede that in a standard D&E the living

13   fetus is extracted past the anatomical landmark?

14                MS. GARTNER:          It does so --

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I thought that was

16   -- I thought their position was that that was not the

17   standard D&E.

18                MS. GARTNER:          Right.        It does so in two

19   places, Your Honor.       On page 32 of their initial brief

20   they refer to, they describe two circumstances that they

21   say or two parts of the law that they say saved the law

22   from banning non- intact D&Es.                The first is the

23   anatomical landmark and the second is the requirement of

24   an overt act.     They describe the overt act as saving

25   non-intact D&Es that were not already excluded from the


                                         34
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   anatomical landmark requirement.              So that suggests that

 2   there are some standard D&Es that would not be saved by

 3   the anatomical landmark requirement.

 4              In addition, in their reply brief on page 22

 5   they explicitly say that the fetus is usually not

 6   delivered past the anatomic landmark in the standard

 7   D&E, but they don't say that that never occurs.                So they

 8   do admit that that sometimes is the case, and in fact

 9   the government witness, doctor --

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I thought their

11   answer on that was that sometimes the D&E procedure will

12   lead to a D&X procedure, but that the requirement of

13   deliberately and intentionally removes those situations

14   from the scope of the statute.

15              MS. GARTNER:         Well, I think that's not how I

16   understood it, Your Honor.         But in addition, the

17   government witnesses, witness, Dr. Sadigian, admitted

18   that in any standard D&E the fetus can be extracted past

19   the navel, the anatomic landmark of the navel, of the

20   naval, even in a standard.

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Prior to demise?

22              MS. GARTNER:         That's right, Your Honor.

23              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Did you understand the

24   government's argument or answer to that to be, well, if

25   the intent did not exist, if there was not an intent to


                                      35
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   do that, then the doctor is not liable?

 2               MS. GARTNER:         Well, Your Honor, I think this

 3   gets to the point I was going to make about the safety

 4   of doing abortions in a way that would be banned by the

 5   law, and that's that in every D&E, regardless of whether

 6   the intent is to do an intact D&E or not an intact D&E,

 7   the intent is to minimize the insertion of instruments

 8   into the uterus and to extract the fetus as intact as

 9   possible, because each insertion of the instruments

10   increases the risk of causing harm to the woman's

11   uterus.   And so in every D&E, regardless of whether the

12   physician expects to have an intact fetus at the very

13   end of the procedure, they do want to minimize the --

14   the amount of instrumentation and bring it out in as few

15   parts as possible and so there is a deliberate and

16   intentional delivery of the fetus as far as possible

17   which often can be past the navel, though in most cases

18   it won't be up to the head.            So that's why the line that

19   this Court drew in Stenberg is the line that first of

20   all delineates between two distinct procedures:                intact

21   D&E and nonintact D&E.       The difference between those two

22   procedures is whether the fetus is extracted to the head

23   or not to the head before demise occurs.                This, this

24   statute doesn't draw that line.              It draws a different

25   line and in doing that, it captures far more abortions


                                       36
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   than the other law would and, and the key thing is that

 2   if this law stands with the past the navel line the

 3   inevitable result is that doctors in order to try to

 4   avoid the reach of this statute will have to stop trying

 5   to minimize the instrumentation and stop trying to draw

 6   the fetus out as intact as possible because often when

 7   that happens --

 8              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 My concern with your

 9   argument is it's not just the anatomical line.                  The

10   statute, I guess the Solicitor General referred to this

11   as the multiple mens rea requirement.                  It's not simply

12   the extraction to a particular anatomical landmark but

13   with the purpose of demise at that point.                  So, if in the

14   typical D&E the demise is going to be accomplished

15   before extraction passed the anatomical landmark.                  It

16   wouldn't be covered by this law.

17              MS. GARTNER:         Well, Your Honor, I guess to

18   some extent it comes down to what intent means but if

19   what it means that the doctors would prefer, would like

20   it to come out as far as possible before they have to

21   take any, any kind of action to clear an obstructing

22   part, that's, that's what they intend.

23              The doctor only uses disarticulation when

24   it's necessary to clear an obstruction because the

25   continued extraction --

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What about the

 2   Solicitor General's reference with respect to the

 3   differing protocols on dilation which suggests a

 4   different intent going into the procedure for the D&E

 5   and D&X?

 6              MS. GARTNER:         Well, two points, Your Honor.

 7   One is the statute makes no mention of dilation

 8   protocols even though some group like the American

 9   College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists when they

10   intend to define an intact D&E abortion they've defined

11   it specifically by reference to dilation protocols.                And

12   some state statutes have also used dilation protocols as

13   part of the definition of intact D&E but this statute

14   makes no mention of dilation protocols.

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, but the dilation

16   protocol certainly would be relevant on the question of

17   intent which this statute does refer to, wouldn't it?

18              MS. GARTNER:         I think it would be relevant,

19   Your Honor, but I think it's not -- it really can't be

20   dispositive of the physician's intent be --

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Because?

22              MS. GARTNER:         Some doctors use a one day

23   protocol, some doctors use a two day protocol but that

24   in of itself isn't --

25              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But you're telling us that


                                      38
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   some do this and some do that and the question is why

 2   wouldn't following one protocol rather than another

 3   protocol very significant evidence of what was intended?

 4                 MS. GARTNER:         Because some doctors use a two

 5   day protocol, Your Honor, even if they don't expect to

 6   get an intact D&E.      There is not a direct correlation,

 7   there's some correlation between the amount of dilation

 8   and the percentage of times that a physician achieves

 9   intact D&E.    To some extent doctors also use other

10   agents to dilate, they use misoprostol and medication.

11   That even if they're doing a one day protocol --

12                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Do we have any indication

13   in your case about the effective safety of any other

14   aspect of this procedure if these doctors would change

15   their, their method of operation and go to a one-day

16   protocol?

17                 MS. SMITH:       In terms, one-day protocol?

18                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes.

19                 MS. GARTNER:         Some doctors -- I think one

20   thing is that doctors perform abortions most safely when

21   they do them in a way that they are most accustomed do.

22   They are doing them the way they were trained to do

23   them.

24                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            I don't want to cut your

25   answer but I want to know whether there is anything

 1   specifically in the record in your case that bears on my

 2   question.

 3               MS. GARTNER:           There is nothing specific

 4   about doctors changing protocols.                  There is significant

 5   evidence about increased risks if doctors were to stop

 6   trying to extract the fetus as intact as possible.

 7   Several witnesses, including several government

 8   witnesses have agreed.

 9               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Do you mean start and stop

10   with a different intent?

11               MS. GARTNER:           That's right, Your Honor.

12               JUSTICE SOUTER:              As opposed to adopting a

13   completely different procedure entirely -- a different

14   protocol entirely.

15               MS. GARTNER:           Well, no actually even the

16   other government witness, Dr. Cook, agreed that -- and

17   the other government witness, Dr. Lockwood, agreed that

18   removing the fetus as intact as possible in any D&E is

19   the safest way to perform a D&E procedure regardless of

20   whether the intent was to do an intact D&E procedure.

21               JUSTICE BREYER:              For such a doctor, a doctor

22   who thinks that I'm trying to remove in this emergency

23   situation as much of the fetus as possible as quickly as

24   possible, would such a doctor often, never, sometimes be

25   thinking what I think is likely to happen here, I'll

 1   make a pass at the fetus, try to draw it out, and what's

 2   most likely to happen is that the trunk, a lot of it

 3   will come out and then the head of the fetus will

 4   dismember, after a lot of the trunk comes out.

 5               Is that --

 6               MS. GARTNER:         I would say it certainly is

 7   not never and it's not always.              It's somewhere in

 8   between but I think --

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:            So if a doctor is being

10   honest about that, is there any way that such a doctor

11   could escape the language of the statute on the

12   government's interpretation?

13               MS. GARTNER:         I think not Your Honor because

14   the intent is to extract the fetus as intact as

15   possible.   In a good many cases it will be extracted

16   past the navel though not to the head.                  So the doctor

17   falls within the deliberately and intentionally language

18   and I don't think, the government also proffers the idea

19   of specific intent, but again because this statute

20   doesn't track the actual differences between the two

21   procedures, the having the specific intent doesn't save

22   the statute.   The doctor may intend to perform the

23   abortion as defined in this law but not intend to do an

24   intact D&E and that was the testimony in these cases.

25               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Would you clear up one

 1   thing for me?     You say it's always the doctor's intent

 2   to extract as much as possible before causing fetal

 3   demise.   I thought there was significant number of cases

 4   in which there was a deliberate decision to cause fetal

 5   demise before I start any extraction?

 6                MS. GARTNER:          Well, Your Honor there is

 7   testimony in our case, in the California case, that a

 8   few doctors that testified said the beginning at

 9   approximately 22 weeks of pregnancy, they offered women

10   the option of undergoing a fetal demise injection before

11   the procedure began.        But the testimony was also

12   overwhelming, including from the government witnesses,

13   that that injection procedure carries significant risks

14   for some women.    For example, women with either

15   susceptibility to infection, like women with HIV or

16   hepatitis, you definitely don't want to do an additional

17   injection.   That in addition --

18                JUSTICE STEVENS:             From the point of view of

19   the doctor it would be the safest thing to avoid

20   criminal responsibility.

21                MS. GARTNER:          It -- but the problem is as

22   the district court, found it's an unnecessary medical

23   procedure that subjects the woman to additional risk.

24   Now if the doctors --

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Why would the


                                         42

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   doctors in that case propose that option to their

 2   patients?

 3               MS. GARTNER:         At 22 weeks and later, as the

 4   abortion is getting closer to the viability line, the

 5   doctors feel that some women would feel more -- it's for

 6   psychological reasons for the woman.                    That's why it's an

 7   offer; it's not a requirement.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, what -- what

 9   are the psychological reasons?

10               MS. GARTNER:         If she would prefer that the

11   fetus undergo demise before the extraction begins, some

12   women may feel better about that.                The testimony was

13   also that other women absolutely don't want that.                   And

14   you know, feel that they -- you know, it's a very

15   personal question that really goes to the heart of this

16   case.   It's a very personal decision how the woman who

17   has made this very difficult moral/religious decision to

18   end her pregnancy, often for very tragic reasons, how

19   does she want the fetus to undergo demise?                   Different

20   people will have different views about this.                   But here

21   Congress has legislated that for the woman and done so

22   pre-viability, when the state interests really are

23   insufficient to require the woman to undergo a procedure

24   that is not marginally safer but significantly safer for

25   her.

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well is there a

 2   difference between, in your view, in the

 3   constitutionality, marginally safer and significantly

 4   safer?    In other words, I take it we don't, you

 5   obviously were here for the discussion in the prior

 6   case.     We don't have evidence on marginal significant.

 7   And do you think it matters; if in fact it's a marginal

 8   difference in safety, does that, is that still enough to

 9   override Congress's interests in this case?

10                 MS. GARTNER:         Yes, Your Honor, it does

11   matter.    Marginal safety would not be enough but I think

12   what is important is that you assess, you assess the

13   question of marginal versus significant by looking at

14   the averted harms.      It's not a question of quantifying

15   how many women would avert the harms.

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, do we just

17   look at the averted harms, or -- or do we, or Congress,

18   also look at the incidence of the averted harms?                   Is it

19   a theoretical -- is it a theoretical inquiry or is it to

20   some extent a quantified inquiry?

21                 MS. GARTNER:         Well, Your Honor, I think it

22   can't be a quantified, quantified inquiry.                   Ultimately

23   this Court has never looked at the constitutional

24   question of when an abortion statute interferes with a

25   woman's health to an extent that it's unconstitutional,

 1   in terms of how many women are affected.                 The question

 2   is, is how seriously would a woman be affected if she

 3   affected?   And the evidence here is overwhelming.

 4               JUSTICE STEVENS:             Doesn't the answer to my

 5   question turn largely on the age of the fetus?                 Isn't it

 6   a vast difference between the kind of decision the

 7   mother that is to make if it's a 14 week fetus on the

 8   one hand and 26 week fetus on the other?

 9               MS. GARTNER:          Well, I'm not sure if that's.

10               JUSTICE STEVENS:             For example, one of the

11   congressional interests described in the finding is

12   avoiding fetal pain to the fetus.                 And I guess they

13   don't suffer any pain prior to 20 weeks but after 20

14   weeks there is some risk of pain.                 And that seems to me,

15   that could affect a calculus very dramatically for the

16   woman making the decision.

17               MS. GARTNER:          For the woman, but I think the

18   important point, Your Honor, is that this, that the

19   intact D&E procedure, and the testimony was overwhelming

20   to this effect, that -- in some cases this procedure

21   averts catastrophic health consequences for the woman.

22   It averts uterine perforation, it averts the spread of

23   sepsis or infection; it averts the spread of --

24   potentially the spread of malignant cancer throughout

25   the women's body.

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    If -- if the woman

 2   can take into account the impact on the fetus at a

 3   certain point in time, and your option, as you said some

 4   physicians give, of fetal demise prior to the procedure,

 5   why is that beyond the scope of things that Congress can

 6   take into account?

 7              MS. GARTNER:            Because what Congress has done

 8   here is take away from women the option of what may be

 9   the safest procedure for her.               This Court has never

10   recognized a state interest that was sufficient to trump

11   the woman's interest in her health.                       If the woman and

12   her doctor together agree that proceeding in this way is

13   going to avert significant health risks to her, and the

14   testimony here is overwhelming that there are situations

15   where that occurs, this Court has never recognized a

16   state interest that was sufficient to trump that woman's

17   paramount interest in her health.

18              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Well, but we have -- we

19   have said that that judgment has to reflect some kind of

20   substantial medical judgment.               It can't be an

21   idiosyncratic determination by one doctor alone.

22              MS. GARTNER:            Absolutely, Justice Souter.

23              JUSTICE SOUTER:               So to that extent --

24              MS. GARTNER:            And that's -- and I take that

25   -- and maybe that was my -- and I take this as a given

 1   here.   Given the overwhelming testimony from doctors

 2   from the American College of Obstetricians and

 3   Gynecologists, and this Court's holding in Stenberg,

 4   where the record was less robust, that we have that

 5   substantial medical authority here.                     And given that

 6   substantial medical authority, doctors need to be able

 7   to use their appropriate medical judgment, in the words

 8   of Roe and Casey, to provide this procedure for their

 9   patients when in their judgment -- not in their

10   unfettered discretion, but in their sound clinical

11   experience and medical judgment it's going to be the

12   safest for her and avert catastrophic health

13   consequences.

14               So this is -- again, it may be that the

15   number of women is not large, but for the women who are

16   affected the impact of this ban is undoubtedly

17   significant.

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I don't want to

19   misinterpret the Attorney General, the Solicitor

20   General's remarks but he indicated in those case there

21   could be an as applied challenge.

22               MS. GARTNER:         Well, I think, Justice

23   Kennedy, you answered that question as well as I could.

24   If a woman had to wait until she needed a banned

25   abortion for her health, and file a proceeding wait for


                                       47

 1   the court to grant relief, undoubtedly she would not get

 2   the relief she needed in time.

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, the answer that the

 4   Solicitor gave -- General gave to that was, you could

 5   have a pre-enforcement proceeding.                  That you can back up

 6   the clock.

 7                MS. GARTNER:         Right.        I'm not sure that I

 8   actually understood his answers though, because I think

 9   that that's what we have here, in fact, is a

10   pre-enforcement proceeding to, to determine that this

11   law blanketly banned intact D&E abortions even when the

12   doctor believes it's, it would have significant health

13   benefits for the patient.

14                So this is not, I want to go back to,

15   because my light is on, Stenberg suggested that there

16   was a line that could constitutionally be drawn between

17   banned, between permissibly banned procedures and, and

18   procedures that have constitutional protection.                 But the

19   statute didn't draw the line and it didn't draw that

20   line in two ways.    This, this statute defiantly rejected

21   this Court's view that because there is substantial

22   medical authority for the proposition that intact D&E is

23   sometimes safer, a health exception is absolutely needed

24   here, and they also refused to draw the line at what

25   this Court understood was the defining difference

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   between intact D&E and nonintact D&E.

 2              In the Solicitor General's reply brief they

 3   talk about the promise of Stenberg.                     Well, the promise

 4   of Stenberg was absolutely betrayed by Congress in this

 5   case in both respects, both in terms of preserving the

 6   health of the woman and allowing her to use what a

 7   substantial medical authority thinks is the safest

 8   procedure for the woman, and in terms of holding the

 9   line at a limited ban on pre-viability abortions given

10   that Casey recognized that women have a constitutional

11   right to choose to end their pregnancy pre-viability.

12              I was going to address briefly some of the

13   concerns that the Solicitor General offered about some

14   of the health risks of intact D&E and cervical

15   incompetence.   Just briefly.           The, all of the government

16   witnesses in this case agreed that the congressional

17   findings completely overstate any risks of intact --

18   there is no, there is no reasonable basis to conclude

19   that intact D&E puts a woman at any greater risk of harm

20   than standard D&E, and in fact the evidence is quite to

21   the contrary.   It averts catastrophic health

22   consequences in some circumstances.                     There is no strong

23   evidence that intact D&E has any impact on cervical

24   incompetence.

25              The Solicitor General talks at length about

 1   the two cases in Dr. Jason's study, but both of those

 2   women who experienced cervical incompetence had, in

 3   future pregnancy, had had cervical incompetence in prior

 4   pregnancies, and that's a condition that tends to stay

 5   with the woman.    So there is no reason to think that it

 6   was the intact D&E itself that caused cervical

 7   incompetence in the subsequent pregnancies because of

 8   intact D&E.

 9                 And finally, yes, it's true that Dr. Chasen

10   used intact D&E or attempted to use intact D&E in all

11   cases, and the women who had D&Es, three of them

12   suffered very serious medical consequences after having

13   a D&E. The Solicitor General says well, Dr. Chasen tried

14   to do intact and he failed so, so there was really

15   nothing to say about this law.               But the fact is, if this

16   law went into effect, no woman could have intact D&E. So

17   even though, even in those cases where Dr. Chasen was

18   able to do intact D&E, he would no longer be able to do

19   that.   So the incidence of those women having

20   catastrophic health consequences, which in the Chasen

21   study, three of the women having D&Es had catastrophic

22   health consequences.       Inevitably if this law is upheld,

23   an intact D&E is not available as an option to doctors

24   when in their judgment based on substantial medical

25   authority, it's the best option for the woman.

 1   Inevitably there will be more and more women having D&Es

 2   and suffering catastrophic health consequences in

 3   situations where if intact D&E had been available, those

 4   catastrophic consequences could have been averted.

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

 6   Ms. Gartner.

 7                 MS. GARTNER:         Thank you for your

 8   consideration, Your Honor.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 General Clement, you

10   have three minutes remaining.

11               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

12                      ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

13                 GENERAL CLEMENT:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may

14   it please the Court:

15                 A few final points.              First of all, I don't

16   think the constitutionality of Congress's act depends on

17   whether the anatomical landmark is the navel or up to

18   the head.     Congress, as everyone recognizes, had to draw

19   a line.     I think drawing the line at more than halfway

20   out is a pretty good place to draw the line.

21                 Second, my learned co-counsel is certainly

22   correct.     This is a pre-enforcement challenge, in

23   response to your question, Justice Kennedy.                  But the

24   point is, this is a pre-enforcement spatial challenge,

25   and if the Court rejects it and allows this statute to


                                         51

 1   go into operation, it will not foreclose the possibility

 2   of a future pre-enforcement as applied challenge that

 3   focuses on particular medical conditions.               That's not

 4   something, though, that one can reach in this record,

 5   because as the district court in this case found at

 6   147a, there is no specific condition here in which the

 7   D&X procedure is particularly ready met for or otherwise

 8   is medically necessary.        Rather, the claims in this case

 9   are that it's always better.            That's what some doctors

10   say.   It's a heterodox position, it's not the majority

11   position, but it's not focussed on specific situations.

12               The other thing it's not focused on, and

13   this is in reference to something that Justice Breyer

14   mentioned, it's not focused on emergencies.               Another

15   thing that the district court noted at page 128a of its

16   opinion is that the D&E procedure and the D&X procedure,

17   neither of them are particularly good in dealing with

18   true medical emergencies where time is of the essence,

19   because both these procedures require substantial

20   advance time to do the dilation.               And since the D&X

21   procedure requires more dilation, I actually think in an

22   emergency, you'd probably end up performing the D&E

23   procedure if you performed either one, because you'd

24   need less time for the dilation in an emergency.

25               The other thing I should point out is that,


                                       52

 1   of course, there is this question about what's a

 2   significant risk.    And one thing about the lethal

 3   injection at the beginning of the process, the Digoxin

 4   injection, is the other side concedes that the mother

 5   gets to make the choice as to whether or not to do that

 6   procedure.   Well, Dr. Carhart does it as a matter of

 7   course after 17 weeks, and I certainly don't think

 8   anyone would suggest that Dr. Carhart is needlessly

 9   inflicting significant risks on his patients after 17

10   weeks by following that regimen in every case after 17

11   weeks.

12                And I think it's worth noting that the legal

13   regime that respondents would construct is a legal

14   regime where the woman can decide whether or not to have

15   that shot, Dr. Carhart can decide it for her and that's

16   okay, but Congress can't make this judgment.                  But it's

17   important to draw a line here, and say that fetal demise

18   that takes place in utero is one thing.                  That is

19   abortion as it has always been understood.                  But this

20   procedure, the banned procedure is something different.

21   This is not about fetal demise in utero.                  This is

22   something that is far too close to infanticide for

23   society to tolerate.       Thank you.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, General

25   Clement.   The case is submitted.
