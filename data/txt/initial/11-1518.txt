 6                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. BYRNE

 7                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                 MR. BYRNE:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10                 This case presents one of the most

11   confounding questions of bankruptcy law, and that is the

12   meaning of defalcation, which is found currently in

13   Section 523(a)(4) of the Code.                  It is an undefined term

14   in a Bankruptcy Code with more than 100 defined terms

15   and it has been in the Bankruptcy Code -- Bankruptcy

16   Act, excuse me, since 1841 and in every version of it

17   since then.    There is no plain contemporary, ordinary

18   meaning that we can resort to, with respect to

19   interpretation of the word because it is not in common

20   use.

21                 This case presents both the question of the

22   action required to establish defalcation and the mental

23   state that most -- that must accompany it.                       And on the

24   mental state issue, the circuits have split in probably

25   three ways, at least.

                                         3

 1                The Eleventh Circuit here held that

 2   Petitioner committed defalcation by acting recklessly

 3   and affirmed on summary judgment -- a summary judgment

 4   order that was granted for the petitioning creditor.

 5                JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, before we get to the

 6   various candidates for applicable mental state, if there

 7   is one, could you tell me what this mental state applies

 8   to?   Does it apply to facts or does it apply to law?

 9                MR. BYRNE:       Your Honor, it should apply to

10   both, but it applies -- the act must be accompanied by a

11   culpable mental state.        We will argue that -- and have

12   argued that mistake of law can be relevant to the

13   knowledge that the actor has when he commits the act,

14   and we have argued that in this particular circumstance

15   particularly involving dischargeability, that a mistake

16   of law ought to be permissible in responding to the

17   claim of defalcation.

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Well, what we have here

19   is, I think everybody agrees, that these transactions

20   were not authorized and they were self-dealing to the

21   extent that there was a benefit to Mr. Bullock from the

22   investments that were made.             So what, in addition to

23   being unauthorized and self-dealing, which the

24   government tells us should be enough to make

25   defalcation, what else other than that it was not

                                       4

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   authorized and it was self-dealing?

 2                 MR. BYRNE:        Your Honor, we believe that a

 3   showing of extreme recklessness at least is required as

 4   to the self-dealing, and so we have advocated for the

 5   First and Second Circuit standard, which requires either

 6   extreme recklessness or conscious misbehavior by the

 7   actor.

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But is a trustee who is

 9   taking -- borrowing against the cash value of the life

10   insurance making an investment for the benefit of

11   himself and his mother getting profit from that

12   investment and not sharing it with the other siblings

13   who are also.     So what more than -- I mean, he did that

14   all advertently.

15                 MR. BYRNE:        Well, Your Honor, let me go back

16   to the question, first were -- were the loans

17   authorized.     Now, this case -- the finding of

18   defalcation here is based entirely on the two Illinois

19   court orders in collateral estoppel.                     And the Illinois

20   courts specifically reserved the question of whether the

21   loans were authorized.          But let me put that aside,

22   please, and answer your second question.

23                 And what -- what sets this case apart and

24   what -- what at least creates a factual question on

25   whether Mr. Bullock committed defalcation was what was

                                         5

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   his -- what was the overall transaction.                      This is a

 2   family trust, it was created by his father, involving

 3   his father's life insurance policy.                      There is

 4   uncontradicted evidence that he did not know that making

 5   a loan to his mother at his father's request would

 6   somehow run afoul of the law more than a decade later

 7   when this all came -- when this all came to court.

 8                 So we say, Your Honor, that there is at

 9   least a factual question that would have entitled him -

10   should have entitled him to a trial on the question of

11   the mental state that accompanied his actions.

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But what about the two

13   other transactions which were not done at the bidding of

14   the father?

15                 MR. BYRNE:       Well, Your Honor, they were done

16   at the bidding of the mother and also they were -- they

17   went into the family business.                 These are two loans that

18   went into the business created by the father and the

19   mother, the garage building business.                      That's where the

20   proceeds went.    And so it would have been a surprise, we

21   say, to the average person to learn that there was a

22   legal problem with those loans.

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, I mean, it's

24   often the case that -- that children don't want to go

25   into the family business and it's often the case that

                                        6

 1   some of them do and some of them don't and the idea that

 2   one of the children who wants to put the money back in

 3   the family business is -- you know, you wouldn't think

 4   that was wrong when the other children want to take the

 5   money out or put it somewhere else.                      That's not at all

 6   unusual.

 7               MR. BYRNE:         Well, it's not unusual to have

 8   some sort of conflict about that, Your Honor.                      But the

 9   record is very limited in this case as to what the

10   preferences of the others were.                  It is -- it seems clear

11   that -

12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 Their preference is that

13   they wanted a piece of the action.                      They still do.   They

14   want the profits from that investment.                      Whether they're

15   entitled to it is a different issue, but -

16               MR. BYRNE:         That -- that position seems

17   clear now, Your Honor, that -- that background, these

18   loans were made, please, recall, in the '80s.

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:               I -- I assume the other

20   children did not have an interest in the business, but

21   just the trustee and the mother did.                      Or is that clear

22   from the record.

23               MR. BYRNE:         That is not clear from the

24   record, Your Honor.      I think I know the answer to that

25   question, but it is not in the record in the case, so -

                                        7

 1                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Could -- could you go back,

 2   please, to Justice Alito's question?                       I -- I don't

 3   understand the answer to that.                  That is, I don't

 4   understand, and it's just something I don't understand.

 5   I'm not saying it facetiously.                  I don't understand the

 6   relationship of mental state to the issue.

 7                  I mean, I didn't think there is any doubt

 8   here that the individual, your client, knew what he was

 9   doing.    He knew for a fact that he was taking money from

10   the trust.     He knew he was giving it to his mother.                    And

11   he knows where it's going.               And he knows it was later

12   paid back with 6 percent interest.                       So you don't have to

13   assume extreme recklessness.                He knew it.

14                  Now, what he didn't know was that that was

15   unlawful.     And therefore, if I look at the accompanying

16   things, embezzlement, larceny, fraud in the trust, I

17   don't think any of them require a knowledge that what

18   you're doing is unlawful.

19                  So if I -- or do they?                    I don't think -- you

20   can be convicted of embezzlement while misunderstanding

21   the law of embezzlement.

22                  You can be convicted of larceny, it's

23   saying.     And as far as I know, a person to commit fraud

24   lies, knows it's material, knows, et cetera, but he

25   doesn't have to know there's a law against it.                       And -

                                         8

 1   and so -- if I do what Justice Harlan was doing and

 2   comparing it to the other three, it looks as if you

 3   don't need to know that what you're doing is against the

 4   law, where you commit defalcation.

 5                 Now, that I think is what Justice Alito was

 6   driving at.    And I'd like to hear an absolutely clear

 7   answer on that.

 8                 MR. BYRNE:       Your Honor, let me -- let me

 9   try -- let me try to give such an answer.               The first,

10   with respect to larceny, embezzlement and fraud, a

11   mistake of law is admissible where it negates the

12   scienter or the mental state.

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:            But I didn't think there's

14   any respect here in which missing -- mistake of law,

15   would negate the mental state as to having taken money

16   from the trust, used it in the family business and then

17   paid it back, which I take it are, we assume, which is a

18   different question I have, but for present purposes, we

19   are assuming that that's sufficient for defalcation.

20                 Is that right?            Where is it and where does

21   it negative the intent in respect to what happened?

22                 MR. BYRNE:       Well, Your Honor, the knowledge

23   of the law, knowledge of wrongdoing I think is what -

24   what you're asking, where does that come into this?                  And

25   it comes into the question A, if you didn't have it; and

                                        9

 1   B, the question becomes was it extremely reckless under

 2   the scienter standard that the First and Second

 3   Circuits -- the First and Second Circuits follow -

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:            No, it had nothing to do

 5   with recklessness.     He did these three things knowingly.

 6   That is a stronger mental state than recklessness, not a

 7   weaker one.

 8                 MR. BYRNE:       Well, Your Honor, but he did it

 9   without knowing that they -

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Were unlawful.         So we're

11   back at the same question, and I'm now assuming you have

12   no answer to the question because there is none.

13                 MR. BYRNE:       Well, Your Honor, the -- in many

14   instances, not many, but in some instances, the Court

15   has held that not knowing that a practice is unlawful is

16   a defense to a charge of the crime.

17                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               My problem is the

18   following, which is let's assume he had taken the money

19   and lost it and he never repaid it.                     What does it matter

20   whether he thought he could take the money or not?                     I

21   thought the very basic definition of defalcation in

22   every dictionary of the time and forever, one of the

23   three definitions has always been that you cause a loss

24   to the -- to the trust.          Why does mental state matter at

25   all, is my bottom line?

 1                  I think that your stronger argument is that

 2   loss to the estate, or the one that you have to -- can

 3   direct your attention to, is what is the loss to the

 4   trust?     But what does it matter whether I intended to

 5   lose it or not if I wasn't entitled to lose it?

 6                  MR. BYRNE:       Well, Your Honor, the question

 7   would be whether or not on the mental state and then

 8   I'll get to the actus reus element of this quickly, but

 9   as to the mental state, if the mental state is not

10   culpable, then it seems entirely inconsistent -

11                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, that's Justice

12   Breyer's point, which is if you took the money and lost

13   it, what does it matter?            You took it.              Unless -- unless

14   you were drugged and didn't know that you were taking

15   the money and somebody else forced you to in some -

16   under some sort of duress defense, some outrageous

17   question, isn't the issue the one that Justice Breyer

18   came to?     If you're a fiduciary, why should an excuse of

19   ignorance of the law ever save you when you are required

20   to exercise the highest protection of the trust?

21                  MR. BYRNE:       Well, Your Honor, of course, it

22   does not save you from liability.                        Our issue here is

23   dischargeability, which is a -

24                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Why should you be

25   discharged if you took -- if you knowingly did an act,

 1   the actus reus -

 2                 MR. BYRNE:        Because -

 3                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                -- with its concomitant

 4   mental state.    You intended to take the money.

 5                 MR. BYRNE:        Well, Your Honor, because for

 6   dischargeability purposes, because of Gleason v. Thaw,

 7   and the rule that -- that bankruptcy discharge

 8   exceptions are confined to those plainly expressed

 9   doubts are resolved in favor of the debtor.                  And if you

10   look at the other requirements for exceptions to

11   discharge in Section 523(a) you see a high level of

12   culpable conduct.     For example, in Geiger the Court held

13   that reckless torts do not amount -

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:             Yes, but you see -- should

15   I have to write the opinion in this case, I would have

16   to deal with this issue and I'd have to say something

17   about it.    And as soon as I look at the other words,

18   those are words like "embezzlement," "larceny," and

19   "fraud."    Now, elsewhere in the U.S. Code where those

20   are crimes ignorance of the law is not an excuse.                  It

21   often is an excuse where in fact it's a tax violation or

22   some other technical violation.

23                 So I would have to explain why the word

24   "defalcation" when linked to those three is being

25   treated differently.        Or I'd have to say Congress used

                                        12

 1   words which never have ignorance of the law as an excuse

 2   and meant them differently.               Each of those is pretty

 3   hard to say.

 4                  MR. BYRNE:       Well, Your Honor, you're

 5   alluding to Cheek v. United States and Rasco v. United

 6   States, cases in which ignorance of the law, as an

 7   exception to the general rule, was found to be a defense

 8   in those cases.     And what you had in those cases was a

 9   complex legal regime.         You had the tax laws and then you

10   had the -- anti-structuring statute.

11                  And here, we say that trust law in and of

12   itself is a complex enough legal regime that a mistake

13   of law at least ought to be admissible, not for

14   liability, but for establishing bankruptcy -

15                  JUSTICE BREYER:            I have one other question

16   on a different subject that may be more helpful to you

17   or not.   I think of defalcation as the individual who

18   has defalcated shows up in Rio with two suitcases full

19   of money, and it seems to me if you look at the root of

20   the word, it consists of diminishing, taking a sickle

21   and cutting something down, and therefore it did seem to

22   refer to an instance where you take the corpus or money

23   belonging to the trust, now it becomes ambiguous, and

24   you run off with it.

25                  Is there anything you would like to say

                                        13

 1   about that?

 2                 MR. BYRNE:       Yes, Your Honor.               I would like

 3   to say that defalcation requires a shortage in accounts

 4   at the end of the day.         And so there must be -- in the

 5   trust, there must be some res missing when the trustee

 6   is called to account.

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But there is a

 8   shortage of accounts at the end of the day.                      It's just a

 9   question of what day it is.              When he takes -- takes the

10   stuff and it's a lost -- it's either viewed as a lost

11   opportunity or an increase in the risk to the

12   beneficiary, and that's a loss to them at that point.

13   The fact -- it's like a bank robber giving back the

14   money.   There is no loss to the bank, but it's still

15   crime.

16                 MR. BYRNE:       Well, Your Honor, the deletion

17   of the word "misappropriation" in 1978 from the

18   Bankruptcy Code by Congress suggests that

19   misappropriations that are on an interim basis that

20   cause -- that do not cause a loss to the trust and

21   are -- are never accounted for is not the kind of action

22   or act that should result in an exception to discharge.

23                 But if you look with respect to defalcation

24   at the definitions at the time, the definitions that

25   were available in 1841 as I believe Justice Breyer has

                                       14

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   done, the -- the definitions you get are, for example in

 2   Webster's 1828 dictionary, the act of cutting off or

 3   deducting a part.

 4               And the origin of the defalcation exception,

 5   and I believe the amici for Respondent are correct in

 6   this respect, was the Swartwout scandal in 1838, when

 7   one Samuel Swartwout, who was the -- in charge of

 8   collections for the New York Customs House, which was a

 9   substantial part of the Federal budget at that time, was

10   found after he departed the country to have $1.2 million

11   missing from his accounts.               And that was referred to as

12   a defalcation at the time and it's quite reasonable to

13   assume that's how it ended up in the statute.

14               So the loss of res there -- the loss of

15   funds to which the fiduciary is responsible for

16   collecting at the time of -- that he turns over his

17   office because this really originated with public

18   officials, is the relevant time.

19               JUSTICE KAGAN:               But I guess the question is

20   how do you measure this loss?                 I mean, if you take money

21   away and then you give it back, or even if you give it

22   back with 2 percent interest or something, I mean, maybe

23   if that money had remained in the trust and I realize

24   that this is a strange trust, but we have to think about

25   other kinds of trusts, if that money had remained in the

                                        15

 1   trust, there would have been a profit to be made from

 2   that money.

 3                 And -- you know, it's not -- if you say,

 4   well, I gave it back, well, yes, but if you had just

 5   left it there, you would have had that money plus all

 6   the money that that money earned.

 7                 MR. BYRNE:        Correct, Justice Kagan.         But

 8   here, there was never any money taken from the trust

 9   that didn't wind up with the trust at the end of the

10   day.    The evidence is that the net policy value on the

11   day Mr. Bullock unwittingly became a trustee in 1978 was

12   the same as when he, at the end of his tenure -

13                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But what -- what about

14   the profit from the transactions, the profit that he

15   made?    Yes, he paid back everything with interest, but

16   in addition to that, according to the Illinois court

17   judgment, there was a profit that he made that he didn't

18   put back in the trust -- he didn't put in the trust.

19                 MR. BYRNE:        He was -- he was charged with

20   having profited with respect to one or more of the

21   loans, Your Honor.

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             A quarter of a million

23   dollars in loans.

24                 MR. BYRNE:        That's correct, Your Honor.

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             And that did not go back

 1   into the trust.

 2                 MR. BYRNE:       It did not.

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            As it should.        Doesn't the

 4   trustee have to disgorge whatever he makes by improper

 5   use of the trust funds?

 6                 MR. BYRNE:       He -- he does for liability

 7   purposes, of course, Justice Scalia.                    But here the

 8   question is whether there is a bankruptcy defalcation.

 9   And that's a question of Federal law.

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              May I ask you question

11   that is not a technical bankruptcy question, but he -

12   the objective of filing for bankruptcy was to get rid of

13   this judgment debt, this Illinois judgment debt, right?

14                 MR. BYRNE:       Yes, Your Honor.

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And the Eleventh Circuit

16   said -- you know, we're really sympathetic to that, but

17   the problem is that the bank would not let you sell the

18   collateral.    If you could sell the collateral, then you

19   could pay off the loan and you wouldn't need to declare

20   bankruptcy.

21                 Did you bring such a suit, the suit that

22   suggests that the bank was the culpable party here by

23   not letting you sell the property which would have

24   enabled you to pay the debt?

25                 MR. BYRNE:       That -- that action has not been

 1   brought, Your Honor.        And in that action, let's say it

 2   were brought today, it could do nothing to relieve

 3   Petitioner of the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit and

 4   the lower courts here that he has a debt that is -- a

 5   substantial debt that is excepted from discharge.                     He

 6   could continue litigating perhaps if he has the

 7   resources in -- in Illinois for many more years perhaps,

 8   but -

 9                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Counsel, give me your

10   best answer to the rule that we should write, okay?

11   Forgetting that I don't accept that you need a mental

12   state, okay?     Let's go to just the loss issue.

13                  If I agree with you that you need to prove

14   the loss, this is a very unusual trust because the

15   measure of what the trust's res should be is fixed.                        It

16   was the amount of the trust plus the fixed interest,

17   essentially.     This is a very unusual trust.               In the

18   norm, the trust just says to the trustee invest

19   prudently.     And the trustee self-deals by taking the res

20   out, puts the investment in his or her own name and

21   takes the profit.

22                  In that situation, how would you measure the

23   loss?   In the normal self-dealing where the trustee just

24   has to invest prudently and is depriving the trust of

25   that investment value, would you say in that situation

                                        18

 1   that the loss is measured by the lost opportunity?

 2                 MR. BYRNE:       Your Honor -

 3                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Because there is a

 4   difference between what the trust loses and the gain

 5   that the trustee makes, which under normal trust

 6   principles the gain has to be disgorged.

 7                 Are you separating out those two things and

 8   how are you separating them out and how would I -- how

 9   would we write -- the Court write this opinion to give

10   loss meaning?    What's the -- what's the meaning you want

11   to give it?

12                 MR. BYRNE:       Your Honor, the -- the loss to

13   the trust should be measured by the economic loss to the

14   trust between points A and point B.                     And -- and it's -

15   it's as simple as that, and of course here there wasn't

16   loss to the trust.     As you point out, it's an unusual

17   situation perhaps, but of course life insurance trusts

18   and other kinds of trusts that present this situation

19   are -

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So under your theory,

21   the profit to the trustee is never a measurement.

22                 MR. BYRNE:       The profit to the trustee would

23   not come into play.      It could come into play for fraud.

24   It could come into play for embezzlement.                    It could come

25   into play if the mental state that we argue for is

                                       19

 1   otherwise met.

 2               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Assume that that is

 3   distasteful because for all the reasons the government

 4   argues in its amicus brief, the idea that a trustee

 5   could self-deal is the height of a breach of fiduciary

 6   duty.

 7               So give me something that -- that would win

 8   your case without upsetting the fact that defalcation

 9   somehow should, in the norm, include something as

10   egregious as self-dealing.            You don't think your guy did

11   because he didn't know, but let's assume the worst case,

12   the guy knew.

13               MR. BYRNE:       Well, for the -- for that worst

14   case, Your Honor, there is embezzlement in the statute.

15   So if a -- if someone comes into possession of property

16   and misuses it and does so with fraudulent intent, it

17   sounds like here, then there is a -- then embezzlement

18   can be established under the statute.

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Byrne, I -- I wasn't

20   finished asking you about the background of this.                  It -

21   it seems the simplest thing, if the bank is the culprit,

22   then why not go after the bank and then get the money

23   which would make the Chapter 7 unnecessary?

24               MR. BYRNE:       Your Honor, there is a good bit

25   not in the record on that, and I presume you want me to

 1   stick to the record in responding and there is no real

 2   explanation for that.       There is in the record a

 3   consistent track of Petitioner trying to get the bank to

 4   sell the collateral in order to pay the debt off over

 5   time and with an urgency to it because the collateral

 6   was deteriorating in value.            But beyond that, there's

 7   not anything else in the record about the practicality

 8   or availability of the remedies in the Illinois court.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But it was what the

10   Eleventh Circuit thought was a solution to this problem.

11               MR. BYRNE:        It was, Your Honor.

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And were they wrong in -

13               MR. BYRNE:        As a practical matter, Your

14   Honor, yes, and also as a legal matter because the

15   Illinois courts cannot set aside the order here

16   excepting the debt from discharge.

17               The only -- the only agenda potentially left

18   for Petitioner would be litigation in the -- in the

19   Illinois courts against the trustee to create some sort

20   of a judgment that might be used in some way to

21   ameliorate the effect of the bankruptcy court's

22   judgment, but he still has -- basically, he's been

23   consigned to permanent insolvency the way that this

24   judgment now sits.

 1   on your side of the case say, well -- you know, there is

 2   a series of words here:          Fraud, defalcation,

 3   embezzlement, larceny.

 4                 But really, fraud and defalcation are

 5   defined in a further way where embezzlement and larceny

 6   are not.   Fraud and defalcation, while acting in a

 7   fiduciary capacity, then embezzlement and larceny.

 8                 So I'm not quite sure it's there to say that

 9   all four words must be consulted for the use of

10   generous because fraud and defalcation are qualified by

11   "in a fiduciary capacity" and then a comma.

12                 MR. BYRNE:       Well, that is correct, Your

13   Honor, that -- that that's the way that this particular

14   version of the Bankruptcy Act is set up.

15                 In the past however, in Neal v. Clark, in an

16   important decision by this Court in 1878, the Court held

17   that fraud should be construed to require fraud with

18   moral turpitude because of the presence of embezzlement

19   in the 18 -

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Yes.         In that respect, I

21   think the word "fraud" gives you some assistance in

22   arguing your case.

 3              ORAL ARGUMENT OF BILL D. BENSINGER

 4                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 5               MR. BENSINGER:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 6   it please the Court:

 7               The Petitioner's act of self-dealing was a

 8   reckless breach of his fiduciary duty of loyalty and was

 9   therefore a defalcation.

10               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Was there a finding of

11   recklessness in the State court?

12               MR. BENSINGER:            No, Your Honor.          There was

13   not a finding of recklessness.               The State court simply

14   found that the debtor engaged in self-dealing.                    That he

15   used trust assets for his own purposes and, thereby,

16   created a split, a conflict of interest between his

17   interest and the interest of the trust.

18               The moment that he made those loans, there

19   is an absolute certainty that there would be a conflict

20   of interest and a reasonable person -- a reasonable

21   trustee in the Petitioner's position would not have made

22   those loans because the risk was so high, nigh on an

23   absolute certainly, that there would be this conflict of

24   interest, and that has been the harm incurred at the

25   moment he made the loans, Your Honor.

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Is the crime of

 2   embezzlement proven if you show recklessness?                 Or do you

 3   need a further criminal intent?

 4               MR. BENSINGER:            Generally speaking, Your

 5   Honor, embezzlement does require some sort of specific

 6   mental intent, an intent to deceive or to defraud.                 But

 7   defalcation does not require that same mental intent and

 8   that's borne out by the history.

 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, of course, that's

10   one of the things we are arguing about here.                 I don't

11   think that's conceded.

12               MR. BENSINGER:            No, Your Honor, it's

13   certainly not conceded, but it's borne out in the

14   history of the Bankruptcy Act.               Defalcation was first

15   added to the Bankruptcy Act in 1841 and it was simply an

16   exception to discharge for defalcation.                 There was no

17   mention of fraud, there was no mention of embezzlement,

18   there was no mention of larceny.                 It wasn't until 1867

19   that Congress, in the Bankruptcy Act of 1867, that

20   Congress added an exception to discharge for

21   embezzlement and for fraud.

22               JUSTICE ALITO:            You think recklessness is

23   required?

24               MR. BENSINGER:            I'm sorry, Your Honor?

25               JUSTICE ALITO:            You think recklessness is

                                     24

 1   required?

 2               MR. BENSINGER:            Yes, Your Honor.

 3   Recklessness is required as to the objective act.

 4               JUSTICE ALITO:            Recklessness as to the law,

 5   as to what the law requires of the trustee.

 6               MR. BENSINGER:            Recklessness as to the law,

 7   correct, Your Honor, but also as to the act.                 This was a

 8   reckless act.

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:            Oh, yes.       Wait, wait.     You

10   say -- you mean either, both?              I mean, there is no doubt

11   here, I agree with you, as far as the act is concerned.

12   It wasn't just reckless, it was intentional.                 So you

13   don't have to worry about that one.

14               Thus Justice Kennedy's basic question I'd

15   like to hear your answer to.             I thought it might have

16   come from the other side, but you -- you concede, I take

17   it, that there has to be an element in which the person

18   not only knows what he has done, but that he does it

19   with an element of moral turpitude; i.e. he knows that

20   the law forbids it or -- or are you conceding this and

21   then fill in the blanks, or?

22               MR. BENSINGER:            No, Your Honor, and I

23   apologize if I misspoke.         All that is required is an

24   intent to do the act and that's what -

25               JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.       Then if that's

                                     25

 1   your position, what do you say to what Justice Kennedy

 2   said, add in Justice Harlan's comment that embezzlement

 3   and larceny are set off.            These two concern fraud and

 4   defalcation in respect to the trust.                        There is a case of

 5   this Court that says fraud in respect to the trust

 6   requires an element of moral turpitude.

 7                  That suggests a knowledge that what you are

 8   doing violates the law.           And if we read in pari materia,

 9   we get the same kind of requirement for this, indeed

10   more so.   Indeed, you just conceded it existed even in

11   respect to embezzlement, which is outside the

12   parenthesis.

13                  MR. BENSINGER:            Your Honor, fraud, like

14   embezzlement, does require a specific mental intent, but

15   defalcation does not.         Defalcation -

16                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Why?           Defalcation on your

17   definition would seem to be more likely to be thought

18   innocent by someone who commits it in some circumstances

19   than would fraud.

20                  MR. BENSINGER:            Your Honor, defalcation must

21   mean something other than fraud.                    The statute says

22   that -

23                  JUSTICE BREYER:            No.       It may mean, for

24   example here, fine, okay, no fraud, but what you did was

25   you took some money that belonged to the trust given by

                                        26

 1   your father to help your mother.                    And your mother says,

 2   help me, and the brothers and sisters will benefit well

 3   too.   And so you go to your insurance guy and he says,

 4   sure, no problem.     And then, lo and behold, they did it.

 5   I mean, innocence just radiates from what the conduct

 6   was as described.

 7                  (Laughter.)

 8                  MR. BENSINGER:            When it's described like

 9   that, maybe, Your Honor.

10                  (Laughter.)

11                  MR. BENSINGER:            However, it was still a

12   reckless act, Your Honor, in that a reasonable

13   trustee -

14                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't understand.           Where

15   does this reckless act come from?                        Where do you get

16   reckless act out of either fraud or defalcation?

17                  MR. BENSINGER:            Your Honor, the courts have

18   traditionally ascribed -- most courts have said that

19   defalcation does require some form of reckless -

20                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Perhaps so.           Where did they

21   get it from?

22                  (Laughter.)

23                  MR. BENSINGER:            Your Honor, that's the

24   genesis of this case.

25                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               What does it matter if

                                        27

 1   the money is missing?         What does it matter the reason

 2   why in terms of recklessness or intent?                     You took the

 3   money.     Justice Breyer and I both agree you intended to

 4   take the money.     So why are you adopting the need for

 5   recklessness, unless you're trying to avoid the second

 6   component that the other side's talking about, which is

 7   that you caused a loss to the trust?                     Because that's

 8   where you have a problem here, where you have a problem

 9   because there really is no loss to the trust in a

10   traditional sense.

11                  MR. BENSINGER:            Possibly in the traditional

12   sense there might not have been a loss, but there was a

13   loss in the context of trust law, Your Honor.                     The

14   Petitioner in this case used trust funds for his own

15   benefit.

16                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, the problem is

17   that, yes, there was a breach of the trust.                     But in

18   terms of the terms of the trust, the trust got every

19   penny that it would have earned if the money had not

20   been taken.     It got the trust plus the fixed 6 percent

21   that the trust was entitled to.                   So it suffered no loss

22   in its traditional sense.

23                  MR. BENSINGER:            Maybe not in the traditional

24   sense, but in the context of a fiduciary obligation a

25   trustee is not allowed to benefit from his position as

                                        28

 1   trustee.

 2                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, the -- why are you

 3   giving away that it's not in the traditional sense?                   I

 4   think it's a loss in the traditional sense.                   The trust

 5   was entitled to whatever profit was made from the use of

 6   its funds, right?

 7                  MR. BENSINGER:            Correct, Your Honor.

 8                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            And he made a quarter

 9   million dollars that should have belonged to the trust.

10   It's not enough to say, well -- you know, I'll pay you 2

11   percent interest or whatever the going rate of interest

12   was.   He made $250,000 which should have been given to

13   the trust.

14                  MR. BENSINGER:            That's correct, Your Honor.

15   And that is what the Illinois State court found, and

16   that is borne out also by the other exceptions to

17   discharge in Section 523(a)(4).                   If a fraudster commits

18   fraud, he doesn't just remedy that by paying back what

19   he took.     He has to return all of the profits that he

20   has obtained.

21                  JUSTICE ALITO:            But the question here -- the

22   question here is not whether the trustee is liable.

23   Yes, the trustee is liable.               The question is whether

24   it's dischargeable.

25                  MR. BENSINGER:            Correct, Your Honor.

 1                  JUSTICE ALITO:            And if you look at the

 2   other, the other words in this list, fraud,

 3   embezzlement, larceny, those are -- those are bad acts.

 4   There is a degree of moral culpability involved and

 5   maybe there are people who commit fraud, embezzlement

 6   and larceny and don't realize that it's illegal, but

 7   there are not many.       It's commonly understood that those

 8   are bad.

 9                  So in a very impressionistic sense, there is

10   a difference between that and the kind of conduct that's

11   presented to us here.         But you think that's irrelevant.

12                  MR BENSINGER:          It is irrelevant, Your Honor,

13   because a reasonable trustee would not act this way.                   A

14   reasonable trustee would know that the moment he makes

15   loans to himself he has created a conflict of interest

16   between himself and his trust.

17                  JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, what about a

18   reasonable trustee who just invests very imprudently, an

19   unreasonable trustee who invests very imprudently?                   Any

20   reasonable trustee would realize that investing

21   in -- you know, the widget factory totally unrelated to

22   him is a really bad idea and money is lost there.

23                  What about that trustee?                  Is that a

24   defalcation.

25                  MR. BENSINGER:            If it's unreasonable, it

                                        30

 1   would be, Your Honor.

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:             Is it -- before we leave

 3   this conduct, I mean, I understand I was painting you a

 4   picture of they're being innocent.                      But we are in a

 5   court that this Court has described as a court of equity

 6   or akin thereto.

 7                MR. BENSINGER:             Yes, sir.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:             One principle I used to

 9   learn was he who has clean hands can come into equity,

10   but not anybody else.

11                Now, we have two lower courts that are

12   saying your client has pretty dirty hands or at least

13   they don't understand it.            That this, the other client

14   tried to get him to sell the property, but they write

15   the properties are abandoned and uninsurable.                      Even

16   though Mr. Bullock produced a buyer, they won't sell it.

17   And so do you have clean hands?                  Not you yourself.        You

18   didn't take the money and you do not have dirty hands,

19   all right?

20                But did your client here, does he lack clean

21   hands because two courts have said he should have just

22   sold his collateral and he would have gotten the money

23   and saved everybody a lot of trouble?

24                MR. BENSINGER:             No, Your Honor.

25                JUSTICE BREYER:             Because?

 1                  MR. BENSINGER:            Because, first of all, the

 2   bankruptcy court never made any specific finding of

 3   facts.     Those were allegations that were included in -

 4   in the record of the district court -

 5                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Did we remand it so they

 6   could?

 7                  MR. BENSINGER:            No, Your Honor, because the

 8   Petitioner had every opportunity to bring those facts

 9   into -- into evidence at the bankruptcy court and he did

10   not.     There are facts outside the record as there are on

11   both sides with regard to this issue, why the trust

12   would not allow subsequent sales.

13                  But it does go back to an important point,

14   and that's that the Petitioner did have, and retains

15   today, an opportunity to go back to State court and seek

16   a reduction in this judgment should he so desire.

17                  A reduction in the judgment would reduce the

18   debt, and if there is no debt, then there is nothing for

19   the trust to collect subsequent to this discharge or

20   subsequent to the lack of discharge, as Respondent is

21   requesting.

22                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              So there's nothing in the

23   record that shows why the bank refused to release any of

24   the collateral?

25                  MR. BENSINGER:            No, Your Honor, there is

                                        32

 1   not.     That was not an issue that ultimately came before

 2   the bankruptcy court.         The bankruptcy court made no

 3   finding of facts.     There were only allegations on appeal

 4   to the district court and to the Eleventh Circuit, Your

 5   Honor.

 6                  However, to return back to the point

 7   concerning that the required mental intent or the mens

 8   rea, both in the petition and here this morning, the

 9   Petitioner has not been able to articulate exactly what

10   mens rea is required, that is, what mental intent is

11   required.     But the mental intent that he asked is that

12   it be something greater than extreme recklessness, in

13   effect.

14                  However, that cannot work in the code

15   because it would make other code sections superfluous.

16   Specifically, if the mental intent required were an

17   intent to cause an injury, Section 523(a)(6) of the

18   Bankruptcy Code already accepts from discharge debts for

19   willful and malicious injury.

20                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, a number of

21   embezzlers -- not all of them -- many embezzlers fully

22   intend to pay everything back once things turn out all

23   right.     But there's still an embezzlement.             But there is

24   also a criminal intent at the time, or a wrongful

25   intent, even if -- even if you plan to pay it back.

                                        33

 1               And it -- it seems to me that you're

 2   standing very firm on the fact that defalcation means

 3   something different than fraud in the first clause, or

 4   embezzlement and larceny in -- in the following clause.

 5               MR. BENSINGER:            It does, Your Honor.

 6   Defalcation when it was first introduced into the

 7   Bankruptcy Act of 1841 had a known meaning, and that

 8   known meaning, at least according to the Oxford English

 9   Dictionary, is a monetary deficiency through breach of

10   trust.

11               That was when the -

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And the problem is, as

13   the -- your friend on the other side points out, that

14   there's two problems with this.                Number one, it's not

15   consistent with these -- with the meaning of the other

16   three terms in the -- in the statute; and two, it's not

17   consistent with the idea that discharges should be

18   freely given so that debtors can begin again.

19               MR. BENSINGER:            But, Your Honor, the

20   subsequent inclusion of the terms fraud, embezzlement

21   and larceny cannot retroactively modify or change the

22   known definition of the word defalcation.                 This Court in

23   Schwager v. Northern Burlington considered two sections

24   of -- or two statutes in the Securities and Exchange

25   Act, Section 14(e) and Section 10(b).                 Section 10(b) was

                                     34

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the first enacted statute.              Section 14(e) was

 2   subsequently enacted.

 3                 Both statutes prohibited a manipulative type

 4   of transaction with regard to securities.               Section 14(e)

 5   also prohibited a fraudulent act with regard to

 6   securities.    This Court stated in that case -- while it

 7   wasn't central to its holding -- the Court did state

 8   that the inclusion of the term "fraudulent" in Section

 9   14(e) could not modify the understanding of the term

10   "manipulative."

11                 And the same logic applies here.              The

12   subsequent inclusion of the terms "fraudulent" and

13   "embezzlement" and "larceny" cannot modify the known

14   meaning, even if that known meaning has been lost, the

15   meaning of the word "defalcation."

16                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Bensinger, if I heard

17   you correctly, you said that the definition was a

18   monetary deficiency arising from a breach of trust.                 Is

19   that -- does that mean that you're conceding that there

20   has to be a loss of monetary deficiency?

21                 MR. BENSINGER:            Your Honor, there was a

22   monetary deficiency in this case when the -

23                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            Whether there was or was not

24   in this case, but you're conceding that there has to be

25   a monetary deficiency according to the traditional

 1   definitions.

 2                  MR. BENSINGER:            Yes, Your Honor.          For there

 3   to be even a debt, which is what the Bankruptcy Code

 4   discharges, there must be a monetary deficiency in this

 5   case, or in the case of a defalcation.

 6                  And that is what this Court -

 7                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So are we fighting about

 8   the meaning of loss?        That's really the question.

 9                  MR. BENSINGER:            I'm sorry, Your Honor?

10                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Are we fighting about

11   what loss means?

12                  MR. BENSINGER:            Your Honor, that is

13   certainly an issue that the parties have contested in

14   the briefs before this Court and in the courts below,

15   whether there was a loss.             And there was a loss.              The

16   State court recognized that there was a loss in the

17   amount of $250,000.

18                  That judgment of $250,000 creates a claim.

19   The Bankruptcy Code at Section 101-5 defines a claim as

20   a right to payment.

21                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So if he made

22   nothing on the deal, and it just turns out he got

23   whatever the -- the trust was getting under its interest

24   rate and gave it back, there'd be no defalcation because

25   there'd be no loss in the sense of a lost opportunity?

 1                MR. BENSINGER:              There would be a

 2   defalcation, Your Honor, but there would be no debt in

 3   that case.   And that -- there would be nothing -

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      I'm sorry.    I

 5   understood your answer to Justice Kagan to be that

 6   you -- there must be a loss, right?

 7                MR. BENSINGER:              Your Honor, there -- there

 8   needs to be a loss for there to be a debt.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      Right.    Does there

10   have to be a loss for there to be a defalcation?

11                MR. BENSINGER:              No, Your Honor.

12   Inconsistent in that answer, I apologize.                         I did not

13   intend to be.     There must be a loss for there to be a

14   debt.   For there to be a defalcation, that merely goes

15   to the bad act.     The act of, in this case, self-dealing.

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                      So taking the money

17   out is sufficient for defalcation even if it's brought

18   back in full and even if there is no lost opportunity.

19                MR. BENSINGER:              Correct, Your Honor.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:              That's not consistent with

21   the original meaning of defalcation to which you were

22   appealing.   It's pretty clear to me that the original

23   meaning of -- is a cutting off, a failure to turn over

24   money that was due.       So you -- are you appealing the

25   original meaning or not?

 1                  MR. BENSINGER:            Your Honor -

 2                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            You're saying defalcation

 3   just means breach of trust.               That's it.

 4                  MR. BENSINGER:            No, Your Honor.   We're

 5   saying that in this case, the breach of trust, the

 6   self-dealing, was that cutting off of the -

 7                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            And that's what made it a

 8   defalcation, no?

 9                  MR. BENSINGER:            Correct, Your Honor.

10                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, so then you say there

11   has to be a cutting off.            There has to be a loss, for

12   defalcation.     Not just for -- for a debt, but also for

13   the defalcation.

14                  MR. BENSINGER:            Your Honor, at that point,

15   there was a -

16                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why are you fighting that?

17   You're going to have to prove the loss anyway.                  You say

18   there is a loss.

19                  MR. BENSINGER:            Your Honor, the loss in that

20   case occurs -- Your Honor is absolutely right -- at the

21   time that there is that cutting off, at the time in this

22   case the Petitioner used the trust assets for his own

23   benefit.

24                  JUSTICE BREYER:            And then what's the loss?

25   I mean, let's assume the trust was worth $1 million plus

                                        38

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   6 percent, and every year, they have in their coffer $1

 2   million plus 6 percent.

 3               MR. BENSINGER:             Your Honor -

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:             The only part they don't

 5   have is the extra money that the trustee made, that

 6   there is no cutting down of the size of the trust.                 At

 7   least that's an argument.           Now, what's the answer?

 8               MR. BENSINGER:             Because, Your Honor, the

 9   loss occurred.   There was a loss in the amount of the

10   loans that he took out.         And that loss was compounded,

11   if you will, Your Honor, by the Petitioner's failure to

12   return those -- the proceeds of those loans -

13               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                But he did.   This is the

14   unusual part of this trust, which is that by the terms

15   of this trust, it was only going to grow at principal

16   plus a fixed interest.        Most trusts are not written this

17   way.

18               This is the highly unusual trust, where it

19   never -- should have made more money because taking the

20   Chief Justice's hypothetical, which is he had invested

21   it and just gotten the interest due, why would there be

22   a defalcation?

23               What's the loss opportunity or the loss that

24   you would have suffered?

25               MR. BENSINGER:             Your Honor, the loss that

                                      39

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the trust suffered was that its principal was taken

 2   away, was it invested by the trustee for his own

 3   benefit -

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Yes.       But let's assume a

 5   different fact scenario, that he didn't make $250,000,

 6   that he happened to make just the amount of the interest

 7   required, and he paid all of that back just as he did

 8   here, what would have been the defalcation under the

 9   Chief Justice's hypothetical?

10                MR. BENSINGER:            The defalcation there, Your

11   Honor, would be that the trustee has split his interest,

12   has created a conflict of interest, and that causes a

13   loss.   There might not be a monetary -- a straight

14   monetary loss at that time.

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I've never heard of a

16   defalcation that didn't result in some monetary loss.

17   What would have been the monetary loss in the Chief's

18   hypothetical?

19                MR. BENSINGER:            In that case, Your Honor,

20   there would not have been a strict monetary loss in that

21   hypothetical had the -- all the proceeds -- had there

22   not been any benefit that the trustee obtained from the

23   investment and use of those funds.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But there is still a

25   loss.   I mean, when you're investing obviously the

                                      40

 1   return is part of it, but also the question is what risk

 2   you assume.    And the trust would have suffered because

 3   during that period they were incurring a greater risk.

 4   That's one reason you set up a trust, so you don't -

 5   you protect people from that risk.

 6                 MR. BENSINGER:             That's correct, Your Honor.

 7                 Thank you.

12                 MR. GANNON:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

13   please the Court:

14                 No particular mens rea is inherent in the

15   term "defalcation" or the structure of Section

16   523(a)(4).

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Unlike fraud -- fraud,

18   larceny and embezzlement?

19                 MR. GANNON:         Each of those terms does have

20   some mens rea associated with it.                        It is not, however,

21   the willfulness requirement that my friend was invoking

22   on the other side.      There is no obligation under any of

23   those that there be an intentional violation of a known

24   legal duty.

25                 There are specific intents to defraud, but I

 1   think we know that this can't be -- it can't have that

 2   mens rea because that would make it superfluous.                    That's

 3   what Judge Hand said in the Herbst decision, and that's

 4   what even the Second Circuit and the First Circuit

 5   recognized here, that they could not adopt the same mens

 6   rea that belongs with the other terms here and I -

 7                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Because?

 8                  MR. GANNON:        Pardon?

 9                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Because?       I mean, I thought

10   defalcation is -- supposes that the person does pack his

11   suitcases with the money and he goes and shows up in

12   Rio.     I take it that would be defalcation.                 That isn't

13   fraud.

14                  MR. GANNON:        That would probably be

15   embezzlement and it would be superfluous in that sense.

16   I think that the dictionary definitions, if you look at

17   the dictionary definitions of defalcation that we quote

18   on pages 10 and 11 of our brief, both the English

19   dictionary definitions and the legal dictionary

20   definitions, they basically -

21                  JUSTICE BREYER:            But you didn't cite to the

22   Latin, did you?

23                  MR. GANNON:        Pardon?

24                  JUSTICE BREYER:            But you didn't have the

25   Latin definition, which I take it from my colleague and

                                        42

 1   it was confirmed by my law clerks, it comes from

 2   medieval Latin, starting with a sickle and meant to cut

 3   down, to cut down, and that suggested reduction.

 4                 MR. GANNON:         We did quote the Samuel Johnson

 5   dictionary and the Webster's 1828 dictionary that have

 6   that meaning.     If you look at the Oxford English

 7   Dictionary definition, that was an obsolete meaning.

 8                 And I think that it's quite clear that the

 9   meaning that Congress was invoking here is what is dealt

10   with under heading five in the Oxford English

11   Dictionary.     And my friend quoted it earlier, there is

12   either a monetary deficiency through a breach of trust

13   by one who has the management or charge of funds -

14                 JUSTICE KAGAN:             Well, monetary deficiency,

15   again, isn't that a loss?             But I thought that your

16   position was that there didn't need to be a loss.

17                 MR. GANNON:         Well, there are two questions

18   there and I think that one of the illustrative

19   quotations that the OED uses for that very definition

20   doesn't actually refer to a monetary deficiency, and

21   neither do most of the other dictionary definitions.                  So

22   I do think that there's probably an open question about

23   what the purest meaning of the term defalcation, whether

24   it requires a loss.

25                 Here, we do think that there is a loss.

 1   There is a loss in a very real and traditional sense.

 2   There is no doubt about it that because the Petitioner

 3   took -- engaged in self-dealing and made a profit with

 4   that, with the money that he had taken out of the trust

 5   corpus and refused to return those profits to the trust,

 6   that is a loss to the trust, just as it would be had he

 7   taken the money and invested it in some great investment

 8   scheme and -- or he decided to bet it at the track -

 9               JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, that's certainly

10   true -

11               MR. GANNON:        -- and he decided -

12               JUSTICE KAGAN:            -- in an ordinary trust, but

13   isn't there a real question as to this trust because if

14   this trust would -- the trustee shouldn't have been

15   investing this in the first place.                    All that this trust

16   was going to get was the principal plus a fixed income.

17               MR. GANNON:        I don't think that's a fair

18   statement of the way this trust operates.                    It's not

19   consistent with Petitioner's own arguments.

20   Petitioner's argument in the State court and in the

21   Bankruptcy Court, the argument that he says is the

22   reason why there is no -- no determination about whether

23   this was an authorized use of the money under the trust

24   instrument is that -- that he was allowed to invest the

25   assets of the trust.

 1                 And so the way the courts -- and the parties

 2   have offered to lodge the trust instrument with the

 3   Court.    As I understand it it's not otherwise in the

 4   record.    But the point here is that he did -

 5                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Would you just repeat

 6   what you said?    Your voice turned.

 7                 MR. GANNON:        The last part I said, that the

 8   parties have offered to lodge the trust instrument with

 9   the Court, but my understanding is that it's not in the

10   record.    But I don't think anybody has taken the

11   position that the only thing that could ever be in the

12   trust was the life insurance policy plus 6 percent.

13                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               That's what I

14   understood.    So you're saying that that is not the case?

15                 MR. GANNON:        I believe that that is not the

16   case and that is not even consistent with Petitioner's

17   own position in the State court, where he said he was

18   taking this money and investing it in some alternative

19   thing because he thought that would be safer than

20   leaving the money with the life insurance company.

21                 And I think if I can go back to explaining

22   why I think that this is a loss and so I think that this

23   trust is not as unusual or unique as you think it is, in

24   part because we don't have the language of it in front

25   of us.

 1                But secondly, I was trying to say that had

 2   he taken this money for an authorized purpose or not and

 3   decided he was going to go invest it, he had some boffo

 4   scheme, he had some friend who had a great stock tip, or

 5   he had a tip at the races and he was going to go down to

 6   the track and bet this money, he made 1,000 percent.

 7                And he decided, well, you know what, had I

 8   not taken the money out of the trust all I would have to

 9   do is return, all I have to do is make it whole in the

10   sense of having the 6 percent that it otherwise would

11   have had.   That everybody would understand, that's a

12   breach of his duty of loyalty.                 That's a defalcation.

13   It is an injury to the trust.                It is a loss in every

14   relevant sense.

15                And in addition here, the $35,000 that the

16   State court awarded for attorney's fees and costs is

17   also another concrete loss to the estate.                 And this

18   Court's decision in Cohen v. De la Cruz, which was about

19   nondischargeability of a fraud judgment, of a debt for

20   fraud, said that that debt for fraud included all of the

21   legal liability associated with the underlying fraud -

22                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                But there is two

23   components of the award, the attorney's fees plus the

24   $250,000 profit.   And you're representing to me right

25   now that, as a trustee, he was entitled to invest that

                                       46

 1   fund for the trust?     And so there was a lost opportunity

 2   here as well?

 3                MR. GANNON:        It's not that there -- it's not

 4   the opportunity loss.       It's not the fact that the trust

 5   wasn't already earning the interest in the -- vis--vis

 6   the insurance company as it otherwise would.

 7   Petitioner's position is if he already gave back the

 8   money that it would have earned in interest vis--vis

 9   the insurance company, my position, the government's

10   position, is that the loss here is that he failed to

11   disgorge the profits that he made by self-dealing in the

12   assets of the trust corpus.             That is a -

13                JUSTICE BREYER:            What about the other

14   argument?   I just don't want you to leave without

15   addressing the other argument.

16                MR. GANNON:        The other argument -

17                JUSTICE BREYER:            In your brief you talk

18   about and quote "Learned Hand" and say it means -- "If

19   it doesn't mean a deliberate malversation," said Learned

20   Hand -

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:            "Malversation."

22                JUSTICE BREYER:            -- then it must be the same

23   as fraud or embezzlement.           So I will go look up

24   "malversation" as soon as I return to my office, and I

25   will get that.

 1                Now, the other argument was, yes, fine, a

 2   loss.   Two, done deliberately, but with an innocent

 3   state of mind because he didn't understand the law.

 4   Justice Kennedy quoted, fraud -- from this Court, that

 5   fraud in bankruptcy for purposes of this provision

 6   requires some degree of moral turpitude.                   Well, that

 7   suggests that you aren't innocent in respect to

 8   knowledge that it's against the law.                   What about that?

 9                MR. GANNON:        My response to that is that the

10   Neal v. Clark decision that's being discussed here is -

11   and we discuss this in our brief -- is distinguishable

12   in part because its current descendent is not this

13   provision.   It is not this reference to fraud.                  It is

14   the exception from discharge in paragraph (a)(2)(A).

15                And what makes this different is that this

16   is fraud in a fiduciary capacity which was not true in

17   the context of Neal v. Clark, and that's something that

18   the Court said at the time, that because it did not

19   actually have the limitations of the fiduciary context,

20   they needed to infer some type of limitation.                   They

21   inferred it, the Court inferred it, from embezzlement.

22                And so going back to Justice Kennedy's

23   question, the way Congress has dealt with that is that

24   it has put actual fraud in (a)(2)(A), and here it has

25   grouped fraud with defalcation in a fiduciary capacity

                                      48

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   and therefore it includes the type of limitation that

 2   the Court was trying to impose in Neal v. Clark.

 3               We don't think that there is any inherent

 4   mens rea in defalcation and -

 5               JUSTICE ALITO:            Could you explain what you

 6   mean, before your time expires, in footnote 18?              I

 7   understood your argument until I got there, but then you

 8   said that there was no particular mental state required.

 9   And then in footnote 18 you said, well, there may be

10   cases where a particular mental state is required.

11               MR. GANNON:         Well, I think when it gets

12   further away from the heartland definition of

13   defalcation, which does -- which, as was discussed in

14   this Court's 1844 decision in Chapman and in the 1841

15   bankruptcy law, the defalcation was equated with

16   self-dealing in trust assets.              And so we think that's

17   the heart of defalcation.

18               As you move away from that particular type

19   of fiduciary breach, and if you move away from there it

20   may become more relevant whether there is -

21               JUSTICE ALITO:            Where are courts supposed to

22   look to find out what is the border between the

23   heartland of defalcation and the badlands of defalcation

24   and whatever else?

25               MR. GANNON:         Well, to be fair, the

                                     49

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   dictionary definitions are broad enough to include other

 2   types of fiduciary breaches, but it's not clear that

 3   that means that defalcation needs to be doing all the

 4   work here of potentially putting limits on the scope of

 5   the exception.

 6               And so if you look at the Ninth Circuit, for

 7   instance, the way it has handled this is it has

 8   recognized, as we do, that defalcation can be innocent

 9   and -- but it has, it has concluded that the essence of

10   defalcation is the failure to account for or to produce

11   funds, and therefore it wouldn't be something that would

12   just be garden variety mismanagement of the assets.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Well, why not?          I mean,

14   it's a -- it's a violation of the trustee's

15   responsibility when he makes a negligent investment of

16   the funds, right?

17               And so he doesn't turn over as much money as

18   should be turned over.          It's a defalcation.

19               MR. GANNON:           Well, we certainly do think

20   that that may well be the ultimate answer.                       We think

21   that would be further away from the core of defalcation,

22   but it's not this case, so we would urge the Court to

23   affirm.

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                       Thank you, counsel.

 1             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. BYRNE

 2                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 3               MR. BYRNE:          Thank you, Your Honor.

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  Is it your position that

 5   he couldn't have invested this?                   Let's assume that he

 6   knew -- that he knew.

 7               MR. BYRNE:          Assuming he knew, Your Honor, he

 8   could -- his position is and it was -- it was true his

 9   position in the State court was that he could have

10   invested it, but -

11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  As a trustee for the

12   trust.

13               MR. BYRNE:          As a trustee for the trust.

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  Okay.    Then you may be

15   losing this case.

16               MR. BYRNE:          Well, Your Honor, that is -

17               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  Because if he could

18   invest it for the trust, why isn't the loss -- isn't it

19   a loss for the trust that he took this opportunity away

20   from the trust?

21               MR. BYRNE:          Well, Your Honor, the -- of

22   course, the Illinois court never decided whether he was

23   right about whether he could actually invest the money

24   other than as -- as specified.

25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  Let's assume he could

                                        51

 1   have.

 2               MR. BYRNE:         If you assume he could have -

 3               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 Then why isn't the loss

 4   of opportunity?

 5               MR. BYRNE:         Well, Your Honor, the -- the -

 6   the trust instrument, I think you'll see does not

 7   expressly authorize him to do that.                     He's making -- he

 8   was making an argument -

 9               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 Let's assume his

10   argument that he could.

11               MR. BYRNE:         If the argument is or if the

12   trust provided that he could invest in other things and

13   it made him prudent investments, then there could be a

14   loss to the trust.     Then his mental state would -- would

15   be poor.

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 Then we have to go back

17   to -- to the first issue, whether a mental state is

18   required or not.

19               MR. BYRNE:         That's correct, Your Honor.

20   Now, to respond to a few things said by Respondent and

21   by the solicitor, the Petitioner actually did put into

22   the record when he opposed summary judgment pro se in

23   the bankruptcy court all of his evidence about what

24   he -- what should have been done with the money that was

25   in the constructive trust, what should have been done

                                       52

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   with the property that was in the constructive trust

 2   during that period.

 3               He put that in -- in evidence, it's in the

 4   record and his repeated pleas that the assets be sold to

 5   pay the judgment are reflected by that.

 6               The Respondent relied entirely on the two

 7   Illinois court orders and put in no evidence other than

 8   the original pleadings, if they are evidence, in the -

 9   in the Illinois case.      So there is that question about

10   the record, and Petitioner did track what -- what his

11   efforts were to try to persuade the trustee to consent

12   to the sale of the property.

13               And it's interesting, the constructive

14   trust, of course, was imposed on the properties that

15   were acquired with loans two and three.               So if there are

16   any profit from the loans, they would have been caught

17   in those properties.     And eventually, of course, they

18   were not sold.

19               But to determine the amount of the loss

20   here, a trial would be needed.               And that's really why we

21   were hoping the Court will give us -- give Mr. Bullock a

22   day in court here to establish under the proper legal

23   standard what any loss really was, if there was one.

24               And it was said earlier that a conflict of

25   interest itself is a defalcation, but not if there's no

                                     53

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   loss.     That's just -- that's entirely inconsistent with

 2   the other exceptions to discharge in the Code.

 3                  Mr. Gannon read the -- noted that the

 4   dictionary definitions evolved over time, but the 1856

 5   definition of defalcation from Bouvier's Law Dictionary

 6   that's quoted in the government's brief actually still

 7   reflects the -- the idea that -- or the definition that

 8   defalcation is the act of a defaulter.                   And a defaulter

 9   is defined as, "one who fails in making his accounts

10   correct."

11                  So by 1856, years after the first enactment

12   of defalcation, that was still the definition that was

13   prevailing in the day, at least according to that

14   dictionary, and according to the others that -- that we

15   cite earlier.

16                  Petitioner here made a mistake in judgment.

17   There was never any finding of dishonesty on his part.

18   There was never any finding that he acted with a

19   malicious intent.     In fact, there was a finding that he

20   acted with no apparent malicious intent in the Illinois

21   courts.     This question is one of dischargeability, and

22   his debt is really what bankruptcy is for.                   It's for a

23   fresh start for an honest, but unfortunate debtor.

24                  Unless the Court has any further questions,

25   that concludes my argument.
