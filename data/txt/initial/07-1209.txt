 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  We will hear

 5   Sanders et al.

 7                ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. MILLER:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court.

11               Congress has directed the Veterans Court to

12   take due account of the rule of prejudicial error in

13   reviewing administrative determinations of veterans

14   benefits.   For four reasons, the court of appeals erred

15   in holding that the Veterans Court should presume the

16   existence of prejudice whenever it finds that the VA has

17   erred in providing notice to the claimant.

18               First, section 7261, the Veterans Court

19   prejudicial errors statute, is in language that is

20   essentially identical to that of the APA's prejudicial

21   error provision.    And when Congress adopted that

22   language in 1988, it was understood to place upon the

23   party challenging an agency's action the burden of

24   showing that any error was prejudicial.

25               Second, a notice error of the kind at issue


                                         3

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   here does not --

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Why do you say that?      That

 3   it was understood so?      Because of the Attorney General's

 4   commentary on that?

 5              MR. MILLER:         The principal reason that it

 6   was understood is because the uniform practice in the

 7   courts of appeals as of 1988 was to place upon

 8   challengers to agency action the burden of showing

 9   prejudice from the error.          And the Congress was well

10   aware of that, and in particular the Senate Veterans

11   Affairs Committee was cited in the Ninth Circuit's

12   decision in Seine & Line Fishermen's Union.

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  You basically have

14   four cases in the courts of appeals to support that

15   proposition, right?

16              MR. MILLER:         Well, Your Honor, it's

17   considerably more than that.            And the only cases that

18   could even suggest any support to the contrary rule are

19   in the very different context of notice and comment

20   rulemaking under section 553.

21              And the reason that that's different is

22   really for two reasons.        That is that the -- the

23   interest that section 553 is intended to protect is not

24   the interest of any particular commenter or particular

25   outcome of the rulemaking.          It's the interest of the


                                        4

 1   public in having the agency's decisionmaking fully

 2   informed by all of the relevant comments.

 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, but this is --

 4   I mean, it's kind of the -- it's the first notice.                  It

 5   gets the ball rolling.        I think it's like, you know, two

 6   teams and you don't tell one of the teams when the game

 7   starts and then you say, well, it doesn't matter because

 8   they would have lost anyway, there is no prejudice.

 9              MR. MILLER:          The reason that in a great many

10   cases there is not going to be prejudicial error of the

11   kind at issue here is that the VA has an informal

12   non-adversarial system and many opportunities to correct

13   the effect of any official notice error.                 That is

14   illustrated by the history of the cases.                 To take the

15   Ms. Simmons's case, for example --

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Can we go back to the

17   question that was just posed?              We have never held that

18   every agency -- agencies come in many sizes and shapes,

19   but in all cases, the APA places the burden on the -- on

20   the petitioner.    But this Court has never held that

21   across the board, no matter what agency we are talking

22   about, that's the rule.

23              MR. MILLER:          That's correct.          This Court has

24   not held that.    But Congress was aware that the uniform

25   practice, certainly in agency adjudications in the


                                         5

 1   courts of appeals, was to place the burden on the

 2   challenger, and Congress --

 3                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Was Congress aware of this

 4   when the Administrative Procedure Act was passed, you

 5   mean?

 6                MR. MILLER:         No, the statute at issue here

 7   is the Veterans Judicial Review Act of 1988.                  So the

 8   relevant time we are looking at what the practice was is

 9   as of 1988 when Congress incorporated the language from

10   the APA and placed it into section 7261.                  And as of

11   1988, it was clear that the burden was on the

12   challengers.

13                JUSTICE ALITO:           Can I ask you to clarify

14   exactly what you mean by the "burden" of showing

15   prejudice?     Is it correct that neither of the following

16   -- to borrow the terminology that you would use in

17   formal litigation, and I understand this is not formal

18   litigation before an agency, but to borrow that

19   terminology, is it correct that the issue here doesn't

20   concern either the burden of production or the risk of

21   nonpersuasion before the administrative agency?                  Before

22   the regional office?        In other words, if there's -- if

23   there is evidence that the veteran as opposed to the VA

24   has to produce, that doesn't change, and whatever the

25   standard is that has to be met to show an entitlement to


                                          6

 1   benefits, that doesn't change either, so that all that's

 2   involved here is whether -- whatever showing needs to be

 3   made is to be made on appeal or on remand?

 4               MR. MILLER:          That's correct.               If we are

 5   talking about what showing needs to be made on appeal.

 6   And as this Court suggested in O'Neal, you know, the

 7   burden language is perhaps more appropriate for the

 8   context where there's people presenting competing

 9   evidentiary submissions to a factfinder and that's not

10   what we have here.

11               JUSTICE BREYER:               That's in O'Neal.           It says

12   that, but most of the court joined and the reason it

13   says it is it just confuses everybody, at least me, to

14   talk about "burden" in this context.                       I think if O'Neal

15   is right, it says what this is, is not involving a jury,

16   not involving -- it's just what Justice Alito says, and

17   following that, what you have, you say to the judge,

18   "Judge, your job is to decide this.                       Decide.   Decide

19   whether you think that the one side -- whether there is

20   error or whether the error is harmless or whether it

21   isn't.   Decide it."

22               Now, it could be in a rare instance the

23   judge just can't decide.           He's in grave doubt.               And so

24   what we are talking about is what to do in that -- what

25   should be a very, very rare instance.

 1               Now, when I read this case, I thought the

 2   Veterans Affairs is absolutely common sense on this.                     It

 3   says, well, when you really don't know what to do,

 4   Judge, if the veteran got no notice at all, then

 5   probably the error was harmful.                But if he got the basic

 6   notice, and all that's at issue is who should produce

 7   what or whether he thinks that he didn't know that he's

 8   supposed to produce a lot of information, well, there,

 9   it would be pretty rare that it was harmful.                   So then

10   you'd better say to him, veteran, why did this hurt you?

11               That's all common sense, and it seemed to me

12   that that's what the Veterans Court was saying and then

13   the Federal Circuit unfortunately, like I might have

14   done, too, got it all mixed up with this burden of proof

15   language.   Now, you tell me, legally is that result

16   which I am talking about sensible, and if so, how do I

17   get there legally?

18               MR. MILLER:          Justice Breyer, the reason that

19   we have used the language of "burden" --

20               JUSTICE BREYER:               I'm not criticizing you for

21   that.   I'm not -- it's not a criticism.                  I'm just really

22   trying to figure out to get to what I see as common

23   sense legally.

24               MR. MILLER:          The point that we are trying to

25   emphasize is that, in the ordinary course the Veterans


                                          8

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Court, like any court, is going to act on the basis of

 2   arguments that are presented to it by the parties.                So

 3   when you speak of the "burden," you mean the challenger

 4   has the obligation, if it wants the Veterans Court to

 5   find prejudice -- to articulate some theory of how there

 6   was prejudice.   And that --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:             The theory is he didn't

 8   know anything about this, got no notice whatsoever, so

 9   he didn't know that he's supposed to produce more

10   information or he'll lose.          That's the theory.

11               MR. MILLER:        But in order to -- in order to

12   connect that error -- I mean, that's an identification

13   of an error under the Veterans Claims Assistance Act.

14   But if you connect error --

15               JUSTICE BREYER:             But if you connect it by

16   saying normally a veteran who isn't that knowledgeable

17   -- not everybody is a genius in law -- when he doesn't

18   get a notice that tells him you got to produce something

19   more or you lose, he might forget to produce something

20   more.   That's the theory.

21               MR. MILLER:        If he has something more.       And

22   what we are saying is that in order to get a remand, the

23   claimant, by the time they get to the Veterans Court,

24   has already identified the error, has made an argument

25   to explain to the court that there was in fact an error,


                                        9

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   at that point they ought to explain how the error

 2   affected them.    If it prevented them from put in a piece

 3   of evidence, they ought to tell the court, "Here's the

 4   piece of evidence that I want to put in."

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, usually, when

 6   you have an appellate court, with a hard question, is

 7   easily divided, the case is resolved on the basis of the

 8   standard of review.      What is the presumption, if it's a

 9   close case?    And why isn't that all sort of what we are

10   talking about here?      It's a close case, and the judge --

11   the panel says, well, this side has the burden of

12   persuasion, so we're going to come out the other way.

13                 MR. MILLER:       Because I think in a case where

14   the -- like these, where plaintiff has not identified

15   anything that they would have done differently, it isn't

16   a close case with respect to the question.

17                 Now, we have to be clear:                  If a claimant can

18   articulate something they would have done differently,

19   we are not saying they have the obligation of showing

20   that the outcome definitely would have been different or

21   more likely than not, it would have been different.                    It

22   would be sufficient to identify what they would have

23   done differently.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, what if what

25   they would have done differently is get different

 1   medical tests, or done something like that, or have the

 2   doctor in the prior testing who prepared the diagnosis

 3   look at something that they didn't have them look at

 4   before?   In other words, it's not simply the absence of

 5   documents that they know they can submit or could have

 6   submitted.     It's that type of question where nobody

 7   knows.    I mean, you don't know what would have happened

 8   if they had the doctor look at the issue that now turns

 9   out to be critical, but if they had gotten the right

10   notice they might have had time to do that.

11                MR. MILLER:         Well, depending on the state of

12   the record in a particular case, that might be

13   sufficient to show a reasonable probability that the

14   outcome would have been different.                   But in a lot of

15   cases it won't be, and I think Simmons's case is a good

16   example of that.

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But if the government has

18   the obligation at the very first to tell the veteran

19   what the veteran must produce to substantiate the claim

20   and the government doesn't do that, why shouldn't it be

21   the responsibility of the government to say to the

22   court, "this is what, if we had done what we were

23   supposed to do, this is what we would have included in

24   our notice."    And looking at that, the court can tell

25   whether there's anything the veteran might have done.


                                         11

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   But why shouldn't the government at least have the

 2   obligation to say what it would have done had it

 3   complied with the statute, what it would have said

 4   specifically in this case?

 5               MR. MILLER:        Well, I mean, how does the

 6   government comply, to take Simmons's case as an example,

 7   when the VA sent her the notice letter, her claim was

 8   for an increased rating.         She had a hearing loss that

 9   had already been determined to be service-connected, but

10   was not sufficiently severe to be compensable, and she

11   said:   My hearing has gotten worse and it now is

12   severely worse to be a compensable disability.          The

13   notice letter that was sent to her, which is on page 43

14   of the joint appendix, was incorrect and simply

15   described the general requirements for establishing a

16   service connection.     It didn't specifically say to make

17   out an increased rating claim you have to show that your

18   hearing has become worse.

19               But as soon as she got a decision from the

20   regional office, which is the first decisionmaker in the

21   VA system, she was told that the reason her claim had

22   been denied was because her hearing loss was not

23   sufficiently severe.      And there's a mechanical

24   application of the certain number of decibels in each

25   ear yields a certain disability rating, and the notice


                                       12
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that she got from the regional office explained all of

 2   that and cited the regulation that we produced in the

 3   tables.

 4               So at that point she was aware of why her

 5   claim had been denied and what was missing, namely,

 6   evidence that her hearing had become worse.                   And she had

 7   been given at that point a series of hearing

 8   examinations -- examinations for hearing by VA doctors

 9   and the results of those were all reproduced in the

10   decision that she got.       And yet, the Veterans Court

11   found that the government had failed to carry its burden

12   of showing a lack of prejudice, because we couldn't show

13   as a matter of law that there was no way she could

14   obtain --

15               JUSTICE BREYER:            Which is fine.         If I get

16   that record and if it is the way you describe, I'm not

17   in grave doubt.   No problem.           The record's the way you

18   described it, she knew everything she was supposed to

19   know, so there's no harmful error, okay?                   We are only

20   talking about cases where there is real doubt in the

21   judge's mind about whether this failure of the agency

22   did or did not hurt the woman or man.                   Now, when in

23   doubt, we have the Veterans Court telling us the best

24   way to administer this stuff is when they get no notice

25   at all, and you are really in doubt, judge, you don't

 1   know if it was harmful or not, here's what you do:

 2   Assume it was harmful.        They're the ones who know.       I

 3   don't know.

 4                 MR. MILLER:       With respect, Your Honor, I

 5   don't think that's a fair description of the effect of

 6   the rule adopted by the court below.

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Suppose then we look at our

 8   rule, we read the first paragraph, what this court said,

 9   and we all held it, and therefore, we say, those are the

10   cases we're talking about, where you are in doubt, and

11   when you are in doubt, go proceed as the Veterans Court

12   told you in terms of who has to show what.

13                 MR. MILLER:       I think this case is a good

14   illustration about why that sort of grave doubt you are

15   describing doesn't arise in a case like this, where at

16   no state in the proceedings has the claimant offered

17   anything that they would have done any differently.             If

18   they can't say, you know, here's what would have

19   happened differently, than there really isn't any doubt

20   what will happen on the remand, because if on the remand

21   if they don't do anything different then the result is

22   not going to be any different.

23                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Maybe I am not following

24   this as I should, but it seems to me you are suggesting

25   that there is no error.

 1                 MR. MILLER:        No, certainly there was an

 2   error.     There was an error.

 3                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            What was the error?

 4                 MR. MILLER:        The error was that the initial

 5   letter that was sent to her describing what the evidence

 6   needed to -- that she needed to submit in order to

 7   establish her claim, misidentified that evidence; that

 8   it described the elements of general claim for service

 9   connectiveness, didn't specifically explain what was

10   needed just an increased rating claim.

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Are you saying that error

12   was not prejudicial because the earlier information she

13   received gave her what she needed?

14                 MR. MILLER:        The principal reason why that

15   error was not prejudicial is because the only way she

16   could have received benefits for an increased rating

17   claim was evidence that her hearing had become worse.

18   And she had a VA hearing test that said her hearing did

19   not meet the schedule A criteria for being compensable

20   damages.

21                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Why wasn't that statement

22   you just made sufficient to discharge the burden of

23   showing no prejudice?

24                 MR. MILLER:        The fact -- I -- we believe it

25   shouldn't, then.    But under the rule as imposed by the

 1   courts below, it clearly wasn't.

 2                Under the decision of the Federal Circuit,

 3   the VA has the burden of showing that there was no way

 4   that benefits could have been awarded as a matter of

 5   law.   And that had been in effect prior to the VA

 6   proving negative by demonstrating the non-existence of

 7   any evidence anywhere that might have been material to

 8   the claim.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  You know -- it's

10   easy to look back and view this in the abstract legal

11   terms, but we are dealing with lay people who are trying

12   to get something from the government, which is always a

13   difficult thing.     And you have one notice saying you

14   have got to show that this was during the service, then

15   they get another notice or decision saying it wasn't

16   severe enough.     Why is it so difficult, when the

17   government made a mistake in dealing with this layperson

18   who is just trying to get benefits to which they are

19   entitled, to say that the government has to show that it

20   didn't make any difference, rather than requiring the

21   layperson to do that?

22                MR. MILLER:         Well, because there are two

23   responses.    The first is that it's important to keep in

24   mind the stage of the proceedings which this inquiry

25   involved.    The prejudicial inquiry is only at issue once


                                         16

 1   the claimant has reached the Veterans Court, which is an

 2   adversary proceeding in which claimants do have counsel,

 3   and they identified an error and they have explained to

 4   the court:    Here's what the error was.                  So that's the

 5   stage in which it would be incumbent upon them to

 6   articulate how the error might have affected them.

 7                 The other point to be made is under the rule

 8   of the court of appeals it's going to be very, very

 9   difficult in many cases for the government to discharge

10   the burden of showing there is no evidence that could

11   have possibly been produced.              And the result is a large

12   number of remands.

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And as between the two

14   courts, the court of appeals, the Veterans Court and the

15   Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, do we owe

16   either of them, maybe not deference in the Chevron

17   sense, but some deference because of their expertise in

18   dealing with these claims, and if that is so then do we

19   owe more deference to the court of appeals or the

20   Veterans Court?

21                 THE WITNESS:         I'm not aware that this Court

22   has ever --

23                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I mean it's an issue of

24   law, so I take it it's de novo.

25                 MR. MILLER:        It's certainly that.

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But in the exercise of

 2   that review, don't we have to give some weight to the

 3   determination of the Court of Appeals for Veterans

 4   Claims that sees these claims all the time?              I actually

 5   thought that that's where you were going to start out

 6   because you cited 7261, which says that the Court of

 7   Appeals for the Federal Claims shall, what, give due

 8   effect to -- take due account of the rule of prejudicial

 9   error.   And I think you could get from that that they

10   have a certain amount of latitude in determining what

11   the best rule is.    But you're not going to -- you don't

12   tell us that?

13               MR. MILLER:         No, and I think that by

14   adopting language from the APA using the same language

15   that applies to all kinds of judicial review of agency

16   actions, Congress strongly suggested that it didn't want

17   a unique rule for judicial review of VA determinations.

18   And so I think there is no reason to defer to either the

19   Veterans Court or the Federal Circuit on this general

20   question of the standard of prejudicial review.

21               JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I ask a factual

22   question.   You said most of these people were

23   represented by counsel.         There used to be a rule that

24   they could only be paid ten dollars a case.              Is that

25   still in effect?

 1              MR. MILLER:          When I said they were

 2   represented by counsel, I meant in the Court of appeals

 3   for Veterans Claims, not at the administrative --

 4              JUSTICE STEVENS:              But not during the nisi

 5   prius proceeding.

 6              MR. MILLER:          In the administrative

 7   proceeding the restrictions on payment of counsel have

 8   now been relaxed at the Court of Veterans Appeals stage.

 9   So there generally -- there is not counsel at the

10   regional office, but once the case reaches the board

11   there can be counsel.

12              JUSTICE STEVENS:              There can be counsel.   But

13   is it really typical?

14              MR. MILLER:          I don't know the statistics on

15   that, because --

16              JUSTICE STEVENS:              There would be a dramatic

17   change, because years ago I remember a case in which the

18   Court upheld a ten-dollar fee limit on the notion that

19   these people didn't need lawyers at all, which struck me

20   as a little strange.

21              MR. MILLER:          In any event, that is no longer

22   the case at the board level, and even those claimants

23   who do not have counsel, the great majority of them, I

24   think about three-quarters at the regional office level

25   and 98 percent at the board level are represented by


                                        19

 1   some sort of non-attorney representative, either service

 2   organizations like the American Legion, or many States

 3   have organizations that assist claimants.                    Like Ms.

 4   Simmons, for example, was represented by a North

 5   Carolina State agency before the VA.                    So there is some

 6   assistance to claimants there.

 7               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Mr. Miller, could you help

 8   me out on how the system works in practice in a

 9   different way?   One of your answers a few moments ago

10   was that when -- I think it was Ms. Simmons was told why

11   she lost, she in effect got as much notice as she would

12   have needed to have to in effect do better on a remand.

13   My first question is:      Is there an automatic right to a

14   remand?

15               MR. MILLER:        If you are talking about after

16   the initial decision from the regional office, there is

17   not an automatic right to a remand, but there is an

18   automatic right to a de novo review by a more senior

19   official at the regional office.

20               JUSTICE SOUTER:            With new evidence?

21               MR. MILLER:        Yes.       You can get a hearing.

22   You can present new evidence.             It's a decision review

23   officer.   And then if you are still dissatisfied with

24   the resolution after that, you can go to the board, and

25   you can get a hearing before the board.                   The board's


                                       20

 1   review is de novo.

 2              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Okay.       But even on the --

 3   on the functioning of the system as you have explained

 4   it, at the -- at the very least the person says -- let's

 5   assume Simmons says:        Oh, now I understand and I will

 6   get the following piece of evidence, which I didn't

 7   realize was my responsibility.

 8              Even on that explanation, it means that the

 9   claimant is going to have to go through another stage in

10   the administrative litigation process.

11              So I assume that ought to count as some sort

12   of prejudice, and I assume it's something that, as it

13   were, the burden of championing the VA ought to bear

14   rather than the claimant.

15              MR. MILLER:           Well, I guess to the extent

16   that the delay in adjudicating the claim is a kind of

17   prejudice, it's not a prejudice that would in any sense

18   be cured by a remand for further proceedings, which will

19   just result in further delay.

20              JUSTICE ALITO:             If the -- I'm sorry.        I

21   didn't mean to interrupt.

22              MR. MILLER:           I would just add that the --

23   the effective date of the claim, which is the date as of

24   which benefits are awarded, is the date the claim was

25   filed, so you wouldn't be losing money when you --

 1   except for the --

 2              JUSTICE SOUTER:              No, but you are going to

 3   have to go through another stage of litigation.             One of

 4   the functions of the burden rule, and it might be too

 5   subtle a function to worry much about, but one of the

 6   functions is to puts the party with the burden on -- on

 7   notice that if you fail in your obligation, you're the

 8   one who is going to have to pay, unless you can convince

 9   everybody that there was in fact no harm done by this.

10   And this induces the party with the burden to do what

11   the primary obligation says the party ought to do.

12              And on your -- and on your analysis, since

13   the government would not have that obligation, the

14   government has less of an inducement to follow the

15   statutory obligation.

16              MR. MILLER:          But the government has a very

17   strong inducement to follow the statutory obligation.

18   Like every agency -- -

19              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Well, it may have a strong

20   inducement, but I'm talking about a stronger one.             If

21   the government knows that it is going to bear the burden

22   of any doubt about the significance of its failure, to

23   some extent I suppose that is going to induce the

24   government to be on its toes.

25              MR. MILLER:          Well, I suppose that is right,


                                        22

 1   but I think in a lot of cases -- the VA in all cases

 2   strives conscientiously to comply with its statutory

 3   obligations.     The notice requirements as described in

 4   section 5103 are fairly vague.                They -- the notice has

 5   to be tailored, at least to some extent, to the nature

 6   of the claim that's presented.                And every time that the

 7   Veterans Court or the Federal Circuit elaborates on

 8   exactly what kind of notice is required, to the extent

 9   that the VA wasn't aware of that elaboration before,

10   there are going to have to be remands in all those

11   pending cases.

12                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, I mean that's the

13   essential problem with common law adjudication.               And

14   there is not much we can do about that.

15                 MR. MILLER:        But it's a problem that is

16   particularly acute here, given the volume of claims that

17   the VA has.

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What is the experience?

19   When the case is remanded, it goes back to the -- does

20   it go back to the regional?              Suppose the -- the veteran

21   is now given an opportunity to present whatever

22   additional substantiation.

23                 MR. MILLER:        The claim, when remanded from

24   the Court of appeals for Veterans Claims, goes back to

25   the board.    In most instances the board would then send


                                         23

 1   it back to the regional office for further development.

 2                 If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

 6                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE

 7                    ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT SIMMONS

 8                 MR. MEADE:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10                 I would like to make three points.               First,

11   because notice is integral to the system that Congress

12   designed, the VA's failure to provide notice is likely

13   to prejudice the veteran.

14                 Second, it would be difficult for the

15   veteran and comparatively easy for the government to

16   carry a burden.    It would be difficult for the veteran

17   because under the government's rule the veteran would

18   need to engage in a speculative exercise, identifying

19   what evidence would have been developed had the veteran

20   been notified and had he received the full assistance of

21   the agency.

22                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Why is it a speculative

23   enterprise?    If you are correct, and the proper

24   resolution in a case like this is a remand, let's say

25   all the way back to the regional office, and if before


                                        24

 1   the regional office it's the veteran who will need to

 2   come forward with some evidence supporting the claim,

 3   why does it make sense to remand the case to the

 4   regional office if there is no possibility that when the

 5   case gets back there the veteran can come forward with

 6   medical evidence that's needed?

 7                MR. MEADE:       Two reasons, Justice Alito:

 8   First, it's not clear even in the Veterans Court that

 9   the veteran will have notice of what's required, a point

10   I would like to address.

11                But, second, if it's remanded, the process

12   will develop as it should have in the first place,

13   because under the statutory scheme there is both the VA

14   and the veteran, the informed veteran, who have joint

15   duties and together during an interactive process they

16   develop the evidence together.               And during this

17   interactive process, to answer to Justice Stevens's

18   question, the veteran is prohibited from hiring a

19   lawyer.    Without having the most basic notice of what's

20   required, the veteran cannot participate in this

21   process.    And the only way we can know how the process

22   would really work would be to give the veteran the

23   notice that he was entitled to in the first place and

24   then allow the process to unfold as it should have.

25                JUSTICE ALITO:          What if you have the

 1   situation -- and I think actually your co-Respondent's

 2   case illustrates this better than yours.                But you have a

 3   situation where the record as it has developed contains

 4   some evidence that supports the veteran's position and

 5   some evidence that supports the position in favor of

 6   denial of benefits.     The Veterans Administration all the

 7   way up through the process finds that the evidence

 8   contrary to the veteran's position is much stronger and

 9   denies the claim on that basis.             The veteran says:     I

10   didn't get notice of what exactly I needed to prove.

11              Now, if on remand to the regional office

12   it's still going to be up to the veteran to come forward

13   with medical evidence showing hearing loss or vision --

14   connecting the vision loss to something that happened in

15   the service, why does it make sense to send it back if

16   there's no possibility that the veteran is going to be

17   able to do that when the case gets back?

18              MR. MEADE:        Well, the answer is, first of

19   all, that we don't know how the process would unfold

20   once the veteran has notice.           Even if there is evidence

21   in the record, we don't know what evidence would have

22   been developed had the veteran had proper notice.

23              In addition, veterans often are not --

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Excuse me.       Why is that?

25   I'm not sure I follow you on that point.                Once he's got

 1   up to the next level and finds what the notice should

 2   have told him, why can't he come up with it then?

 3                MR. MEADE:        Well, for a few reasons.       First

 4   of all --

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:             You say it's a de novo,

 6   right, at this next level?

 7                MR. MEADE:        First of all, it's unclear

 8   whether the veteran would even have notice even at that

 9   point.    None of the other requirements that the agency's

10   is required to give are the same as the notice

11   requirement.     However, if in appropriate cases they have

12   given the actual notice by the time it reaches the

13   Veterans Court, they can use that to rebut the

14   prejudice.     And that's what the Veterans Court said in

15   Vasquez-Flores.

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             In your case did your

17   client attend the initial hearing?

18                MR. MEADE:        There was a medical examination

19   that she didn't attend.          There was a question of where

20   the notice was sent, and this is at 70a of the

21   Petitioner's appendix.         There was confusion.

22   Apparently, notice was sent to the wrong address by the

23   agency.

24                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, what's the first

25   time that your client knew that this claim was going to


                                         27

 1   be processed at a particular time or the first time your

 2   client knew it had been denied?               I just was never clear

 3   on the fact of what happened.              If the notice was lost in

 4   the mail, so how did she know there was a hearing at

 5   all, or did she?

 6                MR. MEADE:       She later informed the agency

 7   that she had changed her address.                 But even it appears

 8   that further notices were sent to the wrong address.

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I'm just trying to -- it

10   seems to me at the first hearing, if she in fact is

11   there, they say, well, now you have to give us some

12   notice.    And then at that point -- or some

13   documentation, and at that point, at the initial

14   hearing, everybody knows who has to produce what.

15                MR. MEADE:       But there is not necessarily a

16   hearing.    It was a medical examination that was supposed

17   to be scheduled that she didn't attend, partly because

18   of confusion of where the notice was sent.

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Is there usually an

20   initial hearing?

21                MR. MEADE:       No.       There's only a hearing if

22   the veteran requests it.

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Okay.

24                MR. MEADE:       There is no hearing unless the

25   veteran requests it.       So here we have a situation where


                                        28
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the veteran did not know what she needed to provide.

 2   She has two sets of claims, one for her left ear and one

 3   for her right ear.      Neither claim was intuitive.               And

 4   she couldn't figure out what she needed to do without he

 5   notice --

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:             And so, why not just say

 7   that?    What's the big problem of saying, judge, and then

 8   you say just what you said?              And then the judge again

 9   won't be in doubt any more.              So there's no need for this

10   case because, either -- either -- either the veteran's

11   agency will say, look, I walked that veteran through the

12   process, I walked him through the process, walking him

13   through the process he was told everything he needed to

14   know, and there is no real problem here.                   It's just a

15   formality that he didn't get the notice.                   And if that's

16   true, I'm not in any doubt, unless the veteran tells me

17   that that's wrong, and here was something, okay?

18                On the other hand, we have your case.                  Your

19   case, she didn't go to the doctor.                   If she went to the

20   doctor, maybe she would have found something out.

21                Again, I have no doubt, there is harmful

22   error.   So this case is a theoretical law professor's

23   case that is never going to come up, because there is

24   never any doubt.   Either the VA did walk him through it

25   and it's no deal -- big deal, because she can't come up

 1   with anything, or she can come up with something.

 2                 MR. MEADE:       I agree that burdens only matter

 3   in a handful of cases, but it makes sense to put the

 4   burden on the government for a number of reasons.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:            It certainly does because

 6   it makes sense to tell the government:                      Government, you

 7   have to come up with every possible conceivable factual

 8   scenario and prove there wasn't a man from Mars who came

 9   in, and -- you know, that doesn't make sense.

10                 MR. MEADE:       But that's not what we ask for

11   here.    First of all, if the veteran actually received

12   notice during this dialogue that the government

13   describes, then the government can point to that as a

14   way to disprove prejudice.

15                 Second of all, veterans are often

16   vulnerable.    They are often unrepresented in the

17   Veterans Court.    Under the latest statistics, 64 percent

18   are unrepresented at the beginning of the Veterans

19   Court, 24 percent at the conclusion of the Veterans

20   Court.    Many have psychological and mental disabilities

21   like post-traumatic stress disorder.                      Twelve percent of

22   those who currently receive disabilities receive

23   benefits for PTSD.

24                 And it's not clear -- this is not lawyers;

25   this is not doctors trying to receive benefits.                      This is

 1   not just lay people.        They are veterans who served the

 2   country --

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:            I know all this and why

 4   don't you just tell the judge that and say:                   Look at my

 5   client, judge, look at my client.                  My client obviously

 6   isn't going to understand what to do unless the client

 7   is told.     And here my client wasn't told.

 8                 I'm the judge, I'm not in any doubt, you're

 9   going to win, okay?

10                 So what I can't figure out is how to deal

11   with this case, which as I said strikes me as a law

12   professor's case that shouldn't make any difference in

13   any real situation.

14                 MR. MEADE:       The reason is that it's helpful

15   to have presumptions to deal with the typical case where

16   we have in our case a first element notice error.                   The

17   question where the veteran does not even know what

18   evidence he needs to put forward, in that case it makes

19   sense because of the high likelihood of prejudice to

20   have a general rule that the burden should be on the

21   government and not on the veteran.

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No court is going to

23   accept as a showing of prejudice the idea that, here,

24   look at my client as a layperson who didn't know what to

25   do.   That's not going to be adequate, is it?

 1               MR. MEADE:        I don't think it would be.

 2   That's why it makes sense to have a general presumption.

 3   In cases where the government can either show that the

 4   process worked as it should have or that the veteran

 5   actually received notice during the process, it can

 6   rebut that prejudice.

 7               In fact, in 2008 alone, the government has

 8   been able to do so.      And it has done so at least a dozen

 9   times in a number of cases, rebutting the burden of

10   prejudice that was established by the Veterans Court.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  What's wrong with

12   Mr. Miller's response that at the very first level of

13   review, you can start all over; and at that point you

14   know precisely why your claim was denied?

15               MR. MEADE:        Well, again, there are various

16   levels of review.    But the notice to start that first

17   level of appellate review does not necessarily give the

18   veteran the notice that she is entitled to.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  That was my

20   question.   Is it -- is it -- I take it it's more than

21   just a stamp saying "denied," right?                     There is some

22   explanation in every case?

23               MR. MEADE:        Exactly.          There is a statutory

24   requirement that a statement of reasons needs to be

25   provided, but the statement of reasons don't necessarily


                                        32
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   correlate with the detailed requirements under the

 2   notice statute.     Under Vasquez-Flores what the Veterans

 3   Court said was that the notice needs to be quite

 4   detailed and the denial letter in a particular case

 5   might not map on to those particular requirements.

 6              In October of this year, Congress went

 7   farther and said:     We want these notice letters to be

 8   even more detailed.       We want to give the veterans more

 9   notice, which shows that the Congress is concerned about

10   these notice letters and wants to make it clear to the

11   veteran what is required.

12              Let me answer a point that Justice Alito

13   raised before.     We are not asking here for a presumption

14   of benefits.     All we are asking for is a remand so that

15   the veteran can get notice and have the process proceed

16   as it was meant to in the original circumstance.

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Does the -- the notice

18   can be given -- skipped entirely, as it was in Simmons

19   case, or notice could be given but it's defective.                 It

20   can be defective in a major way, it can leave out -- you

21   said Congress recently required a more detailed notice.

22   Do we treat all those like, as long as the notice

23   doesn't measure up fully to their statutory requirement,

24   then the veteran goes back to square one?                 And so, you

25   wouldn't make any distinction between whether the notice


                                         33
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   was not given at all, and the case where the notice was

 2   given, but it was incomplete?

 3              MR. MEADE:       The question of whether the

 4   notice is okay or not, is a question for the Veterans

 5   Court, a factual finding.

 6              Generally, though, I would agree with you

 7   that either no notice or incomplete notice are the same

 8   and would trigger a first notice error.                There would be

 9   cases, I suspect, where the notice was erroneous, but

10   only on a technical ground, that the Veterans Court

11   would not think of as being a first level notice error.

12              One final point I would like to make, Your

13   Honor, is that in passing the statute Congress made it

14   clear that it wanted to assist all veterans, including

15   those whose claims did not appear meritorious on their

16   face, and it did so by overruling the decision in Morton

17   v. West in the Veterans Court.

18              That case has said that a veteran needs to

19   meet a certain minimal threshold before receiving VA's

20   assistance, that first the veteran needs to show that

21   the claim is well grounded.           Congress rejected that in

22   passing the statute and said:            Congress wants to help

23   all veterans, including those whose claims don't seem

24   meritorious on the face and including those who can't

25   make a threshold requirement.            And Congress specifically


                                      34
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   rejected the policy rationale of the Veterans Court and

 2   said that they want -- Congress wants to use resources

 3   to help all veterans, including those whose claims are

 4   not meritorious on its face.

 5              Thank you, Your Honor.

 9             ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. LIPPMAN

10            ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT SANDERS

11              MR. LIPPMAN:         Thank you.             Mr. Chief Justice,

12   and may it please the Court:

13              Justice Br eyer, I would like to address one

14   of the observations you made applying O'Neal and

15   Kotteakos and the "grave doubt" standard.

16              The problem here is that those standards

17   assume a fully developed record.              That's why it's not a

18   perfect fit here because the very notice failure, the

19   defective notice, prevents a fully developed record.

20              JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, it seems -- what I

21   was trying to get to, which I don't see how to quite get

22   there -- it seems to me that if something really went

23   wrong, if there -- there's no notice, that "veteran, you

24   have to put in some material, or you are going to

25   lose," if there is no notice of that, and he really


                                      35
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   didn't get any notice during all this cooperative

 2   process, then I think the Veteran's Court is right.                   At

 3   that point I think it's fair to assume that he's hurt.

 4                But if he got the notice -- and there'll be

 5   a few cases where he had nothing to produce, but a lot

 6   of them he would have had something to produce.                They

 7   know it, we don't know.         The Veteran's Court knows.            Now

 8   the other three matters -- who is supposed to produce

 9   what, and do you have general knowledge, can you produce

10   whatever you want -- I would think it would be very rare

11   that a veteran was hurt, if he knows the first, by not

12   knowing the second, third and fourth.

13                And therefore, I think he better come forth

14   to explain in the brief, in the brief, why this matters.

15   Now, that's what it seemed to me the Veterans Court set

16   up.   They know about it.         They set that up.      It's common

17   sense.    So, how do I get to a legal result that says

18   just that?    Or can I or should I?

19                MR. LIPPMAN:         I don't think you should, and

20   if my case could be used as an example --

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Your case is one where

22   the veteran did get what they call the first level

23   notice.

24                MR. LIPPMAN:         Correct.

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So Justice -- the


                                        36

 1   implication of Justice Breyer's question is that your

 2   client would lose, because your client did get the first

 3   level notice and you say that that's not good enough.

 4              MR. LIPPMAN:          That's correct.              He did not

 5   get the second or third level of notices; that is, what

 6   the government said it will get and what he was required

 7   to get.

 8              This is the letter or part of the letter,

 9   critical part of the letter he got.                     It says:   "We are

10   making reasonable efforts to help you get private

11   records or evidence necessary to support your claim."

12   So he had every reason to assume that the -- that the VA

13   would get the evidence that was necessary.

14              JUSTICE ALITO:           Why doesn't this make sense

15   in your case?   I think this illustrates what is

16   troubling to me about the Federal Circuit's decision,

17   but maybe I am missing the point.

18              Your client was denied benefits for failure

19   to show a causal connection, to show that his vision

20   loss is service-related.         He provided evidence from two

21   private ophthalmologists or optometrists providing very

22   weak causes of -- evidence of causation.                    One said it

23   was not inconceivable that this was the cause of it.                       He

24   was examined by two VA doctors, who said it was more

25   likely that this was caused by post-service infection

 1   rather than by an explosion while he was in the service.

 2                 Now if the case -- if the notice was

 3   defective, why does it not make sense to say to your

 4   client, show us that you can come up with some medical

 5   evidence that shows that this is service-related,

 6   something more than a doctor who says it's not

 7   inconceivable?

 8                 Then it makes sense to remand it.            But if

 9   you can't do it on appeal, what sense does it make to

10   remand it, where the same failure to provide evidence is

11   going to doom his claim?

12                 MR. LIPPMAN:         Two answers to that, Your

13   Honor.

14                 The first is, the government makes the

15   proposition that all we need to do is offer an

16   explanation.     But in legal terms, that is a proffer on

17   appeal, and that is every bit as evidential as the

18   actual evidence itself.          Now, if we -- if we are to have

19   a whole practice of proffers, it opens up a Pandora's

20   box.     I mean, where -- where do you stop if you make an

21   exception for extra-record evidence, when the statutes

22   make it clear that the evidence or whatever you are

23   using has to be before the agency.

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Why is that such a tough

25   thing to do?     It sounds like it's sort of -- is there

 1   some law out there that stops you from saying in the

 2   brief in a paragraph that, we would just like you to

 3   know, Judge, that we had some evidence here, or we have

 4   some now that we want to present to them.                    That's all.

 5                 And then if I see that, I would say, my

 6   goodness -- and you describe it in three sentences.                    Now

 7   what is -- the Constitution doesn't stop you from doing

 8   that, does it?     What stops you from doing that?

 9                 MR. LIPPMAN:         The statutes stop you from

10   doing that.

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:            They stop you, but the

12   Veterans Court said to do it.               So -- and they are the

13   one who know this area and they said you should have to

14   do it.

15                 MR. LIPPMAN:         But with all due respect, I

16   think the Veterans Court got it wrong.                    I mean --

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Between me and the Veterans

18   Court, as to who knows best how to work this system,

19   it's ten to one it's not me.

20                 MR. LIPPMAN:         Okay.       Let's look at it this

21   way.     Let's take it outside the VCAA context.                 A veteran

22   has a right to a hearing, an evidentiary hearing, upon

23   request.     Let's say he requests the hearing, and for

24   whatever reason the VA doesn't schedule one.                    He loses

25   that right even though he requests it.                    Are we then now

 1   to have proffers on the court of appeals saying, well, I

 2   would have said this, I would have said this, I would

 3   have said --

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:            What they decided there is

 5   if there's no notice at all, no, you don't have to have

 6   a proffer, because it's up to the agency to do just what

 7   you want.   But if it's one of these other three, far

 8   more technical things, which occur far more rarely, on

 9   that one, you better tell the judge in the brief how it

10   makes a difference.

11               That's their conclusion.                    What's wrong with

12   that?

13               MR. LIPPMAN:         Well, there -- there is

14   certainly no analysis to it.            I mean, it's sort of an

15   intuitive distinction and in my case, it doesn't work.

16               And I think --

17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, the -- the statute

18   says, and this is consistent with Justice Breyer's line

19   of questioning, that the Veterans Court, the Court of

20   Appeals, the Veterans Court of Appeals, shall give due

21   account to the notice -- to the rule of prejudicial

22   error.   That seems to me to indicate that it has some

23   discretion in how to decide the harmless error rules

24   that it will apply, and that it knows more about it, in

25   Justice Breyer's term, than either we or the Court of

 1   Appeals for the Federal Circuit.                 Why can't I get that

 2   out of this statute?

 3                 MR. LIPPMAN:         Well, I guess you would have

 4   to reconcile the more specific statute that deals with

 5   only able to submit evidence or any other material at

 6   the time -- at the of the agency's adjudication.                      In

 7   other words, I don't see that statute allowing

 8   post-agency adjudication proffers or even submitting

 9   evidence.     I mean, just by the very line of your

10   questioning, it seems to me that you find it

11   interchangeable whether you assert it in your brief that

12   this is what I would have done or whether you would have

13   submitted the evidence itself.                They are both

14   evidential.    And another problem, which is really --

15                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Your position seems to be

16   not that the government should have to show prejudice,

17   but as applied to a case like yours, that there is an

18   irrebuttal presumption of prejudice.                      What could the

19   government show?    They would have to show that there is

20   not a single ophthalmologist in the country who, if he

21   or she examined Mr. Sanders, would find that the vision

22   loss was attributable to a bazooka explosion in World

23   War II?

24                 MR. LIPPMAN:         No, Your Honor.             The -- what

25   the government must show is well set forth in the


                                         41

 1   Federal Circuit's opinion.           It must show that the

 2   claimant had either actual knowledge of what he needed

 3   to submit; second, that he had some constructive

 4   knowledge, in other words a reasonable claimant would

 5   have had notice; or three, that the claim couldn't

 6   entitled to benefits as a matter of law.

 7               So that's the beauty --

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:             -- but I don't understand

 9   that.   I mean, let's suppose, contrary to your wishes,

10   that the client was not hurt.              He was hurt by some other

11   thing, nothing to do with the bazooka.                    That's not your

12   client -- that's the imaginary client -- but everything

13   else is the same.

14               Well, does that mean because they forgot to

15   tell the client that the client has to go and produce

16   some evidence, and she thought the Veterans

17   Administration would produce all the evidence?                     Because

18   they forgot that, your client wins and gets the money?

19               MR. LIPPMAN:          Well --

20               JUSTICE BREYER:             That doesn't seem --

21               MR. LIPPMAN: -- he wouldn't get the money,

22   okay?   Because all -- we are talking about a remand, not

23   a --

24               JUSTICE BREYER:             I know.          Now you are going

25   to be back in the remand and you now have to produce

 1   some evidence, don't you, or you lose?

 2                 MR. LIPPMAN:        Correct.

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So then why is it a big

 4   deal that you summarize what you're going to produce in

 5   the brief?    We're back where we started.

 6                 MR. LIPPMAN:        Let me answer it this way.

 7   Let's assume we do make proffers, as you suggest, at the

 8   Veterans --

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I might have called them a

10   proffer.    I just want to say it's a description in the

11   brief of how you're hurt.

12                 MR. LIPPMAN:        Well, in the legal sense I

13   consider it the same thing.             Maybe Your Honors don't,

14   but I do.    And -- let -- let's say he proffers or

15   describes in his brief what medical evidence he needs to

16   submit.

17                 How could he in good faith make a proffer

18   and speculate on what the doctor -- let's say he is

19   seeing a treating doctor.           And on page 49 in the

20   footnote, there is a discussion of what I'm going to

21   explain to you now.      But let's say he alleges, well, if

22   I had gotten notice, I would have gone to my treating

23   doctor, and I would have submitted questions and I would

24   have submitted the claims file, but I can't know in good

25   faith what the doctor would say.                It's inherently

 1   speculative.     And that's one good policy reason, apart

 2   from the clear categorical language of the statute.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  You started earlier,

 4   at one point, to say how this actually worked out in

 5   your case.     Could you just spend a minute to explain

 6   that?

 7                MR. LIPPMAN:          How --

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  How it makes a

 9   difference in your case.

10                MR. LIPPMAN:          Sure.       It was a little unclear

11   until a case -- if I may answer it this way, Your Honor.

12                My -- the Board of Veterans Appeals decided

13   there was only one medical evidence it would follow, and

14   that was the 2000 VA exam.            And that exam really denied

15   the veteran because there was no corroborating medical

16   evidence contemporary with his injury and the

17   symptomology thereafter.           If I could have it go back

18   down, what I would do is try to find what we call "buddy

19   statements," lay statements, that would corroborate that

20   he had symptoms from time of service and well on, which

21   under a case called Buchanan is sufficient evidence to

22   base a finding of service connection.

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So why wasn't that

24   enough for you to establish prejudice, regardless of who

25   had the burden?

 1               MR. LIPPMAN:         To make that allegation at the

 2   court of appeal that I would have gotten this?

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Uh-hmm.

 4               MR. LIPPMAN:         Quite frankly, I don't know if

 5   I would have gotten it.        I mean, I would try.

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, you would

 7   phrase the prejudice in terms of what you would have

 8   done and what you weren't able to do, and which you can

 9   now go back and do if it's remanded.                    You don't have to

10   have the evidence that three people would say he was

11   complaining about the vision loss at the time.                   It just

12   seems a reasonable thing to -- you know, maybe it is

13   reasonable, maybe it's not; but the Veterans

14   Administration has more knowledge about that.

15               MR. LIPPMAN:         Your Honor, in a way, the

16   third prong of the Federal Circuit's analysis does that.

17   It tells the government:         Look, if the veteran could not

18   prove his claim, no matter what the facts -- evidentiary

19   development was, then the veteran loses.

20               So really it's all contained in the third

21   prong.   And that's why the Federal Circuit's analysis in

22   my opinion is so good.       It's because it doesn't make you

23   go outside of the record to reach these issues, and it

24   allows the government a lot of room to prove that it's

25   not worthwhile, this claim's not worthwhile to, remand.

 1               I ask the Court to really carefully look at

 2   that because I know the Federal Circuit spent -- must

 3   have spent a lot of time in coming up with that

 4   analysis.

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Do you know where this

 6   first level, second level -- I'm looking at the statute

 7   on page 98a of the petition.             And it seems to me all

 8   part of one.    It is one notice?             It doesn't seem to

 9   specify a second and a third.              It's describing the

10   contents.

11               MR. LIPPMAN:          Well --

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              "As part of that notice,

13   the Secretary shall indicate which portion of the

14   information and evidence is to be provided by the

15   claimant and which portion by the Secretary."              The

16   statute seems to be talking about one notice, not "first

17   level," "second level."

18               MR. LIPPMAN:          Well, they haven't enumerated

19   it, Your Honor, as such.          But analytically it breaks

20   down to that.   But the fourth element, because it says,

21   look, you'll have to tell the claimant what the

22   contents, what you need.          Then it says, well, what we

23   are going to get for you, and then that's the second.

24   And third one is what you have to get.

25               The fourth one was engrafted upon it because

 2   addition to this --

 4   out, the fourth one.       No?

 5              MR. LIPPMAN:           Not to my knowledge, Your

 6   Honor.

 7              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               And tell me what that is.

 8   It's not in the statute?

 9              MR. LIPPMAN:           No, it's in 3.159.          I don't

10   recall the exact -- it's 38 C.F.R. 3.159.                  I don't

11   recall offhand the exact subdivision, Your Honor.

12              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, it just tells that

13   the Secretary requests the claimant provide any evidence

14   in the claimant's possession that pertains to the claim.

15              MR. LIPPMAN:           Right.

17   straightforward.

 1                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 2              MR. MILLER:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 3              I would like to make just three points.

 4   First, on the question of what is provided to the

 5   claimant after the denial in the regional office.

 6   Before they get to the Board of Veterans Appeals, the

 7   regional office issued them a statement of the case, and

 8   that's described at 38 C.F.R. 19.29, and that regulation

 9   has fairly detailed requirements about what has to be in

10   there in terms of a description of the evidence, the

11   description of the applicable laws and regulations and

12   analysis of the board's conclusions, or the regional

13   office's conclusions and its application of the law to

14   the evidence.

15              The second point --

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So you think it's

17   perfectly clear from that what gaps need to be filled

18   in?

19              MR. MILLER:         In many cases, it would be.

20   But perhaps there would be some where it wouldn't, and

21   of course in those cases if there can be some

22   articulation of why it wasn't then we would agree --

23              JUSTICE SOUTER:             At that point is the

24   claimant disentitled to have a lawyer?

25              MR. MILLER:         No.      Once they file the notice


                                       48

 1   of disagreement in the regional office and receive the

 2   statement of the case, they could then have a lawyer in

 3   the board.

 4                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            But at the point they get

 5   the notice and they are trying to evaluate the

 6   significance of the notice, they are not entitled to a

 7   lawyer?

 8                 MR. MILLER:        If you are referring to the

 9   statement of the case, by the time they receive the

10   statement of the case they are at the stage of the

11   proceedings where they could get a lawyer.

12                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well --

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But what about the notice,

14   the original notice?        They don't have a lawyer at that

15   point?     That was Justice Souter's question.            I didn't --

16                 MR. MILLER:        Oh, if you meant the original

17   notice required by the statute.                No.

18                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            No -- at the point where

19   the statute requires original notice, they are not

20   entitled to a lawyer.

21                 MR. MILLER:        Correct.

22                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            We agree on that.   Now,

23   they have gone through stage one of the litigation and

24   they have lost.     And they are getting a statement of

25   reasons.     At that point, are they entitled to have a

 1   lawyer?

 2               MR. MILLER:         Yes.

 3               JUSTICE SOUTER:             But whether -- I guess the

 4   situation that I am concerned with is, the person up to

 5   that moment not only does not have, but is not entitled

 6   to have a lawyer.    The person then gets a piece of paper

 7   in the mail that says, "You lost.                 These are the

 8   reasons."   If the person -- if the claimant then says,

 9   "I don't know what they are talking about.                 I will go

10   get a lawyer," then I can understand at that point a

11   relatively sophisticated mind is going to come in to

12   understand it.   But if the client simply reads it and

13   says, "I really don't know what they are talking about

14   here or at least I think I know what they are talking

15   about, and I guess it's hopeless," the person is not

16   likely to have legal advice.

17               And what I'm getting at is that the person

18   at that stage, at the moment the notice arrives, is in a

19   position, I would think, of extreme relative

20   disadvantage.

21               MR. MILLER:         I think --

22               JUSTICE SOUTER:             You can see where I am

23   going with the argument.

24               MR. MILLER:         Yes.       The important point is

25   that the only way the prejudicial error becomes an issue

 1   and really the paradigmatic case that we are talking

 2   about is where the veteran does get counsel and has

 3   reached the Veterans Court and has identified the error

 4   in a way that's persuasive to the Veterans Court, but

 5   nonetheless identifies no additional evidence that they

 6   would have --

 7                JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, but it seems to me that

 8   there are two points at which the veteran is at a

 9   disadvantage.    And you are talking about the second of

10   the two.    I am talking about the first of the two.                And

11   the first of the two is the point at which the -- I

12   mean, following the hearing, the veteran gets the notice

13   and the veteran is not in a very sophisticated position

14   to evaluate what the veteran is being told.

15                MR. MILLER:        Yes, and a claimant who in the

16   Veterans Court can say, you know, "I didn't understand

17   and as a result I failed to present the -- because of

18   the defective notice and my lack of understanding of the

19   statement of the case, I didn't present this important

20   piece of evidence, and here's how it would have been

21   material," in that case, they would be entitled to a

22   remand.    But a remand --

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 When you have been

24   saying "entitled to a lawyer," do you mean entitled to a

25   lawyer or allowed to have a lawyer?

 1              MR. MILLER:        Allowed to retain counsel.

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You can finish

 3   your --

 4              MR. MILLER:        I was just going to say that,

 5   given the volume of cases that the VA confronts, there

 6   is a serious harm to the system in unnecessary remands

 7   that have to be given priority over other cases and that

 8   divert resources from the adjudication of meritorious

 9   claims.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

11              The case is submitted.

13   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
