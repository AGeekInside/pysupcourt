 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              We'll hear argument

 4   this morning in Case 11-204, Christopher v. SmithKline

 5   Beecham.

 6                 Mr. Goldstein.

 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

 8                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:       Mr. Chief Justice, may it

10   please the Court:

11                 In the Fair Labor Standards Act, Congress

12   directed the Secretary of Labor to quote/unquote "define

13   and delimit" the statute's outside salesman exemption.

14   By regulation, the Secretary provided that an outside

15   salesman is one who makes sales rather than promoting

16   sales by others.    In further guidance, the Secretary

17   elaborated that nonexempt promotion includes either,

18   one, a conversation where there can be no commitment or,

19   two, one where there will be no exchange with the

20   employer.

21                 Now, everyone agrees that a pharmaceutical

22   detailer engages in promotion.           They tout drugs to

23   doctors.    Everyone agrees that there can't be a

24   commitment to issue a prescription.               Everyone agrees

25   that a prescription is not an exchange with a


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                          4
 1   pharmaceutical company.        But nonetheless, the Respondent

 2   argues that pharmaceutical detailers sell drugs directly

 3   to doctors as a matter of law.            They say that follows

 4   from the fact that the Secretary's regulation

 5   incorporates the definition of "sale" in the FLSA, which

 6   is in the blue brief in the appendix at page 1.

 7               That definition, which is section 203(k),

 8   provides -- it's the second provision on the page --

 9   "'sale' or 'sell' includes any sale, exchange, contract

10   to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or

11   other disposition."      And what you will not find in that

12   language is anything that contradicts the two points the

13   Secretary has made, which is that there has to be a

14   commitment or that, at the very least, there has to be

15   an exchange with the employer.

16               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, is that consistent

17   with the Government's argument?            They argue, quote, "an

18   employee does not make a 'sale' for purposes of the

19   'outside salesman' exemption unless he actually

20   transfers title to the property at issue."             The statute

21   refers to a consignment for sale.             When that occurs,

22   does -- does the consignor actually transfer title to

23   the property at issue?

24               MR. GOLDSTEIN:          It is an arrangement for

25   transfer of title, and that's why it's critical that it

 1   says a consignment for sale, the sale being the transfer

 2   of title.    But in all events, this case is not a fight

 3   about transferring title or some lesser form of

 4   exchange, because there's no exchange between the doctor

 5   and the --

 6                 JUSTICE ALITO:       I understand that, but I

 7   would appreciate an answer --

 8                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:       Yes.

 9                 JUSTICE ALITO:       -- to my question.

10                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:       Yes.

11                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Is the Government's position

12   consistent with the reference to consignment for sale?

13   When a consignment for sale occurs, is there a transfer

14   of title?

15                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:       There is an agreement for a

16   transfer of title, and I believe there --

17                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Is there a -- a transfer of

18   title?

19                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:       I apologize.   There is not a

20   transfer of title, but there is an agreement for a

21   transfer of title.    They -- just to be clear, the

22   Government says the definition of "sale" includes a

23   transfer of title.    And so, all I'm pointing out, if I

24   could just go back to the definition -- I apologize for

25   not answering --

 6   about -- about their position.

 8   I've created some --

 9                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       Excuse me.     I -- I don't

10   agree that there's an agreement for transfer of title.

11   Where there's a consignment, you give the property to

12   somebody, and he says I will sell it to somebody if

13   somebody will buy it.

14                  MR. GOLDSTEIN:       Yes.

15                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       There is no agreement to

16   transfer title.

17                  MR. GOLDSTEIN:       There is --

18                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       It's purely a future

19   contingency.    If someone will buy it, I will sell

20   them -- sell it to that person on your account.

21                  MR. GOLDSTEIN:       Yes.     I believe -- I will

22   allow you -- I apologize saying "I will allow you."

 1   know, whatever you want.

 2                  The Government can explain it --

 3                  JUSTICE ALITO:       No, not really, but

 4   anyway, go ahead.

 5                  MR. GOLDSTEIN:       Yes.     All right.    It is --

 6   the statute refers to a consignment for sale.               I believe

 7   they're defining a sale in that phrase.            But in all

 8   events, the debate over whether it includes or is

 9   limited to a transfer of title is not at issue in this

10   case, because what the -- because all the statute

11   requires is that there, at the very least, be some

12   exchange of some part.       There's going to be an -- a

13   binding agreement, a commitment, and that commitment

14   will involve an exchange with the employer.               What

15   happens in pharmaceutical detailing is that there can't

16   be any commitment to issue a prescription at all --

17                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Because -- because the

18   limitation on sale is they can't sell -- by Federal law,

19   they can't sell.    And you -- you are debating about

20   exchange, sale.    What strikes one about this case is

21   that these are workers -- they work autonomously.                They

22   don't clock in and out.        They work outside the

23   workplace.   After they're trained, they have minimal

24   supervision.

25                  Is there any other category of exempt

 1   workers that have that kind of autonomy and yet come

 2   under the wage and hours law?

 3                  MR. GOLDSTEIN:       I'm sorry.       So, your premise

 4   is that they are exempt to begin with?               There -- I can

 5   tell you that there are a large number of employees who

 6   do work outside the workplace and are substantially more

 7   autonomous than are pharmaceutical detailers, who have

 8   to operate from very strict scripts.               There are -- it's

 9   literally --

10                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          For example, what are

11   the -- that's what I wanted to know.               What are the

12   categories of people that seem to be autonomous, not the

13   type that clocks in and out?

14                  MR. GOLDSTEIN:       Sure.     Well, you can have

15   emergency service workers that are working outside.

16   There are lots of people -- so, for example, you may

17   well --

18                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       I don't -- I don't

19   understand what that is.

21                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       What's an emergency service

22   worker?

23                  MR. GOLDSTEIN:       A police officer or a

24   fireman, an ambulance driver.             They are constantly

25   outside the office.      You can also have lots of different

 4   duty?   My goodness.      Some of them make enormous overtime

 5   wages because they've put in hours beyond their regular

 6   hours of duty --

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         These people have no hours

 9   of duty.

10                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:         That is not quite right,

11   Justice Scalia.    They are expected -- the joint appendix

12   explains -- to be in the doctors' offices between 8:30

13   and 5:00 p.m.   They work additional time.                The fact

14   that --

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, doesn't that

16   just -- I mean, that's when the doctors are there.

17                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:         That's -- but that is when

18   they are supposed to be in the doctors' offices.                   That's

19   dictated by the company.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What about -- what about

21   the extras?   I mean, we're told that part of this job is

22   to have a good relationship with the doctors.                 It

23   includes dinners.    It may be conventions.

24   Entertainment, maybe golf.           If -- if you're right, would

25   the time on the golf course get time and a half?

 1                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:       Well, a couple things about

 2   that, Justice Ginsburg.

 3                 (Laughter.)

 4                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:       There actually are very

 5   strict restrictions.     That kind of activity is under the

 6   PhRMA Code, which is trying to interpret Federal law, is

 7   actually very heavily restricted.            But whatever it is

 8   that the employee is doing to further the employment

 9   relationship is going to be hours on duty.            It is really

10   important I think that while it is true that a

11   pharmaceutical detailer has many of the characteristics

12   of an outside salesman, the one they don't have is

13   selling.

14                 And that is the line that Congress drew.

15   It --

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          You were -- you were

 2   outside cleaning people that are not -- that don't have

 3   any --

 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And these are all -- these

 5   are all within the Fair Labor Standards Act?

 6               MR. GOLDSTEIN:       Yes.     Yes, Justice Kennedy,

 7   they absolutely are.

 8               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Are there any occupations

 9   or pursuits that are not covered by the Fair Labor

10   Standards Act because -- on the rationale that they are

11   out, that they are unsupervised, and so forth.          In other

12   words, if you were arguing the case of the Respondent,

13   would you -- would you have any close analogies to areas

14   that are not -- that are exempt; in other words, they

15   wouldn't be salesmen, but there'd be some other

16   classifications to fit them in?

17               MR. GOLDSTEIN:       I would, but they would all

18   be one of two things.    They would either fall within the

19   administrative exemption, which is, Justice Ginsburg,

20   what is -- Congress was talking about when it talked about

21   people who have a lot of autonomy, and which is not true

22   of detailers -- or some other exemption.          So, to give an

23   example, certain outside buyers are exempt under the

24   Fair Labor Standards Act.      A good -- that's a good

25   example, because if you're an outside buyer of poultry,


                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   then you are exempt, but if you are an outside buyer of

 2   meat, you aren't.

 3                 It is one of a lot of different places --

 4   there are 50-some exemptions from the Fair Labor

 5   Standards Act.    And Congress drew incredibly fine lines.

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       Congress can draw -- draw

 7   even silly lines.

 8                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:       Yes.

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       If Congress draws it, it's

10   a line.   But the line you're suggesting here -- both

11   your brief and the Government's, as I recall, say, my

12   goodness, if we find for the Respondent here, there'll

13   be so much uncertainty in the future.             I'm not sure

14   there isn't a lot of uncertainty if we -- if we find in

15   your direction.

16                 Now, let me give you an example.           One of my

17   law clerks -- my law clerks supplement my sparse life

18   experience.

19                 (Laughter.)

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       One of my law clerks is

21   familiar with the -- the framing business.             Okay?   Now,

22   salesmen of frames do not sell the frames at the time

23   that they visit the -- the framing company or the

24   framing store.    They get a commitment that in the

25   future, that person will order from the framing company.

 1   Now, is that a sale?

 2                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:        That is a sale, but the

 3   difference here is that there's neither a commitment --

 4   remember, the commitment is illegal as a matter of law.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, but there is a

 6   commitment.   There is a commitment to -- what they're

 7   trying to get is a commitment to consider this drug if

 8   it's appropriate for prescription to patients in the

 9   future.   That's a commitment.

10                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:        Justice Scalia, if that is

11   the commitment, then all of promotion I think is going

12   to be a sale, because every promoter who walks up to you

13   on the street saying will you try my product, will you

14   go into the store, is trying to get you to say I'll go

15   in.   And that is much more of a direct commitment than

16   you saying I'll consider it in an appropriate

17   circumstance.

18                 The commitment by a doctor is precatory at

19   most.   They do not make any commitment in any instance

20   that can be binding in any way that they will prescribe

21   a drug for anyone.

22                 And remember, there is the second -- the

23   second distinction.      So, that's one.           But the second is

24   that -- remember, there is a purchase in your

25   hypothetical of framing, a purchase from the framing

                                                                       14
 1   store.   But the second part of the Secretary's guidance

 2   is that when the doctor decides to issue a prescription,

 3   they're not exchanging anything with the drug company.

 4   There -- nothing is acquired from the drug company.

 5   That is a very significant difference.

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:       It's a peculiar line of

 7   commerce.   And -- and you're saying that what

 8   constitutes a sale -- a salesman cannot take account of

 9   the fact that this is a weird line of commerce, where

10   you're selling to people who cannot make a commitment.

11                MR. GOLDSTEIN:       Well, there are two things.

12   The first is the commitment, and they are not selling

13   anything to the doctor.      Remember, just to frame this

14   industry, the pharmaceutical company sells its products;

15   it sells them to pharmaceutical wholesalers, which sell

16   them to pharmacies -- pardon me -- which sell them to

17   customers, which have a relationship with a doctor, who

18   may or may not have met with a detailer.

19                There is a sale here in this industry, but

20   it is to a pharmaceutical detailer, and that is a very

21   significant difference.      The critical point as well for

22   purposes of --

23                JUSTICE KAGAN:       May I ask you --

24                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Mr. Goldstein, doesn't --

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          May I ask you to follow

 1   up on other -- other categories of employee?                You gave

 2   me cleaning workers, emergency service workers.                Are any

 3   of those categories people who get paid commissions?

 4                  MR. GOLDSTEIN:       Those are not, but the

 5   example that I gave to Justice Kennedy would be, which

 6   is that there are outside buyers who do receive

 7   commissions.    And remember, of course, that there are

 8   outside salesmen who do not receive commissions but are

 9   nonetheless exempt.      Congress didn't write an exemption

10   about commissions; it wrote them about whether it's an

11   outside person who engages in sales.

12                  And the other point I was trying to make is

13   that -- and Justice Scalia echoed it to some extent --

14   and that is that the FLSA draws very fine lines.                If you

15   work for a movie theater you are exempt, but not a

16   playhouse.   If you work for a small newspaper but not a

17   small magazine, you're exempt.            If you care for the

18   elderly but not the young, you're exempt.

19                  And what Congress said is that there has to

20   be -- you are an outside salesman and that -- it is true

21   that this is a peculiar industry, but the peculiarity of

22   it is that you don't make sales.

23                  If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

 1               ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

 2       ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 3                   SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 4                MR. STEWART:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 5   please the Court:

 6                It's common ground in this case that in

 7   order to be an outside salesman, an employee must make

 8   sales.   And in theory there are two different ways in

 9   which Respondent could have attempted to establish that

10   the PSRs in this case fit that criteria.

11                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Could you answer

12   Justice Alito's question?        Your brief to the Second

13   Circuit and the Ninth Circuit suggested that a sale is

14   a -- is a transaction, a transfer of some sort, or at

15   least a promise to purchase.             But your brief here calls

16   it a much more rigid test, that there has to be a

17   transfer of title.    And he pointed to the language of

18   3(x) -- 3(k), that says "consignment for sale," which

19   doesn't have a transfer of the title.             So, what is the

20   Government's position?

21                MR. STEWART:      Well, the DOL regulations have

22   since 19 -- I believe it's since 1949, have said that

23   "make a sale" within the meaning of 203(k), the term

24   "making a sale" within the meaning of 3(k) includes a

25   transfer of title.    And in theory, the verb "includes"

 1   could leave open the possibility that other things could

 2   be included as well.      We've never encountered a

 3   situation in which DOL has found a sale of goods without

 4   a transfer of title.      But in direct answer to your

 5   question, Justice Alito, about --

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, excuse me.

 7   Consignment salesmen are -- are not exempt?

 8                MR. STEWART:       It would be -- with specific

 9   respect to consignments for sale, it would have been

10   more precise to say that there has to be a transfer of

11   possession in contemplation of a transfer of title.

12                JUSTICE ALITO:         And what about salesmen

13   who -- whose objective is to obtain a rental?               The lower

14   courts have said that they qualify.                Does the Government

15   disagree with that?

16                MR. STEWART:       DOL believes that they

17   qualify, but not as sales of goods.                And if the -- the

18   Court could look at the appendix to the blue brief on

19   page 4.   This is the pertinent regulation that refers to

20   making sales or obtaining orders.

21                And it says:       "Section 541.500 requires that

22   the employee be engaged in making sales within the

23   meaning of section 3(k) of the Act or obtaining orders

24   or contracts for services or for the use of facilities."

25   And DOL's view is that a rental agreement would be a

 1   contract for services or for the use of facilities.

 2               And the way --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Excuse me.    How can they

 4   put in number (2)?    I -- I thought that 3(k) is 3(k).

 5   Can -- can they supplement 3(k)?

 6               MR. STEWART:       They have supplemented 3(k),

 7   and they did that --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:         What's the authority to do

 9   that?

10               MR. STEWART:       The -- this is discussed in

11   the Stein Report, which was issued in 1940, and what had

12   happened was that the question had arisen -- and the

13   Stein report lays this out in a fair amount of detail.

14   The question had arisen whether individuals who

15   negotiate for contracts to buy time on the radio or sell

16   time -- sell advertising space in newspapers or sell --

17   negotiate contracts for carriage of freight by rail or

18   truck -- the question arose whether they were outside

19   salesmen within the meaning of the statute.

20               And the Stein Report explained that the Wage

21   and Hour Division had taken the position that they were

22   not because it interpreted "sales" -- it appears to have

23   interpreted "sales" to refer only to sales of goods, and

24   people who were engaged in those sorts of businesses

25   were not selling goods.       But the Stein Report said:


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                    19
 1   However, these people are commonly regarded as salesmen;

 2   the contracts they negotiate are treated as sales.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Well, that's wonderful.

 4   Then if you can go beyond 3(k), I guess really the

 5   question before us is whether it's arbitrary or

 6   capricious for the agency not to extend their -- their

 7   power to supplement 3(k) to this situation, which these

 8   people look like salesmen to me.

 9                And so, if they can do number (2) there, I

10   don't know why -- why the agency couldn't say, oh, and

11   by the way, detailers are also included.

12                MR. STEWART:     Well --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:       And the issue would be

14   whether it's unreasonable for them not to say that.

15                MR. STEWART:     The agency has taken the

16   position that, even though it has construed 3(k) to

17   refer only to sales of goods, that sales of services or

18   contracts for the use of facilities can be covered.

19   However, there's a big difference between the

20   interaction between a detailer and a physician and the

21   interaction between the -- the person who sells time on

22   the radio.   The person --

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Sure there is; sure there

24   is.   But once you -- once you concede that it doesn't

25   have to be within 3(k) and that it's within the power of


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the agency to grant the exemption anyway, then we really

 2   have a different -- a different argument before us here.

 3                 MR. STEWART:     Well, the -- the theory on

 4   which the Stein Report proceeded was that, even though

 5   sales of time on the radio were not sales of goods, they

 6   were still customarily regarded as sales, and they had

 7   the essential attributes of sales; namely, an exchange

 8   of something valuable that the seller possessed in

 9   return for consideration from the buyer.          And you don't

10   have any of that when the detailer deals with the --

11   with the --

12                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Mr. Stewart, there's this

13   other regulation which is I guess in the coverage

14   section, 779.241, which says that if an employee

15   performs any work that in a practical sense is an

16   essential part of consummating the sale of the goods,

17   he'll be considered to be selling the goods.

18                 So, I guess this question is a two-part

19   question.   Do you agree that that regulation does cover

20   the -- these detailers?       And the second part is, if you

21   do, you know, how does it work that we should understand

22   "sale" one way for purposes of coverage and another way

23   for purposes of exemption?

24                 MR. STEWART:     Well, the first thing I would

25   say is that we wouldn't agree that this would cover


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

 1   detailers.   That is, if the relevant sales are, as we

 2   believe, GSK's sales to -- the transfer of drugs to

 3   wholesalers and pharmacies in return for consideration,

 4   the detailers don't play an essential role in the

 5   consummation of those sales.              They don't participate in

 6   those sales.    It's true that their mission is to engage

 7   in activities which set in motion a chain of events that

 8   will make those sales more likely to occur, but we

 9   wouldn't regard them as --

10                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       But that seems a little bit

11   blind to the way the industry actually works.             The way

12   this industry actually works is the real work is done by

13   the detailer getting the doctor to say, yes, I'm going

14   to start prescribing this where it's medically

15   appropriate.    The actual sales from the company to the

16   pharmacy just follows from however successful the

17   detailer is.

18                  MR. STEWART:     But I think much the same

19   thing could have been said about all the promotional

20   workers that DOL has done with -- has dealt with in the

21   past.   That is, the premise, the justification for a

22   company to hire a promotional worker, is that the

23   promotional activities will increase the overall sales

24   of the company, will either directly or indirectly set

25   in motion a chain of events that leads people to buy the

 1   product.   But DOL has historically regarded those

 2   activities as distinct from selling the product.

 3                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, do those employees

 4   work on commissions?

 5                 MR. STEWART:     Some employees may work on

 6   commission.   Some --

 7                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Promotional workers do work

 8   on commissions?

 9                 MR. STEWART:     It's -- I don't think there is

10   necessarily a uniform rule one way or the other.                The

11   Stein Report did say in 1940 that, although it was

12   characteristic for outside salesmen to receive

13   commissions, that was not the test, that that was a

14   quirk of compensation.      The other thing I would say --

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       Did we have detailers in

16   1940?   Gee, that's a long time ago.              Did we have

17   detailers in 1940?    That's almost a century ago.

18                 MR. STEWART:     There were detailers in that

19   era, and --

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:       That's my point, actually.

21   That's where I'm sort of bothered, just exactly what

22   Justice Scalia said, that if you look through what I've

23   seen so far by the materials, they're pretty evenly

24   balanced, and there are tens of thousands of people who

25   work in this industry, and there's a history of 75 years

 1   of nobody said anything.

 2                So you would think -- and it isn't the only

 3   problem that has just been recognized in other

 4   industries, too.   If the agency is going to reverse, not

 5   reverse, but suddenly do something it hasn't done for

 6   75 years, the right way to do it is to have notice and

 7   comment, hearings, allow people to present their point

 8   of view, and then make some rules or determine what

 9   should happen.   Perhaps they'd say for the future let's

10   do this, but not let's give people a windfall for the

11   past.   Perhaps they'd say some and not others.      Okay?

12                That's my instinctive reaction, not

13   necessarily legal, but informed by administrative law.

14   But why shouldn't I try to get there?

15                MR. STEWART:     I guess I'd say two things,

16   one general and one specific to detailers.       The general

17   thing is that DOL has consistently drawn a distinction

19                JUSTICE BREYER:       No, I've read those.

20                MR. STEWART:     Okay.

21                JUSTICE BREYER:       I've read those, and I find

22   them beautifully ambiguous.

23                (Laughter.)

24                JUSTICE BREYER:       I'll go back and read them

25   again, and if they're absolutely clear, you win, fine,

 1   that's the end of it.

 2                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And it's gone on for

 3   70 years, and you're -- and instead of doing a

 4   regulation, amended regulation, as Justice Breyer

 5   indicates, you're filing amicus briefs quietly in

 6   different -- different courts.           It seems to me that's

 7   not nearly as fair or straightforward or as candid as --

 8   as an agency ought to be.

 9                MR. STEWART:     Well, with respect to where

10   the industry expectation arose, we have only one data

11   point or at least only one data point that has been

12   identified in the briefs.       That is the National

13   Federation of Independent Small Business Legal Center

14   has filed an amicus brief on Respondent's side, and then

15   they -- they identify one DOL opinion letter, of which

16   we were previously unaware, that dates from 1945.              And

17   in the opinion letter, the employer of the detailer

18   asked for an opinion to the effect that its detailers

19   were covered by the administrative exemption.           That

20   employer didn't request a ruling that these were outside

21   salesmen.   And DOL --

22                JUSTICE BREYER:       You're right about that,

23   and so, they're at fault, too.           But on the other hand,

24   their employees might have been satisfied, and this is

25   done to protect the employees.

 1                  So, I'm asking, not saying, but what is the

 2   process here?    How do you know -- at what level was this

 3   agency decision made to suddenly go ahead with this?

 4   Who made it?    What was the input?           How do you know

 5   they're on your side?       You do know; you're right.           But I

 6   mean, what's the process internally?

 7                  MR. STEWART:     Internally, the -- the

 8   Solicitor's Office at the Department of Labor would

 9   consult with the Wage and Hour Division.                The

10   Solicitor's name went on the briefs both that were filed

11   in the Ninth Circuit and the brief -- I mean, the Ninth

12   Circuit and also the Novartis brief in the Second

13   Circuit.    And the Solicitor's name is on the

14   Government's brief in this Court.             The Solicitor is the

15   third-highest-ranking individual within the Department

16   of Labor.

17                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Do you -- I'm sorry

18   to interrupt your answer, but does your office review

19   the amicus filings in the courts of appeals by the

20   agencies?

21                  MR. STEWART:     There was SG authorization for

22   the amicus brief to be filed.

23                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Is that the normal

24   procedure?

25                  MR. STEWART:     Yes.

 1                    JUSTICE SCALIA:          But this is part of a

 2     regular program that the agency has now instituted, to

 3     run around the country and file amicus briefs; is that

 4     it?

 5                    MR. STEWART:       To clarify -- well, to clarify

 6     the agency's view of what the proper understanding of

 7     the law is.    And in terms of --

 8                    JUSTICE SCALIA:          Yes, right, to get --

 9     instead of doing rulemaking, instead of doing

10     adjudication, we're going to file amicus briefs, and the

11     court will accept our view in that amicus brief and,

12     hey, presto, we have -- we have made law.

13                    MR. STEWART:       Well, maybe yes, maybe no --

14                    JUSTICE SCALIA:          That's extraordinary.

15                    MR. STEWART:       Well, in comparison to the

16     alternative step of filing enforcement actions, it's

17     both --

18                    JUSTICE BREYER:          Well, the alternative step

19   ..-- well, did the Secretary of Labor herself or himself,

20     depending on when it was, consider this matter?

21                    MR. STEWART:       I don't know whether the

22     Secretary --

23                    JUSTICE BREYER:          No, we don't.   All right.

24     So --

25                    MR. STEWART:       But --


                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1                  JUSTICE BREYER:          So, the alternative is not

 2   enforcement actions, necessarily.                The alternative is

 3   for the agency to focus on the question and decide what

 4   it actually wants to do.

 5                  MR. STEWART:       And the agency has regarded

 6   the application of its promotion sales regulations to

 7   the facts of this case as clear.                 That is, if you asked

 8   GSK's highest level management why does it make sense to

 9   employ detailers, they wouldn't say because they get

10   these commitments from physicians which are of value to

11   the company.    The commitments or the quasi-commitments

12   from physicians in and of themselves are of no value.

13                  JUSTICE SCALIA:          There are 90,000 of these

14   people, and you have not -- the agency has not brought

15   any action for these -- lo, these many years.                Ninety

16   thousand of them.      And all of a sudden, you say -- you

17   come in and say, oh, you have been in violation of the

18   law in the past, and you're going to have to pay a lot

19   of money for all these people that you didn't give

20   overtime to in the past.

21                  I just think that's extraordinary.

22                  MR. STEWART:       Well, to the extent that there

23   was an industry expectation that was based on anything

24   DOL had said, it was based on, as far as we know, based

25   on the 1945 opinion letter, which said not --

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, but you -- you

 2   didn't even know about that.

 3               MR. STEWART:        Right.

 4               (Laughter.)

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               And yet, you expect

 6   the industry to know all about it; and yet, it escaped

 7   your attention.

 8               MR. STEWART:        Again, our argument is not

 9   that they should have known from the -- about the

10   opinion letter.   Our argument is that the proper

11   application of the promotion sales regulation to the

12   facts of this case is pretty clear, and that if GSK's

13   top-level management was asked to defend the use of

14   detailers, they would say these people are important

15   because if they persuade physicians to write more

16   prescriptions and those are filled with GSK products,

17   then pharmacies will reorder the drug and our

18   wholesalers will reorder it from us.

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Counsel, can I --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:           So, you have been guilty of

21   malfeasance for 70 years, right?               These 90,000 people

22   out there who have been in violation of the law and the

23   agency has done not a blessed thing?

24               MR. STEWART:        To return to the 1945 opinion

25   letter, the opinion letter was based on the premise that

 1   the employees exercised discretion and independent

 2   judgment in the performance of their duties.           That's

 3   what the -- what DOL said in concluding --

 4                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Counsel, I thought that

 5   this whole system was set up on giving industries the

 6   opportunity to ask the government for an opinion letter,

 7   correct?

 8                 MR. STEWART:       Right.

 9                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          I saw in the briefing

10   hundreds of opinion letters by hundreds of different

11   industries.    Outside of this 1945 letter, did anybody

12   else, any other pharmaceutical company, ever set out for

13   the government or seek an opinion letter that you're

14   aware of?

15                 MR. STEWART:       I'm aware of only one

16   instance.    I think this is not a matter of public

17   record, but there was one request in, I believe,

18   December of 2007 for an opinion to the effect that the

19   detailers were covered by the outside salesman

20   exemption.    DOL never responded one way or the other.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          You don't suggest -- you're

22   not arguing for a rule that if -- if an individual does

23   not seek an opinion letter, he's guilty?           Is that --

24                 MR. STEWART:       No, I'm not arguing for that

25   rule.   The --

 1                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Mr. Malcolm -- Mr.

 2   Stewart, is it -- is it true that that option is no

 3   longer available, that the Department of Labor no longer

 4   gives opinion letters?

 5                  MR. STEWART:       It does -- it has phased out

 6   the opinion letter program and gives other forms of

 7   administrative guidance.          That is, DOL's rationale was

 8   that the opinion letter program had not been cost

 9   effective because often the bottom line -- may I --

10   often the bottom-line answer to the question would turn

11   on factual nuances of a particular employer and wouldn't

12   provide much guidance to others.                 And so, it's tried to

13   provide forms of guidance that are -- speak to the

14   industry or a class of employees as a whole.

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             And they don't make

 3   sales.

 8               MR. CLEMENT:        With respect,

 9   Mr. Chief Justice, we disagree.            We think they do make

10   sales in the way that is relevant in this industry, and

11   we do think they make sales in some sense, which is the

12   practical construction that the agency has always put on

13   the sales requirement in the --

15   your regulation is going to be?

17               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            And would it exempt

18   everybody from coverage?        Meaning, you seem to be saying

19   if in some sense they make sales, it seems that every

20   promotional person will be a salesman, that all

21   industries have to do is put one or two forms of sales

22   activities involved in the work of their worker, and

23   they're exempt.   Give me your definition?           As long as

24   it's in some sense, that covers everybody's exempt?

25               MR. CLEMENT:        Yes, but, Justice Sotomayor,

 1   if I could, there's two important qualifications that

 2   avoid the slippery slope concerns you're talking about.

 3   One is it's, I think, common ground among everybody that

 4   you -- to qualify for any exemption or certainly all of

 5   these relevant exemptions here, it has to be your

 6   primary duty.   So, you can't just slip in a little sales

 7   activity for something and get that person qualified.

 8   The other thing, and I think this is very --

 9                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Well, it seems like the

10   sale here is not the primary duty.                The sale here is to

11   schmooze the doctor and give him information.                That's

12   what you said in one of your briefs -- your company said

13   in one of its briefs in -- in a products liability

14   litigation.

15                 MR. CLEMENT:       With respect, Your Honor, the

16   commitment is very important in this industry.                  It is

17   the objective of the sales call.                It's to get a

18   commitment to prescribe when medically necessary.

19                 Now, it is true that there is prologue to

20   that, and there is efforts to promote before you get

21   that particular sale.       But the regulations address that

22   particularly, and they say, as long as you --

23                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Primary duty is one of

24   the limiting, and what was the second limiting

25   principle?

                                 Official

 1                 MR. CLEMENT:       The second limiting principle

 2   is actually what I'm talking about now, which is if you

 3   look at 503, which are the regulations that draw the

 4   distinction between promotion and between being outside

 5   sales, they do not say that promotion is nonexempt

 6   activity.    What they say is it depends who does the

 7   promotion.    And as long as the outside salesperson does

 8   the promotion in conjunction with his or her own sales

 9   or solicitations, then that is exempt activity.            And

10   what they're trying to --

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:         But it also says -- it

12   also says promotional work incidental to sales made by

13   someone else.

14                 MR. CLEMENT:       Is not covered.

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:         -- is nonexempt.

16                 MR. CLEMENT:       You're right, but --

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:         And these sales -- I

18   mean, eventually there is a sale to a hospital, to a

19   pharmacy, and that sale is not made by the detailer.

20                 MR. CLEMENT:       But, Justice Ginsburg, I think

21   it's important to recognize that the reason that 503

22   draws a distinction between promotional activity in

23   conjunction with the salesperson's own sales or

24   promotional activity with respect to somebody else's

25   sales is they're concerned about the consideration where

 1   somebody else is going to follow up with the same

 2   customer to close the deal.

 3               And if you look at the regulatory

 4   commentary, that's what they're concerned -- they don't

 5   want to sort of have double counting, where somebody

 6   promotes with a sales target and then somebody else

 7   follows up to close the sale.           And --

 8               JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, that might be one

 9   thing that they are concerned about, but it may not be

10   the only thing.   I mean, if you look at these

11   regulations, it seems as though what they're trying to

12   do is draw a distinction between people who actually

13   consummate transactions, transactional people, and

14   people who are pitchmen.        And -- and what the Department

15   of Labor here is saying is detailers are people who make

16   pitches; they're not people who consummate the

17   transactions.

18               MR. CLEMENT:        Well, Justice Kagan, I really

19   think if you look at the regulations as a whole and the

20   commentary in the Stein Report and the Weiss Report,

21   they're not worried about sorting out the pitchmen

22   because they understand that that classic outside

23   salesperson is a pitchman who then tries to get a

24   commitment to buy or some other commitment from the

25   sales target.

                                                                        35
 1                 So, what they're trying to do is really

 2   distinguishing not between pitchmen and sales people,

 3   but between what they refer to as missionary men or

 4   people who pave the way for somebody else to make the

 5   sale.   And I really think that's the focus of the 503

 6   regulation.

 7                 And so, the Government's argument really

 8   boils down to the notion that there's nobody in this

 9   industry that makes enough of a commitment with the

10   doctor for anybody to be involved in anything but

11   promotion with the doctor.             And that seems --

12                 JUSTICE KAGAN:           But why isn't that possible?

13   I mean, your brief seemed to suggest that in every

14   industry there needs to be some group of people who

15   would be classified as outside salesmen.             And that's not

16   necessarily the case.       There may be some industries, and

17   here it's a result of regulation, or it may be because

18   of other business practices, where there just isn't

19   anybody who's an outside salesman.

20                 MR. CLEMENT:       Justice Kagan, it's

21   theoretically possible, but it would be odd, especially

22   in an industry that employs 90,000 people, in order to

23   get a commitment to prescribe from the doctor.             And I

24   think if you look across --

25                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What is -- what is this


                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   commitment?   Is the commitment in writing?

 2                 MR. CLEMENT:       The commitment is generally

 3   not in writing, Justice Kennedy.

 4                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:         Would it be lawful to make

 5   it -- put it in writing?

 6                 MR. CLEMENT:       I don't know that anything

 7   would turn on whether it was in writing or not because

 8   what --

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:         Would it be lawful to put

10   it in writing?

11                 MR. CLEMENT:       I -- I think the answer is

12   yes.   It's important for the commitment not to be

13   binding because of the nature of the doctor's role.

14   Nobody wants to go into a doctor's office, let alone

15   these sales people, and say, look, whoever is the next

16   person who walks in the door, prescribe them the

17   product.

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:         That sounds to me it's not

19   a commitment, unless the doctor says:           Well, I'll look

20   at this, this is interesting; I'll go home and read your

21   material, I'll think about it.

22                 Is that -- is that a --

23                 MR. CLEMENT:       That's not the kind of

24   commitment they're looking for, Justice Kennedy.

25   They're looking for a commitment that -- sometimes it's

 1   the next patient that presents the condition for which

 2   the medicine is medically appropriate, that they will

 3   prescribe.   And if you think just practically --

 4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:         But it's got to be non-

 5   binding.

 6                 MR. CLEMENT:       It has to be non-binding.       I

 7   agree.   But I don't think that the Government --

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:         And that's why -- and

 9   that's why it's not in writing.

10                 MR. CLEMENT:       Well, but you can have a

11   non-binding commitment in writing.              You can have a

12   binding commitment that's oral, as long as it's -- you

13   know, I don't want to get into the statute of frauds

14   here.    But it seems to me that the binding nature is not

15   dispositive either.      You can have a situation -- look,

16   if I agree as -- that I'm going to buy something, I can

17   often return it.    Sometimes there is a cooling-off

18   period, things like that.

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:         Well, let me ask you this,

20   and I'm not well versed in all -- in all of the

21   specifics, but my understanding is that the Federal

22   Government has expressed new concerns, has new

23   regulations, new rules about these outside sales.

24                 Does that mean that the nature of the work

25   has changed in the last 5 or 10 years, so that the

                                                                         38
 1   70 years we are talking about is not relevant?           Would

 2   you comment on that?

 3                MR. CLEMENT:       I'd love to, Justice Kennedy.

 4   I think, to the contrary, I think that -- I mean, the

 5   Government actually ironically says that the 2004

 6   rulemaking, which was the last time there was any

 7   rulemaking, didn't change anything substantively.           We

 8   think that's wrong.     We actually think there was an

 9   important substantive change to the 503(c) regulations

10   and others which addressed the following problem, which

11   is not that the basic role of the outside salesperson

12   has changed, but the technology has changed in such a

13   way that it would be silly to draw a distinction between

14   whether the salesperson actually takes the order and

15   writes it down or gets a form in triplicate, or rather

16   gets a commitment to buy from the sales target who then

17   actually enters the order on a computer on their own.

18                And that I think is the specific situation

19   that the agency was confronted with.           And in 2004 they

20   said:   We don't want things to turn on who enters the

21   order, whether it's the customer on their own computer

22   or the outside salesperson.

23                JUSTICE KAGAN:           But, Mr. Clement, I thought

24   that in 2004 there were two proposals, really, and one

25   was the proposal that was changed, and the other was the


                       Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official

                                                                           39
 1   proposal to get rid of this promotional stuff and to

 2   allow people who promoted products to qualify as outside

 3   salesmen, and the agency specifically rejected that

 4   suggestion.

 5                 MR. CLEMENT:       Absolutely, Justice Kagan, but

 6   there has always been an effort to try to get all

 7   promotional people treated as being exempt.              But that's

 8   different from what's being asked for here, which is the

 9   last person who makes a visit to the person who places

10   the relevant order in the industry and gets the

11   commitment from that person.           That, in contrast to

12   general promotion, often directed at the world at large,

13   has always been the hallmark of a sale in the

14   Department's own flexible approach.              And I think that's

15   really important because if --

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:         But that seems to be

17   inconsistent with this -- this opinion letter.              The

18   request is put in by the pharmaceutical company, and

19   they want an exemption under administrative employee.

20   In the Department of Labor's response allowing that

21   exemption, it says that these detailers, and they use

22   the word "detailers," medical detailers, are engaged in

23   a form of promotional or missionary work.

24                 MR. CLEMENT:       Well, Justice Ginsburg, I -- I

25   want to say two things about that.              One is to say,


                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official

                                                                        40
 1   obviously, that may depend a little bit on how the

 2   particular role was described.            If you're reading from

 3   the 1945 opinion letter, I mean, that may be somewhat

 4   different.   But I do think that what's important here is

 5   that promotional activity itself is not problematic.

 6   Promotional activity is exempt as long as it's in

 7   conjunction with the person's own sales or

 8   solicitations, is the word of the regulation.           So, I

 9   don't think that's dispositive.

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          This goes -- the letter

11   goes on to say that these detailers are engaged in a

12   form of promotion not having for its object the making

13   of specific transactions.

14                MR. CLEMENT:        Well, and again, Justice

15   Ginsburg, we would take issue with that and say, no,

16   there is an interest in getting a specific commitment.

17   It is commitment to prescribe.            It may be somewhat -- it

18   is non-binding, and it may be somewhat forward-looking,

19   but I don't think that distinguishes this industry from

20   many industries.    It's not --

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But as far as your

22   70 years, it's suspect for two reasons.           One is we're

23   told that in the early years, at least, before there

24   were regulations restricting the sale of prescription

25   drugs, that these detailers did two things.           They did


                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                Official

                                                                      41
 1   have their informational function, but they also did

 2   direct sales to pharmaceutical companies, to hospitals.

 3   So, for at least 20 years of those 70 years, these

 4   people were engaged in what the department would call

 5   sales.   So, that's suspect.

 6                And then when we have the commitment, the

 7   opinion letter that says we have a category for these

 8   people; they are engaged in instruction, in information;

 9   they are not engaged in sales; but because they're so

10   independent, we rank them as administrative -- in the

11   particular case we rank them as administrative people.

12                So -- so, it's not so that there was a

13   sudden about-face as you suggest.              We have a

14   categorization as -- as administrative employees, but

15   not sales employees, and we have a history of these

16   detailers at one time actually selling.

17                MR. CLEMENT:       Well, Justice Ginsburg, let me

18   say -- I mean, certainly as the regulatory environment

19   has changed, the nature of how the sales are transacted

20   in this industry have changed, but I think the focus is

21   very much on the doctors appropriately because they're

22   the ones that place the order.           But I also want to be

23   responsive to the administrative exemption.

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:          You wouldn't -- you

25   wouldn't mind being exempt as administrative, would you?

 1                MR. CLEMENT:        I wouldn't, Justice Scalia --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes.

 3                MR. CLEMENT:        -- but I do want to --

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:           But they've changed their

 5   -- their view.

 6                MR. CLEMENT:        They've changed their view on

 7   that, too.   And I certainly don't want this Court to

 8   think that the industry somehow has the administrative

 9   exemption as an ace up their sleeve or in their back

10   pocket.   And it's really the same exact issue, because,

11   once again, the agency has changed their view.           And once

12   again, their view is not based on anything that has to

13   do with label --

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Did you claim -- did you

15   claim exemption as administrative employee?

16                MR. CLEMENT:        We did, Your Honor, in the

17   district court.    It's not before this Court because we

18   got summary judgment in our favor on the outside sales

19   exemption.

20                But I really would think it would be a -- a

21   mistake for this Court to say --

22                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           So, that would -- then

23   that would be still open if you lose on the outside

24   sales?

25                MR. CLEMENT:        It would, Justice Ginsburg.

 1   But you're just deferring the same inquiry, because the

 2   Government's position once again is after 70 years of

 3   having the industry proceed on the assumption that these

 4   individuals were exempt, they now have changed their

 5   mind.   And, again, their view has everything to do with

 6   FDA regulation --

 7                JUSTICE KAGAN:             Well, Mr. Clement --

 8                MR. CLEMENT:         -- and nothing to do --

 9                JUSTICE KAGAN:             I'm sorry.

10                MR. CLEMENT:         -- and nothing to do with

11   labor policy, because what they say is that now because

12   of the government's own off-label prosecutions, these

13   outside salespeople have to stick to a script and -- in

14   order to avoid off-label liability.              And because they

15   have to stick to the script, they are told they don't

16   exercise sufficient discretion to come within the

17   administrative exemption.

18                And the problem here is the Labor

19   Department, instead of looking at this and making a

20   rational judgment about labor policy and whether these

21   individuals who make $93,000 on -- for the median should

22   rationally be the kind of workers that are protected by

23   the Fair Labor Standards Act, instead they're looking at

24   things that have everything to do with FDA regulation

25   and nothing to do with labor policy.

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:           Are they paid commissions?

 5   If they're -- if the salesman or the promotion agent, as

 6   the case may be, is successful in his territory in

 7   getting doctors to prescribe the drug, does he receive

 8   extra pay?

 9                MR. CLEMENT:       He receives incentive

10   compensation.

11                JUSTICE BREYER:           What does that mean?    Does

12   he -- I mean, an outside salesman -- in one document, it

13   says is a person who often obtains a commission on his

14   sales.

15                MR. CLEMENT:       Right.

17   figure out -- I might not have the right words to ask

18   the question -- are these people, people who in some

19   sense or other receive commissions on their sales?

20                MR. CLEMENT:       And the answer is -- for the

21   Petitioners on this record, the answer is yes.              They're

22   not the commissions that are a one-to-one

23   correspondence, but what they do is they receive

24   substantial incentive compensation, about 25 percent of

25   the total, and it's based on the sales of the product in

 2                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          How's that different

 3   from a bonus that an employee gets?             How is it any

 4   different than what most companies do in -- in giving a

 5   bonus at the end of the year?

 6                 MR. CLEMENT:       Certainly, based on the facts

 7   in this record, it -- at the time of this case, it's

 8   much more tied to the performance of the product in the

 9   sales territory.    And I don't think that's -- you know,

10   it's not based on the company's overall performance --

11                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Mr. Clement, you give me

12   one definition of "outside salesmen," the one that you

13   prefer for us to apply here.            The Department of Labor

14   gives another, and the one they're giving according to

15   them is a bright-line rule.            It's easy to apply.   You

16   have to do some sort of transfer of title.             That's as --

17   their rule.

 1   construction, because it's flatly inconsistent with the

 2   statute.   This idea that you have to have a transfer of

 3   title cannot be squared with 3(k); it cannot be squared,

 4   at least as I understand it, with some of the -- the own

 5   advice they've given, which is all you need is a

 6   commitment to buy.     That's what they've told people

 7   since 1949.

 8                 There's an example in that Weiss Report from

 9   1949 involving a jobber where you have a situation where

10   somebody's treated as an outside salesperson even though

11   they never have title over the product.                 So, they get

12   the commitment to buy from the sales target, and then a

13   jobber who works for a different employer is the one

14   that transfers title.       That's at page 11 of the NFIB

15   brief, if you want to look at it.               So --

16                 JUSTICE KAGAN:           Mr. Clement, I guess I'm not

17   sure I understand what you just said.

18                 If -- forget the transfer of title business,

19   but if it's just -- we're requiring a transaction here.

20   And we're drawing a line between people who do

21   transactions and people who just advertise or make

22   pitches or whatever you want to do it.               That's perfectly

23   consistent with the statute, isn't it?               I mean, you can

24   argue about is it the only possible reading; you can

25   even argue about whether it's the best possible reading.

 1   But it's surely a -- a possible reading.

 2               MR. CLEMENT:        It is a possible reading,

 3   Justice Kagan.   But it's not the one that the Labor

 4   Department has advanced in their amicus brief.           So, you

 5   can't defer to that.     I mean, you can decide that it's

 6   the best reading of the statute if you want, but --

 7               JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, I suppose that that's

 8   a question for them.     I read their amicus briefs to sort

 9   of suggest two things.      Sometimes they just talk about

10   transactions, and sometimes they talk about transfer of

11   title.

12               MR. CLEMENT:        Well, and with respect,

13   Justice Kagan, that's one of the many problems with

14   deferring to amicus briefs.           Because when an agency

15   gives guidance in an interpretative rule or something,

16   there's one place, and they provide "the" answer.           Now,

17   I don't know if the Government wants you to defer to the

18   -- defer to the argument on page 12 or the argument on

19   page 20 or the argument on page 24.

20               JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, I think that they

21   would say that it doesn't make any difference, because

22   they've never really seen a person who makes

23   transactions without transferring title.           So, I think

24   that --

25               MR. CLEMENT:        Well, with respect, they

 1   have --

 2               JUSTICE KAGAN:              -- they would think the --

 3   the difference is --

 4               MR. CLEMENT:          No, with respect, they have

 5   seen that person.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Consignment, for one, which

 7   is legitimate business.

 8               MR. CLEMENT:          Well, consignment is in the

 9   statute, but this jobber example is right out of the

10   Weiss Report in 1949, and the outside salesperson in

11   that case never had title.              The title comes from the

12   jobber who works for somebody else.              So, the salesperson

13   in that instance never had title, not even in the chain

14   of distribution.     Yet, they say that is a clear case

15   where the person is an outside salesperson and exempt.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Did -- did the

17   pharmaceutical companies request -- ever in this period,

18   request a ruling, a rulemaking on the status of these

19   PSRs?

20               MR. CLEMENT:          Well, I understand from the

21   Government that there was a request in 2007 and that the

22   Labor --

23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              That was an opinion

24   letter, they said.      I thought they said that was an

25   opinion letter.

 1                 MR. CLEMENT:       It was a request for an

 2   opinion letter.   I'm sorry.

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:         Yes.    I asked if there

 4   was a request from the pharmaceutical companies for a

 5   rulemaking on the proper classification in this case.

 6                 MR. CLEMENT:       No, there wasn't, Justice

 7   Ginsburg, but I think that actually cuts in our favor,

 8   because in 2004, a lot of companies were coming in with

 9   things where they thought it was unclear, where they

10   thought there was some doubt, and asking for

11   clarification.    This was so well understood that the

12   outside sales exemption, or perhaps the administrative

13   exemption, covered the outside sales force of this

14   industry --

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:         What's the case that I

16   cite if this opinion is written the way you -- you

17   propose, and the -- this Court says, well, this has been

18   70 years, or maybe in 10 years if you take the new

19   regulations as setting a new regime, and the Department

20   has never made an objection.           And, therefore, it follows

21   that the Department's interpretation is implausible or

22   improper, and then I cite some case from our Court.

23                 What -- how do I write this?

24                 MR. CLEMENT:       I would -- I would ask you not

25   to be bound by having to cite a case.            I would ask you

 1   to just use the following reasoning, though, which I

 2   think is 100 percent -- and there's plenty of cases you

 3   could cite as perhaps Cf. cites.

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, I'd like one.

 5                (Laughter.)

 6                MR. CLEMENT:        Sure.     Well, here's -- let's

 7   start -- let's start with Fox and just the basic notion

 8   that in administrative law, if you're going to change

 9   your position, you have to acknowledge that you're

10   making a change.    I think at a minimum here, if they're

11   going to impose this kind of massive retroactive

12   liability on this industry --

13                JUSTICE KAGAN:            But, Mr. Clement, this isn't

14   a change.   You've referred to it as a change in a lot of

15   ways -- in a lot of times, but what we have here is an

16   agency that, for some number of years, thought that this

17   was not the most urgent problem on their plate.            Indeed,

18   one would think this is a pretty peculiar Department of

19   Labor if they thought that this was the most urgent

20   problem on their plate.        So, they didn't enforce it.

21                But now the question has come up.           And so,

22   they say we'll look to our regulations.            This falls on

23   one side of the regulation.            Now, you've been given a

24   gift for all these years is one way of looking at it,

25   because -- because you were not their most urgent

 1   problem; and so, they didn't enforce their own

 2   regulations against you.

 3                MR. CLEMENT:         Justice Kagan, here's the

 4   thing.   We can quibble about whether or not there is a

 5   change in their position or whether they just didn't

 6   have a position before, but I think the important thing

 7   is they've imposed, by taking this position in an amicus

 8   brief and asking for deference to it, massive liability

 9   on this industry.      The PhRMA brief estimates it's

10   billions of dollars.

11                Now, I --

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Why must you -- why must

13   you look to an amicus brief?            Why not just look to the

14   regulation that defines -- the regulations that define

15   "sale" and that define "promotion"?              The 541.503 says

16   promotion work incidental to a sale made by somebody

17   else is not exempt.

18                Why do we get into the amicus brief when we

19   have in these 541 regulations a definition of sales on

20   the one hand, promotion on the other, and then this

21   statement that promotion work incidental to sale made by

22   somebody else is not exempt?

23                Why doesn't -- why isn't that the answer to

24   this case?

25                MR. CLEMENT:         Here's the answer as to why


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                        52
 1   that's not the answer, and then let me circle back and

 2   say why, if you're going to err on one side or the

 3   other, you shouldn't err on the side of imposing massive

 4   retroactive liability.        The reason that that's not a

 5   simple matter of deferring to that is because that same

 6   regulation earlier says that promotional work is exempt

 7   if it's in conjunction with the individual's own sales

 8   or solicitations.

 9                  Now, I happen to think it's pretty clear

10   that these -- by getting this commitment, which is the

11   functional equivalent of a commitment to buy, which is

12   what the regulations and the regulatory interpretations

13   have always said is a sale in some sense, I think these

14   are sales.   Certainly --

15                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         Does the -- does the

16   pharmaceutical company have a sales force?           I mean, who

17   sells to the wholesalers, the pharmacies, and the

18   hospitals?

19                  MR. CLEMENT:       It's not this kind of outside

20   sales force.    It's a much less sales-oriented

21   transaction.    The PhRMA amicus brief, for example, gives

22   the example of a company that has 2,000 outside sales

23   reps and 10 people that handle the movement of transfer

24   of product to the wholesalers and the distributors.

25                  If you look at district court's opinion at


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

 1   the page 42a of the petition appendix, the district

 2   court addresses this issue and I think gets it exactly

 3   right, which is the reason there isn't a sales effort

 4   focused on the wholesalers and distributors is because

 5   their job is to have on stock the kind of medicines that

 6   physicians are prescribing.

 7                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         But there are -- there

 8   are people who sell to them.            There may be only a few,

 9   but --

10                  MR. CLEMENT:       There's a handful of people,

11   Justice Ginsburg, but that's -- I mean, there's nothing

12   anomalous about that.        Most industries have some sales

13   force that operates on the wholesale --

14                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         Is there -- are they

15   exempt, too?

16                  MR. CLEMENT:       What's that?

17                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         The -- the actual sellers

18   from the -- the people on the staff of a pharmaceutical

19   company who sell to the wholesalers, pharmacies, and

20   hospitals, are they exempt?

21                  MR. CLEMENT:       I don't believe so, Your

22   Honor, at least not under the outside sales exemption,

23   in part because they're not outside, in part because

24   they're not really engaged in a sales effort.           It does

25   them no good -- if they can convince some wholesaler or


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

 1   distributor that the GSK product is far superior to a

 2   competitor's product and it doesn't make any difference

 3   at all because as a result of that -- I mean, they need

 4   to have product that actual doctors are writing

 5   prescriptions for.      That's what drives sales in this

 6   industry.

 7                  There's nothing anomalous about that.            If

 8   you think about any industry, sales activity is always

 9   directed at the people who place orders.              In this

10   industry, because of the learned intermediary doctrine,

11   the person who places the order is the doctor, not the

12   ultimate end user.

13                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            Is there -- let's

14   say the doctor hears the spiel and the doctor says,

15   okay, yours is the first thing I'll think of, you know,

16   when I have a patient with this and this.              I mean, is

17   that a sale?

18                  MR. CLEMENT:       We think it is, Your Honor,

19   but if you have any doubt about that, certainly at the

20   point that the doctor then, when he sees the next

21   patient, writes the prescription, at that point I think

22   there's a sale, because, again, what the regulations and

23   regulatory history looks for is a -- is a commitment to

24   buy.   That's the relevant commitment to buy.             That's the

25   order in this industry --


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            So, what if the

 2   doctor, as I suspect a lot of doctors do, they listen to

 3   this guy, and they say, okay, I'll think of -- you know,

 4   when it comes up, I'll think of your product; and the

 5   next guy comes in from the other company, and he says,

 6   okay, when it comes up I'll think of your product -- are

 7   those two sales or no sale?

 8                  MR. CLEMENT:       I think they're probably two

 9   sales, Your Honor.      But, you know, it's the same

10   thing -- imagine somebody who's, you know, just sitting

11   in their house, and they get an encyclopedia

12   salesperson.    And they say, you know, I'll -- maybe I'll

13   buy that.   That looks good, I'll buy it.             And they say,

14   but you know, maybe the State law has a law that says

15   you've got to wait 24 hours before you put the order in,

16   in the computer.

17                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            But that's a firmer

18   commitment when they say I'll buy it.              The physician is

19   just saying I'll think of your product when it -- when

20   the need comes up.

21                  MR. CLEMENT:       But -- well, if -- I mean,

22   what I was suggesting is maybe you're talking about a

23   State that has a 24-hour waiting rule or something like

24   that.   So, it's a commitment that, sure, I'm going to

25   enter the order in 24 hours.            Well, maybe another

 1   encyclopedia salesmen comes in, in 12 hours, and he

 2   gives another commitment.          One of the two people he's

 3   going to put the order in, and one of the two people

 4   will certainly have finally had a sale.                I think,

 5   again --

 6                  JUSTICE KAGAN:           But don't you think that the

 7   way this works -- I mean, the way we should all hope it

 8   works is that the detailer comes in, the detailer

 9   provides information, the doctor says that's very

10   interesting, I want to think about it, I'm going to

11   think about it.    Then the doctor reads some medical

12   journals; then maybe the doctor goes to a convention and

13   talks to other doctors about the product.

14                  I mean, that's what you would hope that a

15   doctor would do before a doctor decided I'm going to

16   start prescribing this medicine.                 And the detail work is

17   a part of that, but so are many other things before the

18   doctor actually decides to do something.

19                  MR. CLEMENT:       Sure, Justice Kagan.        But you

20   don't want to look at this like it's an isolated,

21   one-time, you know, sort of interaction.                I mean, one of

22   the things that -- that happens in this industry, like

23   other sales industry, is there are multiple trips.                The

24   detailer goes there maybe the first time and lays the

25   ground work.    Then maybe the doctor reads some other


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

 1   information.    Then maybe on the final visit, after all

 2   that information is there, finally the detailer gets the

 3   commitment to prescribe to appropriate patients.

 4                  I think one way to think about the absurdity

 5   of making the difference turn on the prescription is to

 6   compare this salesperson to another salesperson of

 7   medical devices who goes in, but these are medical

 8   supplies that the doctor uses in the doctor's office.

 9   Now, they're both hired for their sales experience.

10   They both get sales training.            They both have a sales

11   territory.   They're sitting in the same doctor's waiting

12   room, waiting for the same doctor; they have samples in

13   their bags, and they both get a commitment from the

14   doctor.

15                  Now, what sense does it make as a matter of

16   the FLSA and its labor policies to say one of those

17   people is exempt and the other one is not exempt,

18   because for perfectly sensible reasons, we say that one

19   of those products is a prescription where the doctor

20   writes the order and then with that order, the end user,

21   the ultimate end user, can make the purchase at the

22   pharmacy, whereas the other one --

23                  JUSTICE SCALIA:          Mr. Clement, I wanted to

24   ask you about section 501 of the regulations, which --

25   which is on page 4 of the appendix in the blue brief,


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official

                                                                     58
 1   and was mentioned in the -- in the Government's

 2   presentation.    It says -- requires that the employee be

 3   engaged in (i) making sales within the meaning of 3(k);

 4   or (ii) obtaining orders or contracts for services or

 5   for the use of facilities.

 6                 What authorization is there for the agency

 7   to invent number (ii)?

 8                 MR. CLEMENT:       Well, Justice Scalia, you

 9   heard the Government's explanation; and, as you suggest,

10   if the Government's explanation is right, then this

11   shouldn't be a matter of just trying to limit things to

12   3 -- to the 3(k) definition.           I think, even though -- at

13   the 3(k) definition, though, if you look at that

14   definition, it has every hallmark of being broad and

15   functional and flexible.

16                 I would want to make one very important

17   point, though, about the ultimate question here, because

18   ultimately the decision whether to go one way or another

19   on this issue has remarkable significance for

20   retroactive imposition of liability.

21                 We all know that retroactive rulemaking is

22   disfavored.   Well, think about the consequences here.

23   You have massive liability, between 4 and 6 years of

24   effective time and a half, because of the way that the

25   statute works.    It has time and a half plus liquidated

                                                                            59
 1   damages.    You are talking about people who are very well

 2   paid, close to six figures.            So, unlike the classic

 3   worker who you might think is covered by the FLSA, who

 4   is a relatively low hourly worker, the amounts of

 5   damages here are quite significant.

 6                 Of course, the effort to try to reconstruct

 7   these people's hours, given that they were told they

 8   were exempt and they were outside the office, trying to

 9   reconstruct how many overtime hours they actually worked

10   is going to be a crapshoot at best.             So, if you think

11   about all of that, and then you think about, as

12   Justice Breyer indicated, the other option, which is

13   to --

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Let's pursue this for a

15   second.

16                 MR. CLEMENT:       Sure.

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Because I'd like to go back

18   to Justice Kennedy's question, and this is only me

19   speaking.   I don't know how anybody else feels.           If this

20   had come up in 1941, you wouldn't have had a chance.               I

21   would have said look at the statute; it says the

22   Secretary defines it.       You'd say, well, can you define

23   it in a brief?   Yes, you have to be careful of briefs,

24   but, yes.   And that's the end of the case.           It's not a

25   question for judges; it's a question for administrators.

 1                 All right.     But now it's difficult for me

 2   because of the passage of 75 years.             And we can blame it

 3   in part on the industry or in part on the Secretary.

 4   There is blame to go around.           So, the question is, what

 5   do I do as a judge?

 6                 And partly my instinct is get somebody to

 7   decide this other than a lawyer in the Department of

 8   Labor, because this is a hard question.             And that's

 9   where we come to Justice Kennedy's question, which is he

10   says all right, fine, let's write that, and -- and what

11   case do we cite?

12                 And I don't agree with you, overturn Auer.

13   I think amicus briefs are often helpful, but use them

14   with care.    And then I have the statute here, which

15   talks about the Secretary doing the definition of

16   "outside salesman," and I have lots of rules and

17   regulations and reports, which are fairly ambiguous in

18   my opinion.   So, you tell me what to say.

19                 MR. CLEMENT:       I -- may I answer?

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            Certainly.

21                 MR. CLEMENT:       I would start by citing -- I

22   know it's not always in fashion to cite lower court

23   opinions, but I'd start by citing Judge Posner's opinion

24   in Yi, because the Seventh Circuit -- they're a very

25   distinguished panel, Judge Posner, Judge Wood, and one

 1   other judge.    The three of them considered this

 2   question -- Judge Sykes.          I'm sorry; it slipped my mind.

 3   A very distinguished judge.

 4                  (Laughter.)

 5                  MR. CLEMENT:       The -- it's -- the point being

 6   that he said along these lines that the 70 years of

 7   history makes a significant difference.               And here's the

 8   thing.   Just like you expect an agency to confront a

 9   change in position, you'd at least expect an agency to

10   confront the retroactive consequences and in that sense

11   address them and make sense of it.

12                  And I would just simply say this, which is

13   if you had a rulemaking, you could bring in all of the

14   affected parties, including the current sales

15   representatives, who are not the ones bringing these

16   lawsuits, whose jobs are going to be changed, and you

17   could make a comprehensive view, as opposed to just

18   getting one side of an ongoing litigation and then

19   making a decision about an amicus brief.

20                  Thank you.

21                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Thank you, counsel.

23   it.

 1           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

 2                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 3                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:           Thank you,

 4   Mr. Chief Justice.

 5                 Three quick points.           First, if you read the

 6   transcript, you will see that my friend says that the

 7   nature of this job has changed.            And that is an

 8   essential part of understanding this case.            And there is

 9   an entire amicus brief in addition to our submission on

10   behalf of pharmaceutical representatives, which explains

11   how very much the requirements of pharmaceutical

12   detailers and the restrictions on them have changed

13   dramatically over the last couple of decades in

14   particular.   And that's why the continued references to

15   70 years are wrong.

16                 The other important point about the FLSA in

17   particular is that there is a statute on this issue, and

18   it says that an employer can request guidance from the

19   agency; and if it doesn't do that, it is not -- it has

20   no defense.   Its job is to ask for guidance.           And there

21   are 50 different exemptions from the FLSA that cover

22   hundreds of different categories of employees.              And if

23   the rule you are going to announce -- because Mr.

24   Clement's view is you shouldn't be bound by any

25   precedent.    If the rule you are going to now announce is


                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                             63
 1   that there has to be rulemaking with respect to all of

 2   those, it's going to be an administrative nightmare.

 3                  Two quick further points.             The Department of

 4   Labor's position is that there has to be an actual

 5   commitment, not a precatory commitment.                And Mr. Clement

 6   says, well, that's contrary to the definition of "sale"

 7   in 3(k).   Please read the definition again, and if you

 8   find something in there, something that is not a

 9   commitment -- it can be an exchange; it can be a

10   commitment that is even a consignment; it can be a

11   traditional sale.      Every one of those things is

12   commitment.    It is impossible to find in the definition

13   of "commitment" a rule that says -- excuse me, in the

14   definition of "sale" --

15                  JUSTICE ALITO:           Where do they say that

16   that's -- that that's their test?                Where does the

17   Department of Labor say that's their test, that it has

18   to be a commitment?       I thought what they said in their

19   brief was there has to be a transfer of title.

20                  MR. GOLDSTEIN:           There are two different

21   parts to it.    One is that they -- as explained by Mr.

22   Stewart, their view of transfer of title, but the Weiss

23   Report says repeatedly that there has to be a commitment

24   to buy.    That is --

25                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, which is it?       I mean,


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official

                                                                           64
 1   you say, yes, yes, it's both.

 2                MR. GOLDSTEIN:            You have to agree --

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Pick one.

 4                MR. GOLDSTEIN:            You have to --

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is it the transfer of title

 6   or a commitment?

 7                MR. GOLDSTEIN:            It is the agreement to

 8   transfer title.    There are two parts to it.

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Ah.     Okay.

10                MR. GOLDSTEIN:            But there has to be the

11   agreement, a firm agreement.            It's repeated in the 2004

12   preamble to the regulations as well.

13                Now, the last critical point I want to make

14   is that Mr. Clement says there are commissions on sales

15   in the sales territory.        And what he is not talking

16   about is any commitment by a physician.                 When you go

17   look at the transcript and he talks about sales in the

18   sales territory, he is talking about the sales by the

19   pharmacy.   That's where the sale occurs in this

20   industry.   It's to the wholesaler and to the pharmacy

21   and to the customer.

22                He is not talking about a sale in the sense

23   of getting a commitment to have --

24                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But the district court

25   here made a finding -- this is at 42a of the appendix

                                 Official

                                                                         65
 1   for the Petitioners:      "Sales volume is directly and

 2   exclusively driven by the number of prescriptions

 3   written by physicians, and plaintiffs' job was to

 4   encourage such prescriptions."

 5                MR. GOLDSTEIN:            That -- Mr. Justice Kennedy,

 6   I don't believe that you can fairly describe that as a

 7   finding of fact.    That is the judge -- his view of the

 8   summary judgment record.         It is --

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:            It's a finding of logic,

10   for Pete's sake.    These are prescriptions.            You can only

11   get a prescription from a doctor.               Obviously, the number

12   of prescriptions, drugs sold, depends upon the number of

13   prescriptions given by doctors.

14                MR. GOLDSTEIN:            Two -- two things about

15   that.   First is that a detailer doesn't get a commitment

16   to a prescription.     And then in addition, it's clear

17   that there are numerous influences on what a doctor

18   does.   There's all the advertising --

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's a different point.

20                MR. GOLDSTEIN:            It is an important point.

21   It is a different point, but it is --

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:            It's not the point you were

23   making.

24                MR. GOLDSTEIN:            Justice Scalia, the point

25   that I will make at bottom is that you have to have a

 1   firm commitment.     That's what the Department says.           And

 2   there is nothing in the definition in 3(k) that

 3   contradicts that.
