 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  We will hear

 4   argument next this morning in Case Number 11-1118,

 5   Gunn v. Minton.

 6                Ms. Webre?

 7                     ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANE WEBRE

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9                MS. WEBRE:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                In Grable, this Court explained that

12   "arising under" jurisdiction demands, not only a

13   contested Federal issue, but a substantial one embedded

14   in a State claim in order to indicate whether there is a

15   serious Federal interest in exercising Federal

16   jurisdiction over the State claim.

17                This Court should reverse the judgment below

18   because Minton -- Mr. Minton's claims do not present a

19   substantial Federal issue, and exercising Federal

20   jurisdiction over his claim and legal malpractice claims

21   like his, State legal malpractice claims would -

22                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              The question is whether

23   the experimental use -- whether that was a viable

24   theory.   Why isn't that a substantial -- what do you

25   mean by, "substantial"?

 1               MS. WEBRE:         Well, Your Honor, defining

 2   substantiality is a difficult point.                      I -- I would

 3   answer in two layers.         First, Mr. Minton's claim did not

 4   involve a legal question of does the -- how does the

 5   experimental use doctrine work; how is it applied, what

 6   are its parameters?

 7               The question was did his fact-bound and

 8   situation-specific affidavit present relevant evidence

 9   of the application here in this particular case.                      And it

10   is not a substantial question because, first, from a -

11   a unique case perspective, it involved merely a

12   hypothetical determination.

13               There were no actual patent rights that

14   would be at issue.      Those were already fully, finally,

15   irrevocably determined in the underlying patent

16   litigation in Federal court.

17               And, second, from a jurisprudence

18   standpoint, the -- the question of uniformity of patent

19   law, any decision by a State court, in Mr. Minton's

20   legal malpractice claim, would not be binding in any

21   way, on either the PTO in a patent application, or on

22   any subsequent Federal court deciding a real patent

23   case.

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Do you mean substantial

25   beyond the -- the -- this particular case?

 1               MS. WEBRE:      Yes, Your Honor.                And I -- I

 2   think that that's where the Federal circuit's

 3   jurisdictional -- the Federal circuit's "arising under"

 4   jurisdiction standard, which the Supreme Court of Texas

 5   applied here, that's exactly where it goes awry, is that

 6   the court improperly conflates the -- the question of

 7   necessity of a Federal issue with the question of

 8   whether that issue is substantial.

 9               And, in the Grable case, this Court

10   emphasized that those are two separate issues.                   There

11   are four prongs to the Grable test.                    The Federal issue

12   embedded in the State claim must be necessary to the

13   State claim; actually disputed; substantial; and then

14   there is a federalism inquiry that exercised a Federal

15   jurisdiction over this State claim can't upend the

16   proper balance between State and Federal authority.

17               The Grable court announced that, and then

18   just a year later, in the Empire HealthChoice case, Your

19   Honor -- Justice Ginsburg, you wrote that opinion for

20   the Court, and that acted sort of as an underscoring of

21   "and here's how limited the Grable rule really is."

22               The Empire HealthChoice opinion

23   distinguishes between Grable, which presented a merely

24   pure question of law, and the claims at issue in Empire

25   HealthChoice which were fact-bound and
                                5

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   situation-specific.      It distinguished the -- the

 2   question of whether a State court is competent to apply

 3   Federal law to the extent relevant to the claims and

 4   found that, yes, it was.

 5               And the -- the Court emphasized that,

 6   certainly, the State courts are going to be deciding the

 7   occasional Federal issue here and there, but let's not

 8   make a Federal case out of each and every State tort

 9   claim that might have an embedded Federal issue.

10               Now, in the earlier argument, there was some

11   discussion of the fact that jurisdiction means a lot of

12   different things in a lot of different contexts.       But,

13   here, this Court has, on more than one occasion,

14   determined that jurisdiction -- "arising under"

15   jurisdiction means the same thing in 1331, the general

16   Federal question jurisdictional grant, and 1338(a),

17   the -- the exclusive provision that's applicable

18   specifically to patents.

19               Now, that has been amended slightly.       It -

20   it, now, includes compulsory counterclaims where they

21   didn't used to be a part, but the jurisdictional grant

22   that Congress gave through the first sentence of 1338(a)

23   uses the same exact phrase, the "arising under," "any

24   civil action arising under Federal law."

25               And, Justice Scalia, you wrote the opinion
                                6

 1   for the Court in the Holmes Group case and explained

 2   that the linguistic consistency between those two means

 3   that they mean the same thing.

 4                  There is nothing unique about this subject

 5   matter -- the patent subject matter, that changes the

 6   scope of the jurisdictional grant.                   To be sure, the -

 7   the grant of original jurisdiction to the district

 8   courts is exclusive, and that is different from the

 9   general Federal question.

10                  And to be -

11                  JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, why isn't that

12   significant?    Doesn't that manifest Congress's view

13   that -- that -- that this is -- that this is a

14   complicated specialty area?               And so there would be,

15   arguably, a special reason for having these cases, cases

16   that involve a patent issue, in Federal court, rather

17   than State court?

18                  MS. WEBRE:      Yes, Your Honor.            But the --

19   Congress did that in a couple of different ways.                  First

20   of all, I think it begs the question -- it begs the -

21   the core question, to say that exclusive -- the fact

22   that jurisdiction is exclusive answers the

23   substantiality because, in order to get to exclusivity

24   of the jurisdiction, you have to get to jurisdiction

25   first.
                                          7

 1                 You have to -- it has to be "arising under"

 2   an act of Congress relating to patents before it can

 3   then be exclusive.      So -- so we still have the first

 4   step.   But, also, Congress did not cast a net broader

 5   than the general "arising under" standard.

 6                 Even under the -- the statutory framework

 7   after the America Invents Act amendment -- under the

 8   statutory structure, there are still a number of patent

 9   issues -- legal issues that are going to be decided in

10   the State courts that do not come within the exclusive

11   jurisdiction of the Federal courts.                       For example,

12   compulsory counterclaims, now, come within the exclusive

13   jurisdiction, but permissive counterclaims don't.

14                 Permissive counterclaims can certainly

15   present just as substantive a question of patent law,

16   and, yet, those are excluded under the statutory scheme

17   of 1338(a).   Patent issues raised as a defensive matter

18   are not sufficient to support "arising under"

19   jurisdiction under 1338(a).

20                 So, certainly, Congress contemplated a

21   situation where some patent issues are just not going to

22   come within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal

23   courts.

24                 And I think it's interesting to -- to back

25   up a little bit and look at the Federal circuit's
                                8

 1   evolved perception of its own exclusive jurisdiction.

 2   In the early years of the Federal circuit, in 1984, the

 3   first Chief Justice -- the first chief judge of the

 4   court, Chief Judge Markey, in the Atari case that is

 5   cited at page 21 of the amicus brief filed by the

 6   American Intellectual Property Lawyers Association, the

 7   Federal circuit wrote, "Congress was not concerned that

 8   an occasional patent law decision of a regional circuit

 9   court or of a State court would defeat its goal of

10   increased uniformity in the national law of patents."

11               And that was the view of the Federal

12   circuit's own jurisdiction in 1984.                    But, in the time

13   evolved, the Federal circuit has changed its perception

14   of its own jurisdiction, and that's why we are here

15   today, is, in 2007, the Federal circuit went awry and -

16   and changed the standard that no longer follows what

17   this Court articulated in Grable.

18               They -- they have improperly conflated the

19   necessity and substantiality components of the -- of an

20   appropriate Grable analysis.           And they totally disregard

21   a proper balance of the State and Federal interests.

22   The Federal circuit announced that there's an interest

23   in -- Federal interest in uniformity of patent law, and

24   then that was that.      That was the end of the inquiry.

25   There is no balance if you don't look at the State

 1   interest on the other side.

 2               And, in legal malpractice cases, in general

 3   and in Mr. Minton's claim in particular, there are

 4   substantial State interests.              There is the general

 5   interest, the right of a State to develop its own State

 6   claims, its own State law, and its own State courts.

 7               But there is also a State interest in

 8   governing the relationship between attorney and client

 9   that happens through the legal malpractice process.

10   But, specifically, with regard to Mr. Minton's claim,

11   one of his primary theories in -- in this case -- in the

12   legal malpractice case, is that the attorney's error,

13   with regard to bringing up the Experimental Use

14   Doctrine, deprived him of an opportunity to make a

15   lucrative settlement with the NASD in the underlying

16   patent litigation.

17               Well, the question of exactly how you prove

18   whether and to what extent the NASD would have paid a

19   settlement and for how much in the underlying case is a

20   matter of tremendous dispute right now.                   That is an

21   evolving issue in the -- in the legal malpractice

22   jurisprudence of the State of Texas.

23               In fact, in the month of December 2012, the

24   Supreme Court of Texas heard argument in a case called

25   Elizondo v. Krist that addresses that precise issue.

 1   How do you prove that NASDAQ would have paid him

 2   $100 million, if only these lawyers had raised this

 3   issue earlier?

 4                And, yet, if this -- if Mr. Minton's claims

 5   are hailed into Federal court because of the fact-bound

 6   and situation-specific application of the Experimental

 7   Law Doctrine, the Federal courts would be Erie guessers

 8   as to that important issue that the State courts really

 9   need to resolve.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Ms. Webre, is there any

11   binding effect of a Federal determination here on State

12   law?   And is there any binding effect of any State

13   determination here on Federal law?

14                MS. WEBRE:      No, Your Honor.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:          If it was left to the

16   State, would what the States say about -- about patent

17   law be binding in any Federal cases?                    And, vice-versa,

18   if it went to the Federal jurisdiction, would anything

19   that the Federal court says about -- about State tort

20   law be binding on State courts?

21                MS. WEBRE:      In neither direction would any

22   decision be binding.      The -- the State -- any decision

23   in a State court on a legal malpractice matter regarding

24   issues of patent law would not be binding in any way on

25   the Federal courts or on the PTO in handling any of the

 1   patent applications -- prosecution of patents.

 2                  JUSTICE SCALIA:          Well, that -- that being

 3   so, your -- your last argument about the Federal

 4   government messing up -- you know, State tort law in an

 5   area that -- that is currently very much in the fore in

 6   the -- in the decisions of the Texas Supreme Court, that

 7   doesn't really carry a lot of weight, except in this

 8   single case.

 9                  I mean, they are not going to mess up Texas

10   law in that regard.       They may get this case wrong,

11   but -

12                  MS. WEBRE:      You -- you are right that -

13   that it will not, substantially, adversely impact Texas

14   State law, but that's an illustration of a substantial

15   State interest.

16                  And, in a way, it's akin to the issue in

17   Grable because the -- the embedded issue in Grable that

18   justified this Court reaching down and grabbing a State

19   law claim and bringing it up into Federal court wasn't

20   just that the issue was disputed, the -- the

21   construction of that statute was unresolved.              But that

22   it needed resolving.        It needed resolving by a court

23   whose decision could be precedential, so then it's

24   resolved from then on.

25                  And so the -- the question of how do you

 1   prove a settlement is an issue that needs resolving by a

 2   court who's going to advance the jurisprudence.

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          What about the Federal

 4   issue?   Doesn't that need resolving?

 5                 MS. WEBRE:      There are no Federal issues that

 6   need resolving here because it's solely a question of

 7   the application of these specific facts in this

 8   affidavit to the doctrine.            There's -- there's no

 9   overarching question of -- of patent law that needs

10   resolving.

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Let me -- me ask this

12   question:    Suppose you have two cases, hypothetical,

13   case A, case B, both involve the Experimental Use

14   Doctrine in Federal patent law.                In case A, it's a very

15   weak argument; it's most unlikely it's not going to

16   apply.   Case B, very strong argument, Experimental Use

17   Doctrine applies.

18                 Any difference in the removability in those

19   two cases?

20                 MS. WEBRE:      I don't believe so, Your Honor,

21   because the question isn't the -- the significance to

22   the particular claim.        The question is the Federal

23   issue.   Is there a -

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, if -- if you say -

25   since you're going to say it -- I mean, if it's a

 3               MS. WEBRE:        Well, it's -- it's, perhaps,

 4   more necessary.   But -- and maybe what I need to do is

 5   back up a little bit and discuss what I think are the

 6   factors for a court to look at, when deciding whether or

 7   not an embedded Federal issue is a substantial one.

 8               In looking at this -- this Court's

 9   articulation in the Grable case and the Empire

10   HealthChoice case, the -- the issues that the Court

11   looked at -- one was the nature of the Federal -- of the

12   Federal question itself -- the Federal issue, is it a

13   constitutional issue?

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So does that mean that,

15   if the claim in the malpractice action is that the PTO

16   acted unconstitutionally -- assume that set of facts -

17   how does that change your analysis?

18               MS. WEBRE:        That -- that would be a more

19   substantial Federal question than the one presented

20   here, but I submit that it would not be sufficient to

21   warrant "arising under" jurisdiction here because it

22   is -- it involves only a hypothetical actual set of

23   patent rights.    No judgment that can happen in a State

24   legal malpractice case actually impacts any patent

25   rights.

 1                  Let's say Mr. Minton won a judgment from a

 2   State legal malpractice court saying, it was the

 3   negligence, that you would have won the experimental use

 4   exception, your patent would have been declared valid.

 5   And so he has a judgment from a State court saying,

 6   the -- the loss of your patent was the result of a

 7   negligence and not because it was actually invalid.

 8                  That doesn't give him a valid patent.            He

 9   cannot take that judgment and then sue somebody and say,

10   look, look, I've got a patent.                And it's -

11                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So go back to -- you

12   were going through a list of questions, and I posited

13   let's assume that the malpractice claim does involve a

14   constitutional question.

15                  MS. WEBRE:      Yes.       So -

16                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Then what other

17   factors -

18                  MS. WEBRE:      Well, the -- the -- in the

19   continuum constitutional issues would be more

20   substantial; statutory issues would be a little less

21   substantial.    In fact, this Court grappled with that in

22   the Grable case and said, we're not going to draw a hard

23   and fast line on statutory issues.

24                  But then, in the Empire HealthChoice

25   opinion, the Court noted that this is a -- the issue -
                               15

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the Federal issue there was nonstatutory, and so,

 2   therefore, let's not make a Federal case out of it.           So,

 3   in that continuum, that would be one factor to look at.

 4                Another factor to look at would be, is the

 5   Federal issue -- the legal issue undisputed or

 6   uncertain?   Not necessarily the application of these

 7   particular facts to the legal issue because there really

 8   isn't a Federal interest in how this affidavit is

 9   construed or not.

10                But, in -- in the resolution of the legal

11   issues, as in Grable, is the question of law disputed or

12   uncertain?   And the corollary to that is does it need

13   resolving?   Because that was the situation in the Grable

14   case.   But just because an issue is novel doesn't ipso

15   facto make it a -- a substantial issue.

16                This Court, in the Merrell Dow case,

17   discussed that, that -

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Why -- why do all -- why do

19   all of these issues cut in your favor, in all cases

20   involving malpractice?        I mean, you're urging, not just

21   that your client win here, but you want us to adopt a

22   general rule that malpractice suits involving patent

23   rights can never, ever come under "Federal arising"

24   under jurisdiction.

25                Isn't that -- isn't that what you want us to

 1   say?

 2                MS. WEBRE:        Yes, Your Honor.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:            So the burden would be on

 4   you to show that every one of these factors, in all of

 5   those cases, is always going to cut in your favor.

 6   That -- what, that they will never involve a

 7   constitutional issue?         That they will never, ever

 8   determine future patent decisions?

 9                MS. WEBRE:        Well, Your Honor, I -- I urge

10   that because I think that's the only appropriate

11   application of the Grable test to legal malpractice

12   cases.   And it's not that -

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, I like -- I like

14   bright-line rules.      In fact -- you know, I thought

15   Holmes had it right.        It doesn't arise under, unless the

16   cause of action is a Federal cause of action.             But once

17   we've gone down -- down the road of Grable, I don't -

18   you're -- you're proving a negative.

19                The burden is on you to prove a negative,

20   that there is no situation that can arise in -- in

21   malpractice cases involving patents where the Federal

22   issue would justify arising.              That's a hard road to hoe.

23                MS. WEBRE:        I think there are two reasons -

24   there are two reasons why that's the only appropriate

25   way to apply the Grable test to legal malpractice cases,
                               17

 1   and both of them involve the lack of precedent from the

 2   case.

 3                 One is it can never involve actual patent

 4   rights.    The consequence of a judge's -

 5                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             How about fraud on -- a

 6   claim of fraud on -- that the malpractice was fraud on

 7   the PTO?   Lawyer loses that.            It's been litigated.

 8   Isn't it res judicata, and won't it affect the patent -

 9   or might it not affect the patent in a patent action?

10                 MS. WEBRE:      No, Your Honor, it would not.

11   It would not affect the patent office, either, as a

12   matter of res judicata or as a matter of issue

13   preclusion -- non-mutual issue preclusion or as a matter

14   of jurisprudential precedence, for a couple of reasons.

15                 One is that, as a starting point, the -- the

16   question of attorney misconduct can affect the issuance

17   of a patent before the patent office, but that would

18   happen not in the context of a legal malpractice claim,

19   but in the context of the actual prosecution of the

20   patent before the PTO itself.

21                 So the PTO would have made a -- its own

22   determination and granted or not granted limited

23   sanction, whatever action it is the PTO takes in -

24   before -- in a proceeding before itself, the PTO would

25   be deciding that.
                                        18
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                So a legal malpractice case would only be

 2   subsequent to that.      So, in -- in the first instance,

 3   the PTO gets to decide that.

 4                From a res judicata standpoint, the PTO's

 5   patent review manual -- the Manual of Examination of

 6   Patents provides that res judicata effect is only given

 7   to decisions by either the Board of Patent Review or

 8   Interferences, the United States District Court for the

 9   District of Columbia, and the Federal circuit.               No State

10   courts make that list.

11                So, from a res judicata standpoint, only

12   going right up the chain is going to bind the PTO.                 And,

13   from an issue preclusion standpoint, the PTO would never

14   be a party -- could never be a party to a -- a legal

15   malpractice claim and, therefore, would not be bound by

16   any State court decision.

17                And what's kind of a funny -

18                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             I find that somewhat

19   hard to follow.

20                Let's assume, in adjudicating a medical -- a

21   malpractice claim, the State court finds that the

22   attorney suppressed information.               It's a finding of

23   fact.   He has this information in his or her file, and

24   they didn't disclose it.         I'm not quite sure how the PTO

25   ignores that litigation.

 1                MS. WEBRE:      The PTO may not ignore it.             The

 2   PTO -

 3                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Or the district court

 4   does, if it gets to review that in a later action.

 5                MS. WEBRE:      Well, but -

 6                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             I'm only raising this

 7   question to address Justice Scalia's point.                You're

 8   asking for an absolute rule, and I posited a situation

 9   where I think it's not so clear that a State court

10   finding might not have an effect.

11                So do we have to go to your absolute rule?

12                MS. WEBRE:      No, Your Honor.            You do not have

13   to go to my absolute rule.           I think that the absolute

14   rule is the -- the most sensible and appropriate

15   application of the Grable test to State law legal

16   malpractice claims, and it has the added benefit of

17   certainty.   It -- it doesn't roll us back to the Justice

18   Holmes' rule.

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I guess you might argue

20   that, even if it fails the Grable test in a couple of

21   isolated cases, we should still adopt that rule because

22   the benefits of having a -- a clear rule that doesn't

23   have to be litigated in every -- every case outweigh the

24   fact that one or two might -- might not come out that

25   way if we applied Grable.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Because we're making it up

 3   anyway, right?

 4                (Laughter.)

 5                MS. WEBRE:      Well, Your Honor, I -- I would

 6   take it a step further than that because I think that

 7   any actual impact of -- of what you're positing, Justice

 8   Sotomayor, is so ephemeral.           The idea that -- that the

 9   PTO will look at a fact-finding in a legal malpractice

10   case, and, oh, goodness, I didn't realize there was this

11   suppression of evidence, I'm now going to dig further.

12                Well, that's such a speculative and

13   ephemeral possibility, it doesn't disrupt the fabric of

14   patent jurisprudence -- patent law, in any way, and it

15   doesn't tie the hands of the PTO in any way.                     It doesn't

16   bind the PTO in any future consideration of a

17   continuation patent or any other related

18   continuation-in-part patent.

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Let -- let me ask you

20   this:   The Brighton Miller treatise is rather

21   complimentary of Grable, and said it brought

22   considerable certainty to the area.                     I was pleased to

23   hear that because I'm not sure that it's true.

24                (Laughter.)

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY: But can you just tell me,

 1   as an -- as an empirical matter, does "arising under"

 2   for removal jurisdiction cases consume a tremendous

 3   amount of time in litigation in the Federal courts?

 4   It's just -

 5                 MS. WEBRE:      Well, it -- it does a couple of

 6   things.   First is it consumes a lot of time of the

 7   courts and the litigants in removing and then getting

 8   remanded again.   And it -- as is discussed in the -

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What I -- yes.   What I

10   mean is the argument over "arising under" over

11   jurisdiction.

12                 MS. WEBRE:      There are, on this issue of the

13   legal malpractice cases, in the wake of the Federal

14   circuit's opinions, the Air Measurement case and

15   Immunocept case in 2007, scores and scores and scores of

16   courts -- State and Federal courts have been grappling

17   with this precise jurisdictional issue.

18                 I think this case is about the fifth or

19   sixth cert petition that came up to this Court on this

20   jurisdictional question.          I think there are three or

21   four behind us in queue, and there -- there continues to

22   be uncertainty in the lower courts on this precise

23   issue.

24                 And -- and it really presents for this Court

25   a question of is "arising under" jurisdiction truly a

 1   lenient standard, as the Federal court has articulated?

 2                Now, it's true that the -- the entire body

 3   of State law legal malpractice cases arising out of

 4   patent representation is not going to overwhelm the

 5   Federal court.   It's not going to -- to -

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             So my question was even

 7   broader.   Let's say we resolve legal malpractice.

 8   Then -- then we will have products liability with a

 9   particular product, and then we will have some food and

10   agriculture cases.      It goes on and on.

11                MS. WEBRE:        Well, I think that is a -- that

12   is a -- that's a substantial issue.                       But, like

13   Justice Scalia said, that -- you know, the -- this Court

14   departed from Justice Holmes' construct some years ago.

15   But I think that there is the opportunity in this case

16   to provide a great deal of certainty, to provide

17   absolute certainty vis-à-vis legal malpractice cases

18   because of their unique hypothetical aspect.                       The

19   consequence of the judgment affects no rights.

20                But, second, in reaffirming -

21   rearticulating the Grable test, emphasizing the

22   importance and the separateness of the substantiality

23   inquiry, emphasizing the importance of the federalism

24   aspect, this Court has a great opportunity to resolve a

25   lot of uncertainty.

 9               Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

10   Court:

11               This case is about whether a State court has

12   subject matter jurisdiction over a State law patent

13   malpractice claim that rests entirely on an issue of

14   patent law that is only heard in Federal court, and when

15   that issue is dispositive, central to the case, has

16   issues of first impression in them, has no State

17   analogue in any other area of the law, and whether in

18   the deciding issues of questions of law and will not

19   disturb the balance between State and Federal judicial

20   responsibility.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               What about other areas of

22   exclusive Federal jurisdiction, where the claim, if you

23   are stating it initially, would have to go into Federal

24   court and not State court, say, an antitrust claim, a

25   copyright claim?

 1               Is -- is what you're saying about patents,

 2   does that go for every area, where initial jurisdiction

 3   is exclusively in the Federal court?

 4               MR. MICHEL:        No, Your Honor.          It does not.

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Then what's the

 6   difference between, say, antitrust and patent?

 7               MR. MICHEL:        There -- there are many

 8   differences, Your Honor.         First, antitrust has -- has a

 9   State analogue.   The Texas Supreme Court in

10   Coca-Cola v. Harmer, 218 Southwest -

11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Then take immigration

12   law.

13               MR. MICHEL:        Yes.

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Don't get in the weeds.

15   Take immigration law.

16               MR. MICHEL:        Yes.       Now, once again, the

17   issues -- immigration law may be a -- a different area

18   where there is exclusive Federal court jurisdiction in

19   that area, possibly.      But, once again, the analysis and

20   the application in immigration law, from a malpractice

21   case, may give rise in that area.

22               However -

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Excuse me.        I guess I just

 5   rule?

 6                MR. MICHEL:       I believe, in part.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:          I mean, any -- any Federal

 8   statute that can be sued upon, both in Federal courts

 9   and in State courts, but as to which Federal courts are

10   the dispositive adjudicators, you say that that does not

11   come within this "arising under" rule?

12                MR. MICHEL:       Does -- does not come within

13   this Court's doctrinal holdings in Grable and Empire

14   because we have a Federal balancing and State balancing

15   issue.   And, as we've articulated, when Congress has

16   articulated -

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Do you have a case for

18   that, that says, if a suit could be brought in State

19   court, even though it involves a dispositive Federal

20   question as to which this Court would be the -- you

21   know, the last interpreter, it cannot possibly come

22   within "arising under" jurisdiction?

23                Have you got a case for that.

24                MR. MICHEL:       I'm sorry, Your Honor.    I don't

25   know if I followed your question.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Do you have a case which

 2   says that, when a Federal question is presented in a

 3   case over which Federal courts have jurisdiction, but

 4   also State courts have jurisdiction, although, needless

 5   to say, the Federal courts would be dispositive on the

 6   issue, such a case cannot come within the "arising

 7   under" jurisdiction?

 8                MR. MICHEL:       No, I don't think anything that

 9   expressly.   But the A&T and the -

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:          I would find it

11   extraordinary for -- for that to be the rule.

12                MR. MICHEL:       Well, you can't isolate it.

13   That rule is more complicated because it is the

14   application of the Grable standard that's the analysis.

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But getting back --

16   Justice Ginsburg simply made the point, I had thought,

17   that you place a good deal of reliance on the fact that

18   there is exclusive jurisdiction.               And her question to me

19   pointed out how far-reaching this case might be because

20   it -- it could involve patents, copyright, all other

21   areas of exclusive jurisdiction.               If that is going to be

22   your special rule, it's not so confined as you suggest.

23                That's all that question meant to me.

24   Certainly -- certainly, you -- you could have cases

25   where there is concurrent jurisdiction, 1983, in which
                               27

 1   we'd have the same problem.

 2                 MR. MICHEL:       I think -- I think the factors

 3   that go into determining the -- one of the grounds that

 4   has been articulated by Grable and the balancing for

 5   Merrell Dow is the number of cases that would come into

 6   Federal court, and it is a doctrinal decision.              It is a

 7   doctrinal rule.

 8                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So patent law cases of

 9   malpractice are smaller in number than copyright

10   cases -

11                 MR. MICHEL:       Patent law cases -

12                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR -- immigration, other

13   exclusive jurisdictions, so that's okay to -- to remove,

14   but those others aren't?

15                 MR. MICHEL:       Those -

16                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Does that make a whole

17   lot of sense?

18                 MR. MICHEL:       That is the articulation in

19   Grable, Your Honor.

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Well, how about a

21   different one, the one that's being proposed by your

22   adversary -

23                 MR. MICHEL:       That -

24                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             -- which is define

25   "substantial" as to how it affects Federal law, which I

 1   think was the bottom line -- or the development of

 2   Federal law, the bottom line of Grable.

 3                And she says -- you dispute this in your

 4   brief -- that it doesn't affect the invalidated patent,

 5   that there's no way that a judgment on the malpractice

 6   is going to be used in a continuation patent dispute

 7   because it's not one of the listed preclusive courts.

 8                So how does a ruling affect patent law?

 9                MR. MICHEL:       Sure.        Many -- many ways, Your

10   Honor.

11                First, the test is uniformity, under Grable,

12   the uniformity of patent law -- Federal law, not whether

13   the -

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Why is -- who's going to

15   follow it?

16                MR. MICHEL:       In many situations.               For

17   example, she -- she conflates -- Petitioners conflate,

18   res judicata with issue preclusion.                     That goes back to

19   your earlier question, Justice Sotomayor, and that issue

20   preclusion will have an affect.               And as, in fact -

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Issue preclusion applies

22   only to someone who was a party.

23                MR. MICHEL:       Correct.          That would only apply

24   to the inventor; it would not apply to the PTO.                    It can

25   only be used against, in this, case Mr. Minton.                    And, in

 1   fact, patent counsel in this case, under the rules of

 2   the Federal circuit, under patent law and the Patent

 3   Manual, disclosed the State court's rulings in this case

 4   to the Patent Office during its continuing patent.                    The

 5   State district court judge made a scope and claim

 6   decision.

 7                  So, Justice Sotomayor, back to your

 8   question -

 9                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But that, certainly, is

10   not binding.    The -- whatever the State -- whatever the

11   State court says, as a matter of patent law, has no

12   binding effect on that question coming into Federal

13   court.

14                  MR. MICHEL:       It does.

15                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            How?

16                  MR. MICHEL:       Under this Court's decision

17   Marrese v. The Academy of Orthopedic Assertions --

18   Surgeons, a State court's decision is entitled to issue

19   preclusion, even in Federal forum.                   And so that is

20   why -- also the patent -- the continuation patent

21   would -- could be declared invalid for failing to

22   disclose that information.

23                  We are not saying it's binding on the PTO,

24   but it is an issue of issue preclusion as against Minton

25   that would be in front of the PTO and is in front of the

 1   PTO, as we speak.

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          I mean, is that -- my

 3   goodness, but you are going to have a purely

 4   hypothetical State decision here.                 The State will have

 5   held that -- you know, if -- if he had said this, the

 6   result would have been something else.                   And you think

 7   that that precludes the -- the issue when it arises in

 8   real life?

 9                 And you say, since the State court made that

10   hypothetical determination, it precludes me from arguing

11   it in -- in real life.

12                 MR. MICHEL:       Yes.       It is a factor -

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Do you have any cases like

14   that?    It seems, to me, a rather weird -- weird

15   situation.    I mean, maybe it could, but it -- it's

16   strange.

17                 MR. MICHEL:       Well, it is a matter of issue

18   preclusion.    This Court -- that is the danger of

19   allowing these patent law issues to proceed in State

20   court.

21                 This Court -- the State district court in

22   this case entered in a brand-new issue of Federal

23   interpretation -- Petitioners and Respondents totally

24   disagree as to whether this is a fact-specific case or

25   whether this case involves issues of law.                  And, in fact,

 1   we contend it involves issue of first impression.

 2               In this case, the State district court made

 3   holdings about issues of whether the question of -- the

 4   experimental use exception is a question of law or a

 5   question of fact.

 6               It made the requirement that experimental

 7   use had to go to a required claim element, as opposed to

 8   a claimed element.      It made the determination -- and the

 9   Court of Appeals made the legal determination that

10   knowledge of the buyer is conclusive, rather than as a

11   factor.

12               Those are all issues of not only disputed

13   substantial issues of Federal patent law that both

14   parties submitted briefings in the trial court and the

15   court of appeals, 70 pages long, disputing the legal -

 1                 MR. MICHEL:       It's going to have a really

 2   profound effect on the patent law practitioners who are

 3   uniquely situated and work in parcel -- and interlocking

 4   with the Patent Office.

 5                 It is the patent lawyers who draft the

 6   patents, it is the patent lawyers who present them to

 7   the Patent Office, they are the ones who engage when

 8   they need to be amended or refined or narrowed or

 9   broadened.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          They knew -- they knew

11   these were controverted issues.                You say that they -

12   they are controverted issues.              So they would have been

13   alerted to a problem anyway.             And they certainly would

14   not accept a State court determination as authoritative

15   resolution of that problem.

16                 MR. MICHEL:       The patent -

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          The patent attorneys.         I

18   mean, you -

19                 MR. MICHEL:       No, the Patent Office will have

20   to take that as guidance because their new taskmaster

21   will not be -- be following Federal patent law because,

22   in this case, the Court injected a brand-new requirement

23   that was never held by a patent lawyer, that you had to

24   have an expert witness testify to establish your

25   experimental use testing exception.

 1                 That's never been held anywhere in Federal

 2   patent law.    So, now, who's the patent lawyer going to

 3   be looking to for guidance?            The exclusive Federal

 4   courts?    The Patent Office?          Guidance from the Federal

 5   circuits?

 6                 No, they are going to have their backs

 7   watched by the State courts, saying, uh-huh, you know

 8   what?   I'm going to impose a new legal obligation on

 9   you, and you are going to be held for malpractice.                   And

10   that's not -- that's not -

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What would happen -- what

12   would happen if that came up in an ordinary litigation

13   in Federal court, and the Federal circuit, ultimately,

14   decided the question, that the State court was entirely

15   wrong about this; you don't need a witness.

16                 Well, that's the end of it, right?               Once the

17   Federal court decides the question, then whatever the -

18   the State judge thought was the Federal law is -- is

19   gone.

20                 MR. MICHEL:       No, that's exactly the problem.

21   The State courts aren't bound by the Federal circuit's

22   holding.    There will be no Federal review of substantial

23   issues of Federal law -- zero -- unless this Court is

 1   courts are not bound by the Federal court's holding?

 2   You mean State courts can resolve patent questions,

 3   contrary to what the Supreme Court of the United States

 4   says the law is?

 5                MR. MICHEL:       No, not contrary -- that was

 6   the point I was going to make -- not contrary to the

 7   holdings of the United States Supreme Court, contrary to

 8   the Federal circuit's holding.              And, in fact, the Fort

 9   Worth Court of Appeals did not follow the Federal

10   circuit's holding in this area.

11                JUSTICE KAGAN:          Well, are you saying,

12   Mr. Michel, that what -- what the State courts are going

13   to do is to say that, notwithstanding that the Federal

14   circuit has ruled on a matter and notwithstanding that

15   the lawyer has complied with the rule as articulated by

16   the Federal circuit, that, nonetheless, they will be

17   held to have committed malpractice because they didn't

18   comply with the State's rule?

19                Is -- is that what you think the State

20   judges are really going to do?

21                MR. MICHEL:       I think the State judges are

22   going to try to, possibly, apply Federal circuit

23   holdings.   And, in this case, they did not.            They

24   injected a new holding, which established a new

13   court practitioners, in that State, who get sued for

14   legal malpractice.      And it's that interrelationship

15   between the lawyers who are drafting patents --               they

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It's not -- it's

 3   not -- I guess it's not their hypothetical law.                They

 4   would be saying, this is what we think the Federal law

 5   requires, and while we're happy -- or not happy -- but

 6   it's interesting that the Federal circuit thinks

 7   something else, but that doesn't bind us.

 8               MR. MICHEL:        Correct.          Correct.   And it's

 9   not just hypothetical.       The hypothetical doesn't mean

10   insubstantial.   The hypothetical doesn't mean -

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why is that worse than the

12   fact that, if it goes to Federal court, all of the

13   lawyers in the State, in all malpractice cases, are

14   going to be, supposedly, bound by the Federal court's

15   holding as to State issues of malpractice?

16               I mean, it seems to me it's Twiddle Dum or

17   Twiddle Dee, whichever court system you go to, you are

18   going to terrorize the lawyers of that State on the

19   basis of an opinion of a court that is not dispositive

20   on those issues.

 1                You are going to try the Federal lawsuit,

 2   Your Honor -- Justice Scalia, you are trying that patent

 3   infringement lawsuit in State court, in the -- in the

 4   case within the case analysis.               The Federal rules,

 5   that's what is so troubling about -

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:           And you -- you are trying

 7   the malpractice lawsuit -- the State practice

 8   malpractice lawsuit, in Federal court.

 9                MR. MICHEL:        Correct.          But the application

10   and the rules governing it are going to be by Federal

11   law.   The rules in this case -- in particular, the

12   substantial issue of the experimental use exception, the

13   only issue that saved was the -- the experimental use

14   exception.   We disagree, but, just because the State

15   court makes an opinion and a holding, it doesn't have

16   real-world effects.      It really does.                 It's not an

17   advisory opinion.

18                And there needs to be a distinguishment

19   between the side issue the Petitioners are saying -

20   they are trying to get you focus on this one micro-issue

21   of whether it will affect an actual patent -- as to

22   whether it will affect patent law.                  And it will affect

23   patent law, and it will affect the application of patent

24   law.   And so what you're going to have is you're going

25   to have two divergent systems.

 1               You're going to have -- actually, you will

 2   have one on the Federal side, and then you will have 50

 3   jurisdictions espousing whether they think the law is of

 4   patent law and not being bound by the Federal circuit,

 5   which is going to -

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Anytime -- anytime -- I

 7   mean, a lot of patent questions -- as you already

 8   pointed out, a lot of patent questions come up in State

 9   court litigations, contract litigations, every time you

10   have a patent question, then must the case go to the

11   Federal court, in your view?

12               MR. MICHEL:        No, that is not our position.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So what is the dividing

14   line between patent questions that belong in State court

15   and patent questions that belong only in Federal court?

16               MR. MICHEL:        For example, not every

17   malpractice case -- it will be the case within the case

18   doctrine in a patent case that will go to Federal court.

19               For example, failure to communicate a

20   settlement offer does not have a case within the case.

21   In a business transaction, it doesn't have the case

22   within the case analysis.

23               So those malpractices arising from them will

24   not go to Federal court.        Breaches of fiduciary duty for

25   divestiture of fees don't have the causation element.

 1   So we are -

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          So you are talking about a

 3   patent case that has a patent issue, whether it's a

 4   contract case, a tort case, a malpractice case -- if it

 5   has a patent issue, you think it has to go to Federal

 6   court?

 7                 MR. MICHEL:       We do not.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Well, then I repeat Justice

 9   Ginsburg's question, how do you decide which of those do

10   and which of those don't?

11                 MR. MICHEL:       I think this is a case in

12   point.   This case is on all fours with Grable.                 There is

13   no exception.   The only distinguishing factor is this

14   hypothetical argument of the case within the case

15   analysis.

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, why don't you stay

17   within the lines that you give us?                  You have said not

18   every patent question that comes up in a State court, if

19   it's dismissed, just so you can start over in Federal

20   court, what patent questions -- now, let's not talk

21   about breach of fiduciary duty general questions -- what

22   patent questions are properly adjudicated in the State

23   court as part of a lawsuit that -

24                 MR. MICHEL:       Well, the -- the distinction

25   is, for example, in a licensing case, in a patent case,

 1   where you -- those cases are brought in Federal -- I

 2   mean -- I'm sorry -- brought in State court -- our -

 3   our request here is following Grable, that what will go

 4   to Federal court are legal malpractice cases arising

 5   from substantial issues of Federal patent law that have

 6   that case within the case analysis.

 7                 And it's that narrow -- extremely narrow

 8   window of cases.   This is not, "Katie, bar the door."

 9   We -- we set forth the empirical numbers.                     They are

10   going to be microscopic.          But what they do have is

11   Grable's test.   Every element that Grable articulated,

12   this case meets.

13                 It does involve substantial issues of first

14   impression.

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But what was the

16   substantial Federal matter in Grable?

17                 MR. MICHEL:       The issue of the IRS, whether

18   personal service had to be given under an IRS -

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Yes.          And that was in the

20   control, the actions of the Federal agency, of IRS.

21                 MR. MICHEL:       Correct.

22                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And you have no

23   counterpart for that here?

24                 MR. MICHEL:       We do have rules that will

25   govern the law on experimental use exception.

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            You have -- you have -

 2                 MR. MICHEL:       And that would govern the

 3   application in Federal court.              That's why it should be

 4   in Federal court, to govern how the agency -- and

 5   whether a patent -- and this suit goes directly -- it

 6   affects patents.   This is going to patent validity.

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But the -- but the

 8   Federal court -- you said before that whatever the

 9   Federal circuit says, the State doesn't have to follow

10   it the next time there's a case in State court, but the

11   Federal court is certainly not going to follow what the

12   State says on experimental use.

13                 MR. MICHEL:       It does.          I will tell you -

14   the reason why it does, it's in the doctrine of

15   collateral estoppel.       It affects the inventor.                It's

16   affecting the inventor in this case.                     This holding of

17   the State district court and the State court of appeals

18   are now before the Patent Office -

19                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             I'm sorry.        How does

20   it -- the patent's invalid.

21                 MR. MICHEL:       I'm sorry?

22                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             The patent's invalid.

23   Nothing the Court does here is going to change that

24   invalidity.   That -- that's what I don't understand.

25                 MR. MICHEL:       Correct.

 1                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             He's not going to get

 2   his patent back from this action.

 3                 MR. MICHEL:       That's correct.

 4                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             He's going to get money

 5   for losing it, maybe.

 6                 MR. MICHEL:       Correct.

 7                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So how does it affect

 8   the patent?

 9                 MR. MICHEL:       There is a pending continuation

10   patent.    And -

11                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             We're back to that

12   issue.    Okay.

13                 MR. MICHEL:       Yes, but that is a collateral

14   estoppel issue.    Here, let me -- let me give up another

15   scenario because, in a different role, when the patent

16   is not declared invalid and, instead, there is a finding

17   of non-infringement, and that's what gives rise to the

18   legal malpractice case.

19                 Then you go to State court, and, in that

20   situation, the determination of -- of infringement will

21   be raised as a basis for legal malpractice against the

22   lawyer in the malpractice action.                 Then the lawyers

23   raise, as within the case within the case exception, is

24   that, oh, the patent was invalid.

25                 So, then, in that situation, a State
                                 43

 1   district court will be rendering an opinion on a live

 2   patent, and then that will be binding on the inventor

 3   and will affect real live actual patents, and it does

 4   affect patents before the Patent Office.

 5                Petitioner said we -- it's not an issue of

 6   res judicata.   They cite a rule.              That's not our

 7   argument.   It's an issue of issue preclusion.              It's also

 8   the duty and the obligation of the lawyer to disclose

 9   that judicial discussion -- discussion to the Patent

10   Office.

11                Otherwise his, continuation patent could be

12   declared invalid for inequitable conduct -- for not

13   disclosing material information.

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And your -- your

15   distinction between other areas of Federal jurisdiction

16   where the Federal law controls and patent is what?

17   What -- Justice Sotomayor brought up immigration law -

18                MR. MICHEL:       Yes.

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- copyright law.     Why

20   don't they -- why doesn't what you said work the same

21   way in those fields?

22                MR. MICHEL:       I think there are -- there are

23   distinctions in the area of patent law versus any other

24   area of the law namely because, as we get to the

25   State -- and this -- this goes to the analysis of the
                               44
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   State/Federal balance.        That's why the exclusive Federal

 2   court jurisdiction.

 3                 That's why exclusive nationwide jurisdiction

 4   in patent law in the Federal circuit is different than

 5   any other area of the law.            It is that balancing test

 6   that we are required to engage in.

 7                 That's why it's unique from antitrust,

 8   trademark, civil rights, securities, employment.                   Those

 9   have concurrent jurisdiction.              They may not have an

10   agency involved.

11                 For example, bankruptcy initially sounds

12   like it's exclusively Federal court issues, but, when

13   you look underneath the bankruptcy, there is core

14   proceedings, and there's non-core.                  Non-core are

15   concurrent.   Those could be heard in State court.

16                 Secondly, those underlying issues in

17   bankruptcy, typically, involve State property right

18   issues anyway.   So they are really applying whether

19   somebody has a perfected security interest lien, whether

20   somebody has a justified debt, whether -- things of that

21   nature.

22                 So rather than in any other area of law,

23   these other areas, even if they are exclusive in Federal

24   court jurisdiction, some of those underlying issues are

25   basically based on who the party is.

 1                And they are still applying underlying

 2   State issues.

 3                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So your case turns on

 4   the -- the Federal circuit having exclusive appellate

 5   jurisdiction?

 6                MR. MICHEL:       That is one of the most

 7   defining factors on the State/Federal balance of

 8   judicial responsibility.         Our understanding of that

 9   analysis of the federalism and, also, the articulation

10   of -- just as we have showed up -- Petitioners said a

11   whole ton of cases were going to come in.

12                We supported statistics that the numbers

13   would be very small.      But the distinguishing factor

14   because of the balancing test that we are required to -

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But, if there's a large

16   Federal interest, I mean, that's a -- you're saying that

17   there is in the Federal/State balance -- the Federal

18   balance -- it's preponderant on the Federal side.

19                If there is that large Federal interest, is

20   it surprising that the government hasn't come into this

21   case, if there's such a Federal interest to be

22   protected?

23                MR. MICHEL:       No, I think the Federal

24   government -- I can't -- I can't speculate to -- for

25   that, Justice Ginsburg.        There could be just many
                                     46
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   reasons why they didn't come in on this case, just like

 2   they don't come in on many other cases.

 3                But the Federal interest here, in the

 4   national uniformity, I think, has been well stated, both

 5   by this Court and the Federal circuit.

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            There's a difference

 7   between you and your colleague on what "substantial"

 8   means.

 9                MR. MICHEL:       Yes.

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And she says it doesn't

11   just mean necessary -- essential in this particular

12   litigation, but, as in the Grable case and the Kansas

13   City Title & Trust, has larger ramifications for many

14   other cases, not just this case and whether there's

15   going to be issue preclusion as to this particular

16   inventor.

17                Those -- I don't see an issue in this case

18   comparable to those.

19                MR. MICHEL:       I think there are -- there are

20   a number of issues of -- of greater importance than just

21   this case.   The question is the ongoing conflict in

22   Federal patent law on whether the experimental use

23   exception is a question of law or a question of fact.

24                The Federal circuit has gone both ways on

25   that, whether the issue of buyer knowledge is a
                               47

 1   conclusive factor or whether it is just one of 13

 2   factors.

 3                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Whether they -- those

 4   questions will come to the Federal circuit, and they'll

 5   decide it, and then they'll be settled.

 6                  MR. MICHEL:       Well, we would hope they would

 7   be settled, but, then, we're going to have this whole

 8   other body of law out there in State courts that aren't

 9   bound by the Federal court to answer those questions.

10   And those will govern the practice of patent -- patent

11   lawyers.

12                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            How likely is that, in

13   practice, that once the Federal circuit weighs in, that

14   the State judges will go their own way?

15                  MR. MICHEL:       I think it's a very real

16   possibility.    We've had -

17                  JUSTICE SCALIA:          Well, my -- my experience

18   is that Federal judges, including this Federal judge,

19   are not interested in -- in getting into the weeds of

20   patent law, and, if -- if they could rely on a decision

21   of the Federal circuit, they would do that just as fast

22   as they can.

23                  MR. MICHEL:       You -- you would -- you would

24   think so.   It doesn't appear to be the case because, in

25   this case, we had holdings that -- that experimental
                               48

 1   testing had to be on a required claim element.                 There is

 2   also an issue in this case of whether you had to have an

 3   expert witness testify to prove up the experimental use

 4   exception, nowhere held in Federal law.

 5                  The problem is these judges often will have

 6   never handled a patent law in their career.                 This will

 7   go to some judges who have been in family law, got

 8   elected at the district court, and will never have

 9   decided or looked at a patent law case.

10                  We're requesting -

11                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Would that be the same

12   thing for antitrust, be the same for copyright?

13                  MR. MICHEL:       But the articulation isn't the

14   same.   There are other -- in antitrust, there are State

15   analogs.   The -- the judges are familiar with applying

16   it.   In fact, the State of Texas, in Coca-Cola v.

17   Harmar, stated that there's a high interest in its own

18   State interest -- I mean, antitrust laws.                 The same with

19   trademark, trademark is concurrent jurisdiction.

20                  The limited area that applies these factors,

21   going back to the balancing test, is extremely narrow.

22   Patent law is unique in that area of almost any other

23   area of law.    We think the Texas Supreme Court got this

24   decision right, and we request that the Court follow

25   Grable and apply Grable to the case at hand.

 1               Thank you.

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

 3               Ms. Webre, you have four minutes remaining.

 4                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JANE WEBRE

 5                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Ms. Webre, can I ask you

 7   about the question presented?

 8               The way you presented it to us, it -- it was

 9   as though we're -- we're reviewing whether the Federal

10   circuit was right to reject Grable in -- in whatever the

11   names of those opinions are.           But.       In fact, that's not

12   the situation at all.

13               The Texas Supreme Court here applied Grable,

14   and I think just the way you would want it applied.                  So

15   your -- your contention is simply they didn't apply it

16   correctly; isn't that right?

17               MS. WEBRE:      I disagree, Your Honor.            The

18   Texas Supreme Court didn't properly apply Grable.               What

19   they applied was the Federal circuit's improper

20   departure from Grable, in two ways.

21               One is they conflated necessity with

22   substantiality, and that comes -- in the Federal

23   circuit's jurisprudence, that comes from a sound bite

24   from the earlier Christiansen case, where the -- the

25   line goes something like, "There is a substantial
                               50

 1   Federal issue because it is necessary to the parties'

 2   claim."

 3                And so it conflates necessity with

 4   substantiality, and the -- the Texas Supreme Court

 5   followed the Federal circuit's construct.               They said,

 6   we're applying Grable, we're looking at substantiality,

 7   but then they did exactly what the Federal circuit did.

 8                And ditto with -- with the Federalism

 9   balance.   They pointed to the needs of the Federal

10   interest in the uniformity of patent law, and that was

11   the end of the inquiry.

12                And I think that that is a measure of the

13   deference that the Supreme Court of Texas -- as other

14   State courts would do, the deference they grant to the

15   Federal circuit in deciding the question of appropriate

16   scope of patent jurisprudence and the relative

17   importance of the -- the uniformity of patent law.

18                And so we arrive to you from the Supreme

19   Court of Texas, but truly presenting the -- the

20   appropriateness of the Federal circuit's redone

21   application of the Grable test.

22                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Could you answer the one

23   point your adversary raised that -- that gives me

24   pause -- a lot of pause.

25                He says a ruling on patent law of how you

 1   should or should not behave in a State malpractice claim

 2   will affect all of the lawyers who practice in -- in

 3   your State because each of them will have to do or not

 4   do whatever that malpractice ruling was because that's

 5   what the State is going to -- State courts will follow

 6   in the future.

 7               So it will change those lawyers' behaviors

 8   in Federal court.

 9               MS. WEBRE:        Your Honor, I think that that is

10   such a speculative road to go down.                      What is it the

11   lawyers are going to do different?                  A lawyer -

12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               They are going to

13   present an expert all of the time when they don't need

14   to.

15               MS. WEBRE:        They are -- they are going to do

16   some extra work and make an extra belt along with the

17   suspenders that they are required to do.

18               And where is the harm in that?                      And where is

19   the undermining of -- of the uniformity of patent law if

20   a lawyer in a-- in a real patent case in Federal

21   court -

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               But you can think of an

23   example where -- not perhaps on the facts of this case,

24   but where a State court's ruling could, in fact,

25   establish a -- a code of behavior that's not just belts
                               52

 1   and suspenders, that's something else.

 2                  MS. WEBRE:      Your Honor, I think that -- that

 3   spinning out a hypothetical on that would be truly

 4   speculative.    It's hard to imagine a situation where it

 5   would be contrary or intentioned with what -- what the

 6   Federal courts would hold, particularly since it's -- I

 7   agree with Justice Scalia's construct, that the State

 8   courts are going to try to apply appropriate Federal

 9   law -

10                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What about just

11   the -- just the flip side of this case?                   Let's suppose

12   they said, the one -- no, you don't need an expert.                    So

13   it's not belt and suspenders; it's neither belt nor

14   suspenders.

15                  That's going to affect the conduct of the

16   lawyers in the State in the way that would be disruptive

17   of -- of the uniformity of Federal patent law.

18                  MS. WEBRE:      If an expert is required under

19   Federal jurisprudence, then an expert is required in a

20   real patent case.     And if the State court makes the

21   mistake in -- in an occasional case here or there, then

22   a lawyer practicing in a real patent case -- in a real

23   case in Federal court, needs to make sure that they are

24   complying with the requirements.

25                  And -- and if you're going to -

 1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, right, the

 2   requirements of the Federal law.                 The question is

 3   there's going to be a different interpretation of what

 4   that means in the State court and in the Federal

 5   circuit.

 6                  MS. WEBRE:      Well, Your Honor, if there is a

 7   conflict, then what you're supposed to follow is the

 8   jurisprudence of the courts who -- before whom you are

 9   practicing.    If -- if the Federal circuit or Federal

10   district court has something about patent law, then

11   that's what the lawyers should follow in prosecuting a

12   patent case.

13                  And a lawyer who decides, I'm going to

14   disregard the Federal circuit standards on fact

15   question, expert required, whatever it is, and, instead,

16   follow the Fort Worth court of appeals on this issue, I

17   submit that -- that the lawyer does so at his peril, and

18   that doesn't undermine the appropriate uniformity of

19   patent law.

20                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

21                  The case is submitted.
