 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Case 10-1491, Kiobel v. Royal

 5   Dutch Petroleum.

 6               Mr. Hoffman.

 7                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL HOFFMAN

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9               MR. HOFFMAN:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               The principal issue before this Court is the

12   narrow issue of whether a corporation can ever be held

13   liable for violating fundamental human rights norms

14   under the Alien Tort Statute.            Under Respondents' view,

15   even if these corporations had jointly operated torture

16   centers with the military dictatorship in Nigeria to

17   detain, torture, and kill all opponents of Shell's

18   operations in Ogoni, the victims would have no claim.

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But, counsel, for me, the

20   case turns in large part on this:            Page 17 of the red

21   brief says, "International law does not recognize

22   corporate responsibility for the alleged offenses here";

23   and the -- one of the -- the amicus brief for Chevron

24   saying "No other nation in the world permits its court

25   to exercise universal civil jurisdiction over alleged


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                             4
 1   extraterritorial human rights abuses to which the nation

 2   has no connection."

 3                And in reading through the briefs, I was

 4   trying to find the best authority you have to refute

 5   that proposition, or are you going to say that that

 6   proposition is irrelevant?

 7                MR. HOFFMAN:       Well, there -- there are a

 8   couple of questions within that.

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And it's -- it involves

10   your whole argument, of course.

11                MR. HOFFMAN:       It does.           Yes.

12                (Laughter.)

13                MR. HOFFMAN:       And -- and let me start by

14   saying that the international human rights norms that

15   are at the basis of this case for the plaintiffs --

16   crimes against humanity, torture, prolonged arbitrary

17   detention, and extrajudicial executions -- all of those

18   human rights norms are defined by actions.                They're not

19   defined by whether the perpetrator is a human being or a

20   corporation or another kind of entity.

21                And so, I think that the -- the Respondents

22   are wrong when they say that international law does not

23   extend to -- to those kinds of acts.                They do -- it

24   does.   And the United States agrees with that position.

25                What they have tried to -- to conflate is


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official

                                                                      5
 1   the question about whether international law -- the

 2   international law norms apply to a corporation or a

 3   person with whether there's a -- an international

 4   consensus with respect to how those norms should be

 5   enforced, particularly within domestic civil

 6   jurisdiction as opposed to criminal jurisdiction.

 7              JUSTICE KENNEDY:        But in -- in the area of

 8   international criminal law, which is just analogous, I

 9   recognize, there is a distinction made between

10   individuals and corporations.

11              MR. HOFFMAN:      Well, there's a distinction

12   made within the jurisdiction of certain modern

13   international criminal tribunals.         And Respondents take

14   their position too far in this, because what they've

15   said is that the fact that corporations can't be found

16   liable criminally under the International Criminal

17   Court, for example, means that the norms, the underlying

18   norms -- genocide, crimes against humanity, and war

19   crimes when it comes to the International Criminal

20   Court -- don't apply to corporations.

21              And that's clear -- that clearly is wrong because

22   the United Kingdom and Netherlands, for example, the two

23   home countries of -- of these corporations has passed

24   domestic implementing legislation that imposes criminal

25   penalties for violations of those very norms.        So,

 1   there's no question that it can be done.

 2               What the most important -- I think one of

 3   the most important principles in this case is that

 4   international law, from the time of the Founders to

 5   today, uses domestic tribunals, domestic courts, and

 6   domestic legislation, as the primary engines to enforce

 7   international law.

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Hoffman --

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You began by --

10   by --

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Hoffman, I -- I

12   thought that Justice Kennedy asked you, is there another

13   nation that has a counterpart to 1350 that imposes civil

14   liability on corporations for violations of customary

15   international law, where the conduct occurred abroad,

16   the harmed person is employed, and the defendant is not

17   a U.S. resident?

18               MR. HOFFMAN:       Well, the -- there are two

19   parts to -- to my answer to that.            One is that the Alien

20   Tort Statute is a -- is a unique way of enforcing the

21   law of nations, in terms of the way that the Founders

22   married tort law and violations of the law of nations.

23               In the international human rights amicus

24   brief, the amicus brief of international human rights

25   organizations, at pages 18 to 22, there's a whole series

 1   of cases where the domestic courts and domestic

 2   legislation of various states around the world have

 3   addressed those kinds of issues.            And so, there isn't an

 4   exact analogue to the Alien Tort Statute, but there's no

 5   question that domestic legislation and domestic courts

 6   have taken on these kinds of issues.

 7                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, there's no particular

 8   connection between the events here and the United

 9   States.    So, I think the question is whether there's any

10   other country in the world where these plaintiffs could

11   have brought these claims against the Respondents.

12                 MR. HOFFMAN:     Well, let me address the -- I

13   think this comes under the general rubric of

14   extraterritoriality.

15                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Is there a yes or no answer

16   to that question or not?

17                 MR. HOFFMAN:     I believe that they -- that

18   the answer to that would be "yes."

19                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Where?

20                 MR. HOFFMAN:     I think that they could be

21   brought in Holland or the United Kingdom for events in

22   Nigeria.   I think that the cases that are discussed as

23   those --

24                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Any other country other than

25   the country of the citizenship of the defendants?

                                                                             8
 1                MR. HOFFMAN:     I don't know if this precise

 2   case could be brought.     I know that the -- we have a

 3   principle of transitory torts, and so, one -- and I

 4   believe other countries have that principle as well.

 5   So, in terms of the underlying tort action, we have

 6   plaintiffs who are U.S. residents and were U.S.

 7   residents when they filed this case.              They found a

 8   tortfeasor within the United States that they believe

 9   was responsible for these torts.           And from Mostyn v.

10   Fabrigas and before, Mostyn v. Fabrigas being the 1774

11   case by Lord Mansfield talking about transitory torts,

12   the courts clearly have the jurisdiction to adjudicate

13   those kinds of tort claims.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              If -- if there is no

15   other country where this suit could have been brought,

16   regardless of what American domestic law provides, isn't

17   it a legitimate concern that allowing the suit itself

18   contravenes international law?

19                MR. HOFFMAN:     Well, that -- that issue has

20   been raised in a number of the briefs.              I would say two

21   things:   One is that that doesn't really go to the

22   question about whether corporations can be categorically

23   excluded from Alien Tort Statute coverage, which is

24   really the issue that -- that was decided by the court

25   below and which was the question presented here.

 1   Extraterritoriality has to do with a different kind of

 2   issue.   I would argue that -- I mean, we've obviously

 3   argued that that's an issue that ought to be briefed on

 4   its own.

 5                But there is no international law principle

 6   that I am aware of, and I think it would need to be

 7   proved, that says that the United States Congress was

 8   disempowered at its founding from providing these kinds

 9   of tort remedies.   And it was clear from the founding

10   that the Founders at least believed that this statute

11   would be extraterritorial.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But it was

13   motivated, I gather, by assaults on ambassadors here

14   within the United States.

15                MR. HOFFMAN:     Well, it was motivated by the

16   Marbois incident and a similar incident to -- with

17   regard to a Dutch ambassador in New York at the time of

18   the Constitutional Convention.          But if -- if the Court

19   looked to the Bradford incident -- the incident about

20   which Attorney General Bradford expressed his opinion in

21   1795, which was an opinion that this Court found very

22   important in terms of interpreting the Alien Tort

23   Statute, the Bradford opinion had to do with an assault

24   on the British colony in Sierra Leone.              And so, it was

25   not only extraterritorial in the sense of piracy, and I


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   think everybody agrees that -- that this statute was

 2   intended to deal with piracy and maritime-related

 3   violations of the law of nations.

 4                It -- the Bradford opinion there said, even

 5   though U.S. criminal jurisdiction was limited, the civil

 6   jurisdiction under the Alien Tort Statute provided that

 7   the corporation that -- whose property was attacked

 8   within the territory of Sierra Leone --

 9                JUSTICE ALITO:       Have all the judges who have

10   interpreted that opinion interpreted it the way you just

11   did?

12                MR. HOFFMAN:     The Bradford opinion?

13                JUSTICE ALITO:       Yes.

14                MR. HOFFMAN:     I'm not sure in which sense.

15   I mean, the -- yes, the -- I think that the Bradford

16   opinion has been used --

17                JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, what did -- how did

18   Judge Kavanaugh interpret that on the D.C. Circuit?

19                MR. HOFFMAN:     Well, I think -- I don't

20   recall specifically.    I know that there has been some

21   controversy about whether that was an attack in the high

22   seas.   I know there's some scholarship about that.      What

23   I would suggest to the Court, if the Court went back to

24   the original documents that the -- that were sent to

25   Attorney General Bradford which -- from the British


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

 1   government, I think the Court would find that -- that

 2   this attack actually took place in the territory of

 3   Sierra Leone.

 4                 And so, one of the reasons that we've

 5   suggested that -- that -- that the extraterritoriality

 6   issue deserves full treatment if the Court is troubled

 7   by it, in a case where there is full briefing, because

 8   in this case it was raised by the -- by -- by the

 9   Respondents' amici largely, although the Respondents

10   have raised it, and there -- the historians that have

11   expressed opinions on corporate liability and others

12   that would be interested in this question have not been

13   able to put the other side before the Court.

14                 And I think there's a very -- there are

15   very --

16                 JUSTICE ALITO:    The first statement ­ the first

17   sentence in your brief in the statement of the case is really

18   striking:   "This case was filed ... by twelve Nigerian

19   plaintiffs who alleged ... that Respondents aided and abetted the

20   human rights violations committed against them by the

21   Abacha dictatorship ... in Nigeria between 1992 and

22   1995."    What does a case like that -- what business does

23   a case like that have in the courts of the United

24   States?

 1                JUSTICE ALITO:       There's no connection to the

 2   United States whatsoever.

 3                The Alien Tort Statute was enacted, it seems

 4   to be -- there seems to be a consensus, to prevent the

 5   United States -- to prevent international tension, to --

 6   and -- does this -- this kind of a lawsuit only creates

 7   international tension.

 8                MR. HOFFMAN:     Well, the Alien -- if I could

 9   start with the second part first.           The Alien Tort

10   Statute certainly was passed to do that but also as an

11   expression of the Nation's commitment to international

12   law, I think primarily as a -- as a statement of this

13   country's commitment to international law as a new

14   member of the community of nations.              And if -- if you

15   look at the incidents like the Marbois incident --

16                JUSTICE ALITO:       Do you really that think the

17   first Congress wanted victims of the French Revolution

18   to be able to sue in -- in the court -- to sue French

19   defendants in the courts of the United States?

20                MR. HOFFMAN:     I think that what -- I think

21   the question would have been, is there a law of nations

22   violation?   For example, in the Marbois incident, say

23   the -- Marbois was -- was attacked by Longchamps outside

24   the United States, but Longchamps came to take refuge in

25   the United States, and the French government said you

 2   our ambassador in violation of the law of nations.

 3               I think the United States -- I think the

 4   same principle -- the United States would have wanted to

 5   do something for the French government in response to

 6   that because it would have been giving refuge to someone

 7   who had violated the law of nations.             And -- and the

 8   same principle has been applied in the modern era to --

 9   to giving no safe haven to torturers and others.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            That sounds --

11               JUSTICE KAGAN:        Mr. Hoffman, could I --

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            That sounds very much

13   like Filartiga.   And I thought that -- that Sosa

14   accepted that Filartiga would be a viable action under

15   the Tort Claims Act.    So, I thought what we were talking

16   about today, the question was, is it only individual

17   defendants or are corporate defendants also liable?

18               MR. HOFFMAN:      A lot of the

19   extraterritoriality issues would apply to the cases that

20   this Court endorsed in Sosa.

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But I agree that we can

22   assume that Filartiga is a binding and important

23   precedent, it's the Second Circuit.              But in that case,

24   the only place they could sue was in the United States.

 3                  In this case, the corporations have

 4   residences and presence in many other countries where

 5   they have much more -- many more contacts than here.

 6                  MR. HOFFMAN:     And those issues, generally

 7   speaking, are resolved by other doctrines, rather than

 8   an exclusion of corporations categorically from the

 9   statute.

10                  JUSTICE BREYER:       You went -- can I go back

11   to -- are you finished with that answer?            Because I want

12   you to finish.

13                  MR. HOFFMAN:     I was -- the only thing I was

14   going to add to that is that a doctrine like forum non

15   conveniens or personal jurisdiction would deal with the

16   issues about whether this is the most appropriate forum.

17   And those doctrines apply whether it's an Alien Tort

18   Statute case or it's a -- a common law tort case.

19                  These plaintiffs could bring this case in

20   State court.    What the Alien Tort Statute does is

21   provide a Federal forum when these torts are in

22   violation of the law of nations.             And that's really what

13               ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

14      ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

15                     SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

16                  MR. KNEEDLER:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

17   please the Court:

18                  The court of appeals erred in its

19   categorical ruling that a corporation may never be held

20   liable under the Alien Tort Statute regardless of the

21   nature of the norm, the locus of the wrong, or the

22   involvement of the state.

23                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Mr. Kneedler, could you

24   explain to me the -- the difference between respondeat

25   superior liability and corporate liability?                In -- in


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official

                                                                       16
 1   the briefs, there seems to be an assumption that

 2   respondeat superior liability is -- is permissible, and

 3   the only issue is whether corporate liability is.         Is

 4   there a difference between the two doctrines?

 5               MR. KNEEDLER:      Well, I think the difference

 6   is really a matter of degree.          I mean, under respondeat

 7   superior liability, a corporation is normally

 8   responsible, liable for the acts of its agents.

 9               Judge Posner, in the Seventh Circuit Flomo

10   decision, suggested that in the nature -- in this

11   category of cases, assuming that the ATS would allow a

12   common law cause of action for conduct in another

13   country, that maybe there should be more limited

14   respondeat superior principles because the action would

15   occur in circumstances were the corporation sought to be

16   held liable may not have much -- much control over it.

17               Where the corporation itself is liable --

18   and this would be true in criminal law and presumably in

19   -- in tort law -- would usually require some action by

20   those responsible for running the corporation or high

21   enough up the chain of command --

22               JUSTICE KAGAN:       But, Mr. Kneedler, when

 1                  MR. KNEEDLER:      I'm sorry.

 2                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       When you say in your brief

 3   that we should look at this as a remedial question, as a

 4   question of enforcement, do you say that because you're

 5   thinking of this as a vicarious liability case?           In

 6   other words, there's an individual person who clearly

 7   has violated a norm of international law, and then the

 8   question of whether to hold the corporation liable is an

 9   enforcement question.       Or would you say that it's also

10   an enforcement question when we're talking about direct

11   corporate liability?

12                  MR. KNEEDLER:      I -- I think it's both.

13   Particularly the latter, but I think the former as well.

14   As Mr. Hoffman said, international law norms proscribe

15   certain conduct, but the enforcement of that is left to

16   each nation.

17                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       Well, but -- but I find it

18   difficult to understand why we -- we would not hold

19   foreign sovereigns liable under this Act, that they're

20   excluded despite -- despite its language; and yet, we

21   cannot inquire whether persons other than sovereigns are

22   covered.   What is -- what is the distinction between the

23   two?

24                  MR. KNEEDLER:      Well, with respect to

25   sovereigns, a sovereign could not be held liable for --

 1   at least for conduct outside the United States, because

 2   of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.             That's --

 3   that's what this Court held in the Amerada Hess case.

 4   Within the United States, if the foreign sovereign

 5   committed a tort, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act,

 6   subject to certain limitations, would allow --

 7               JUSTICE KAGAN:       But I think, Mr. Kneedler --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:       This is more specific than

 9   the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.             It deals with a

10   much more narrow category of case.              And I do not think

11   that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act would be

12   interpreted to eliminate the sovereign's liability, if

13   indeed this statute provided for it.

14               MR. KNEEDLER:      Well, the court in Amerada

15   Hess did hold that, that -- and it made an important --

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:       Yes.

17               MR. KNEEDLER:      It made a point that is

18   important to this case as well.         It said that while the

19   Alien Tort Statute identifies who the plaintiff must

20   be -- the plaintiff must be an alien -- it does not

21   identify who the defendant may be, and that if there are

22   limitations on who the defendant may be from other

23   sources of law, and foreign sovereign immunity would be

24   one of them, then the suit could not go forward against

25   the foreign sovereign.

 1                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       But, Mr. Kneedler, in Sosa,

 2   and this is the footnote 20, we said that the question

 3   of whether you were a state actor or not a state actor

 4   might be relevant to the question of whether there was a

 5   substantive norm that applied to you.

 6                 And I guess the question here is why that

 7   same analysis doesn't apply to the question of whether

 8   there is corporate liability?             In other words, is there

 9   a substantive norm that applied to corporations?               Maybe

10   there is; maybe there isn't.             But that that's the

11   question, as opposed to what you suggest in your brief,

12   that really we should just think of this as a question

13   of enforcement, which is entirely up to Federal common

14   law.    And I guess the question is why think of it as

15   enforcement rather than as a substantive obligation?

16                 MR. KNEEDLER:      Well, first looking at

17   footnote 20 in -- in Sosa, it -- what the footnote says,

18   that a related consideration, meaning related to whether

19   the particular norm satisfies the criteria in Sosa, is

20   whether international law extends the scope of liability

21   for a violation of a given norm to the perpetrator being

22   sued.    If the defendant is a private actor such as a

23   corporation or individual --

24                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       No, I'm not saying footnote

25   20 --

 1                  MR. KNEEDLER:      Right.

 2                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       It addressed a different

 3   question, but it's an analogous question.          If the

 4   question of whether non-state actors are part of the

 5   substantive obligation question, why, too, isn't the

 6   question of whether international law extends to

 7   corporations?

 8                  MR. KNEEDLER:      Because the state

 9   actor aspect of it goes to the question of the conduct.

10   Does the conduct itself violate the norm?

11                  I think it's a -- but beyond that, it's

12   enforcement.    I think it's important to bear in mind

13   that the Alien Tort Statute uses the word "tort."           And

14   it's --

15                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       But it -- I didn't

16   understand the point you just made, that the sovereign

17   immunity part goes to?       To the conduct?

18                  MR. KNEEDLER:      Well, it goes to whether the

19   defendant can be sued, the sovereign immunity does.

20                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       Why doesn't the corporate

21   thing go precisely to the same question?

22                  MR. KNEEDLER:      Because there is no

23   independent prohibition in international law or domestic

24   law against suing a corporation the way there is for a

25   foreign sovereign.     To the contrary --

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But whether -- I'm

 2   sorry.

 3                MR. KNEEDLER:      I was just going to say, to

 4   the contrary, at the time the Alien Tort Statute was

 5   adopted, corporations could be held liable.              This

 6   Court's decision in Chandler recently surveyed the --

 7   the law, and corporations could be held liable in tort.

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But under

 9   international law, it is critically pertinent who's --

10   who's undertaking the conduct that is alleged to violate

11   international norms.    If an individual private group

12   seizes a ship, it's piracy.        If the navy does it, it's

13   not.   Governmental torture violates international norms.

14   Private conduct does not.

15                So, why doesn't the -- why isn't the same

16   pertinence -- your argument seems to be that all you

17   need to do is find an event, torture, piracy, whatever,

18   and then it's up to the domestic law whether or not

19   particular entities can be sued.

20                MR. KNEEDLER:      I -- I think that's correct,

21   and --

 1   when you're talking about state -- whether it's a state

 2   conducting the illegal conduct or somebody else.             So,

 3   why -- that's not up to the domestic --

 4                MR. KNEEDLER:      No, because that goes to the

 5   definition of the norm.      But if we -- if we take -- if

 6   we take the Alien Tort Statute, in 1907, the Attorney

 7   General concluded that an irrigation company could be

 8   sued for violating a treaty.            If we take the examples

 9   that gave rise to the Alien Tort Statute, if a process

10   serving company -- if one of its agents went into an

11   ambassador's house and tried to serve process, that was

12   a criminal violation at the time.

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But you go much -- you go

14   much further.   Suppose an American corporation commits

15   human trafficking with U.S. citizens in the United

16   States.   Under your view, the U.S. corporation could be

17   sued in any country in the world, and it would -- and

18   that would have no international consequences.              We don't

19   look to the international consequences at all.

20   That's -- that's the view of the Government of the

21   United States, as I understand.

22                MR. KNEEDLER:      No.       The question of

23   extraterritorial application is distinct from the

24   question of whether a corporation can be held liable.

25                JUSTICE BREYER:       So -- so, why -- why

 1   then -- you want to answer in your brief and -- this

 2   question, I find impossibly difficult, maybe highly

 3   fact-dependent.   There is no United States Supreme Court

 4   of the World.   There is no way of getting unified law on

 5   the points of whether when we interpret a common law

 6   Federal -- a system of Federal common law to decide

 7   whether a corporation can be defendant in every ­ a

 8   defendant in a certain kind of case.               Every other country

 9   could do the same.    And there's no way of resolving it.              All

10   right?

11                 So, I find that a difficult question.                I

12   don't know why that's in this case.               I would have

13   thought the question in this case is, can a private

14   actor be sued for certain violations of -- of

15   substantive criminal law?        The answer is "yes."         Okay?

16   Genocide, for example.

17                 And then the question is -- a corporation is

18   a private actor, and is there any reason why, just like

19   any other private actor, a corporation couldn't be sued

20   for genocide?   And there the answer is I don't know, but

21   I'll find out when the other side argues.               You see?

 8                  MR. KNEEDLER:      Well, our -- our position is

 9   straightforward.    Just as you said, the question of

10   whether a corporation can be held liable we think should

11   be based on the fact that the ATS refers to torts.                And

12   in applying -- this question we think is not

13   complicated.

14                  In -- in fashioning Federal common law to

15   decide whether there should be a common law cause of

16   action, the ATS's reference to tort law, I think,

17   directs the Court to domestic tort law, and the question

18   of whether a corporation can be held liable under

19   domestic tort law.     And it clearly can be.              It could be

20   at the time this statute was enacted, and it can be

21   today.

22                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you,

23   Mr. Kneedler.

 1                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 2                MS. SULLIVAN:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 3   please the Court:

 4                I'd like to begin with the answer to

 5   Justice Kennedy's first question.           Justice Kennedy

 6   asked, and Justice Breyer renewed the question, is there

 7   any source in customary international law throughout the

 8   world that holds corporations liable for the human

 9   rights offenses alleged here?

10                And the answer is there is none.

11                JUSTICE BREYER:       You say there is not a

12   case.   That's a different matter.

13                MS. SULLIVAN:      Not a case --

14                JUSTICE BREYER:       Yes, but that's a different

15   matter because you can have a principle that applies

16   even though there isn't a case.          And the principle that

17   here would apply is what I said, Pirates, Incorporated.

18   Do you think in the 18th century if they brought

19   Pirates, Incorporated, and we get all their gold, and

20   Blackbeard gets up and he says, oh, it isn't me; it's

21   the corporation -- do you think that they would have

22   then said:   Oh, I see, it's a corporation.          Good-bye.

23   Go home.

24                (Laughter.)

25                MS. SULLIVAN:      Justice Breyer, yes, the

 1   corporation would not be liable.

 2                  JUSTICE BREYER:       All right.      Well, what

 3   source have you for --

 4                  MS. SULLIVAN:      The corporation would not be

 5   liable.

 6                  JUSTICE BREYER:       What source have you for

 7   that proposition?

 8                  MS. SULLIVAN:      The -- look to Justice Story

 9   in U.S. v. Smith, cited in the Respondents' brief at

10   footnote 12.    It looks to piracy.           And piracy is

11   allowed -- in rem actions.          You could seize the ship

12   with which the piracy was committed, as you could later

13   slave trading ships.      But you could not seize another

14   ship, and you could not seize the assets of the

15   corporation.    So, piracy --

16                  JUSTICE BREYER:       You couldn't seize another

17   person other than Blackbeard.             That's why -- if the ship

18   is owned by a corporation, and they sue the corporation

19   in 18 -- 17 whenever it was -- '96 or something, what

20   reason do we have to think that the corporation would

21   have lost -- I mean, would have won?

22                  MS. SULLIVAN:      Your Honor, let's be clear

23   that Sosa referred to specific norms.              So, the answer to

24   Pirates, Inc., does not determine the answer in this

25   case, which is about whether corporations can commit

                                                                          27
 1   post-Nuremberg human rights offenses.

 2                  A given norm must be applicable to a

 3   corporation.    So, even if I gave you Pirates, Inc., it

 4   wouldn't decide this case.          But in fact Pirates, Inc.,

 5   was not suable; it was the ship that could be seized.

 6                  But to answer Your Honor's question about

 7   the genocide convention, and perhaps I could go back.            I

 8   want to be very clear:       We're not arguing there needs to

 9   be an international adjudicated case finding a

10   corporation liable in order for Petitioners to win, but

11   they have failed to show anything in the conventions,

12   the non-binding treaties engaged in by multiple nations.

13   They've failed to show anything in custom or practice.

14                  They failed --

15                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       But, Ms. Sullivan, I think

16   that that's mostly because all of these are written to

17   prohibit certain acts, and they don't talk about the

18   actors.   So, if I could, you know, draw an analogy, it's

19   as if somebody came and said, you know, this -- this

20   norm of international law does not apply to Norwegians.

21   And you -- well, there's no case about Norwegians, and

22   it doesn't specifically say "Norwegians."          But, of

23   course, it applies to Norwegians because it prevents

24   everybody from committing a certain kind of act.

25                  MS. SULLIVAN:      But, Justice Kagan,

                                                                          28
 1   international law does speak to who may be liable, which

 2   you correctly identified as a substantive question, not

 3   a question of enforcement.         And international law holds

 4   corporations liable for some international law

 5   violations.   Look to the convention on the suppression

 6   of the financing of terrorism, which speaks about legal

 7   entities, or the convention on bribery of public

 8   officials, which speaks about legal persons.

 9                 But the human rights offenses here do not

10   arise from conventions like those, which allow corporate

11   liability.    To the contrary.           The human rights offenses

12   here arise from conventions that speak to individual

13   liability.    The liability of individuals.

14                 And, Justice Breyer, in precise answer to

15   your question about the convention on genocide, if you

16   look to the Chevron brief on page 20 -- this is the

17   amicus brief of Chevron filed by Professor Goldsmith.

18   On page 20, it quotes in full the relevant passage from

19   the genocide convention, article IV.

20                 I'm sorry.    There are many briefs, but

21   perhaps if I could read it to Your Honors, I'll read it

22   in full.

23                 It says that "persons committing genocide or

24   any of the other acts enumerated in article III shall be

25   punished, whether they are constitutionally responsible


                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   rulers, public officials or private individuals."

 2                  And, Justice Kagan, all the other relevant

 3   conventions also speak about natural persons.                The

 4   convention against torture speaks about "him," not "it."

 5   And when Congress -- in the one time it implemented the

 6   conventions that are the source of the human rights

 7   offenses that are alleged here, Congress, in the Torture

 8   Victim Protection Act, said that the suit may be brought

 9   against individuals.       And it expressly declined to use

10   the term "persons," which could embrace corporations.

11                  And we --

12                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              You're getting ahead

13   of yourself.    We haven't --

14                  (Laughter.)

15                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              We haven't decided

16   that question just yet.

17                  (Laughter.)

18                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But this statute doesn't

19   use the word "individual," and it doesn't use the word

20   "person."   As far as a corporate entity is concerned, a

21   corporate -- a corporation could sue, could be a

22   plaintiff under the Alien Tort Statute, could it not?

23                  There's no --

24                  MS. SULLIVAN:      Justice Ginsburg, a

25   corporation could sue if it were an alien, and if you

 1   decided "alien" embraced corporations.                 And, of course,

 2   the Attorney General Bradford opinion from 1795, which I

 3   agree with the Chief Justice, extended -- and with

 4   Justice Alito -- did not extend to conduct in other

 5   countries; it extended only to conduct on the high seas.

 6                But Bradford -- the Bradford opinion, if you

 7   give it any credit, only establishes that a corporation

 8   may be a plaintiff.      It does not speak to the question

 9   here, which is whether a corporation may be a defendant.

10                JUSTICE KAGAN:         Ms. Sullivan, take an

11   example that has all the extraterritoriality aspects of

12   this case removed from it.          Let's assume that the French

13   ambassador is assaulted or attacked in some way in the

14   United States and that that attack is by a corporate

15   agent.   Would we say that the corporation there cannot

16   be sued under the Alien Tort Statute?

17                MS. SULLIVAN:        Yes, Your Honor.          You would

18   say that because there is no assaulting ambassador norm

19   that applies to corporations.

20                I just want to go back and --

21                JUSTICE KAGAN:         Well, could you explain that

22   to me?   We would have to sue the person individually.

23                MS. SULLIVAN:        Exactly.          Exactly.

24                JUSTICE KAGAN:         And what -- so, this goes

25   back to Justice Breyer's question.                 Where do you find


                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that in international law?        Where -- where does it say,

 2   when the French ambassador is sued in the United States

 3   by a corporate agent, we can't sue the corporation?

 4               MS. SULLIVAN:       The burden rests on the

 5   Petitioners to show that the norm is established by

 6   international law, not on us to show that corporate

 7   liability is anchored --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Congress could -- could

 9   pass a statute to that effect.

10               MS. SULLIVAN:       Could absolutely.

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Yes.

12               MS. SULLIVAN:       Congress tomorrow,

13   Justice Scalia --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:        The issue is whether this

15   did it or not.

16               MS. SULLIVAN:       This did not.    And what

17   international law has not established -- not just

18   through cases, Justice Breyer, but through any source,

19   convention or custom.     If you look to the jurisdictional

20   statutes of the ICC, the Rome Statute --

21               JUSTICE KAGAN:        You don't -- of course, one

22   could bring an ATS suit against the individual.        Is that

23   right?

24               MS. SULLIVAN:       Yes, Your Honor.

25               JUSTICE KAGAN:        Now, all of United States'

 1   law and mostly other countries' law would hold the

 2   corporation liable for the individual's act.               Isn't that

 3   right?   That's a general principle of law.

 4                  MS. SULLIVAN:      Justice Kagan, let's be clear

 5   to separate two very different causes of action.               There

 6   is no country -- and to answer Justice Ginsburg's first

 7   question, there is no country in the world that provides

 8   a civil cause of action against a corporation under

 9   their domestic law for a violation of the law of

10   nations.   In Mr. Hoffman's hypothetical, if there were a

11   suit in England or in the Netherlands, it would be for

12   assault and battery, wrongful death, or --

13                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Ms. Sullivan that would be

14   true against an individual as well.                The ATS is just a

15   unique statute.    It's unique against individuals, and

16   it's unique against corporations.             That doesn't answer

17   the question that you're here to address, which is

18   whether corporations are meaningfully different from

19   individuals.

20                  MS. SULLIVAN:      They are meaningfully

21   different from individuals under international law,

22   which is the crucial choice of law question you need to

23   answer here.    The crucial question that's at the

24   threshold is which law determines whether corporations

25   are liable?

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:       Well you're right on

 2   that point.   What about slavery?           Genocide -- I see your

 3   point in the Goldsmith brief.            But what about slavery?

 4   That seems like contrary to international law norms,

 5   basic law norms, it could be committed by an individual.

 6   And why, if it could be committed by an individual,

 7   could it not also be committed by a corporation in

 8   violation of an international norm?

 9                 MS. SULLIVAN:      Let me be clear.        The

10   question is not "could" --

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:       No, no.       I know, but the

12   way --

13                 MS. SULLIVAN:      -- international law apply.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:       I've read the reason why,

15   as you point out in your briefs, the corporations are

16   different in many countries as if they're not moral

17   persons.    And I have in my mind filled in the blanks on

18   that, and I think I know what it refers to.             All right.

19   That's the rationale that kept them out of some of these

20   treaties.

21                 And now the question would be, all right,

22   are they always kept out no matter what?             And I'm

23   bringing up the two counterexamples I think were fairly

24   strong, was Pirates, Inc., but that's a joke example,

25   and the other -- although it's a point.             And the other

 1   is slavery.   What about -- what about that one?

 2                 MS. SULLIVAN:      Corporate liability, even for

 3   norms on which the international community agrees --

 4   torture, genocide, piracy, slavery -- corporate

 5   liability is a substantive norm that is established by

 6   international law.    And the nations of the world, for

 7   various reasons, have treated individuals and

 8   corporations differently.

 9                 And, Justice Kennedy, over and over and over

10   again, as not just the Respondents' brief at page 17 but

11   the U.K./Netherlands brief -- two of our most important

12   allies filed a brief in support of Respondents, saying,

13   at pages 11 through 15, there is no international norm

14   applicable to corporations for violations of the human

15   rights offenses here.

16                 Now, the international community has many

17   reasons for this.    In 1998, when the Rome statute

18   established the ICC, the signatories actually discussed

19   whether to have criminal liability for corporations; and

20   as the Scheffer amicus brief in support of Petitioners

21   points out, at page 18, they actually also discussed

22   civil liability for corporations, and the nations of the

23   world who created the ICC, one of the most important

24   modern instruments for bringing about human rights

25   prosecutions, declined to embrace --

 3   corporations.

 4                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Can you tell me why you

 5   think they did that?      I mean, for us, the -- respondeat

 6   superior is so simple.       Why isn't it a big deal in

 7   international law?

 8                  MS. SULLIVAN:      Well, Justice Kennedy,

 9   there's many reasons.       For one, a corporation involves

10   many innocent stakeholders beyond the perpetrators.                And

11   the regime established at Nuremberg, if it established

12   nothing else, established that it is individuals who are

13   liable for human rights offenses.             It pierced the notion

14   of hiding behind a state abstract entity, and it held

15   individuals, including individual businessmen, from

16   Alfred Krupp to 28 officials indicted from the I.G.

17   Farben firm.    But Nuremberg was about individual

18   liability.

19                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           What happened to I.G.

20   Farben?    I thought that it was dissolved and its assets

21   taken.

22                  MS. SULLIVAN:      Yes, Justice Ginsburg.       I.G.

23   Farben was dissolved by the Control Council Law Number 9

24   in 1945.   It was a political act.            It preceded any of

25   the tribunals, either international or national.             It was

 1   not until later that year that the international

 2   military tribunal began.      It prosecuted no corporations.

 3                When the Allies prosecuted perpetrators of

 4   the Nazi horrors in later cases, they prosecuted, again,

 5   only individual officers, not any corporations.

 6                There are two amicus briefs on the Nuremberg

 7   history, one in support of Petitioners filed by Jennifer

 8   Green and one in support of neither party filed by

 9   Jonathan Massey.   Both of them agree on one proposition,

10   and that is that no corporation was prosecuted by either

11   the international military tribunal in 1945 and '46 nor

12   in any of the subsequent U.S. tribunals.          In fact, in

13   U.S. v. --

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But there's no -- there

15   was no civil liability adjudicated in Nuremberg.          It was

16   about criminal.

17                MS. SULLIVAN:      That's correct, Your Honor.

18   And to answer your question, when I.G. Farben was

19   dissolved, it was part of denazification,

20   decartelization, and the destruction of the Nazi war

21   machine of which I.G. Farben was an integral part.          It

22   was practically viewed as an enemy state in and of

23   itself.

24                That is a -- so, the precedent of Nuremberg,

25   like the precedent of the ICTY, the ICTR, the ICC, all

 1   exclude liability for corporations, even for the most

 2   heinous offenses of the modern era.              They focus

 3   liability, rather, on corporate officers.

 4                And, Justice Kagan, we don't dispute that

 5   corporate officers can be held to account for these

 6   offenses, assuming, Justice Alito, that we don't have

 7   concerns about extraterritoriality --

 8                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, if that's --

 9                MS. SULLIVAN:      -- even as to individuals.

10                JUSTICE KAGAN:       If that is true -- let me

11   just take you back to this question of separating out

12   direct corporate liability from vicarious corporate

13   liability, because it's clear if -- one question is, is

14   there a substantive international law obligation?

15                But there's another question which would not

16   be an international law question, which is a remedial

17   question.   Remedies are addressed by common law rather

18   than -- American common law rather than by international

19   law.

20                So, why shouldn't we look at the vicarious

21   liability question as essentially a question about the

22   scope of the appropriate remedy once an international

23   law violation has been found?

24                MS. SULLIVAN:      Justice Kagan, you should

25   look at questions of corporate liability.              Like


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   questions of aiding and abetting liability.           Like

 2   questions of individual private liability as opposed to

 3   state actor liability.       You should look at all of those

 4   questions as substantive questions answered by

 5   international law.     And that's because footnote 20 of

 6   Sosa says you look to whether international law extends

 7   liability to the perpetrator being sued.

 8                  You can't just find an act out there and fan

 9   out to anyone in the entire world, including consumers

10   pumping gas in Ohio, and say there's been an act of --

11   an international law violation.

12                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       But the question of who can be

13   sued --

14                  MS. SULLIVAN:      It's a question of who.

15                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       --    is a remedial question.

16                  MS. SULLIVAN:      It's not.

17                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       The question of who has an

18   obligation is a substantive question.

19                  MS. SULLIVAN:      Respectfully, Justice Kagan,

20   we disagree.    The question of who may be sued is

21   fundamentally part of the question of whether there has

22   been a tort committed in violation of the law of

23   nations.   It would read the verb "committed" out of the

24   statute, if you just said find a violation of the law of

25   nations anywhere and then apply it to whoever you want.

 1                JUSTICE KAGAN:        But in my example, the tort

 2   in violation of the law nations has been committed.              It

 3   has been committed by the corporate agent.            And the

 4   question then is, can one hold the corporation

 5   responsible for that tort?         And that seems to be a

 6   question of enforcement, of remedy; not of substantive

 7   international law.

 8                MS. SULLIVAN:       Justice Kagan, we

 9   respectfully disagree.      That is a question of

10   substantive law.   Think about a domestic analogy.           Look

11   to the Restatement of Conflicts.            You would ask

12   whether -- you would not look to foreign law to

13   determine a question of respondeat superior or

14   contribution or indemnity.         You would not look to

15   foreign law to determine whether, in the words of the

16   Restatement, one person is liable for the tort of the

17   other.

18                You would look to the law of the place of

19   misconduct or the place of where the corporation is

20   headquartered.   We -- foreign law determines in this

21   case whether you had can have civil remedies rather than

22   criminal.   We concede that the ATS allows a civil remedy

23   where the world would impose only criminal liability.

24                That's because civil liability versus

25   criminal liability -- that's a matter of remedy.            So

 1   would be the amount of damages.           So would be the choice

 2   of compensatory or punitive damages.

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          If you look --

 4                 MS. SULLIVAN:      Those are matters of remedy

 5   for domestic law to decide.

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          If you look to the law of

 7   the place where the corporation is headquartered, well,

 8   suppose that has a typical respondeat superior liability

 9   that says corporations are liable for the acts of their

10   agents.   So -- and most -- correct me if I'm wrong, I

11   think most countries in the world have such a notion,

12   that corporate -- corporations are responsible for the

13   acts of their agents.      So, how does the -- looking to the

14   law where the corporation is headquartered, where does

15   that get you when that country has the very same law

16   that we do, that, yes, corporations are liable for the

17   acts of their agents?

18                 MS. SULLIVAN:      Justice Ginsburg,

19   respectfully, we don't think the world is all of one

20   when it comes to issues of corporate responsibility for

21   the acts of its agents.       If you look at the ICJ --

22   sorry.    If you look at the Rome statute, the Rome

23   statute itself has very particular sections about when

24   an -- a corporate superior is liable for the actions of

25   a corporate inferior.      It looks to a knowledge and


                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   deliberate indifference standard.

 2               Not every nation of the world agrees on what

 3   standard must -- there must be for even attributing the

 4   agent's act at the bottom of the corporate hierarchy to

 5   a senior officer, much less to the corporation as an

 6   entity.

 7               In answer to your question about -- earlier

 8   about respondeat superior, Justice Kagan, the only way a

 9   corporation can do anything is through the acts of human

10   beings; thus, there's always the question, when it comes

11   to corporate liability, to ask how to attribute the

12   action of the human beings who work for the corporation

13   to the corporation.      And we respectfully submit that

14   Sosa footnote 20 commits that question, as does the ATS

15   itself, to international law.

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well --

17               MS. SULLIVAN:         Yes?

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              -- I wonder if you don't

19   concede away too much when you say, well, there's a

20   difference in substance and -- and remedy and questions

21   of jury trial, damages, and so forth.               That's domestic.

22               Those were the concerns that the U.K. and

23   the Netherlands addressed in their brief as saying why

24   corporations shouldn't be liable for acts committed on

25   foreign -- foreign territories.             Those -- that was the

 1   whole reasoning of -- of the U.K. brief.

 2                 MS. SULLIVAN:      Justice Kennedy, I agree

 3   completely, and let me be very clear on one thing.             I've

 4   addressed only step one of Sosa, which is, does

 5   international law provide for a specific universal and

 6   obligatory norm of corporate liability?             It does not.

 7   In fact, it refutes it.       The Rome statute rejected

 8   liability for corporations.         The jurisdictional statutes

 9   of the ICTY and the ICTR apply jurisdiction only to

10   natural persons.   The international community at step

11   one has rejected it.

12                 But, Justice Kennedy, it's very important

13   that Sosa puts a second screen into your inquiry.             You

14   must ask, at the second step, even if international law

15   had provided any source of corporate liability, which it

16   does not, you would still have to ask -- footnote 30 of

17   Sosa says it's a higher bar -- should Federal common

18   law, should Federal common law now embrace these kinds

19   of actions?   And the answer is "no."

20                 Even if you found this were a question of

21   domestic remedy, we think you cannot.             This is a

22   question of substance.      But even if this were a question

23   of -- domestic remedy, you should not find liability for

24   corporations for the same reasons you rejected corporate

25   liability in Malesko.

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Ms. Sullivan, and I'm -- in

 2   Sosa, as I understand it, it's all about what is the

 3   conduct that falls under this law of nations.                    It is not

 4   about who is the actor subject to that law.                 Sosa is

 5   dealing with what kinds of conduct come within the Alien

 6   Tort Statute.   It -- it doesn't consider the question of

 7   what actor; that wasn't before the Court.                 What was

 8   before the Court is what kind of activity violates, is

 9   contrary to, the law of nations.

10                MS. SULLIVAN:         Justice Ginsburg,

11   respectfully we disagree and so do all the courts of

12   appeals who have addressed the question of aiding and

13   abetting liability.       Every court of appeals, save one,

14   including the Ninth Circuit and the D.C. Circuit, which

15   disagreed with us on the outcome, said that the question

16   of whether international law permits liability for

17   aiding and abetting is to be determined by international

18   law.   The second --

19                JUSTICE BREYER:          You could -- you could --

20   first, maybe you addressed this case.                 There was a case

21   called Skinner v. East India Company.

22                MS. SULLIVAN:         Yes, Your Honor.          That was

23   under English tort law, 1666.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:          Okay.         All right.    So, it's

25   -- now, what -- what I'm thinking of is if you go


                            Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

 1   through the rationale is you find some instances where

 2   individuals could, in fact, violate an international law

 3   norm, and then you find a lack of a reason why a

 4   corporation couldn't do the same.             Now, in that kind of

 5   category, could the Court say we're interpreting Federal

 6   common law here to determine who can be sued under this

 7   statute?   That's the remedial part.

 8                  MS. SULLIVAN:      You may --

 9                  JUSTICE BREYER:       And we're -- and so, what

10   we're saying is that there is a -- in certain

11   circumstances, there could be a suit against your

12   corporation.    You'd have to be careful because you

13   recognize that by creating a -- a suit against your

14   corporation, you're saying every country in the world

15   can do the same.    And -- and, therefore -- but maybe

16   there are instances of like, universal jurisdiction

17   recognized under international law where you could be

18   pretty certain no harm would be done by that.

19                  And so, what I'm thinking of is -- is a way

20   of enforcing it.

21                  MS. SULLIVAN:      Justice Breyer, first we

22   disagree that the question of who may be sued is a

23   question of enforcement.        We think that bridge --

24                  JUSTICE BREYER:       No, I see.     Yes.

25                  MS. SULLIVAN:      -- was crossed in Sosa.      And

 1   as I was saying to Justice Ginsburg, in all the cases

 2   that hold, all the courts of appeals agree that who may

 3   be liable, just primary actors or also aiders and

 4   abetters, is determined by international law is a

 5   question of substance.      So, we disagree with the

 6   premise.    But to answer Your Honor's question, the

 7   Federal common law still should not fly in the face of

 8   Congress, and I think the important question in your

 9   hypothetical is who is the "you"?

10                 As Justice Scalia just pointed out, Congress

11   could amend the ATS tomorrow to provide for a Federal

12   common -- a Federal statutory cause of action against

13   corporations.    But the one time Congress spoke to the

14   very question at issue here, it held the diametric

15   opposite.    Congress in the TVPA rejected corporate

16   liability by choosing the term "individuals" rather than

17   "persons."

18                 And I realize, Mr. Chief Justice, that's the

19   next case, but we think there's -- really the answer

20   that the TVPA excludes corporations is compelled, and

21   the U.S. agrees.

22                 So, Your Honor, the question is not what

23   should Federal courts do in the abstract; it's what

24   should Federal courts do when there is exact statutory

25   decisionmaking by the political branches that has gone


                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the other way.   In maritime law, in Miles v. Apex, you

 2   didn't -- you didn't decide to go contrary to the

 3   Congress in the Jones Act; you said if there's a Jones

 4   Act statutory statement about wrongful death, we should

 5   follow it in Federal common law.

 6                Similarly here, even if the international

 7   community thought there was anything to corporate

 8   liability -- which it doesn't.          It disagrees.   Our two

 9   allies the U.K. and Netherlands disagree, and Germany

10   has filed a brief saying it also disagrees with the ATS

11   as it has been applied.      Even if there was international

12   consensus, you would still have to ask, should the

13   Federal courts, through free-form Federal common law

14   making, do the opposite of what Congress is saying?

15                JUSTICE BREYER:       Well, we know the way to do

16   it.   I mean, in Skinner, even if it was English common

17   law, the court reasons -- it says the taking of the ship

18   on the high seas was "odious and punishable by all laws

19   of God and man."   So, we -- could you not say, where an

20   action is forbidden by the international law, and it is

21   punishable or -- by all laws of God and man, in such a

22   circumstance there being no reason to deny corporate

23   liability here, even under the moral person rule, it --

24   we interpret the Federal common law to permit that

25   remedy?

 1                MS. SULLIVAN:        Well, Your Honor, the ATS has

 2   language that says the tort must be committed in

 3   violation of the law of nations.             And so, although,

 4   Justice Ginsburg, it doesn't specify who may be the

 5   defendants, it does point us to the law of nations to

 6   figure out what the law of nations thinks about who may

 7   be the defendants.     And the law of nations is uniform.

 8   It rejects corporate liability.            It rejects corporate

 9   liability.

10                So, to find a Federal common law cause of

11   action here is to fly in the face of both the

12   international community, with all the foreign policy

13   consequences Justice Kennedy referred to earlier, if as

14   Mr. -- as the Chief Justice said earlier, the point of

15   the ATS was to stop war, by making sure there was a

16   forum for the Marbois incident so that France wouldn't

17   think it had to go to war on us to stop the offense to

18   its sovereignty.   But it will it provoke war to go out

19   ahead of the international community, foiling the

20   purpose of the ATS.

21          But also -- and this is --

22                JUSTICE KAGAN:         Ms. Sullivan, could I take

23   you back to --

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I assume the United

 2   interests of the United States, when the United States

 3   representative told us they think that individuals and

 4   corporations are both subject to suit.

 5               MS. SULLIVAN:      Well, Your Honor,

 6   respectfully, we -- we accept that the United States

 7   here before you today doesn't speak to the foreign --

 8   foreign policy consequences of this kind of ATS

 9   liability, and we haven't even gotten to the alternative

10   ground Justice Alito and the Chief Justice referred to

11   earlier, which is Charming Betsy canon says don't

12   lightly construe your law to offend international law.

13   But just back to the -- the United States, I

14   respectfully suggest you should look to the TVPA, rather

15   than simply to what the United States says here today.

16   And the TVPA, which is Congress interpreting --

17               JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, the TVPA is one

18   limited statute dealing with one particular category of

19   offense, and it was specifically meant to supplement,

20   not to supplant, the ATS.      So, between those two things,

21   the fact that it's limited to torture and that there was

22   no design to supplant the ATS, I guess I think that if

23   your best shot is the TVPA, that's a -- that's a weak

24   one.

25               MS. SULLIVAN:      Well, far -- it's -- it's one

 2                Just to go back to the key point about

 3   international community, the international community --

 4   Justice Breyer says don't just look for adjudicated

 5   opinions, but every convention for every international

 6   tribunal excludes corporations.

 7                Look to the U.N. process.           The Petitioners

 8   make a great deal out of a U.N. process that's taken

 9   place since 2007.   We cite the U.N. special

10   representative, saying I have looked at the

11   international human rights instruments that are out

12   there, and I find no basis --

13                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Ms.    Sullivan, if I asked

14   you --

15                MS. SULLIVAN:      -- for corporate liability.

16                JUSTICE KAGAN:       If I asked you --

17                MS. SULLIVAN:      That's the U.N., not

18   Congress.

19                JUSTICE KAGAN:       You said the international

20   community draws this line.        And as far as I can see, the

21   international sources are simply silent as to this

22   question.   So, if I said to you, Ms. Sullivan, I want to

23   go back and read the best thing you have saying that the

24   international law sources draw this line, what do I

25   read?

 1                  MS. SULLIVAN:      Read, first of all, the Rome

 2   statute, 1998, and the legislative history of it,

 3   reports --

 4                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, the Rome statute is

 5   different because the Rome statute is about criminal

 6   liability.   And we know that the Rome statute was meant

 7   to complement many -- many international states' laws

 8   which in fact do not hold corporations criminally liable

 9   domestically.

10                  MS. SULLIVAN:      Read -- but the Rome statute

11   also rejected civil liability.             That's in the Scheffer

12   brief.   The Scheffer amicus brief.                He was our

13   representative there, and he said civil liability was

14   considered but rejected.

15                  So, the Rome statute rejected either

16   corporate or criminal liability for corporations under

17   the new ICC.    The ICC -- the ICTY, the convention

18   against torture itself, and --

19                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          I thought they rejected

20   civil liability for everyone.             It wasn't limited to

21   corporations.

22                  MS. SULLIVAN:      Well, Justice Ginsburg, we

23   don't -- we agree that there's no civil liability for

24   human rights offenses.       The answer to Justice Alito's

25   question at the beginning -- is there any other nation

 1   in the world that provides for civil liability for human

 2   rights violations?    The answer is, no, there is no other

 3   nation in the world that provides an ATS.

 4                JUSTICE KAGAN:        Yes, but that's for

 5   individuals as well as for corporations.

 6                MS. SULLIVAN:       That's correct, but for --

 7                JUSTICE ALITO:        Could I ask you this --

 8                MS. SULLIVAN:       -- human rights violations.

 9                JUSTICE ALITO:        Yes.     Is there an Article

10   III source of jurisdiction for a lawsuit like this?

11                MS. SULLIVAN:       None other than the ATS, Your

12   Honor.   If -- there --

13                JUSTICE ALITO:        Well, what's the

14   constitutional basis for a lawsuit like this, where an

15   alien is suing an alien?

16                MS. SULLIVAN:       The -- well, there's no alien

17   diversity jurisdiction.       So -- because an alien is suing

18   an alien.   And there's a good argument you could dispose

19   of this case, but not all the other ATS cases, by simply

20   holding there's no alien diversity jurisdiction here,

21   and the ATS can't have been viewed as displacing

22   Congress's intent to limit jurisdiction at the time.

23   That would dispose of this case and other cases

24   involving foreign corporations sued by foreign

25   plaintiffs, cases likes Talisman and Nestle and Rio

 2               But we respectfully urge you to reach a

 3   broader ruling, which is that corporate liability is

 4   foreclosed both by the uniform practice, the uniform

 5   practice, not just adjudications, of the nations of the

 6   world --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:       You're -- now you're

 8   beginning one additional thing, that the corporate rule

 9   that you're about to cite shows that many people believe

10   there shouldn't be a remedy against a corporation

11   because they're not moral persons.              Why does it show

12   that the corporation couldn't violate the substantive

13   rule?

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Please.

15               MS. SULLIVAN:      Your Honor, we do not urge a

16   rule of corporate impunity here.          Corporate officers are

17   liable for human rights violations and for those they

18   direct among their employees.          There can also be suits

19   under State law or the domestic laws of nations, but

20   there may not be ATS Federal common law causes of action

21   against corporations.

22               Thank you, Your Honor.

 1               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL HOFFMAN

 2                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 3               MR. HOFFMAN:        Let me just make a few

 4   quick --

 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             For all the reasons

 6   Justice Kagan mentioned, that the TVPA is not a limiting

 7   source and can be viewed as a supplemental source, but

 8   there does appear to be a little bit of incongruity,

 9   that aliens can sue corporations for acts against other

10   aliens, but American citizens under the TVPA might not

11   be able to sue corporations.

12               How do we deal with that incongruity?

13               MR. HOFFMAN:        Well, there are a number of --

14   of differences between the TVPA and -- and the Alien

15   Tort Statute apart from that.             I mean, for example, the

16   Alien Tort Statute applies to a much broader range of

17   international human rights violations.             Congress decided

18   to legislate in those areas for the reasons that it

19   decided to do that.

20               The one thing that's clear, as Justice Kagan

21   said, is that the Torture Victim Protection Act was

22   designed to establish or to make even stronger the

23   Filartiga precedent and shield it from analyses that

24   challenged its bases, and was -- was not intended to

25   restrict the Alien Tort Statute in any way.

 1                 And obviously, the next case will discuss in

 2   greater detail whether the TVPA applies to corporations

 3   or not.    If -- I don't know.

 4                 If I could just make a couple of additional

 5   points.

 6                 If -- if it was true that international law

 7   barred corporate liability, then our friends the United

 8   Kingdom and the Netherlands have violated international

 9   law by passing legislation that imposes criminal

10   liability on corporations for violating genocide, crimes

11   against humanity, and war crimes.

12                 And I think that brief makes it pretty clear

13   that whatever they're saying, if -- if the Alien Tort

14   Statute is a domestic enforcement of international law,

15   then their views don't apply.

16                 And -- and this is a tort statute.            That's

17   what -- there was a meaning to torts.             Skinner's case,

18   for example, was a tort not only under English common

19   law; it was -- it was a tort in violation of the law of

20   nations.    It was robbery on the sea.            The law of nations

21   was incorporated in English common law, just as it was

22   in the founding in our country and, under the Paquete

23   Habana, is still part of our land -- the law of our

24   land.

25                 "Tort" meant to the founders "tort


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

 1   remedies."   It meant -- it meant that the means of

 2   enforcement would be done by the common law.               That's all

 3   that was available then.       It's all that's available now.

 4                And -- and international law places no

 5   restriction on the way domestic jurisdictions enforce

 6   international law.    There is a general principle law of

 7   corporate civil liability for all of the things that we

 8   allege in this case.

 9                In every legal system in the world, one can

10   get redress for this kind of thing.               Countries don't

11   necessarily call it a violation of the law of nations.

12   They didn't fashion the statute the way our Founders did

13   for the reasons that they did --

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               I'm sorry.   In every

15   nation in the world, you can get redress for this sort

16   of thing, but I thought you told us earlier that there

17   was no place where this suit could be brought --

18                MR. HOFFMAN:      No, no.       If --

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               In other words, a

20   suit by an alien against another alien for conduct that

21   takes place overseas.

22                MR. HOFFMAN:      Well, what I'm suggesting -- I

23   don't know whether in every domestic jurisdiction, the

24   extraterritoriality issue is taken in the same way.

25                What I'm suggesting is that, for these kinds

 1   of acts, you can get redress against a corporation

 2   within every legal system.          Now, not every legal

 3   system -- I don't know every legal system with respect

 4   to the extraterritoriality issue.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, that just gets

 6   back to your basic submission, which is you define the

 7   international norm based on the act rather than the

 8   entire issue that's going to be litigated, which

 9   includes both remedy and actor.

10               MR. HOFFMAN:        Well, what -- what -- what we

11   would suggest is that international law does not

12   distinguish with respect to actor, at least in -- with

13   respect to these four norms, if we're going by a

14   norm-by-norm basis.      These -- these norms are defined in

15   ways that human beings and corporations can violate.

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:          What's your position --

19   aiding and abetting?      Is that -- is that a matter of our

20   domestic law or would we track international law on

21   that?

22               MR. HOFFMAN:        The lower courts have treated

23   it in different ways.       I think that most of the courts

24   now have found that aiding and abetting is --

 2   aiding and abetting?

 3                MR. HOFFMAN:     I think that -- I think that

 4   aiding and abetting could be viewed as a conduct

 5   regulating norm, that it actually applies to the things

 6   that can be done to violate the norm.              And, therefore,

 7   international law would apply to that.

 8                I think my -- my time is up.
