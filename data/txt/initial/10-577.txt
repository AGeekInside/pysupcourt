 4   next in Case 10-577, Kawashima v. Holder.

 5               Mr. Whalen.

 6               ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. WHALEN

 7                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 8               MR. WHALEN:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10               Mr. and Mrs. Kawashima came here to the

11   United States as legal immigrants in 1985.               And later

12   on, they pled guilty to filing a false statement under a

13   corporate tax return.      The issue we bring to the Court

14   is whether that conviction under 26 U.S.C. 7206 is an

15   aggravated felony, specifically under (M)(i) of the

16   aggravated felony statute.

17               This Court many times has held that it is

18   the elements of the crime of conviction that determine

19   whether a crime is an aggravated felony.               And the

20   elements of 7206 do not change when they go over to the

21   immigration statute.     And the terms of that statute is

22   basically as the Department of Justice has written in

23   its Tax Manual.   It is basically a tax perjury statute.

24   If you don't tell the truth, and you know what you're

25   saying is false, and you do it under oath, that's


                                      3

 1   perjury.

 2               There are other statutes, perjury statute,

 3   which in essence says the same thing.              And 18 U.S.C.

 4   1001 is also a perjury statute.              And none of them

 5   require the Justice Department or a court to determine

 6   whether fraud and deceit was an element of that crime.

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:            How would you prove fraud

 8   and deceit beyond proving that the person lied,

 9   intentionally lied?      What -- what is added to

10   intentionally lying to convert that into fraud or

11   deceit?

12               MR. WHALEN:        It's the intention to deceive

13   or the intention to defraud.              And simply --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Isn't intentionally

15   lying -- doesn't that mean that you intend to deceive?

16               MR. WHALEN:        It does not, Your Honor.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:            It doesn't?

18               MR. WHALEN:        It does not mean, because you

19   are saying a false -- making a false statement, that

20   that is evidence of an intent to deceive.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Whalen, the common

22   definition of deceit is acting -- intentionally giving a

23   false impression, intentionally giving a false

24   impression with the intent that someone will act on it.

25   So, it seems that's exactly what filing a false return


                                       4

 1   is.   You give a false impression of what your income is

 2   with the intent that the IRS will accept it.

 3                MR. WHALEN:      Justice Ginsburg, the

 4   difference I'm trying to ask the Court to consider, it

 5   is the intent which is an element of fraud and deceit.

 6   Under section 7201, the tax evasion statute, that

 7   includes both a requirement or a finding of fraud and

 8   deceit.   Section 7206 does not.

 9                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But why isn't it obvious?

10   What proof would you need?         You submit a document

11   because you want to convey a false impression for

12   someone to act on.    Why do you have to have anything

13   more than that to establish deceit?

14                MR. WHALEN:      Because the requirements, Your

15   Honor, of 7206 is a finding of -- of simply making a

16   false statement.   That's all that's required.           The IRS,

17   when they go after a taxpayer because they have not

18   provided -- they have not disclosed all of their income,

19   the IRS comes in, or rather the Department of Justice,

20   and all they have to prove is that it's false.            They

21   don't have to prove --

22                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And that it's willful.

23   And that it's willful.

24                MR. WHALEN:      Pardon me, Your Honor.

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            That it's willful.

 1   Whoever willfully makes a false statement.


 2                  MR. WHALEN:     Yes, Your Honor, but as this


 3   Court held --

 4                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So, it's not correct.


 5                  MR. WHALEN:     No, Your Honor.

 6                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, correct me if I'm

 7   wrong.   It would seem to me, just from reading the

 8   statute unless we have some gloss on, that if you think

 9   it's true but it's false, from the way you were

10   indicating, would be a violation.              That's not the way I

11   read it.   Now, have we said something other than that in

12   later cases?

13                  MR. WHALEN:     If I may, Your Honor.        This

14   Court has written in the Spies case, and specifically in

15   the Bishop case, that in order to be convicted of any

16   tax offense under the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS or

17   the Department of Justice must show it was done

18   willfully.    Willfully is not intrinsic to any -- it's

19   really intrinsic to all of the tax offenses.

20   "Willfully"    does not mean deceit or fraud.            It simply

21   means that the IRS cannot bring a criminal information

22   or indictment against somebody who does something

23   unintentionally.    They must do it willfully.

24   "Willfully," as this Court defined in Bishop, is simply

25   evidence that -- to commit any of these IRS crimes you


                                       6

 1   must -- it must be shown to have been done willfully.

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         You must know that it's

 3   false when you say it.      Isn't that what "willfully"

 4   means?    You must know that the statement you're making

 5   is false.

 6                 MR. WHALEN:     "Willfully" means

 7   intentionally.    The false, I submit --

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         I don't want another

 9   adverb.

10                 MR. WHALEN:     No.        All right.

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         I want you to describe what

12   it means in the context of a statement.               Doesn't it mean

13   that you have to know that the statement you are making

14   is false?    Isn't that enough for willfulness?

15                 MR. WHALEN:     That's what -- that -- yes.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Okay.       Now, you tell me

17   what deceit involves beyond that.

18                 MR. WHALEN:     Deceit involves an intention to

19   induce somebody to act.       And what I'm arguing to this

20   Court is that simply making a false statement under a

21   tax perjury statute such as we have in this case does

22   not meaning and does not evidence an intention to

23   deceive or a finding.

24                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           I'm sorry.     I'm a little

25   bit lost here.

 1               Your definition of "deceit" is a false


 2   statement with an intent for the other party to rely.


 3   And you don't see that when you file your tax returns


 4   that the government is relying on your statement to


 5   calculate your tax and to ensure that you've paid it?

 6   You don't see any reliance by the government on the

 7   truthful statements there and its collection of taxes?

 8               MR. WHALEN:     I -- I do see reliance as

 9   generally is what happens.       What I'm saying is that 7206

10   is a perjury statute and the government does not have to

11   prove, and did not have to prove in this case, anything

12   more than the -- the income was unreported or the tax --

13   the tax return was -- was false.          If --

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So, it also had to prove

15   that the government relied?         Is that what you're saying

16   the --

17               MR. WHALEN:     I'm saying that the

18   government was -- if the government wanted to prove

19   fraud or deceit, they -- that would be an element of the

20   crime of tax evasion --

21               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         I'm not even sure why,

22   because under tax evasion you can be charged with tax

23   evasion merely for avoiding the payment of tax.           You

24   don't have to make a statement at all.            You can take the

25   money from the bank, withdraw it openly, and stick it in

 1   your mattress, refuse to pay, and if somehow they find

 2   your mattress, you can be charged with tax evasion.

 3                MR. WHALEN:       And the --

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Where's the false and

 5   deceit in that?

 6                MR. WHALEN:       The government would have to

 7   prove fraud or deceit, because an intent to evade is --

 8   the Court -- the -- the government has to prove --

 9                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           If there's a -- if there

10   are cases that say otherwise, what does that do to your

11   argument?   Of which there are many that say that the

12   avoidance of taxes, tax payment, doesn't require an act

13   of fraud or deceit?

14                MR. WHALEN:       I would be surprised by

15   those --

16                JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, suppose somebody

17   goes -- he goes to a country where we have no

18   extradition treaty, takes all his assets and writes a

19   postcard to the IRS every -- once a month saying

20   ha-ha-ha.

21                (Laughter.)

22                JUSTICE BREYER:           I mean, why wouldn't that

23   be an attempt to evade?        That's why he went; he didn't

24   like to pay his taxes.

25                MR. WHALEN:       Then the government would bring


                                       9

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   an action under the --

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Well, 7201.   Why can't

 3   you -- well, why doesn't that violate 7201?            I mean, my

 4   simple question really is you are a drafter, imagine you

 5   are a drafter, and you are charged with drafting section

 6   (43).   And you read -- you try to get the fraud and

 7   deceit crimes, okay?      So now we read 76 -- 7206(1) and

 8   (2).    And you see for both of those, you can't be

 9   convicted unless you materially and willfully make a

10   false statement.

11                 So, you think, hey, I don't need a special

12   section on that one.      But then you go to 7201, and you

13   say, oh, my God, I just thought, somebody might violate

14   this by going off to some special country, taking all

15   his assets and writing ha-ha-ha.             Now, there's no fraud

16   and deceit in that.      He's totally open about it.        But he

17   sure has evaded it.      So, therefore, I better write a

18   special section.

19                 Now, that's the simple-minded argument, but

20   what's wrong with it?

21                 MR. WHALEN:      What's wrong with it, Your

22   Honor, is that what we're talking about is the

23   aggravated felony statute.          And the issue -- and it may

24   be a narrow one for this Court -- is whether the

25   conviction under 7206, which does not require anything


                                      10

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   more than filing of a false statement without any intent

 2   to deceive or defraud -- whether that is an aggravated

 3   felony.   And this Court has said time and again that it

 4   is the elements of the offense that determines

 5   aggravated felony.

 6                If I may illustrate the point, if -- if a

 7   conviction under 7206 was viewed by this Court as

 8   including fraud and deceit for the reasons many of the

 9   Justices have indicated, that, you know, that when

10   somebody writes a false tax return, it's got to be

11   deceit, what that does is that would collaterally estop

12   a taxpayer from denying fraud and deceit in the civil

13   collection action.

14                So, this is what Commissioner Walters was

15   concerned about, why he has filed his brief, that it in

16   effect would undermine the ability of the government to

17   get an easy conviction based simply on a false

18   statement.

19                Similarly, if you are convicted of tax

20   evasion, the -- the tax evader cannot challenge fraud.

21   He is collaterally estopped.             And as we know, when the

22   government goes to seek recovery -- that is, getting the

23   taxes back in a civil proceeding -- there's no statute

24   of limitations.

25                The intention of Congress is also reflected


                                     11

 1   in the Internal Revenue Code section 6501, where if a

 2   person is convicted under 7206 and the government seeks

 3   to collect the unpaid taxes in an assessment proceeding,

 4   Congress particularly said that where there's a

 5   conviction under 7206, the government has the burden of

 6   proving fraud, which seems to me to be evidence -- or

 7   rather, the government has the -- a duty to prove there

 8   was an attempt to evade the tax.             But the conclusion is

 9   the same.

10                  If Congress had intended that proof of fraud

11   and deceit would be in 7206, there would be no reason at

12   all for Congress to put that in 70 -- 6501.

13   Therefore --

14                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I'm sorry.   That's

15   26 U.S.C. 6501?

16                  MR. WHALEN:     Yes.       To be more precise,

17   6501(c)(1).

19                  MR. WHALEN:     That is the exceptions to the

20   running of the statute of limitations.

21                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Do we have that in the

22   briefs?

23                  MR. WHALEN:     I have it in my reply brief.              I

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Do you have the text of it?

 2                 MR. WHALEN:     I --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         I don't like counsel

 4   getting up here and talking about statutes that they've

 5   never put before us.     If you're going to rely on it, we

 6   -- we would like to have the text somewhere.

 7                 MR. WHALEN:     Yes.       I apologize for that,

 8   Your Honor.

 9                 I would like to move to the second part of

10   my argument, if Your Honor please, that the -- this

11   Court has been very clear on deciding statutes invoking

12   canons of construction.       And one of the important canons

13   is that different words have different meanings.

14                 So, in (M)(i), we have loss to victim or

15   victims in excess of $10,000, and in (M)(ii), we have a

16   revenue loss to the government in excess of 10,000.              And

17   as this Court said in Nijhawan, referring to (M)(ii),

18   this is the Internal Revenue provision, a correct

19   assessment I suggest, and that (M)(i) deals with

20   injuries or damage to third parties, not to the

21   government.

22                 If you take the government's position that

23   fraud and deceit crimes are in -- fraud and deceit

24   revenue crimes are in (M)(i), then (M)(ii) would be

25   worthless or pointless.

 1                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, why?   Because it

 2   wouldn't be pointless if in fact an attempt to evade or

 3   defeat tax does not require a lie, does not require a

 4   willful lie.    It would be adding to the -- to the fraud

 5   and deceit offenses, 7201, which does not require a lie.

 6   It just requires, you know, going to Cuba and writing

 7   postcards saying, I know I owe money; I'm just not -- I

 8   just ain't gonna pay it.        There's no fraud and deceit

 9   there.   It's just what 7201 requires, an attempt to

10   evade or defeat tax.

11                  MR. WHALEN:     Well, anyone who leaves the

12   country with an intent to avoid tax is committing tax

13   evasion.

14                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         That's right.   That's my

15   very point.

16                  MR. WHALEN:     And that is --

17                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         Without lying -- without

18   lying -- without making a single lie.

19                  MR. WHALEN:     What I'm saying is that fraud,

20   such as you suggest, Your Honor, is going to be an

21   aggravated felony.     It's the only one that Congress

22   says -- only revenue offense, only offense under the

23   Internal Revenue Code which Congress designated as an

24   aggravated felony.

25                  What I'm saying is that if tax evasion were


                                      14

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   also included in (M)(i), then Congress would have

 2   created a useless, pointless provision.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes.   And my point is that

 4   it would not have been included within (M)(i).            There is

 5   no way that it could be included with (M)(i), because it

 6   does not involve fraud or deceit.             It does not involve a

 7   lie, as 7206 does.

 8                MR. WHALEN:       7201 involves, I'm suggesting

 9   that --

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:           An attempt to evade or

11   defeat -- "who willfully attempts in any manner to evade

12   or defeat any tax."      And one can do that without lying.

13   One can do that by simply not report income, for

14   example.   Or in -- in Justice Breyer's more colorful

15   example, by going to Cuba.          Was it Cuba or somewhere

16   else?

17                (Laughter.)

18                MR. WHALEN:       Well, the point I am trying to

19   make, Your Honor, is that if your example is an example

20   of fraud and deceit, which I agree it is, then a crime

21   of fraud and deceit would not be in (M)(i) because it

22   would be -- it would already be captured in (M)(i) if

23   the government's position was upheld.

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But the point that was

25   being made is not that it's fraud and deceit.            Quite the

 1   opposite.   I think Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor,

 2   Justice Scalia have tried to get you to focus on the

 3   evasion that involves no false statement at all, evading

 4   payment where you say nothing.           What would be the crime

 5   if you simply don't pay your taxes, and you don't file a

 6   return, so you are not filing anything that's false?

 7   Where would that come in the Internal Revenue --

 8                 MR. WHALEN:     That would be a violation of

 9   one of the other Internal Revenue crimes.

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Would it be evasion

11   simply not to report your income?

12                 MR. WHALEN:     If the government chose to

13   prove that it was an attempt to evade the tax, it would.

14   The Internal Revenue's statute and crimes all carry the

15   duty to -- it's a legal duty we all have of fairly

16   reporting our income, our deductions, what have you.

17   It's the same legal duty whether it's in 7201 or 7206.

18                 The difference is, in tax evasion, there

19   must be a proof of fraud or deceit.               That's inherent.

20   From the beginning of this country -- rather, beginning

21   of the tax statutes, Congress has always separated

22   revenue statutes from other crimes.               In this case,

23   (M)(i) deals with crimes involving third parties;

24   (M)(ii) deals with revenue loss crimes to the

25   government.   Only (i) is an aggravated felony.

 1               I would like to reserve the remainder of my

 2   time for rebuttal.

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

 5               ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON

 6                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 7               MR. GANNON:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 8   please the Court:

 9               Congress's specific reference to tax evasion

10   in subparagraph (M)(ii) of the INA's definition of

11   aggravated felony did not remove all other tax offenses

12   from the scope of subparagraph (M)(i).

13               JUSTICE KAGAN:         Mr. Gannon, do you think

14   that you can commit tax evasion without committing

15   either fraud or deceit, and are there cases that show

16   that?

17               MR. GANNON:       The cases that we cited in our

18   brief on page 34 that discuss this are ones that are

19   evasion of payment cases as opposed to evasion of

20   assessment cases.    And those -- those are instances in

21   which somebody could accurately file a tax return and

22   say I owe you this amount of money and then take steps

23   to prevent the IRS from collecting on it, usually by

24   removing their assets from the IRS's reach.

25               As a factual matter, it so happens that most


                                     17

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   of those cases will often involve some concealment along

 2   the way.    If somebody's taking more than $10,000 in gold

 3   coins out of the country to take them to a Swiss bank,

 4   they often don't mention that when they're leaving the

 5   country.

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         What about just not filing

 7   a return?

 8                 MR. GANNON:     Just not filing a return is

 9   probably not going to be enough to establish tax

10   evasion.    That would be an offense under 7203, which

11   doesn't necessarily involve fraud or deceit.            The thing

12   that distinguishes 7201 is the need for the government

13   to establish that there is an attempt to evade either

14   the assessment or payment of taxation.

15                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       I mean, I suppose what

16   confuses me is that when somebody is convicted of 7201,

17   they can't -- they're estopped from contesting a civil

18   fraud suit; isn't that right?            And it also counts as a

19   crime of moral turpitude, which involves fraud.            And all

20   of those things suggest, and I think kind of the cases

21   as a whole suggest, that tax evasion involves fraud.

22                 MR. GANNON:     Well, certainly in the context

23   of the civil tax fraud penalty, the Tax Court has

24   concluded that intent to evade is synonymous with an

25   understatement due to fraud.             And the reason why it has


                                     18

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   refused to reach that conclusion in the context of 7206

 2   offenses, like the ones at issue in this case, is

 3   because the 7206 offense does not require the government

 4   to have proved that there was any understatement to

 5   begin with.   And so, there could not have been an

 6   understatement due to fraud.

 7                 I'd also note that it's not at all clear

 8   that in the context of the evasion of payment cases that

 9   I was just discussing in the context of tax evasion,

10   that the same civil tax fraud penalty would be

11   applicable there, because the civil tax fraud penalty is

12   triggered by an understatement of an amount required to

13   be shown on the return.       And, therefore, if it isn't --

14   if it isn't actually something that's done in the

15   context of filing a tax return that understates how much

16   you owe the government, then -- then that may well not

17   trigger the collateral estoppel effect in the follow-on

18   civil case.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Counsel, what did

20   you --

21                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Excuse me.       Are there

22   any tax provisions that you think are not covered by the

23   fraud and deceit section and the tax evasion section?

24                 MR. GANNON:     You mean --

25                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Any tax crime.

 1               MR. GANNON:        Any tax crime --

 2               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Felonies, I should say.

 3               MR. GANNON:        There are several tax offenses

 4   that don't necessarily involve fraud or deceit.               So,

 5   parts of 7202, which is the willful failure to collect

 6   tax, would not necessarily involve fraud and deceit, but

 7   it also covers failing to truthfully account for

 8   collected tax.   So, some of those offenses would involve

 9   fraud or deceit, and it may be divisible.               7203, which I

10   just mentioned --

11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Does that fall under tax

12   evasion, or that's a separate statute?

13               MR. GANNON:        That's not tax evasion.         The

14   only thing that counts as tax evasion is 7201.

15               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            I cut you off.     Which

16   are the other ones?

17               MR. GANNON:        I was saying that I already

18   mentioned to Justice Scalia that section 7203 -- all of

19   these offenses I'm talking about are in 26 U.S.C.; 7203,

20   the willful failure to file a return or to pay tax or

21   maintain records or supply information doesn't

22   necessarily involve fraud or deceit.               Parts of 7204,

23   which is failing to furnish a statement to the employee

24   reflecting the amount of taxes, but not -- but then,

25   again, I think it could be divisible because it would


                                      20

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   also apply to furnishing a false statement to your

 2   employee.   Even the misdemeanor offense under 7207 for

 3   presenting false documents might be covered for fraud or

 4   deceit, but in practice it's only used when there's --

 5   it's only used when the tax deficiencies are de minimis.

 6   And so, it would never trigger the $10,000 loss

 7   requirement that (M)(i) would also require us to

 8   establish in order to make it an aggravated felony.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Counsel, what --

10   what is your answer to your friend's 6501(c)(i)

11   argument?

12                MR. GANNON:     Well, my answer is that I don't

13   think it proves really any more than the collateral

14   estoppel cases in the civil fraud context.              The

15   provision that we're talking about is not reprinted in

16   any of the briefs, but 6501(c)(1) is an exception that

17   -- that lifts the limitation on when the IRS can levy an

18   assessment or seek collection; and it refers to the case

19   of a false or fraudulent return with the intent to evade

20   tax.   And I think that in context, the reference to a

21   false or fraudulent return with intent to evade tax is

22   not something that clearly connotes that Congress is

23   just speaking to 7206 offenses.          It uses not only the

24   word "fraudulent," but also "the intent to evade tax,"

25   which I think --


                                    21

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, no, but I

 2   think your friend's argument, which has some appeal, is

 3   7206 is fraud and false statements.             And he said if

 4   you're right that that includes deceit, they wouldn't

 5   have had to add "with the intent to evade tax," which is

 6   what they do in 6501(c)(1).

 7               MR. GANNON:     Well, I -- I think if you look

 8   to (c)(2), it also refers to a willful attempt in any

 9   manner to defeat or evade tax.         So, the next provision

10   also applies more broadly to 7201 and more closely

11   tracks the definition in 7201.         So, I think just like

12   the statute of limitations provision that we note,

13   Congress is probably using a belt and suspenders

14   approach there, that -- we noted that Congress may well

15   have had reason to be concerned that 7201 offenses would

16   not necessarily be seen as having fraud or deceit as an

17   element of the offense in light of this Court's decision

18   in Scharton, which was an old case, but it had said that

19   in the -- in the statute of limitations context, that

20   the -- the extended statute of limitations that apply to

21   offenses in which fraud was an element was not triggered

22   by the statutory predecessor to tax evasion.             And so, to

23   the --

24               JUSTICE KAGAN:       But Scharton was a very old

25   case which had been distinguished away by many courts.

 1   It really has no power in the -- in the -- I mean, tell

 2   me if I'm wrong, but --

 3               MR. GANNON:      Well, to this day section 6531,

 4   which is the statute of limitations provision which we

 5   do reprint in our appendix, includes provisions that

 6   refer not only generally to offenses involving fraud but

 7   also specifically to a tax evasion offense.       And so, I

 8   think that the fact that Congress had already felt like

 9   it needed to be expressed, to pull in not just fraud

10   offenses but also tax evasion offenses in 6531, makes it

11   unsurprising that they would have pursued a similar

12   approach here.   In addition, I would --

13               JUSTICE KAGAN:        I mean, the paradoxical

14   thing about your argument is that, one, it makes us

15   think that Congress was just being hypervigilant about

16   this problem of making sure that tax evasion offenses

17   were covered, even though tax evasion offenses almost

18   always do involve fraud or deceit, but Congress was

19   thinking about these hypothetical possibilities that

20   maybe there was going to be some conviction out there

21   that would not involve fraud or deceit, and so Congress

22   is being super-careful about this; and yet, at the same

23   time, that Congress is being utterly careless, utterly

24   clueless about the basic rule of statutory construction

25   which is that one does not write superfluous language.

 1               MR. GANNON:      But, Justice Kagan, we don't

 2   think it's superfluous, in part because of the evasion

 3   of payment cases we're talking about, but I think also

 4   if you look at the context of the rest of paragraph

 5   (43), the aggravated felony definition, you'll see that

 6   there are several other provisions that have significant

 7   overlap in them.   And so subparagraph (A) refers to

 8   murder and rape; those would also generally be covered

 9   in crimes of violence in subparagraph (F).       The same

10   thing is true in paragraph (E)(i); it pulls in various

11   explosives offenses including arson, destruction of

12   property or building by fire or explosives; that's the

13   reference to an 8441 --

14               JUSTICE KAGAN:        So, our rule of statutory

15   construction when it comes to this aggravated felony

16   statute is that superfluity doesn't matter?

17               MR. GANNON:      No, Justice Kagan, I think that

18   in context, there is a lot of overlap among the

19   different provisions in -- in paragraph (43) already,

20   and I -- I was also going to mention subparagraph (K)(i)

21   and (ii), which like (M)(i) and (M)(ii), are ones that

22   have little (i), which has a generic reference there to

23   offenses associated with managing a prostitution

24   business, and little (ii) then expressly refers to

 1   involve transporting individuals for purposes of


 2   prostitution in the case of seeking commercial


 3   advantage.


 4                 And I think that virtually all of those


 5   offenses would have been included within (K)(i), but

 6   Congress wanted to be sure and, therefore, added

 7   (K)(ii).   And as -- as Justice Breyer, I think, pointed

 8   out before, textually it -- it had reason to think that

 9   7206 would be picked up by fraud or deceit here in --

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But 7206 is the lesser

11   offense.   I mean, you don't take -- you don't dispute

12   that the heavier crime is the 7201 crime; that is,

13   evasion.   It gets a more severe penalty.              And when

14   Congress picks out one tax crime and one tax crime only,

15   why wouldn't we assume that that's what Congress meant

16   with respect to aggravated felonies?               That there's one

17   tax crime, the most serious tax crime, that fits that

18   label.   And the (M)(i) provision deals with the many,

19   many statutes that involve loss -- fraud or deceit and

20   loss to the victim?

21                 MR. GANNON:      The reason why we don't think

22   that's appropriate is in part because, as I've

23   explained, there would -- there is some aspect of which

24   (M)(ii) is not superfluous.            But, more importantly, we

25   don't think that the specific controls -- the general


                                      25

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   canon is triggered here, and we don't think that (M)(ii)

 2   talks about a category of tax crimes or tax offenses

 3   more generally, because it only refers to one offense.

 4                And so, the cases that Petitioners invoke

 5   here, in order to establish that there is a category

 6   that's being pulled out of (M)(i), are HCSC-Laundry and

 7   Leocal.   Those are both cases in which the statute

 8   actually identified the category of offenses in

 9   question, whether it was the cooperative hospital

10   service organizations in HCSC-Laundry or DUI offenses in

11   Leocal.

12                And so, here we don't have Congress actually

13   saying tax offenses are covered by (M)(ii).          What it

14   says is tax evasion is covered by (M)(ii).          And --

15                JUSTICE BREYER:         But what about -- what

16   about -- suppose that didn't even exist here, 7201.

17   Suppose we only had 7206, and the question before us

18   was, does 7206 fit within the term "aggravated felony";

19   i.e., does it involve fraud or deceit?

20                So, we read 7206; it doesn't say anything

21   about fraud or deceit.     It says perjury and making a

22   false statement.   So, then we go look up what were the

23   torts of fraud and deceit.        And he's right.    Fraud

24   traditionally requires an intent to get another person

25   to act, but you don't have to have that intent to


                                    26

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   violate 7206.    And deceit -- it not only involves that;

 2   it also involves the person having acted.

 3                So, the traditional tort of deceit, you have

 4   to intend the acts, and he actually has to have acted to

 5   his detriment.     Fraud, you have the first of those and

 6   second.   You read the statute and say, well, say neither

 7   of those is present here.         This is just perjury, which

 8   isn't good, but it's not fraud or deceit.           And there we

 9   are, not in the statute.        What's the answer to that?

10                MR.    GANNON:     Well, I don't think that the

11   common law definitions of fraud and deceit are the ones

12   that this Court has always applied in the context --

13                JUSTICE BREYER:           No, no, not always.   But

14   here we were dealing with a very serious statute,

15   aggravated felonies.      That has terrible consequences for

16   the persons who fall within it.

17                MR. GANNON:       And --

18                JUSTICE BREYER:           So -- and in most of these

19   M's and A's and B's and C's, and so forth, they refer to

20   statutes by number so most of it, though not all of it,

21   is very specific.     So, when we read these words "fraud"

22   and "deceit" here, why don't we say fraud and deceit

23   means fraud and deceit?

24                MR. GANNON:       Well, in the --

25                JUSTICE BREYER:           The traditional elements.

 1                  MR. GANNON:     In the criminal context, the

 2   Court has recognized that fraud offenses don't require

 3   the government to prove reliance or damages.             And that

 4   makes sense.    If you think about the tort action, the

 5   classic tort action, you would need to be an injured

 6   plaintiff; and, therefore, you would need to be able to

 7   say I relied on this to my detriment --

 8                  JUSTICE BREYER:         No, no, no.

 9                  MR. GANNON:     -- and I want to recover.

10                  JUSTICE BREYER:         You have to prove that the

11   -- the liar intended reliance to -- to his detriment.

12                  MR. GANNON:     And --

13                  JUSTICE BREYER:         Which he may or may not

14   have done.    I mean, when you commit -- a person who

15   commits perjury may or may not have intended that a

16   victim rely to his detriment.             Which you don't have to

17   prove here.

18                  MR. GANNON:     We do not have to prove as a

19   separate element that there's reliance or intended

20   reliance here, but we do need to prove what we think

21   satisfies the plain meaning of the term "deceit."             We're

22   not focusing on fraud here but deceit, and that's the

23   act of intentionally giving a false impression, because

24   the elements of this offense are making and signing a

25   return under the penalties of perjury that it is false


                                      28

 1   as to a material matter, that the defendant does not --

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:         Deceit can mean that.

 3   You're absolutely right.

 4                MR. GANNON:     -- does not believe to be true

 5   or correct, and it's all done willfully.

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:         No, the tort didn't involve

 7   that.   The tort involved the same element of fraud which

 8   you don't want to rely on.

 9                MR. GANNON:     That -- that's right, and we

10   think here Congress has used the -- the term --

11                JUSTICE BREYER:         Is there any -- is there

12   any evidence of what -- I mean is there any argument

13   other than that you just think that and you could argue

14   the other way?   I mean, can we get anywhere?

15                MR. GANNON:     Well, I think that Congress did

16   use the terms disjunctively here.            And I think that now

17   the plain meaning of "deceit" is -- it sort of operates

18   in the opposite direction of the one that you're talking

19   about, Justice Breyer.     And if you look at the way the

20   Court in Yermian discussed the difference between an

21   intent to defraud and intent to deceive, it talks about

22   an intent to defraud includes actually obtaining

23   something, whereas an intent to deceive just involves

24   creating a false impression.            And so, I think that

25   actually the difference can run the other direction in a


                                    29

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   way that supports the definition that we're relying upon

 2   here.

 3                  But going back to the point that I was

 4   trying to make about this not ruling out all tax

 5   offenses, Justice Ginsburg, I think that the reference

 6   to 7201 alone doesn't do that, nor do we think the fact

 7   that Congress then added a limited -- limiting language

 8   that said that when the revenue loss exceeds $10,000, it

 9   would satisfy (M)(ii).

10                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Could I make sure,

11   Mr. Gannon, that I understand your argument about

12   superfluity?    Because when I asked whether (M) -- the

13   second provision was superfluous, you pointed me to

14   these evasion-of-payment cases.            And you cite two of

15   them.    But then you say even those cases will almost

16   invariably involve some affirmative acts of fraud.            So,

17   are there, in fact, any cases, evasion of payment or

18   otherwise, which do not involve some affirmative acts of

19   fraud?

20                  MR. GANNON:     Well, I think that's as a

21   factual matter, Justice Kagan.            We were --

22                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       As a factual matter, are

23   there any?

24                  MR. GANNON:     We were observing that as a

25   factual matter, those evasion-of-payment cases probably


                                      30

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   would not happen without there being acts of

 2   concealment, but that doesn't --

 3               JUSTICE KAGAN:       And that's what I'm asking.

 4   As a factual matter, can you point me to any cases that

 5   do not involve affirmative acts of fraud?

 6               MR. GANNON:     I don't believe that I can, but

 7   I think that to the extent that the Court is looking to

 8   the elements of the offense in 7201, if they're talking

 9   about evasion of payment, that will not necessarily

10   require deceptive acts of concealment.          And so, that's

11   the reason --

12               JUSTICE KAGAN:       I know, but we have a very

13   active IRS, which prosecutes lots of tax cases, and

14   you're saying that it just never prosecutes tax cases

15   under this section that don't involve affirmative acts

16   of fraud.

17               MR. GANNON:     Well --

18               JUSTICE KAGAN:       And that makes me wonder why

19   Congress was so worried about this problem that it

20   ignored normal rules of statutory interpretation.

21               MR. GANNON:     Well -- and I believe that the

22   reason that they were worried could be because of the

23   Scharton decision, in which this Court had already said

24   that evasion does not necessarily require fraud, because

25   the textual cues in 7201 are much further from fraud and


                                   31

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   deceit than those in 7206; that there's also -- there


 2   would be less certainty.        Even assuming that Congress


 3   was well aware of the established practice at the


 4   Federal level of having 7201 tax evasion cases be


 5   compared with fraud, this is also a provision that

 6   applies to State and foreign offenses.             The penultimate

 7   sentence of paragraph (43) says that the term applies to

 8   an offense whether it's in violation of Federal or State

 9   law.

10                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But that was one of the

11   problems that was brought up in the amicus brief which

12   actually you considered, that reading the (M)(i) to

13   include 7206 offenses would also -- would bring in

14   offenses that are merely misdemeanors at the State and

15   local level.    It would really swell the category of tax

16   crimes that lead to deportation.             That -- did Congress

17   really mean to turn misdemeanors into aggravated felons?

18                  And then there was a very practical point

19   made, that the government is going to be hurt more than

20   helped by what you are seeking, because we are told that

21   very often the government will try to make a bargain.

22   It has a 7201 case, but it's going to be a little hard

23   to prove.   So, they offer as a plea bargain 7206.              And

24   if you -- if your position prevails, we are told, there

25   will be many, many people who will say:             If it's a

 1   question of whether I get thrown out of the United

 2   States, I'm going to go to trial; I'm not going to plead

 3   to something that will mean immediately when I serve my

 4   time I will be thrown out of the United States.

 5                 MR. GANNON:      Well, that may well be the

 6   consequence of the definition that Congress has adopted

 7   here of aggravated felony.          And I would note that in the

 8   plea agreement that Mr. Kawashima filed in this case,

 9   paragraph 4, which is reprinted on page 117a of the

10   petition appendix says Mr. Kawashima recognizes that he

11   may be deported as a result of his conviction.                 That's

12   in his plea agreement to the 7206 offense here.

13                 And so, it is, to be sure, the case that the

14   government may well find it more difficult to secure

15   guilty pleas when an alien is -- is admitting to an

16   offense that is an aggravated felony.                 But we think that

17   that's a consequence of Congress having expanded the

18   definition.   In --

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Let me go up to start with

20   Justice Ginsburg's first question.                 I mean, if this

21   falls within it, 7206, this fraud, what about perjury?

22   Is every perjury statute within it?                 And what about

23   lying to an FBI agent?       And what about lying to a

24   government official, which is -- which is -- you know,

25   there are all kinds of statutes on that one.

 1                MR. GANNON:      Well --

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:          Are all those aggravated


 3   felonies?


 4                MR. GANNON:      Congress has given us two


 5   different metrics for determining whether those --

 6   whether those offenses are aggravated felonies.             If they

 7   involve fraud or deceit and there is loss to the victim

 8   exceeding $10,000 --

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:          Yes, yes.

10                MR. GANNON:      -- then that it could fall

11   within (M)(i).   If it's perjury statute that doesn't

12   involve loss or a false statement to an FBI agent that

13   doesn't involve loss to --

14                JUSTICE BREYER:          The government's view is

15   that, of course, you have to meet the other

16   requirements.    But as far as the words "fraud" or

17   "deceit" is concerned, aggravated felony picks up every

18   perjury statute, every lying statute, lying to an FBI

19   agent, lying to this or lying to that.             And has that

20   been the consistent policy of the immigration service?

21   Have they deported people where the other two conditions

22   are fulfilled?

23                MR. GANNON:      In the beginning, when the

24   amount of loss was $200,000.             I think most perjury

25   offenses don't involve a loss of more than $10,000 --

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:         But all I need are a few.

 2   I mean, I just wonder, is it the policy of the INS and

 3   the government to deport people where these other things

 4   are met -- which they would be perhaps rarely; I don't

 5   know -- but to deport them where the crime, the

 6   underlying crime, is perjury, lying to an FBI agent or

 7   lying to other government officials?

 8                MR. GANNON:     There -- yes, there are such

 9   cases.   Sometimes they go under (S), which is the

10   paragraph for perjury, which was actually not in

11   existence when (M)(i) was added to the statute.         It was

12   added 2 years later.    But, more generally, I would like

13   to mention that there are other tax offenses --

14   Justice Scalia.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, I -- I'm confused by

16   the $10,000 requirement.      Does that have to be an

17   element of the offense?

18                MR. GANNON:     It does not need to be an

19   element of the offense.      It's a consequence of the

20   Court's decision in Nijhawan.

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Just a consequence of the

22   -- of the fraud or deceit, right?

23                MR. GANNON:     It needs to be tied to the

24   offense of conviction under this Court's decision in

25   Nijhawan.   And most instances where somebody lies to an


                                    35

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   FBI agent probably don't involve costing somebody more

 2   than $10,000.   And so, I think that it doesn't often

 3   come up in (M)(i).    But many other tax offenses are

 4   prosecuted under other provisions that potentially

 5   involve fraud or deceits and could -- can cost the

 6   government more than $10,000.

 7               And Petitioner's reading of saying that all

 8   tax offenses have to be pulled into (M)(ii) and then

 9   only tax evasion is covered would require the Court to

10   bifurcate all of these other provisions.           And I'm

11   thinking of, for instance, 18 U.S.C. 371.           This is the

12   provision for defrauding the United States by

13   obstructing or impeding the IRS in its efforts to

14   collect taxation.    This Court cited 371 as one of the

15   fraud offenses that it thought was covered by (M)(i) in

16   the Nijhawan decision.

17               The same is true for mail fraud.           The

18   criminal division, the tax division can prosecute tax

19   cases in which somebody mails a false tax return under

20   18 U.S.C. 1341.   False claims under 18 U.S.C. 287,

21   conspiracy to false claims under 286, false statements

22   to the government -- these are all provisions that are

23   used to prosecute tax offenses.           And Petitioner's

24   reading of saying that all tax crimes are pulled out

25   would require the Court to bifurcate these offenses and

 1   make whether it's an aggravated felony turn on whether

 2   the government has lost revenue as opposed to some other

 3   form of money.   And we don't think that that's what

 4   Congress intended when it went to the trouble of just

 5   stating that tax evasion was expressly covered.


 6               And going back, Justice Kagan, to your


 7   concerns about superfluity, I do think it's important


 8   that in the context of this statute, there's lots of


 9   other overlap.   Congress had reasons to be unsure in


10   light of the Scharton decision, in light of the

11   evasion-of-payment cases because, even though as a

12   factual matter --

13               JUSTICE KAGAN:         But it would have been

14   perfectly easy for Congress to write a provision which

15   said just in case that you -- you know, just in case

16   this decision called Scharton has any effect, we mean

17   tax evasion, too, without writing it in this way that

18   appears to exclude all other tax offenses.

19               MR. GANNON:       I don't see how -- if Congress

20   wanted to exclude all other tax offenses, I think they

21   should have put that exception in (M)(i).         They should

22   have said offenses involving fraud or deceit, but not

23   tax offenses, in which the loss to the victim or victims

24   exceeds $10,000.    If Congress wanted to make an

25   exception tax offenses --

 1                JUSTICE KAGAN:        Well, that's just arguing

 2   against our application of the normal rule of avoiding

 3   superfluity where we can.

 4                MR. GANNON:      Well, yes.          I agree that the

 5   Court avoids superfluity where it can.              Here we have

 6   contextual reasons to think that Congress was just

 7   trying to add more offenses to the definition rather

 8   than rule out an entire class.            And I also think that

 9   there is no way to avoid the consequence of bifurcating

10   all of those other provisions under Petitioner's

11   reading.

12                And so, if you were to say that the

13   reference to 7201 pulls out all revenue loss offenses,

14   that would mean that some mail fraud cases against the

15   government in which the government loses more than

16   $10,000 count and some don't.            Same for wire fraud.

17   Same for false statements.         Same for false claims,

18   conspiracy to false claims, and Klein conspiracies under

19   section 371, which -- which are -- have a great deal of

20   overlap with 7201.

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:          They still wouldn't -- no.

22   Why?   They still wouldn't be tax offenses.

23                MR. GANNON:      Well, I -- they would be --

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:          I mean, you use the mail to

25   avoid -- still, what you're being prosecuted for is use


                                     38

 1   of the mail to defraud.


 2                MR. GANNON:      But the -- I mean, as I


 3   understand Petitioner's argument, it is the fact that


 4   (M)(ii) refers to revenue loss that is the thing that


 5   makes it pull in or define a category of cases involving

 6   tax offenses.   And I think that if a mail fraud offense

 7   against the government involved taking -- getting more

 8   than $10,000 worth of refunds from the government as

 9   opposed to getting more than $10,000 in an ill-gotten

10   government contract or government benefits from the

11   government, that that could still be characterized as

12   revenue loss.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Well, he put it -- he put

14   it wrong.   He should have said -- just tax statutes are

15   covered.

16                MR. GANNON:      Well, that --

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Then -- then you wouldn't

18   have to bifurcate, right?

19                MR. GANNON:      Then I just don't see how the

20   reference to a single provision of 7201 refers to all

21   other tax provisions --

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Well, it's not just that.

23   It's -- it's also that -- that (M)(i) says loss to the

24   victim or victims.    And (M)(ii) says the revenue loss to

25   the government has to exceed 10,000.              I mean, in one


                                     39

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   case, it's the loss to the victim or victims.          Why --

 2   why did it use parallel language?           Why -- or why did it

 3   say an offense that involves -- an offense in which the

 4   loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000 and (i)

 5   involves fraud or deceit or (ii) is described in section

 6   7201 of Title 26?   I mean, if -- if you read it, it

 7   seems to contrast loss to the victim or victims with

 8   revenue loss to the government.

 9                And I find it hard to regard the government

10   as a victim in any of these cases, to tell you the

11   truth.

12                MR. GANNON:     Well, I -- none of the courts

13   of appeals has had any difficulty concluding that the

14   government is a victim when it loses more than $10,000

15   in a fraud case or, indeed, in a tax evasion case.          And

16   so, here, there is a different phrase, but I think

17   what's important is that 7201 doesn't define a class of

18   revenue loss offenses.     Instead, it defines a class of

19   tax evasion offenses.     It only refers to the one

20   statute.   And -- and then in that context, where there

21   has to be a deficiency in order to -- for there to be a

22   7201 conviction, there must be a tax deficiency.          Then

23   it's natural to talk about the relevant losses being

24   revenue loss to the government.

25                The phrase in (M)(i) is broader because it


                                    40

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   also applies to other types of frauds.               And I think that

 2   the reference to 7201 alone doesn't indicate Congress is

 3   intending to read out all tax offenses.

 4                 As Justice Ginsburg mentioned before,

 5   although 7201 has a 5-year maximum statutory penalty,

 6   which is longer than the 3-year maximum that applies

 7   under 7206 and some of the other tax offenses in that

 8   particular chapter of Title 26, as a practical matter

 9   the -- the sentencing guidelines use the same thing, the

10   -- the same criteria that are both tied to loss.                 And

11   more importantly, a lot of these other offenses, like

12   371 and 1341 and 1343 in Title 18, actually have longer

13   maximum punishments.

14                 So, if the government wants -- has a

15   particularly big fraud that they want to -- to get after

16   somebody who has a tax evasion case in which they've

17   cost the government a great deal of money, it may choose

18   to proceed under one of the other provisions where it

19   can get an even greater punishment.               And so, just

20   referring to 7201 as the capstone I don't think allows

21   it to be a stand-in for all other tax offenses.

22                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          There's a technical

23   aspect of this case I don't understand.               Maybe you can

24   explain it.   There was a question about what might be

25   the revenue loss in -- in the case of the wife.               Why


                                     41

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   should the revenue loss be different?               She's -- she's

 2   convicted of aiding and abetting.

 3                 MR. GANNON:     She -- although it's -- the

 4   statute itself refers to aiding, assisting, procuring,

 5   or advising, it's not a traditional aiding and abetting

 6   statute.   It doesn't require there to be an underlying

 7   primary violation.    It's an independent offense.

 8                 And so, as it happens in this case, we all

 9   know and it's not disputed that they're for the same

10   underlying false tax return, the same tax return that

11   ended in 1991 for one of the corporations that

12   Petitioners co-owned, but -- but we just didn't have

13   that evidence in the record.

14                 And so, I think even though it's an aiding

15   and abetting, it's -- it's not a classic aiding and

16   abetting violation that depends on the husband's

17   conviction.   She could have been convicted under 7206,

18   too, even if the husband didn't know anything about the

19   false numbers that she was providing him from the

20   restaurant that they were operating.

21                 So, if there are no further questions, we'd

22   urge the Court to affirm the court of appeals.

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

 1                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 2               MR. WHALEN:        My colleague mentioned the

 3   Yermian case, which is in our brief, but I failed to

 4   present it to the Court today.            And it's a very

 5   important case decided by this Court, which said that

 6   filing a false statement is not -- is not indicative,

 7   not evidence, of an intent to deceive.

 8               Similarly, the Harry Bridges case, as also

 9   decided by this Court, said that -- and the Court held

10   that making a false statement about Mr. Bridges'

11   involvement with the Communist Party does not evidence

12   fraud.

13               And these cases, I believe, of this Court

14   control the issue that deceit or fraud is not an

15   essential element of this crime of conviction.

16   Following up what Justice Kagan has said or has asked,

17   that the rules -- canons of construction that the

18   Petitioner has invoked, the rules of superfluity --

19   against superfluity; the idea that the court must give

20   cognizance to different words mean different things;

21   that is, revenue loss from the government is different

22   from loss to a victim or victims; and the specific

23   versus the general.

24               The answer of the Government is simply

25   speculation and conjecture of, among other things,


                                      43

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   courts make the wrong decisions; Congress didn't

 2   understand that tax evasion does involve fraud; and,

 3   therefore, it will be superfluous.

 4                 The position of the Government in this case

 5   is simply that tax evasion may not be in 72 -- or may

 6   not be in (M)(ii), the reason that -- rather, that fraud

 7   and deceit may not be in tax evasion, but that a lesser

 8   revenue offense is in (M)(i).

 9                 I would like to remind the Court, as many of

10   the Justices have indicated, that we're not looking at

11   an idea of someone who suffers a penalty because -- as a

12   result of the tax offense.         We're talking about

13   banishment.   And we're talking about deportation.             And

14   the statute in which we're -- of which we're involved

15   should be read in favor -- where the Congress has not

16   been clear, the statute should be read in favor of the

17   immigrant.

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Although it's not a

19   criminal statute?

20                 MR. WHALEN:     Pardon me, Your Honor.

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          It's not a criminal

22   statute.

23                 MR. WHALEN:     This Court in the Fong case

24   said that the rule of lenity applies to an immigration

25   case.   And the holdings of this Court have been


                                     44

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   consistent that the rule of lenity applies to both

 2   criminal cases as well as immigration cases.           And I

 3   invite the Court to look at the cases we have cited that

 4   the rule of lenity has applied, in fact, to immigration

 5   cases.

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          There -- there's one

 7   technical feature, too, that I also didn't understand.

 8   The particular tax here in question, the failure to

 9   report was 76-some thousand dollars, but the number that

10   was given for the total failure to report is over

11   1 million, and the -- the loss to the IRS at -- is

12   245,000.   Well, the 245,000 loss must refer to more than

13   the failure to report 76,000.

14                 MR. WHALEN:     The threshold amount is not an

15   issue in the case.

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          I'd just like to know how

17   we got -- how the 245,000 revenue loss was calculated,

18   given that the crime that was charged, the failure was

19   to report only 76,000?

20                 MR. WHALEN:     I don't know.       It was in

21   negotiations between the government and the Kawashimas.

22   In any compromise, the government chose only to charge

23   them with a crime under 7206, which -- and to settle on

24   that basis.   As Justice Alito has mentioned in the

25   Padilla case quite emphatically, that attorneys


                                     45

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   representing immigrants deal with the government in

 2   order to avoid deportation.         And that -- in this case

 3   whether the Kawashimas in fact had filed false returns

 4   in an attempt to deceive, that was by the boards,

 5   because the government and the taxpayer agreed that

 6   their offense would be solely 7206, which as you read

 7   the elements -- and you can read the Justice Department

 8   handbook which tells you what the elements are, and it

 9   does not include fraud and deceit.

10               If there are no further questions, I --

11   finally, I would like to mention one case which hasn't

12   been brought up, which evolved from the questions by the

13   Justices, and that is a Third Circuit case which we

14   cited, Nugent, mentioned in response to Justice Breyer's

15   question, that the Nugent case said that you must

16   fulfill both elements, that is perjury, (S) under the

17   statute, and if it's included in fraud and deceit, you

18   must fulfill the elements of both crimes at issue.

19               And, of course, in this case, the Kawashimas

20   did not -- were imprisoned for 4 months and did not meet

21   the statutory requirement for an aggravated felony of 1

22   year.

23               But in any event, I want -- I would like the

24   Court to keep in mind that what we are dealing here with

25   is perjury, and we're not dealing with fraud or deceit,

 2   that, I suggest to the Court, should be dispositive in
