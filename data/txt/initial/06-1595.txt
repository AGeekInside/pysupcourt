 4   next in Case 06-1595, Crawford v. The Metropolitan

 5   Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee.

 6   Mr. Schnapper.

 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

 8                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9              MR. SCHNAPPER:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may

10   it please the Court:

11              When Vicky Crawford reported to city

12   officials that she had been repeatedly harassed by the

13   board's director of employee relations, her conduct was

14   protected by section 704(a) of Title VII.               It is

15   protected first by the first clause of section 704(a),

16   which is known as the opposition clause.               The opposition

17   clause has three elements that must be proven.                  Only one

18   of them is at issue here.         But just to set the context,

19   first a plaintiff will have to prove that the employer

20   acted with a retaliatory motive.              Second, the employee's

21   statement or conduct must relate to action that was

22   unlawful under Title VII.         It might be something that

23   happened in the past.     It might be a concern about

24   something that might happen in the future.

25              And third, the conduct must be in the nature


                                       3

 1   of opposition, and that's the question in dispute in

 2   this particular case.

 3                 It is our view that the -- it is sufficient

 4   to establish that element if a reasonable person would

 5   conclude from the employee's statement or conduct that

 6   the employee disapproved of or objected to the

 7   employment practice in question.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            So a co-worker of your

 9   client says:    You know, the boss really was guilty of

10   sexual harassment and the co-worker says:                  Gee, that's

11   terrible.

12                 MR. SCHNAPPER:         Yes, yes.

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's enough?       That's

14   opposition?

15                 MR. SCHNAPPER:         Yes.       Yes, it is.     In fact,

16   there are cases involving --

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What if it's just,

18   sexual harassment is terrible?

19                 MR. SCHNAPPER:         That would be covered.            If

20   an employee wore a button --

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Even if there's no

22   link, there's no link to the person that the original --

23   the complainant says was engaged in that activity?

24                 MR. SCHNAPPER:         The opposition doesn't have

25   to be directed at a particular event.

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            What about, violating the

 2   law is terrible?

 3                 MR. SCHNAPPER:         I think if there's no

 4   reference to Title VII that wouldn't suffice.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay.      But if she said that

 6   in response to the remark by the co-worker that she had

 7   been subjected to sexual harassment and then the remark

 8   was "Violating the law is terrible," that's opposition?

 9                 MR. SCHNAPPER:         I think a trier of fact

10   could conclude she was referring to what the co-worker

11   had just said.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So if Mr. Jones, the

13   person, did that, that's terrible.

14                 MR. SCHNAPPER:         Yes.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That's actionable as

16   opposition to the practices?

17                 MR. SCHNAPPER:         It is protected.         If the

18   employer comes in and fires her for having said that.

19   The case --

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Schnapper --

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I was going to say in part

22   it seems to me that in isolation it seems harmless,

23   almost trivial, but the whole point is that the employer

24   doesn't think it is trivial.             The employer uses it, by

25   hypothesis, as a basis to retaliate.

 1                 MR. SCHNAPPER:         Right.         That's why the

 2   elements are important.         If the employer fires a worker

 3   for that --

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But that doesn't solve the

 5   problem of having too broad an entry into this thing.

 6   You get to the jury by just showing that she said "Oh,

 7   if he did that, it's terrible," and then it's up to the

 8   jury all of a sudden whether that is the reason that the

 9   employer fired this person or not.                  I mean, that just

10   leaves -- lays the employer open to a lot of jury

11   determinations that he shouldn't be subject to, it seems

12   to me.

13                 MR. SCHNAPPER:         With all deference, Your

14   Honor, the plaintiff must have sufficient evidence to

15   get to the jury on all three elements.                   Retaliation

16   claims are routinely dismissed on the causation element.

17   There's not usually a dispute about whether the conduct

18   was protected, and this case in that regard is unusual.

19   But the --

20                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Do you believe, as I

21   understood you to suggest a moment ago, that you could

22   prove causation if the statement "It is terrible" or

23   "Sexual harassment is terrible" had been uttered in

24   effect in the abstract without reference to particular

25   behavior or a charge of particular behavior on the part

 1   of a co-worker or an employer?                In other words, if A

 2   says "Sexual harassment is terrible" and elsewhere in

 3   the company sexual harassment is going on and A is then

 4   fired, would it be your view that A would at least state

 5   a claim if A said, I had expressed disapproval of sexual

 6   harassment, it turns out there was sexual harassment

 7   being gone -- taking place elsewhere; and I was fired

 8   for that reason.     Would that at least state a claim that

 9   would get a harassment case into court?

10                MR. SCHNAPPER:           Up --

11                JUSTICE SOUTER:              What I'm getting at,

12   doesn't the statement "It's terrible" or whatever the

13   opposition may be have to be made in relation to some

14   specific activity?

15                MR. SCHNAPPER:           No, Your Honor.     No, Your

16   Honor.

17                JUSTICE SOUTER:              Then what is the limit?    It

18   seems to me you've got a cause of action in effect under

19   the statute that would be virtually unlimited.               Anybody

20   who thinks sexual harassment is bad and later gets fired

21   can claim retaliation under the statute if it turns out

22   just as a matter of good luck that somebody was being

23   sexually harassed unbeknownst to the speaker.

24                MR. SCHNAPPER:           That's at least two

25   questions.   Let me try to answer them both.              With regard


                                          7

 1   to what would constitute protected activity, it is our

 2   view -- and I think this is consistent with the lower

 3   courts and the view of the government -- that there

 4   doesn't have to actually be a violation.                  If a worker

 5   walks into the office with a button saying "Violations

 6   of Title VII are bad and I'm against them," she can

 7   be -- and fired for that, that's illegal even though

 8   nothing was going wrong.

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But why are we -- why are

10   we spending so much time on hypotheticals that are so

11   far from this case?      This was a person who appeared at

12   an internal proceeding, she gave testimony, very

13   specific testimony.      She wasn't saying:              I'm against

14   harassment.    She said:      This boss harassed me.            It is

15   about as specific as you get.              So we're dealing with a

16   particular case of somebody who was a witness in an

17   internal investigation.         Why do we have to reach the

18   outer boundaries of this claim in this case?

19                 MR. SCHNAPPER:         You do not, Your Honor.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, but, you know,

21   that's why we ask hypotheticals that aren't related to

22   the specific facts, because we're interested in how

23   broadly the proposition you're asking for goes.                  I'd

24   still like to find out where you draw the limit.                  What

25   if the person says:      Mr. Jones would never do anything

 1   like that, but if he did that would be terrible.                       Now,

 2   is that actionable as opposition?

 3                 MR. SCHNAPPER:          Yes.       Expressing

 4   disagreement with conduct that violates the law is what

 5   the opposition clause protects.                It doesn't have to be

 6   about a specific instance, although it emphatically is

 7   so here.     It doesn't have to reference the statute.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            And there does not have to

 9   have been sexual harassment in the employment unit.

10                 MR. SCHNAPPER:          That's right.

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            So this is a law directed

12   against expressive activity.

13                 MR. SCHNAPPER:          Yes.       Yes.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Are those laws good?           I

15   thought we had a First Amendment.

16                 MR. SCHNAPPER:          No, no.             It is a law that

17   protect expressive activity and those laws are

18   excellent.    It protects the activity.

19                 JUSTICE ALITO:          What if the employee just

20   made -- reports factual information:                       Supervisor did

21   such and such; doesn't express opposition to it.                       Or

22   what if the employee goes further and says:                       Supervisor

23   did such and such, but I know he was just kidding; or I

24   hope you don't take any action against that person.

25   Would that be opposition?

 1               MR. SCHNAPPER:          Not necessarily.         Again, it

 2   depends on the question that was asked and the answer

 3   that was given.   If I might, for example, in this case

 4   the question was did Mr. Hughes engage in inappropriate

 5   activity.   That was a request -- I think a trier of fact

 6   could understand that that was a request for a

 7   description of something that the witness objected to.

 8               JUSTICE ALITO:          Let me ask this.         Suppose

 9   the employer conducts an investigation because it

10   believes that the supervisor has engaged in improper

11   activity.   So what they are trying to do is substantiate

12   grounds for dismissal or some other sanction.                 And then

13   an employee provides information that's exculpatory.

14   Can -- is that protected?          Is that -- is that

15   information protected.

16               MR. SCHNAPPER:          It's our view that that is

17   not protected by the opposition clause.                 It is our view

18   it would be protected by the participation clause.

19               If I might get back to the question --

20               JUSTICE ALITO:          Isn't it strange when there

21   are many situations in which testimony or the reporting

22   of information is protected, but when it's done, isn't

23   it usually done both ways, as it is under the

24   participation clause?      So that the testimony is --

25   cannot be the subject of retaliation or the reporting of


                                       10
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   information cannot be the subject of retaliation, but

 2   not it's protected only if it goes in one direction?

 3   Isn't that a very odd approach to that situation?

 4                MR. SCHNAPPER:         That's why we're advancing

 5   the view that the participation clause here provides as

 6   well, so that it's clear that exculpatory witnesses are

 7   protected.   It is not unimaginable that an exculpatory

 8   witness would anger someone.

 9                But going back to the question you asked

10   earlier, it's possible that in response to a question an

11   answer might be given which a reasonable person would

12   not conclude reflected disapproval such as, well, he

13   told that joke, and I thought it was funny.

14                And, indeed, in the Harris v. Forklift case

15   there were witnesses like that who -- who confirmed that

16   the owner of Harris Forklift had made the jokes in

17   question but said they didn't mind.                     That that would not

18   be our position at --

19                JUSTICE ALITO:         Wouldn't that be very

20   strange?   Suppose that this -- the factual situation

21   actually is very severe and is enough to -- to establish

22   liability on the employer's part, but this particular

23   reporting employee doesn't think so.                    So then the

24   employer might well be very annoyed that this

25   information which can be the -- the basis for liability

 1   has been brought out against the employer, and the

 2   employer might want to retaliate.

 3              Why would that be unprotected just because

 4   this employee adds his or her opinion that it isn't

 5   serious?

 6              MR. SCHNAPPER:           We think it is protected by

 7   the participation clause.

 8              JUSTICE BREYER:             Why don't you follow what

 9   the EEOC says?   I mean, the EEOC, as I understand it,

10   has said the very fact the employer has initiated an

11   investigation of an alleged discrimination is sufficient

12   to demonstrate the reasonableness of the employee's

13   belief that by providing information relevant to the

14   inquiry she is opposing an employment practice made

15   unlawful by Title VII.

16              And then they go on.                To be absolutely clear

17   about it, they say an employee who assists her or her

18   employer in the endeavor, i.e., you go and testify; so

19   the sun was shining on that day; you are assisting your

20   employee by telling the truth-- is by definition -- is

21   opposing practices made unlawful by Title VII.

22              So here we have a difficult question, quite

23   an interstitial question, defining precisely "opposing,"

24   and here we have the EEOC doing it.                     So why don't we

25   just follow what they say?

 1              MR. SCHNAPPER:          Well, I -- that would --

 2   that would certainly be fine with us.

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:            It wouldn't be fine with

 4   me.

 5              MR. SCHNAPPER:          We get to the same place --

 6   we get to the same place by a different route.

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:            What if -- what if I am

 8   indeed very much in favor of sexual harassment?                      I am a

 9   world class sexual harasser, but I'm also not a liar,

10   and I'm -- I am subpoenaed or called up by the employer

11   in connection with this internal investigation and asked

12   whether so-and-so harassed a particular worker.                   And I'd

13   say, yes, as a matter of fact, he did, and a good thing

14   too.

15              Is that expressing opposition?

16              MR. SCHNAPPER:          No.      We believe it is

17   covered by the participation clause.                   We think --

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Covered by the

19   participation clause?

20              MR. SCHNAPPER:          Because our view is that the

21   employer's internal processes for detecting and rooting

22   out sexual harassment, for example, is a -- is a process

23   -- is a process that's under this title within the

24   meaning of --

25              JUSTICE BREYER:            Is this a real problem?            I

 1   mean, let's suppose the opposition clause protects

 2   everybody in the internal investigation who could be at

 3   all interpreted as favorable to the complainant.                        It

 4   also protects everybody who could possibly be viewed as

 5   neutral.

 6               Then you have a problem about what about a

 7   person who loves sexual harassment?                     This is the

 8   hypothetical:   he comes in, testifies:                    I love sexual

 9   harassment; it's wonderful, and they fire him.                        Now is

10   this a real problem?

11               MR. SCHNAPPER:          It -- it is not, Your Honor.

12   But -- but as the -- as the Chief Justice pointed out,

13   I'm -- you know, I'm here to answer hypothetical

14   questions, and I'm going to do so.

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But I thought that --

16               [Laughter.]

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But I thought that the --

18   real case -- the real case that we're dealing with is

19   somebody who appeared in an internal investigation, and

20   I thought that what was the debate between the two

21   sides; anyone who made a charge, testified, assisted, or

22   participated in any manner in the investigation, I

23   thought that the other side's position was, well, this

24   is not an "investigation" within the meaning of the

25   statute.   That what goes on internally doesn't qualify.

 1               "Investigation," "proceeding," or "hearing"

 2   under Title VII requires first that there be a Title VII

 3   charge.   I thought that that's what the controversy

 4   we're talking about today is about:                      Is this a

 5   qualifying investigation?

 6               MR. SCHNAPPER:           Your Honor, there actually

 7   are two distinct questions here.                One of them is whether

 8   the conduct is protected by the opposition clause and

 9   whether it constitutes opposition.

10               The second question is whether this conduct

11   is protected by the participation clause and would be an

12   investigation under Title VII.               We are asserting

13   arguments under both claims, and -- and the Respondents

14   disagree with us on both.

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  And those are

16   overlapping but not whatever it -- concurring --

17               MR. SCHNAPPER:           Redundant.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  -- positions.     You

19   can oppose without participating.                 You can participate

20   without opposing.

21               MR. SCHNAPPER:           Right.         Right.     This case is

22   both.   But -- but there are circumstances which are only

23   one or the other.

24               And this is -- this is a statute that --

25   that is deliberately written with overlapping provisions

 1   to be sure nothing is missed.

 2               In the phrase in the Fort Stewart case, I

 3   think, Justice Scalia, it is ex abundante cotilla, out

 4   of an abundance of caution, or in modern terms boots --

 5   belt and suspenders.      So these are deliberately

 6   overlapping provisions to -- to assure that --

 7               JUSTICE ALITO:          What is the test for

 8   determining whether an investigation has been done, and

 9   the person has testified?          What degree of formality, if

10   anything, is necessary?

11               If -- if somebody in -- in the company

12   simply goes to the office of an employee or the

13   workplace of an employee or encounters the employee in

14   the hallway or someplace and asks a question, is that

15   enough?   Does it have to be --

16               MR. SCHNAPPER:          No.

17               JUSTICE ALITO:          -- a sort of a formal

18   proceeding in -- in some sense?

19               MR. SCHNAPPER:          It -- it -- in our view, it

20   doesn't have to be formal, but there are two essential

21   elements to an investigation or a proceeding or anything

22   other internal being under this title.                  The first is

23   that the employer must have a rule or policy forbidding

24   the type of discrimination in question which is similar

25   to the requirements in section 706(c) for State and


                                       16

 1   local agencies.

 2                Second, the individual -- the official who

 3   did whatever you describe has to have been specifically

 4   authorized by the employer to play that role.                  Vicarious

 5   here wouldn't cover it.

 6                If I could reserve the balance.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

 9                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

10                  ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

11                            AS AMICUS CURIAE,

12                     SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

13                MS. BLATT:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

14   and may it please the Court.

15                We think this case is best resolved under

16   the opposition clause, and that clause does not require

17   employees to utter magic words of opposition or to

18   initiate the interview in which they express opposition

19   to unlawful conduct.       Rather, the clause is satisfied

20   when a reasonable person would understand that the

21   employee has objected to sexual harassment in the

22   workplace.

23                And when an employee discloses or reports

24   that she has been subject to unlawful sexual harassment,

25   a reasonable person could certainly infer that the


                                        17

 1   employee opposes a practice made unlawful by the

 2   statute.

 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  In that case,

 4   doesn't the opposing employee herself have a direct

 5   cause of action under Title VII?               Given what

 6   Ms. Crawford described, you know, "that happened to me,

 7   too," she could proceed under Title VII herself.

 8              MS. BLATT:        Right.         She has got timing

 9   requirements.   So if she hasn't complained to the EEOC

10   within the relevant time, she wouldn't have a cause of

11   action for discrimination.          But once she has

12   retaliated -- an adverse action is taken against her

13   because of what she has reported, then she has timing

14   requirements on when she has to sue for the retaliation,

15   and she did that here.

16              And this is a case where the Sixth Circuit

17   tossed the case out on summary judgment, and it erred in

18   doing so because the facts alleged in this case were

19   more than ample to survive summary judgment on the

20   question of whether she opposed what the Director of

21   Employee Relations did to her.

22              She alleged that in the context of a sexual

23   harassment investigation in which she was asked to

24   disclose inappropriate behavior by the director, she

25   reported repeated instances of offensive, objectionable,


                                       18

 1   and unwelcome conduct by him.             For instance, she said

 2   that she had her head pulled into his lap and that in

 3   response she threw him out of the office, thereby

 4   indicating that she did not like this conduct.

 5               The jury could easily infer from those facts

 6   that she opposed the director's conduct.                 Now, that

 7   timing would --

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Would you go as far

 9   as Mr. Schnapper in determining what constitutes

10   "opposition"?   I mean, do you agree with him that a case

11   where somebody says, "oh, Mr. Jones would never do that,

12   and if he did, I think that would be awful" -- is that

13   "opposition"?

14               MS. BLATT:       If you -- yes, if a reasonable

15   person could infer that.         I think that we are similar.

16               But if you just are a reporter of unlawful

17   conduct, that's enough.        But this case is easier, much

18   easier.   She was a victim.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Yes, yes, I know,

20   but -- I know, but --

21               MS. BLATT:       I understand that.            And if --

22   you can either decide the broader question or the

23   question of the Petitioner here, which she reported that

24   she was subject, and it makes it all the more evident,

25   and certainly a jury could have found that she opposed

 1   the conduct.

 2                 But we do think that at least a reasonable

 3   inference could be drawn -- when you report facts that

 4   would constitute unlawful activity, the reasonable

 5   inference is that you have objected.

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Facts that would

 7   constitute unlawful activity.               What about facts that --

 8   I mean, many of these cases, of course, are

 9   he-said/she-said cases, and what about the facts that

10   you are reporting confirm one side or the other?                   They

11   just ask you, look -- and, you know, the person says,

12   "Well, every day at three o'clock he came in and do

13   this," and you're outside.            And he says, "No, I wasn't

14   there."

15                 MS. BLATT:       Right.         If you just have a --

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Are you opposing it

17   if you say -- you know, you are asked, "Well, you know,

18   you sit outside the office; did he come in there or

19   not?"     And you say, "Yes, he did."

20                 MS. BLATT:       I think this is where we have

21   not embraced the position of the EEOC, that we don't

22   think that expresses opposition if all you do is say,

23   "here's what a person's job duties were and he was in

24   town on that day" or "I had lunch with him on that day,"

25   and that would verify -- it may verify a victim's

 1   statement or corroborate it and thereby be the essential

 2   evidence in the case, but it wouldn't come within the

 3   statutory language of opposing.

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Even you knew that

 5   that was the critical fact in resolving the complaint?

 6               MS. BLATT:       If a reasonable -- well, if a

 7   reasonable person knew from all the circumstances, then

 8   maybe.   If this -- unfortunately, if you don't like jury

 9   trials, this is a jury question whether you oppose the

10   practice or not, and it would have to go to a jury based

11   on the totality of the evidence.

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, since this is a case

13   where the --

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It seems to me that the

15   participation clause is the line of least resistance.                   I

16   understand we have to say what a hearing is and so

17   forth.   Are you asking us to resolve on the opposition

18   clause because that will give more guidance to the

19   system or --

20               MS. BLATT:       No.       When you said "least

21   resistance," it certainly is the most sweeping and broad

22   coverage.   In that sense, you cover all witnesses and

23   participants in the process, and we think Congress

24   intended to do so here.

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 The opposition


                                       21

 1   clause is?

 2                MS. BLATT:       The participation clause is much

 3   broader coverage.    It could -- it would cover anyone who

 4   participates in the investigation, whether or not they

 5   oppose the practice.

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, it depends how

 7   you define the investigation --

 8                MS. BLATT:       Opposition.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 -- the inquiry, and

10   that's kind of a tough issue, it seems to me.

11                MS. BLATT: If this were before the EEOC,

12   everybody who testifies in that proceeding or

13   participates in the investigation would be covered.                     It

14   doesn't matter whether you oppose a practice.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Right.

16                MS. BLATT:       So in that sense, it's broader.

17   The reason why this case is easier for you, under the

18   opposition clause, is it's a narrow holding and it

19   doesn't get you into the question of whether just an

20   employer investigation is an investigation --

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I guess the

22   question I was asking earlier, you have overlapping but

23   not concentric categories, so the "opposing" may be

24   broader than the "participating in" depending upon how

25   we define either one.

 1                 MS. BLATT:      That's exactly right, but at a

 2   minimum when you have a victim of sexual harassment who

 3   reports it to her employer in the context of an

 4   investigation where she's asked was there anything

 5   inappropriate and she recounts here, it's so clearly

 6   opposition.    It so clearly should not have been thrown

 7   out on summary judgment.          And it so clearly can force --

 8                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           You think -- you think the

 9   conduct in this case is also covered by the

10   participation clause?

11                 MS. BLATT:      Absolutely.

12                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           You do?

13                 MS. BLATT:      Yes.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:           The problem with that is

15   that I -- while I have the EEOC with me, say, on --

16   assuming your thing -- on, from what I read, on the

17   opposition clause, when I looked into what the EEOC

18   actually said here on the participation clause, I don't

19   think I can characterize it, except for their litigation

20   position.

21                 MS. BLATT:      But that --

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I can't characterize what

23   they've said in their compliance manual as being with

 1   neither does the EEOC interpret their compliance manual

 2   as --

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:            And they could easily

 4   change it.    They could easily change it.

 5                MS. BLATT:       Yes, it is true that it's in a

 6   brief, it's on their Website, it's on home page, on

 7   their Website.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.      It's not in their

 9   manual.

10                MS. BLATT:       It's not in their compliance

11   manual; it's in our amicus brief, but it is the EEOC's

12   position.    And, again, that's why I think it's an easier

13   case for you under the opposition clause.

14                JUSTICE ALITO:          Can you think of any other

15   situation in which the law says that a person who

16   testifies or provides information is protected against

17   retaliation only if that person gives testimony of a

18   particular type or gives a statement of a particular

19   type?

20                MS. BLATT:       No, but you have to remember

21   there are two separate clauses.               The statute under the

22   opposition clause just says "oppose a practice made

23   unlawful."    If you didn't oppose a practice, you're not

24   covered under that.      You would be covered under -- in

25   the proceeding, why there is such broad coverage.                Once

 1   you're under the participation clause, no matter what

 2   the substance of your testimony is, it's covered.               It

 3   protects the process itself, regardless of whether it

 4   was -- it was determined true.

 5              JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, I understand that, but

 6   I'm -- what I'm asking is, is the reason to doubt

 7   whether Congress intended in the opposition clause to

 8   provide protection only for people who testify or

 9   provide information that goes in a particular direction?

10              MS. BLATT:        I think --

11              JUSTICE ALITO:           If the purpose is to -- is

12   to elicit information and protect the people who come

13   forward with the information, then why don't you provide

14   the protection irrespective of what the person says?

15              MS. BLATT:        I think that position is

16   consistent with the EEOC, and I don't think we would

17   oppose that position in the sense that it would give the

18   greatest and broadest protection.

19              And what is so upsetting about this case is

20   the gaping hole in statutory coverage that the Sixth

21   Circuit left.   It is an inexplicable gap that a

22   complaining witness in an employer investigation would

23   be unprotected from retaliation.               The statute simply

24   can't function, as intended by Congress, as intended by

25   this Court, if there are all these incentives for

 1   employees to investigate unlawful activity, witnesses

 2   come forward and report that they, in fact, have been

 3   subjected to sexual harassment, and employers are free

 4   to retaliate.    They --

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I think that's a very

 6   strong argument for the participation clause.

 7                 MS. BLATT:      It is.         It is, but it's all the

 8   more reason that she has to be covered under one of them

 9   if not both of them.       Witnesses simply are going to be

10   afraid to fully cooperate if they're not given

11   protection.

12                 And if there are no questions, we'd ask that

13   the Sixth Circuit be --

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The -- the other side

15   says this is not an investigation.                  There was no charge

16   filed.   She's filed no charge.              So this is not a

17   qualifying investigation.           What is the government's

18   position on that?

19                 MS. BLATT:      Well, I mean, we think that is

20   border-line absurd, although all courts that have

21   reached the issue have held that.                 And it just -- it

22   makes no sense, and it -- I'm not even --

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm sorry.   Have

24   held what?

25                 MS. BLATT:      Have held that -- that the

 1   internal investigation is covered as long as somebody

 2   has filed a charge.     It's not clear who or that it has

 3   to be related to the subject matter.                    And that would

 4   mean if the investigation is conducted on the day a

 5   charge is filed at noon, all the witnesses who came in,

 6   in the morning, are unprotected; yet all the witnesses

 7   who came in, in the afternoon, would be protected.                       Yet

 8   nobody even knows that a charge has been filed.                    And

 9   that's just not something that Congress possibly could

10   have intended and wanted to leave the morning witnesses

11   unprotected from retaliation.

12              So I don't think the current state of the

13   law under the participation clause is supported by the

14   text, and it's certainly not supported by any policy

15   under Title VII.

16              No questions?

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, counsel.

19              ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS H. YOUNG

20                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

21              MR. YOUNG:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

22   and may it please the Court:

23              Title VII was the result of a congressional

24   compromise which struck a balance between protecting the

25   interests of employees and employers.

 1              In relation to the anti-retaliation

 2   provisions of section 704, that balance was struck to

 3   protect the rights of employees to report allegedly

 4   discriminatory activity, as well as employers' rights to

 5   manage their workplaces.        The participation clause

 6   covers activity or conduct in the course of an

 7   investigation, proceeding, or hearing under Title VII.

 8              The opposition clause -- the actual words of

 9   the opposition clause protect an employee who has

10   opposed a particular unlawful practice.

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What -- what more

12   could Ms. Crawford do to make it clear that she opposes

13   what was alleged in this case?

14              MR. YOUNG:       She could have -- she could have

15   initiated making contact with the government official to

16   register a complaint or an objection.

17              Instead, she made a disclosure or she

18   cooperated in the investigation, Your Honor.

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, how can the

20   fact that what led to the statement change the

21   characterization of the statement?                She can initiate it,

22   go in and say, "I oppose what's going on," or if

23   somebody just asks her, you know, "how do you feel about

24   what's going on," she says she opposes it.                It seems to

25   me in either case you look at the statement and not what


                                      28

 1   led to the statement.

 2               MR. YOUNG:         Congress chose to use the word

 3   "oppose," Your Honor.        That's why the short --

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   That's why my

 5   hypothetical uses the word "oppose."                      In the first case,

 6   she goes in of own volition and says, "I oppose"; in the

 7   second case, she says "I oppose" in response to a

 8   question.   Congress used the word "oppose," and my

 9   hypothetical in both cases used the word "oppose."

10               MR. YOUNG: If she's not taking the

11   initiative, then she has to report it and request that

12   something be done about it.              Does the word -- if she

13   uses the word "oppose," as in your hypothetical, that

14   would not be the facts of this case, but that would

15   probably nudge it to the line of opposition conduct

16   because she's using the word "oppose."

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Right.    Well, is it

18   real a magic word?      She comes in and says, "you won't

19   believe" -- you know -- "you think that's bad, wait till

20   I tell you what he did to me," and goes on tells -- it's

21   quite obvious from the context that she opposes it.

22               MR. YOUNG:         Well, that's why we advocate a

23   reasonableness standard, Your Honor, in the ears of the

24   person receiving the information, but under the facts of

25   this case, that standard was not met.

 1                 The true opposition activity -- it's called

 2   the opposition clause, not the disclosure clause, not

 3   the cooperation clause.          There's an element -- and all

 4   the parties have provided the Court with a dictionary --

 5   the various dictionary definitions of the word "oppose,"

 6   all of which contain the common theme of resistance,

 7   coming up against something, communicating resistance.

 8                 When the -- when what Mrs. Crawford said to

 9   the human resources investigator in response to

10   questioning is actually examined, it is making a

11   disclosure.     There's no request that anything be done

12   about it.     The time lag between the end of the alleged

13   harassment and the actual reporting is over two months.

14   Mrs. Crawford had multiple opportunities to report to

15   her supervisor, her supervisor's supervisor, the

16   director of employee --

17                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            You mean if she had made

18   complaints after she had answered the questions in --

19   and given the information at issue here, that would

20   convert her prior statements into opposition?

21                 MR. YOUNG:       That would -- the fact that Your

22   Honor chose the term "complaint" would be a different

23   situation from what we had here.                 A subsequent --

24                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            I'm asking you.     You're in

25   effect saying there has got to be some kind of what you

 1   call active opposition; and I took it from what you said

 2   a moment ago that if she had given the evidence in

 3   question here, and then in the period, subsequent period

 4   of two months, made some sort of complaint, that that

 5   complaint would have qualified her original evidence as

 6   opposition.

 7                 Is that your position?

 8                 MR. YOUNG:       That complaint would undoubtedly

 9   be opposition.     Would it reach back --

10                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            You're taking about --

11                 MR. YOUNG:       Would it retroactively imbue the

12   initial disclosure with an opposition quality?                      Yes.

13   Yes.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            It would?          Why?   It doesn't

15   seem so to me.     I mean, it either was or wasn't.                   You're

16   making the argument, essentially, that "oppose" has two

17   quite different meanings.            You can ask somebody, you

18   know, do you oppose the war in Iraq?                      And all you're

19   asking is what is your opinion of the war in Iraq.                         Do

20   you think it is good or bad?

21                 But "oppose" is also used in a quite

22   different sense.     He -- you say somebody opposed the war

23   in Iraq, you mean he went out and -- and paraded against

24   it and so forth.

25                 And your assertion is that in this


                                         31
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   legislation, it has the latter meaning.                    It just doesn't

 2   ask for your opinion about whether sexual harassment is

 3   good or bad.   It asks whether you were actively --

 4   actively opposing it.

 5                Now, once you adopt that position, I don't

 6   see how the fact that you -- that something that was not

 7   active opposition can be converted into active

 8   opposition by something that occurred later.

 9                I mean, if you want to abandon your other

10   argument, that's fine with me, but --

11                (Laughter.)

12                MR. YOUNG:      Your Honor, I'm uncomfortable

13   with the concept that subsequent -- a subsequent

14   complaint can imbue a prior statement with that --

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Would that uncomfortable?

16   Say it doesn't.   I mean, I -- I don't care if you're

17   uncomfortable with it.       Does it or doesn't it?

18                MR. YOUNG:      Perhaps yes.               But if it does --

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Then I don't understand

20   your case.

21                MR. YOUNG:      Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't

22   see that distinction as being relevant.                    Because if --

23   if a subsequent complaint is made a month, two months

24   after the initial disclosing conduct, then we're -- then

25   we're traveling on that subsequent complaint.

 1                 And the fact that a disclosure was made a

 2   month or two prior doesn't become a relevant watershed

 3   date in terms of when the protections of the statute

 4   arise.

 5                 The -- the -- the concept is something more

 6   than disclosure, something more than mere cooperation.

 7   The language of the statute is he or she has opposed a

 8   specific practice, not just opposition to the war in

 9   Iraq in general; not just opposition to sexual

10   harassment in general; but that a specific --

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It isn't just a specific --

12   again, if I don't understand your case, it isn't just a

13   matter of the specific practice.

14                 Your point is it is not asking your opinion.

15   It is asking whether you are actively trying to

16   eliminate it.

17                 I think even if -- if you were asked your

18   opinion, you know, do you -- do you oppose what, you

19   know, what this supervisor did?               And -- and you said

20   yes, I don't favor it, I think it's bad, I think it's a

21   bad idea, I -- as I understand your case, that's not

22   opposition.

23                 MR. YOUNG:      Your Honor --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           And I don't see how that is

25   changed at all when you put it in the context of a

 1   specific act of harassment as opposed to putting it in

 2   the context of harassment in general.

 3              You -- you -- if you're hiding behind the --

 4   the defenses you've built up, it seems to me those

 5   defenses require something more than an expression of

 6   your opinion of whether it's good or bad.

 7              Your opinion is whether it's good or bad is

 8   not opposition.

 9              MR. YOUNG:       I agree with that, Your Honor.

10   I used the term "practice" inartfully.                 Our argument is

11   there is a specific act that the employee considers to

12   be unlawful, and that's what the employee is opposing.

13   So that is what needs to be communicated to a reasonable

14   person within the government or within --

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:            If the -- if the employee

16   in response to the inquiry that's being made says yes, I

17   saw my employer do "X" and it happened -- and I think

18   it's terrible, that is certainly specific to the act.

19              MR. YOUNG:       It's specific to the act, Your

20   Honor, but I -- I would argue that does not cross the

21   line into "and I oppose it."

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But the reason -- but the

23   reason it doesn't cross the line is you are, in effect,

24   saying that "oppose" within the meaning of the statute

25   has got to be read more narrowly than the -- than the


                                      34
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   notion of oppose as we commonly use that word in common

 2   speech.

 3              And I don't know why -- I don't know what

 4   your -- what your authority is for saying that "oppose"

 5   was not used in its commonsense everyday connotation.

 6              MR. YOUNG:         Well, I think the word "oppose"

 7   can be used in a specific sense in common everyday

 8   speech and can be used in a general sense, Your Honor.

 9   And I think --

10              JUSTICE SOUTER:              But in my hypothetical,

11   we're not talking about a general sense.                 In my

12   hypothetical we were talking about a reference to a very

13   specific act.    So the generality problem doesn't arise.

14   And yet despite the specificity, you say, and despite

15   the fact that in common speech a -- a specific statement

16   like that would be taken as opposition, you say it

17   shouldn't be under the statute.

18              And the statute doesn't have any definition

19   that narrows it.    Common speech wouldn't narrow it your

20   way.

21              Why should it be narrowed your way?

22              MR. YOUNG:         The -- Your Honor's hypothetical

23   of saying something is terrible would -- would -- would

24   not be commonly understood to communicate opposition

25   to --

 1                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Mr. Young, even under your

 2   definition, why is not the statement that's made in this

 3   case, "get the hell out of my office," wouldn't that be

 4   opposition even under your statement, under your

 5   definition?    She's opposing his advance to her.           That's

 6   an active opposition it seems.

 7                 MR. YOUNG:      Her statement to him to get out

 8   of my office would --

 9                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Get the hell out of my

10   office.

11                 MR. YOUNG:      Yes, Your Honor.

12                 (Laughter.)

13                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Why isn't that opposition

14   under your statement -- under your definition?

15                 MR. YOUNG:      Well, the -- because the -- in

16   the context of anti-retaliation provisions, making a

17   statement to an alleged harasser to stop the harassment

18   or get out of my office does not rise to opposition

19   conduct, because the -- the -- the essence of the

20   opposition clause is somehow putting the employer on

21   notice.

22                 If every employee who was a victim of sexual

23   harassment and says stop, if that -- if that constitutes

24   opposition conduct under the retaliation clause,

25   suddenly that employee has two causes of action, one for

 1   sexual harassment and one for retaliation.

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, that isn't even --

 3   look, the best way to oppose a crime is to cooperate

 4   with the police when they investigate individual

 5   instances.

 6                 The best way to oppose sexual discrimination

 7   in the workplace is to cooperate with the employer when,

 8   in fact, he investigates individual instances.

 9                 Is what I've just said English?                Does it

10   make sense?     And indeed, I'm just quoting the EEOC's own

11   definition.

12                 MR. YOUNG:       Yes, it was in English.          Yes, it

13   makes sense, Your Honor, but I would beg to differ,

14   respectfully.     The best way to oppose sexual harassment

15   is to go and make a complaint about it.

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:            It is your opinion.     The

17   EEOC's opinion is, as they state, the best way to oppose

18   is to cooperate.

19                 Now, what are we to do with, at

20   least ambiguity, giving you that, I'll give you

21   ambiguity.    But we have the agency charged with the

22   enforcement of this taking the side of it that is the

23   opposite side that you are taking.

24                 MR. YOUNG:       Yes, Your Honor.           There is --

25   there are enough contradictory statements in the

 2   Court is inclined to give to the EEOC's compliance

 3   manual should be tempered by the fact that even the EEOC

 4   recognizes the importance of employees taking initiative

 5   to report harassment and not --

 7   finish your answer.

 9   waiting for the investigation to come to them.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The investigation is not

11   of her.   She's testifying as a witness.

12               MR. YOUNG:       She's offering a statement in an

13   interview, Your Honor, as a witness, yes.

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And this is an act that's

15   meant to protect people against discrimination in the

16   workplace, including harassment.

17               MR. YOUNG:       Yes.

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             This is a woman who

19   testified truthfully -- we have to assume that because

20   this was tossed out at the very threshold, so we have to

21   assume that everything she alleged in her complaint is

22   true, right?

23               MR. YOUNG:       It is not up -- it is not before

24   this Court on a Rule 12 standard of assuming all the

25   allegations are true, Your Honor; but it comes to the

 1   Court on summary judgment.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             There is no -- no dis --

 3   then there has to be no genuine dispute as to any

 4   material fact.     That means we must take her allegations

 5   of fact as true at this point.

 6                 But in any case this is a statute that's

 7   meant to govern the workplace with all of its realities.

 8                 One of them was when they asked, well, why

 9   didn't you make a complaint, use whatever internal

10   remedies are there are?          She said, because the person in

11   this outfit who is charged with receiving complaints is

12   the harasser.

13                 MR. YOUNG:       That isn't -- that was her

14   contention.     That's not necessarily true.

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But we have to --

16   everything -- for you to prevail, since there has been

17   no trial on the facts, we have to take the facts as she

18   alleges them.

19                 MR. YOUNG:       There are multiple places to

20   report sexual harassment, Your Honor.                     She -- she didn't

21   even report it to her boss.              She didn't report it to her

22   boss's boss, and she didn't report it to the Director of

23   Human Resources.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, I suppose your point

25   would be it doesn't matter what the reason was that she

 1   didn't report it.    In order to recover here she has to

 2   have taken a public stand; and whatever the reason why

 3   she didn't, the fact is that she didn't.

 4                Why do you get into, you know, the reason

 5   that she didn't?

 6                MR. YOUNG:       I agree with you, Your Honor.

 7   The reasons why she didn't make a report are immaterial.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:            And -- and I suppose that

 9   you -- you would require the -- the opposition to be

10   somehow a public -- a public expression of opposition.

11   No?

12                MR. YOUNG:       Yes.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I mean, if one political

14   candidate says that the other one opposed the war in

15   Iraq, do you think the other candidate could say, that's

16   a lie?    I'm sorry, that the charge would be held to be

17   correct if, in fact, the other candidate had never said

18   anything about the war in Iraq, although deep in his

19   heart he thought it was probably a bad idea.

20                Would you say that he opposed the war in

21   Iraq?    I don't think so.

22                MR. YOUNG:       Your Honor, even when --

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:            The implication is --

24                MR. YOUNG:       Even when --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:            The implication is that he

 1   came out with some public position opposing it, and

 2   that's your position as to the meaning of --

 3              MR. YOUNG:         Yes, Your Honor.           And even the

 4   EEOC in its own compliance manual as set forth on page

 5   38 of the red brief, the examples of opposition cited by

 6   the EEOC are threatening to file a charge, complaining,

 7   protesting, picketing.        These are active verbs.

 8              JUSTICE ALITO:            Why wouldn't this fall

 9   within the participation clause?                There was an

10   investigation, and -- and you described the people who

11   provided information as "witnesses."

12              MR. YOUNG:         Yes.

13              JUSTICE ALITO:            So why doesn't it fall under

14   the participation clause?

15              MR. YOUNG:         An -- an employer's internal

16   sexual harassment investigation is not an investigation

17   under this title.

18              JUSTICE ALITO:            Never, even after -- even

19   after a charge has been filed with the EEOC?

20              MR. YOUNG:         Well, the five circuits that

21   have squarely considered the issue have held that that's

22   the trigger that brings the internal investigation under

23   the rubric of the participation clause here, Your Honor.

24              JUSTICE ALITO:            And what's your argument?

25              MR. YOUNG:         I'll -- I'll take that.

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And how about taking our

 2   decisions in the Faragher and Ellerth case which in a

 3   sense made the employer's internal investigation part of

 4   the EEO process because it says to the employer, if you

 5   don't have that find of effective internal complaint and

 6   investigation procedure, then you're going to be stuck

 7   on respondeat superior liability.                  If you do, then you

 8   will be shielded.

 9                 So this Court's decision in those two cases

10   seemed to me to say to every employer, as part of your

11   EEO compliance you had better have this internal

12   complaint procedure and investigation.

13                 MR. YOUNG:       I agree.          Faragher and Ellerth

14   put the carrot on the stick in front of the employers

15   and say, here's an affirmative defense that will be

16   available to you in certain harassment cases if you

17   adopt a -- an anti-harassment policy which includes an

18   investigation mechanism.           However, such a policy and

19   such a mechanism is not made mandatory by Faragher and

20   Ellerth.     The argument of --

21                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, you say it's not made

22   mandatory.     Any employer who doesn't go through it is

23   crazy.     And I don't see how this Court, having imposed

24   in practical terms the requirement that Justice Ginsburg

25   just described, can then say, oh, but we're going to

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   construe this indefinite term of "investigation"

 2   to exclude this kind of employer activity which our

 3   construction of the statute has virtually mandated.

 4              So that if in fact the employer's

 5   investigation succeeds in ending the problem and there

 6   is no EEOC complaint, those who participated in the

 7   investigation are absolutely helpless against

 8   retaliation.     That would be a bizarre way to interpret a

 9   -- a statute in which we have any -- any opportunity to

10   interpret "investigation" to include this kind of

11   investigation.

12              What do you say to that?

13              MR. YOUNG:          The fact that Faragher and

14   Ellerth create an incentive to employers to develop

15   these policies with investigate -- which include

16   investigations, does not elevate such investigations to

17   fall under the statutory requirement of being --

18              JUSTICE SOUTER:               No.     But I'm -- I'm giving

19   you an argument as to why we should construe it to

20   elevate it, and -- and the argument is that we, in

21   effect, in what I think were correct decisions -- you

22   agree, you said a moment ago, were correct decisions --

23   have in practical terms mandated this kind of an

24   inquiry.

25              Why then would it be reasonable for us, if


                                         43

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   we have any option in construing the term

 2   "investigation," to construe it to exclude this kind of

 3   investigation and exclude coverage of the people who

 4   under our decisions are supposed to come forward and --

 5   and answer questions?       Why would that be a reasonable

 6   construction?

 7              MR. YOUNG:         Because at some point, Your

 8   Honor, the construction departs so far from what can

 9   reasonably be supported by the language of the statute

10   itself that it --

11              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Well, why isn't it -- why

12   isn't an investigation by the employer an

13   "investigation"?    That's the language of the statute.

14              MR. YOUNG:         It -- it is an "investigation."

15   Our contention is it does not fall under the category of

16   an "investigation" under this title even despite

17   Faragher and Ellerth.

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   I thought Faragher

19   and Ellerth --

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Why couldn't he -- I'm

21   sorry, Chief Justice.

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   I thought Faragher

23   and Ellerth were limited to the hostile work environment

24   cases.

25              MR. YOUNG:         Of supervisory harassment,

 1   that's true, Your Honor.

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well -- well, that's

 3   a different question.      Is the defense we recognized in

 4   Ellerth and Faragher in the hostile work environment

 5   case or in the specific action case as well?

 6               MR. YOUNG:       My understanding of Faragher and

 7   Ellerth is that it -- it applies in the hostile work

 8   environment case involving harassment by a supervisor.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I thought you were going to

10   answer Justice Souter with the assertion that if indeed

11   the Court wants employers to conduct these

12   investigations, it does not want to reduce the incentive

13   to do so.

14               And the rule that is urged by the other side

15   means whenever the -- whenever the employer conducts

16   such an investigation, any employee who is smart enough

17   to come in and testify against -- against sexual

18   harassment has a guaranteed job.               It is almost like --

19   almost like being a Federal judge.

20               [Laughter.]

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You can't be fired after

22   that, or the employer can't fire her without opening

23   himself up to a lawsuit under -- under this provision.

24   And he might win the lawsuit, but it's going to cost

25   money.   So why -- maybe an employer would rather say,


                                       45
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   you know, I'd rather roll the dice and -- and not

 2   conduct an investigation and insulate all of my hostile

 3   employees from -- from employment actions.

 4              MR. YOUNG:       That would be the -- that would

 5   be the employer's interest.           The disincentive that the

 6   employers would have to comply with these -- with this

 7   Court's directives or strong suggestions in Faragher and

 8   Ellerth is employers would stop conducting these

 9   investigations if everyone they interviewed was going to

10   be a potential retaliation claim.

11              JUSTICE SOUTER:            And instead they would

12   substitute the -- the response to an EEOC investigation

13   in which they would not have the leg to stand on in

14   opposing respondeat superior.            I suppose that would be

15   an inducement for them to go ahead with the

16   investigation; wouldn't you?

17              MR. YOUNG:       Their -- they would lose the

18   protections of Faragher and Ellerth.                   We would be back

19   to respondeat superior liability.               It sounds illogical,

20   but I -- I submit to the Court that if -- that if it is

21   going to be a Hobson's choice and it -- it would be a

22   situation in which employers would have an incentive to

23   choose not to -- would choose to abandon their policies

24   and take their chances.

25              If they have to interview 20 people in a --


                                      46

 1   in a retaliation -- in a sexual harassment case, there's

 2   20 potential plaintiffs because they all participated.

 3   It doesn't even matter if the employer knows what the

 4   employees said.   If -- if some type of discipline or

 5   adverse action is imposed by the employer on any of

 6   those employees, there is an instant retaliation claim.

 7               JUSTICE SOUTER:            By the way, I take it in --

 8   in this case, although this is not the issue before us,

 9   that if you -- if you lose on the issues before us, it

10   is still your position that ultimately you should win

11   this case, because you have good evidence, you say in

12   your briefs, to indicate that the reason for firing had

13   nothing to do with retaliation.

14               That's true, isn't it?

15               MR. YOUNG:       I have two arguments left in my

16   quiver on summary judgment, Your Honor, that the trial

17   court didn't even consider.            So if this case goes back

18   down, that's what I'm going to ask the trial court to

19   consider.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What are the other

21   arguments on summary judgment.

22               MR. YOUNG:       The lack of causation, the lack

23   of knowledge between whatever told the investigator in

24   this confidential interview as to which confidentiality

25   was promised and delivered, the lack of any knowledge --


                                       47

 1   -- the lack of any evidence that the decision-makers

 2   regarding Ms. Crawford and her job, that they knew what

 3   she said in this interview.            The lack of causation is my

 4   first ground and the lack of pretext is my second ground

 5   that has yet to be considered.              Because of the abundant

 6   evidence of misconduct which was discovered regarding

 7   how Ms. Crawford was not running her office.

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              When you say it's not

 9   that the employer is stuck because there's a potential

10   retaliation claim, if the employer is certain of its

11   grounds, that this discharge had nothing to do with her

12   testimony, then go ahead and discharge her.

13              MR. YOUNG:        Yes, Your Honor.

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Do you get your litigation

15   fees if you win?   If the plaintiff here loses, does she

16   pay all the attorneys' fees that this employer has

17   incurred on this litigation?

18              MR. YOUNG:        It is very difficult for a

19   victorious defendant to recover attorneys' fees under

20   section 1988, Your Honor.          The threshold is very high.

21   I've never recovered the fees in my 14 years working for

22   this office in a section 1983 case.

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:             So even when you win you

24   lose.

25              MR. YOUNG:        Yes.       In that sense, yes, Your

 1   Honor.    Or a Title VII case.

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              On the other side, that

 3   attorney, there's a large disincentive.                   He hasn't got a

 4   good case.    He's not going to be paid any retainer as

 5   you might be.     And he's not going to get any counsel

 6   fees.    Why should such -- why should it -- counsel be

 7   available to a person who obviously was discharged for

 8   having her hand in the till and not because she was

 9   harassed?

10                MR. YOUNG:        First of all, there is no

11   allegation that Ms. Crawford embezzled or took money.

12   There is no allegation, and she was not disciplined.

13   She was not discharged based on any allegation she was

14   stealing money.    That's simply not a factor.

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              No.      I meant that as a

16   hypothetical.

17                MR. YOUNG:        Oh, I'm sorry.

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              What was the reason that

19   she was -- what was the employer's reason for

20   discharging her?

21                MR. YOUNG:        Multiple -- she was the payroll

22   coordinator and her office -- all these checks were

23   sitting in her office and they were not being processed.

24   Some of them were six, eight, ten months old.                   Her

25   office was in complete disarray.                 And this came to light

 1   as a result of this sexual harassment investigation when

 2   her subordinates were interviewed and they provided

 3   testimony regarding how she was running her office, and

 4   that eventually got to the finance department of the

 5   government, which hired an outside auditor which went in

 6   and generated all this evidence at great expense to the

 7   metropolitan government to hire this outside auditor.

 8              That's where the evidence was developed to

 9   terminate Ms. Crawford six months after the statement to

10   the investigators.      So that's -- those were the facts on

11   how it happened.

12              I forgot Your Honor's original question, or

13   maybe I answered it.        I don't know.

14              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                I said if you have a

15   really strong case of having discharged this person for

16   cause that has nothing at all to do with harassment, you

17   are going to win the lawsuit and it would be hard for

18   the plaintiff to get a decent lawyer to represent her

19   side of the case because she's going to lose.

20              MR. YOUNG:          In theory, yes; but the burdens

21   of litigation, which is part of the congressional

22   compromise -- back in 1964 in order to gain passage of

23   the Civil Rights Act, employer's interests were deemed

24   to be of equal magnitude as employees'.

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    You're not going to

 1   win -- you're not going to win this case; you're going

 2   to settle if you lose up here, right?

 3                MR. YOUNG:       If I lose up here, first I've

 4   got two more shots at summary judgment, Your Honor.

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You don't have to answer

 6   that.    We'll be glad to see you again.

 7                (Laughter.)

 8                MR. YOUNG:       I hope I'm not --

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 My point is simply

10   that the incentive system is skewed because if you lose

11   you pay not only your attorneys' fees but the

12   complainants'.   If you win, you have to incur yours.

13                MR. YOUNG:       In civil rights cases the

14   incentives, that incentive fee, that incentive system,

15   is skewed against the defendants because of the public

16   policy reason favoring --

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I'm not saying it

18   shouldn't be.    But in terms of the pressures towards

19   settlement, it is a very strong incentive.

20                MR. YOUNG:       Yes.

21                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Is bringing frivolous

22   cases cost-free for the plaintiffs?                      There are certain

23   costs.

24                MR. YOUNG:       Well, Your Honor, many of these

25   types of cases are taken on a contingent fee basis


                                        51

 1   except for hard costs.

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            It is a mix.       I mean, you

 3   know, a lot of plaintiffs might be afraid to bring these

 4   cases because they'll be accused of doing all kinds of

 5   bad things.     They don't want their reputations ruined.

 6   They have lawyers who take contingent fees because they

 7   have to pay for it.       Oh the other hand, you have

 8   problems with your costs and you have problems

 9   dismissing people who should be dismissed.                   Everybody

10   has problems in this area.            That's why we have law and

11   lawyers.     They try to minimize it.                This doesn't seem

12   fruitful to me.

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Isn't it true that

14   financially it is always cost-free for the plaintiff

15   because she has an attorney who is taking it on a

16   contingent basis?     Now, you could say it's not cost-free

17   to the lawyer; but even that's not always true because

18   if the lawyer has nothing else to do he may as well be

19   doing this, you know, whatever the odds are.

20                 MR. YOUNG:       I agree with that, Your Honor.

21                 And if the Court has no more questions,

22   thank you.

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

 1                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

 2                      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 3              MR. SCHNAPPER:             Thank you, Your Honor, may

 4   it please the Court:

 5              Protecting witnesses from being fired

 6   because they provide information in internal

 7   investigates is not going to interfere with the conduct

 8   of those investigations or deter them.                    We know that

 9   from experience.     Until the decision in this case, no

10   one had questioned the applicability of the opposition

11   clause to a witness in an investigation who complains

12   about sexual harassment.           It was simply not in dispute.

13   The compliance manual in this regard was entirely clear

14   since 2000 because the Commission took the position

15   witnesses who complained were protected by the

16   opposition clause.      None of the problems Mr. Young

17   expressed concern about had happened.

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Counsel, Ms. Blatt

19   said the government would prefer a decision under the

20   opposition ground as opposed to the participation.                      Do

21   you have a preference?

22              MR. SCHNAPPER:             I think she said she thought

23   it was easier.   We don't have a preference.                  But I'd

24   like to address briefly the participation clause.                   The

25   participation clause does have the singular value, as


                                         53
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Justice Alito suggested, that it is evenhanded, that it

 2   will protect witnesses for both sides.                      And the

 3   integrity of the process is certainly strengthened if

 4   both witnesses, witnesses on both sides, know they're

 5   protected from retaliation.

 6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Is the only question --

 7   -the participation is not in doubt.                      The only question

 8   is whether it's an investigation under this subtitle.

 9                 MR. SCHNAPPER:         But the question is under

10   this title.    That language its certainly broad enough,

11   as Justice Souter suggested, to encompass the sort of

12   process that's at issue here.              As Justice Ginsburg

13   pointed out, this Court's decisions in Faragher

14   virtually mandate these decisions.

15                 In response to the Chief Justice's point --

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           You think the language

17   "investigation under this title" is the equivalent of

18   "investigation with respect to an alleged offense under

19   this title"?    That doesn't strike me as self-evident at

20   all.   It seems to me "investigation under this title" to

21   me means an investigation under this title, which is not

22   an investigation by the employer.

23                 MR. SCHNAPPER:         I think the words under this

24   title are elastic enough to support either meaning.                     The

25   context of the statute and the way this Court has


                                        54
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   repeatedly construed it give meaning to it.                     In response

 2   to the concern that the Chief Justice raised, Faragher

 3   and Ellerth are not the only decisions that provide an

 4   incentive for these investigations.                     The Court's

 5   decision in Kolstad makes the existence of this sort of

 6   process essential to avoid awards of punitive damages.

 7   So even in non-harassment cases that same incentive has

 8   been created by the courts.

 9               In a situation involving harassment, the

10   contours of the investigation are fact largely shaped by

11   Federal law, not only policy guidance which the EEOC has

12   issued helping employers figure out what to do, but a

13   large and growing body of case law under Faragher and

14   Ellerth elucidating what those requirements are.

15   Particularly importantly here, the victims of sexual

16   harassment are virtually required by the court to use

17   these processes.   Ms. Crawford had to speak up at some

18   point or she had had no claim.

19               And last, as a practical matter, if sexual

20   harassment is going to be stopped, it's mostly going to

21   happen through these internal processes.                    By the time

22   most of these controversies about sexual harassment get

23   to the EEOC or the courts, the victims have left their

24   jobs.   In this Court's decision in Pollard, the

25   individual had been fired.          In Souter she had been


                                       55
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   driven from her job.     In Faragher and Ellerth and

 2   Harris, those had quit.       If you look at the array of

 3   lower court decisions involving sexual harassment, by

 4   the time a case gets to the Commission in most of those

 5   cases the victim has give up and left.

 6              So it's exceptionally important that these

 7   processes be effective and evenhanded.

 8              No further questions.

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

10   The case is submitted.
