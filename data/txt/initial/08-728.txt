 6               ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK K. STANCIL

 7                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8               MR. STANCIL:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10               Pretrial motion preparation time is not

11   automatically excluded under Section 3161(h)(1) of the

12   Speedy Trial Act.     Such delays are subject to exclusion

13   only on a case-by-case basis under (h)(7).

14               I would like to focus today on three

15   features of the statutory text that make that abundantly

16   clear.   First and foremost, when crafting (h)(1)

17   Congress specifically addressed pretrial motion delays

18   and precisely defined that exclusion.                    Subparagraph (D)

19   declares that the exclusion shall begin with the filing

20   of the motion and end with the hearing on or other

21   prompt disposition of the motion.

22               Reading the general language in (h)(1) to

23   encompass preparation time would circumvent the

24   deliberate legislative choice to limit the pretrial

25   motion exclusion.

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           That would allow the

 2   prosecutor's time to be excluded, right?                     On your theory

 3   that it starts -- the trigger is the filing of the

 4   motion, and it ends when the motion is disposed of.                        So

 5   the prosecutor might say, I need additional time, and

 6   that would be included in the suspension period, right?

 7                 MR. STANCIL:       Yes, Your Honor.              The

 8   government's motions and the defense motions are treated

 9   equally under (h)(1), which is why the government's rule

10   to treat defense motions, or defense requests for

11   additional time differently --

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But I'm --

13                 MR. STANCIL:       The exclusion -- I'm sorry,

14   Your Honor.

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Yes.

16                 MR. STANCIL:       The exclusion begins with the

17   filing of the motion, be it the defense motion or the

18   government's motion.      That is clear on the text, the

19   face of the text of the statute, which --

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But the clock -- the

21   clock would run, on your theory, during the preparation

22   time of the defendant.        It would not run during the

23   preparation time of the prosecutor.                     So I don't think

24   they are being treated the same.

25                 MR. STANCIL:       No, Your Honor, that is not

 1   our position.     The clock runs up until the moment of

 2   filing.

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Right.

 4                 MR. STANCIL:        Whether it is a defense motion

 5   or a government motion.         So --

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            No, no.       I'm talking

 7   about the prosecutor's answer to the defense motion.

 8                 MR. STANCIL:        Oh, yes, Your Honor.           Their

 9   response to the motion, it is tolled -- or the clock

10   stops during the preparation of the response by either

11   side.   And that was a deliberate legislative choice by

12   Congress.     It says -- on the face of (h)(1), it says the

13   clock stops at filing and remains stopped through the

14   conclusion of the hearing or other prompt disposition of

15   the motion.

16                 That was an express choice by Congress.                  It

17   was not lost on them that a response time would be

18   treated differently.       And the government's suggestion

19   that that, therefore, means we should factor back in

20   preparation time is --

21                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Shouldn't we be

22   looking --

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            One point that I would

24   like you to clarify.       I -- I understand you to take the

25   position that the interest of justice would be the route


                                         5

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to take, where the judge would have to stop and make a

 2   finding.   In your view, would it be appropriate,

 3   assuming your interpretation of (B)(i) holds, for us to

 4   send the case back, or is it too late, because the

 5   interest of justice finding was never made?

 6               MR. STANCIL:        It is too late because this

 7   Court answered that question -- that very question in

 8   Zedner and held that an (h)(7) ends of justice finding

 9   cannot be supplied retrospectively on remand.             That was

10   the precise question put to this Court and it was

11   rejected by the Court unanimously.

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But you think it could be

13   found.   If it doesn't have to be found on the spot by

14   the judge, when is the latest time the judge could make

15   the interest of justice filing?

16               MR. STANCIL:        Zedner says that as long as it

17   is made -- or the latest it could be made is the time by

18   which the district court rules on the motion to dismiss

19   on speedy trial -- on speedy trial grounds.            So it can

20   be made in the district court up until the time the

21   district court decides the speedy trial motion.             It does

22   not -- at least it is left open in Zedner.

23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So the result in your

24   case would be that the case is dismissed, period.

25               MR. STANCIL:        Yes, Your Honor.       It would be


                                       6

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   -- it would be remanded with instructions to dismiss.

 2   However, the district court -- it remains for the

 3   district court to determine whether to dismiss with or

 4   without prejudice according to the factors specified in

 5   the act.

 6              JUSTICE ALITO:          Is it clear that a period of

 7   time attributable to a defense request for time to

 8   prepare pretrial motions can fall within (h)(7)?

 9   Because (h)(7) speaks of a continuance.               Isn't that a

10   very -- wouldn't that be a very odd use of the word

11   "continuance"?

12              If you make an application to a judge for

13   time, additional time to prepare pretrial motions, do

14   you say, "I want a continuance of the date on which my

15   pretrial motions are due"?

16              MR. STANCIL:        I think that's not an unusual

17   reading of the term "continuance," yes, Your Honor.                 I

18   think they frequently -- trial counsel will frequently

19   ask for a continuance of the date.               But what I think

20   both parties agree is that that is how the courts almost

21   universally interpret (h)(7), that any time that is

22   excluded, even if it doesn't result in the moving of the

23   trial date per se, is treated as an (h)(7) exclusion.

24              JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, there's -- but the

25   courts of appeals have almost universally read


                                      7

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   (h)(1)(D), or overwhelmingly read (h)(1)(D) to apply in

 2   this situation as well.

 3              I'm sorry.        Not (h)(1)(D), but the

 4   introductory phrase.

 5              MR. STANCIL:         Yes, Your Honor, but this rule

 6   wasn't confined to pretrial motions.                   So even in those

 7   jurisdictions that follow the majority position at issue

 8   here, also to my understanding use (h)(7) to exclude

 9   intermediate delays before trial.                In fact, in the

10   government's brief, the government acknowledges that

11   courts treat pretrial motion delays under either (h)(1)

12   or (h)(7), and more specifically (h)7)(B)(iv), which

13   specifically speaks in terms of preparation.                  And in

14   fact, that's still further evidence that Congress

15   specifically contemplated that preparation time would go

16   under (h)(7).   Both (h)(7)(B)(ii) and (h)(7)(B)(iv)

17   specifically direct district courts to consider the need

18   for additional time for adequate or effective

19   preparation.

20              And Justice Alito, back to your concern

21   specifically with motions.          (B)(ii) specifically refers

22   to pretrial proceedings.        So I think there, in that

23   sense, there is evidence that Congress didn't think that

24   a continuance under (h)(7) would refer only to a

25   continuance of the trial date.             At least, that's --


                                       8

 1   that's my understanding.

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Counsel, at the time

 3   that (h)(1)(C) -- or (D) was being looked at, wasn't it

 4   a fact that some circuits had reviewed the prior

 5   exclusion as applying only to the date in which there

 6   were actual hearings before the court?

 7                MR. STANCIL:       Yes, Your Honor.

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            So isn't it -- shouldn't

 9   we be looking at what you did with respect to this time

10   period in light of the need that it was addressing?

11                MR. STANCIL:       Yes, Your Honor.       And the

12   Court -- and Congress did decide to expand or clarify

13   the end point and beginning point of the (h)(1)(D)

14   exclusion.

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Well, what's wrong with

16   the logic of district courts who have ruled in this --

17   in the government's favor, that say Congress was only

18   looking at that particular part of the proceeding --

19   what related to the hearing, the filing of the motion,

20   its actual adjudication -- but they weren't considering

21   a motion by the defendant for time to investigate, and

22   that can be another proceeding?

23                Can you imagine a situation in which a court

24   grants that adjournment to a defense attorney where we

25   would reverse that finding by the court?

 1                 MR. STANCIL:        I'm sorry, Your Honor?

 2   Reverse --

 3                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But -- it would seem to

 4   me that if a defense attorney comes to a court and says,

 5   I need an adjournment, and the Court says, you can have

 6   it, isn't that implicitly a proceeding in which the

 7   court is saying there is a need for this?

 8                 MR. STANCIL:        Not in a speedy trial context,

 9   Your Honor, for two reasons.              First, it is not a

10   proceeding.    There is no pretrial proceeding until the

11   motion is filed.    That is -- that is the definition of a

12   pretrial motion proceeding.             It is a formal initiation

13   before the district court.

14                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             "Proceeding" doesn't

15   mean an act -- it is an act before the court.                     The

16   entire action is before the court.                  But it is a

17   proceeding in which the defense attorney is looking at

18   whether there's anything to file motions about.

19                 MR. STANCIL:        If that were correct, Your

20   Honor, then preparing your witnesses is a proceeding

21   respecting trial.     I think that takes "proceeding" and

22   expands it so that everything would be excludable delay.

23                 But if -- if I may return to your original

24   question, Congress did look at preparation time when

25   drafting (h)(1) and (h)(1)B) specifically --

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Well, the Senate did.

 2              MR. STANCIL:         Pardon me.             Yes, the Senate

 3   Judiciary Committee specifically considered a proposal

 4   by the government no less to include preparation time,

 5   and the committee rejected that proposal as

 6   unreasonable.   I think this is simply not a case in

 7   which we are left to guess whether preparation time was

 8   on the table.   It was on the table and it was declared

 9   unreasonable to suggest that it would be within the

10   automatic exclusion.

11              Moreover, I think that makes abundant sense.

12   It is not the case that simply asking for more time

13   necessarily means that you have some prejudice in the

14   speedy trial context, or even that the trial date

15   necessarily would move.       In this case, the counsel

16   requested the extension for pretrial motions.                  That

17   extension was granted.       The trial date held.             It wasn't

18   moved until much later, under an (h)(7) exclusion on

19   unrelated grounds.     So I think it's a -- I think it's a

20   false -- a red herring, if you will, for the government

21   to suggest that when the defendant asks for something,

22   it's necessarily -- it ought to be granted, fair enough,

23   but that it's necessarily going to prejudice the speedy

24   trial calculation.

25              With respect, I don't think that's the case.

 1   I think ordinarily, these things will come very early in

 2   the speedy trial -- speedy trial clock, and there will

 3   be relatively brief delays.           And so I think it's quite

 4   reasonable to think that district courts could be

 5   allowed to give more flexible preparation time to decide

 6   whether to file, what to file, and then the exclusion

 7   starts with the filing.       And I think Congress has made

 8   that abundantly clear in -- on the text of the statute.

 9                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           That would certainly

10   encourage judges who don't want to get involved with

11   making findings, which you have to do to satisfy

12   interest of justice, to just say:                Motion denied; I'm

13   sorry, I'm not going to let you have the clock run while

14   you -- you are asking me for a favor.                    You want time to

15   prepare, and the clock is going to run in the meantime.

16   Forget it.   You are not going to get the extension.

17                MR. STANCIL:       I disagree, Your Honor.

18                First, I think courts will granted them when

19   necessary.   Again because it is early in the clock,

20   there won't necessarily be speedy trial -- some sort of

21   speedy prejudice to the government.                    But moreover, all

22   this means is that the court needs to put findings on

23   the record to say this is preparation time that is

24   legitimately needed, the defendant's interests here

25   outweigh the public's interest, and so I'm going to

 1   grant that and I'm going to put those findings on the

 2   record.   And I think it's clear from the statute that

 3   that's how Congress anticipated this would work.               But

 4   I --

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           What must the judge --

 6   the judge must make a finding orally or in writing.                  Can

 7   it just say, okay, I'm giving it to you in the interest

 8   of justice?

 9                 MR. STANCIL:       I think -- I don't believe

10   that precise question has come to the Court.               But courts

11   are very permissive in terms of how much needs to be put

12   on the record, and it's my understanding that this

13   happens quite literally every day in scores of contexts

14   where courts, as long as they make the finding, it is

15   reviewed for an abuse of discretion only and that's

16   sufficient.

17                 JUSTICE ALITO:         So the rule that you are

18   arguing for really will accomplish nothing, other than

19   to benefit a small set of defendants who -- who got

20   pretrial preparation time in reliance on court of

21   appeals decisions saying that those could be done

22   without making explicit ends of justice findings on the

23   record?

24                 MR. STANCIL:       No, Your Honor.        If we are

25   correct, the decision will have significant effect on


                                       13

 1   the public's interest.        In fact, an individual defendant

 2   has very little to gain from such gamesmanship as the

 3   government suggests would be at issue.                  What you get is

 4   a dismissal of your indictment with or without

 5   prejudice, and there are no statute of limitations

 6   problems --

 7                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, how is the public

 8   going to benefit if all the judge needs -- presumably,

 9   district judges are not granting these extensions of

10   time in situations in which they do not think that the

11   ends of justice are served by granting the extension of

12   time.

13                 So what is going to be served by requiring

14   them to recite this -- to make this rote recitation on

15   the record?

16                 MR. STANCIL:       First, Your Honor, it's not

17   rote.   It specifies four factors that they have to

18   consider, including and before, it says, whether its

19   time -- the time is necessary for effective preparation,

20   taking into account the exercise of due diligence.

21                 What this -- what putting this under (h)(7)

22   and making that process required will do is weed out the

23   very worst sorts of delays where counsel, even for the

24   defendant or the government, comes in and asks for the

25   delay without the exercise of due diligence and without


                                       14
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   any showing that this is actually necessary.              And I

 2   think that's exactly what Congress was doing by not

 3   putting this under the automatic exclusion in (h)(1).

 4                 If it's automatically excluded, and there is

 5   additional time granted for no reason whatsoever or for

 6   something that wouldn't meet the due diligence standard

 7   in (B)(iv), the speedy trial clock is effectively

 8   lengthened automatically.

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Could you tell me how it

10   works in district courts?          This district court set

11   September 13 originally for the -- for the motion.                Do

12   the district courts generally have a custom schedule for

13   every case where they set times or do they have local

14   rules on the subject?

15                 MR. STANCIL:       With respect to pretrial

16   motions specifically?

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.

18                 MR. STANCIL:       It varies widely from district

19   to district.    For example, in some districts the default

20   is 21 days.    So, if you try a case in Chicago, you go to

21   arraignment, your pretrial motions, unless set by a

22   different rule, are due in 21 --

23                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And that's -- that's part

24   of -- that there in the local rule of court?

25                 MR. STANCIL:       Yes, Your Honor.       In D.C., it


                                       15
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   is 11 days.    In many other jurisdictions and here, there

 2   is no set time limit.

 3                 And one of the problems -- one of the

 4   fundamental problems with the government's rule that a

 5   request -- a defense request for additional time must be

 6   treated differently and does stop the clock, is that

 7   gives speedy trial consequences to those variations in

 8   local rules.    So, in districts where you have a very

 9   short standard timeframe, the defendant has to run in,

10   if he wants to file pretrial motions, and stop the clock

11   almost automatically.       If you have -- say, your motions

12   are due automatically in seven days; you have got to run

13   in there and stop the clock.

14                 As a practical matter, the speedy trial, the

15   70 days, it's that much longer in those districts

16   because you have got to stop the clock compared to

17   districts where, say, 21 days are ordinarily allotted.

18   Well, they may not have to stop the clock.              It's clear

19   that Congress did not --

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But I'm -- I'm not sure

21   that that isn't -- that that argument doesn't cut both

22   ways.

23                 MR. STANCIL:       I'm sorry, Your Honor?

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I'm not sure if that -- if

25   you have a district where you have five days, a very


                                       16
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   short period and almost nobody can comply with it, then

 2   maybe that's an argument for the government's rule.

 3              MR. STANCIL:         I disagree, Your Honor.           I

 4   think that illustrates the problem, because if there is

 5   a -- call it an unreasonably short time period in this

 6   district, the speedy trial clock only burns for four or

 7   five days or a week, and then someone is going to have

 8   to run in and stop it.       So those trials are just going

 9   to take longer.

10              Let's assume that it takes two weeks on

11   average or three weeks on average to prepare a

12   reasonable pretrial motion.           Well, in those

13   jurisdictions that have that local rule, the short local

14   rule, you get two extra weeks on the speedy trial clock,

15   because you have to run in and hit stop on the clock by

16   asking for additional time.

17              In those districts that give you 21 days by

18   default, by contrast, that whole 21 days counts against

19   the 70 days.   And that is, I think -- I think that is an

20   essential judgment that Congress made.                 It decided on 70

21   days --

22              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, I think an

23   assumption in your mathematical analysis is that there

24   will be a difference in the time that it takes to

25   dispose of the motion.       If the time to dispose of the


                                      17
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   motion is the same, then you are wrong, I think.            I will

 2   work it out.

 3               MR. STANCIL:        I don't believe so, Your

 4   Honor.   If you assume hypothetically 21 days to prepare

 5   --

 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Right.

 7               MR. STANCIL:        -- 21 days to respond and call

 8   it 21 days to rule --

 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Right.

10               MR. STANCIL:        -- in a district that allows

11   21 days of preparation time by default rule, 21 days

12   will burn and then 42 days with response and ruling.

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Right.

14               MR. STANCIL:        In a district that allows only

15   five days, five days burn, and then you have to stop the

16   clock for the additional 16 days of preparation, plus

17   21, plus 21.   You end up effectively, if the difference

18   is 5 days or 21 days, there is an 86-day speedy trial

19   clock in the district with the short rule and a 70-day

20   speedy trial clock in the district with the local

21   rule -- with the 21-day rule.

22               And so I think it's -- and it's clear that

23   what Congress did not want in the Speedy Trial Act was

24   these time periods to be amended by local rule

25   effectively.   And that's what would happen.           I think


                                      18

 1   more fundamentally --

 2                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Where does that show,

 3   because the disposition time isn't going to be the same

 4   from district to district?            Districts vary.

 5                 MR. STANCIL:        That's correct.

 6                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Congress could have

 7   required, as they have in some instances, to have a

 8   judge decide a matter within a certain period of time.

 9   They didn't do that, did they?

10                 MR. STANCIL:        That's not correct, Your

11   Honor.     In subparagraph (H), 3161(h)(1)(H) allows only

12   30 days during which a matter is actively under --

13   actually under advisement by the district court.                 So

14   here they actual did set a 30-day clock on which to

15   rule.

16                 There is an exception to that.               If there is

17   a hearing subparagraph (D) says, well, you know, we are

18   not going to govern the time in the hearing, and this

19   Court's in Henderson gives district courts flexibility

20   in that regard, when there is a hearing.                 But Congress

21   was pretty clear in trying to put a book end at either

22   end.     It starts on filing and it ends with disposition,

23   and we only give you 30 days without a hearing or after

24   the hearing to dispose of it.

25                 And I think more fundamentally this is a


                                        19
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   quintessentially legislative judgment.                   Congress said,

 2   this is a system of rules that we need in place to move

 3   cases more expeditiously toward trial.                   We are going to

 4   give you 70 days.     We are going to exclude certain

 5   things automatically, and we are going to give district

 6   courts flexibility under (h)(7).

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Could a district

 8   judge, as part of his normal pretrial order, say that I

 9   am inclined to grant normal motions for extensions, but

10   I think so we don't run into these problems that it's in

11   the best interest of justice that whatever time I grant,

12   I issue an order covered by (h)(7)(A)?                   That avoids all

13   this problem.   I don't have to worry about the Speedy

14   Trial Act when I grant you a motion, because whatever I

15   grant you is going to be excluded under (h)(7)(A).

16               MR. STANCIL:          I don't -- that sounds a lot

17   like a prospective waiver of speedy trial, which is --

18   this court rejected in Zedner.               If I understand the

19   hypothetical correctly, if the district court says if I

20   give you extra time, we are not going to complain about

21   it later.   I don't think that the court could do that,

22   and I don't think that would be consistent --

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But presumably, a

24   judge can do it in every case.               You are saying they

25   can't tell you in advance this is what they are going to

 1   do, but they can do it automatically in every case?

 2                MR. STANCIL:        I don't believe so, Your

 3   Honor.   I think, if I understand the hypothetical

 4   correctly, if a -- if we appear before the district

 5   judge and the judge says exclusions or extensions for

 6   pretrial motions will qualify for (h)(7), that sounds

 7   like to me in an individual case a prospective waiver of

 8   that defendant's Speedy Trial Act --

 9                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Wait a minute.     If a

10   defense attorney comes in to you and says -- I'm a

11   district court judge -- I need time to prepare; granted,

12   I am excluding time under (7)(A).                 You are saying that

13   is insufficient?

14                MR. STANCIL:        No, Your Honor.          If it's done

15   on a case-by-case basis, where the time is requested and

16   the continuance or the delay is granted with the (h)(7)

17   findings made either then or later, that would be

18   perfectly appropriate.        That's how Congress --

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But it's not okay for a

20   district court to say, you tell me how much or you have

21   21 days to prepare motions and I'm excluding time

22   because of that?

23                MR. STANCIL:        No.      I'm not sure I -- I

24   apologize.   I'm not sure I under --

 1   district court judge:       Defendant is arraigned; you have

 2   21 days to file motions.

 3               MR. STANCIL:        Yes, Your Honor.              That is --

 4   that time is not excluded if it is just set by local

 5   rule.

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Could you finish

 7   answering one earlier question.              You said that there is

 8   no statute of limitations problems if we rule in your

 9   favor.   Could you explain why?

10               MR. STANCIL:        Yes.       Under 18 U.S.C., I

11   believe it's 3288 and 3289, essentially gives the

12   government six months after the dismissal of an

13   indictment to reindict a defendant.                    And courts have

14   almost universally held that that applies -- or I

15   believe it's universally held that that applies where

16   the dismissal is based on Speedy Trial Act grounds.                      I

17   think we are in agreement with the government that there

18   is not a statute of limitations problem.

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Could under that retrial

20   provision the court begin excluding time?

21               MR. STANCIL:        The speedy trial clock starts

22   anew after a new --

23               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             That's what I mean.

24               MR. STANCIL:        Yes, Your Honor.              That is

25   clear under the statute.

 1              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Do you have any idea how

 2   many convictions would be at risk for reversal under

 3   this rule, that would be currently pending and subject

 4   to a ruling in your favor now?

 5              MR. STANCIL:        I don't know.          My supposition

 6   is that it's not very many.          The government certainly

 7   hasn't suggested that there are a lot.                It would have to

 8   be cases within those eight districts or -- pardon me --

 9   I guess it would be nine or ten, that have either not

10   taken a position or take the government's position, in

11   which the defendant raised this argument in the trial

12   court --

13              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             In a timely manner.

14              MR. STANCIL:        -- in a timely manner.          So I

15   think if that is the case, it's an exceedingly small

16   number, and for that matter, that would be a problem in

17   any case in which this Court reverses an incorrect

18   ruling.

19              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is -- is there any

20   indication in the circuits that follow what seems to be

21   the majority rule -- that is that the clock is stopped

22   during preparation time -- that there have been

23   excessive delays, in comparison to the -- what is it,

24   two circuits who go the other way?

25              MR. STANCIL:        Not that I am aware of, Your

 1   Honor, but nor has there been any indication that

 2   district courts in the two jurisdiction where they get

 3   the rule right in our view deny defense requests for

 4   additional time.

 5              I think -- I think this rule will matter if

 6   you assume that the average pretrial motion extension is

 7   relatively modest and that the lawyers are fairly

 8   reasonable in what they request.                We are talking about,

 9   you know, additional delays of a week or two weeks, but

10   that is -- again, that backs right up into the

11   congressional judgment, the legislative judgment that

12   Congress made.

13              And so those trials will on average in the

14   majority of jurisdictions, I think, just take that much

15   longer to get to trial.

16              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, what is your

17   systemic concern with the -- with the government's rule?

18   The judge has to grant the continuance under either --

19   under either of your rules, and you say he has to make a

20   finding that it's good.        But are you concerned the

21   continuance would be because the attorney wants to play

22   golf or take a vacation with his kids, and that that's

23   not the cause?

24              MR. STANCIL:          Well, that --

25              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Is that's what's driving

 1   your concern?

 2              MR. STANCIL:        Well, that would be -- that is

 3   the most important function of (h)(7), to screen out the

 4   truly unmeritorious delays.          That's what Congress wanted

 5   to get at most of all.

 6              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But wouldn't judges in

 7   many cases do that anyway just in the course of deciding

 8   whether to grant a continuance?

 9              MR. STANCIL:        The court may --

10              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Give -- give me the

11   consequences of ruling for the government that you see

12   that are adverse in your view.

13              MR. STANCIL:        The consequence -- ruling for

14   the government would mean that any time a defendant

15   needs any extra time, or -- or we would say either side

16   needs any extra time, the clock stops.                And so any time

17   you need additional time for pretrial motions there is

18   no balancing.

19              So in the routine case that is not complex,

20   where the -- where the defendant's counsel may be just

21   simply not exercising due diligence, you could ask for

22   two weeks and there is no -- there is no balancing.                 The

23   district court doesn't even have to ask, what's the

24   delay, you know, why the extra delay?                 And that time is

25   automatically excluded.

 1              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               But that's my point.

 2              MR. STANCIL:           Yes.

 3              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               I assume the district

 4   judge will ask.     Or is --

 5              MR. STANCIL:           In the absence --

 6              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Or do you doubt that?

 7              MR. STANCIL:           I am sure it will vary from

 8   court to court.     But in the absence of (h)(7) and

 9   putting it on the record, the district court is

10   certainly not required to ask and may not -- certainly

11   won't put those findings on the record.                  And I think

12   this Court made that point very clear in Zedner, that

13   (h)(7) balances substantive open-endedness with

14   procedural strictness, and the procedure is what

15   matters, and Congress made that explicitly clear in

16   drafting (h)(7).

17              If I may, I would like to reserve the

18   remainder of my time for rebuttal.

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

20              Mr. Roberts.

21             ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

22                 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

23              MR. ROBERTS:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

24   please the Court:

25              Additional time granted for preparation of


                                        26

 1   pretrial motions is automatically excluded from the

 2   Speedy Trial Act deadline for commencing trial.                   For

 3   three reasons, that time falls under section 3161(h)(1)

 4   which excludes delay resulting from other proceedings

 5   concerning the defendant.

 6              First, Section (h)(1) excludes delay

 7   resulting from various listed proceedings and other

 8   proceedings that are analogous or ancillary to those

 9   proceedings.   A court's grant of additional motions

10   preparation time is ancillary to pretrial motions

11   themselves, which are a listed proceeding.                It

12   facilitates the motions because adequate time to prepare

13   them is critical to their fair and accurate resolution.

14   The exclusion is similar to other excludable delays that

15   result from proceedings ancillary to listed proceedings.

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Could I ask a

17   specific date question?       Am I right that you would

18   exclude the time from September 7th to October 4th?

19              MR. ROBERTS:         Yes, the time from

20   September 7th to October 4th.

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, that

22   doesn't -- I'm not sure that makes much sense.                 Before

23   the motion for extension was filed, the hearing date for

24   pretrial motions was September 20.                After the extension

25   was filed and granted, the hearing date was October 4th.


                                      27

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   So the only period of delay that you could say resulted

 2   from the extension was from September 20 to October 4,

 3   or 13 days.

 4                 Well, how can you possibly count the time as

 5   a delay after he filed his extension up to the point

 6   when things would have been due anyway?

 7                 MR. ROBERTS:       Well, the delay is just the

 8   time that's being used for preparation, which was

 9   presumably the time all the way up to the period at

10   which the waiver of the intent to file motions was

11   filed.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, but how is

13   that a -- how is the time being spent for preparation a

14   delay, when some of that time was going to be allowed

15   anyway?

16                 MR. ROBERTS:       Well, I think the act --

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               In other words, the

18   motions were not due until September 25th.                 So I don't

19   see how the time he spent before then can be regarded as

20   a delay.

21                 MR. ROBERTS:       Well, that's -- that's a

22   result of the fact that the act doesn't exclude the time

23   before a routine deadline for filing the motion, because

24   it only excludes the time -- the delay resulting from an

25   individualized proceeding.           But it makes sense not to


                                       28
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   exclude the -- the time before the routine deadline as a

 2   general matter, because if you excluded all that time,

 3   then you -- the result would be that the basic deadline

 4   of the act would be extended and time would be excluded

 5   in cases where no time was being used for consideration

 6   or preparation of pretrial motions.                   But once you

 7   know --

 8              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What is the -- what

 9   is the proceeding from which you count in determining

10   what should be excluded?

11              MR. ROBERTS:        The time running from the

12   order of the district court granting additional time.

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Okay, that order --

14   that proceeding was initiated and ruled on the same day.

15   The person comes in and says:           I would like time.           The

16   judge that same day says yes.

17              MR. ROBERTS:        There were --

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That proceeding

19   takes a day.

20              MR. ROBERTS:        The request -- the request for

21   time, that proceeding was done.             But the order -- the

22   order granting additional time is a proceeding, and the

23   additional time that --

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                The additional time

25   flowing from the order is a proceeding?

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              MR. ROBERTS:        The order -- an order is a

 2   step in the case, an act of the court --

 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Right.

 4              MR. ROBERTS:        -- and it's a proceeding.

 5              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Right.

 6              MR. ROBERTS:        And it's --

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And that's one day.

 8              MR. ROBERTS:        Yes, but it's the delay

 9   resulting from the order that we are talking about.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Ah.   Now that -- now

11   -- now I don't see how that's consistent with the other

12   provisions of the act.      If you take (h)(1)(A), that

13   excludes delay resulting from any proceeding to

14   determine mental competency.           Okay?

15              MR. ROBERTS:        Yes.

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And under your

17   theory that would include the time from the filing of

18   that motion to the end of the determination of mental

19   competency, right?

20              MR. ROBERTS:        I think courts have excluded

21   from the filing of a motion seeking an examination, yes.

22   You could also, that would probably be excluded under

23   (h)(1)(D) --

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Ah.   Well -- yes.

25   Well, or -- yes ---no, I'm looking at (h)(4).                 Now


                                     30
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   (h)(4) excludes any period of delay resulting from the

 2   fact that the defendant is -- is mentally incompetent.

 3                MR. ROBERTS:       Right.

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               It seems to me

 5   redundant if you exclude the delay from the examination

 6   and then also exclude mental incompetence.

 7                MR. ROBERTS:       I don't think so, Your Honor,

 8   because the delay resulting from the examination would

 9   -- would be excluded from the order granting the

10   examination until the examination was complete.                 And

11   then there would be a determination of competence or

12   incompetence.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               All right.   Well,

14   let's look at (h)(1)(G).        That excludes delay resulting

15   from consideration by the court of a proposed plea

16   agreement.   But then (h)(2) says any period of delay in

17   which prosecution is deferred pursuant to a written --

18   written agreement with the defendant, for the purpose of

19   allowing the defendant to demonstrate his good conduct,

20   which sounds an awful lot like a plea agreement to me.

21                MR. ROBERTS:       I don't -- I think that

22   that's -- that that's a different -- a different

23   deferral, Your Honor.      It's not for the court's

24   consideration of a plea agreement or even for

25   negotiations.   It's saying we're going to take time out


                                      31
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   so that the defendant can demonstrate his -- his good

 2   conduct.

 3                I think that the plea agreement provision is

 4   once the parties have proposed an agreement to the

 5   court, the court has time to consider whether it should

 6   approve that and that time's excluded.                  And in fact

 7   courts have excluded the time that the parties are

 8   engaged in plea negotiations as ancillary to that

 9   provision of consideration of the proposed plea

10   agreement.

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                If I disagree with

12   you that, when the time that is extended before a

13   hearing on the pretrial motions and the acceptance of a

14   waiver, which runs from 13 days, September 20, the

15   original date, and the date that it actually took place,

16   which is 13 days, and if I think, contrary to your

17   submission, which is that the whole time from the filing

18   of the extension to the final hearing is delay, even

19   though it was only 13 days that was pushed back, then

20   you lose, right?

21                MR. ROBERTS:        I'm not sure.          If you think

22   that the -- that there's delay that results from the

23   grant of the extension, I don't think that the

24   Petitioners ever challenged the length of the delay that

25   was excluded, so the only issue that's before the Court


                                       32
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   is whether that delay is excluded.

 2              I don't know that the Petitioners preserved

 3   any argument about the length of the delay, Your Honor.

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Putting aside what

 5   Petitioners may or may not have argued, if I think that

 6   the delay is only how far the date for consideration of

 7   a motion and acting on the motion has been moved -- in

 8   this case, from September 20 to October 4; in other

 9   words, it's 13 days, not 28 days -- then you lose,

10   right?

11              MR. ROBERTS:        I'm not sure that we lose.             I

12   have to confess that I haven't calculated the -- the

13   exact amount of time that that results.                In any case,

14   there are other periods of delays --

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I guess it

16   would be, take 15 days from what time you have

17   calculated, and that's -- that's under the wire -- or is

18   it above the wire?

19              MR. ROBERTS:        Yeah.        I'm sorry, Your Honor.

20              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 In other words, I am

21   contesting 15 of your days, and you figured out how much

22   days you think can be excluded or not excluded.

23              MR. ROBERTS:        Right.         I guess I would say,

24   if there was some question about the length of delay,

25   the appropriate thing would be to -- to rule for us on


                                     33
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the issue that's before the Court, remand to the courts

 2   below, allow them to decide whether the Petitioners

 3   preserved the question about the length of delay and

 4   what the effect is on a rule that would only limit the

 5   additional delay.

 6               You know, we also have other arguments for

 7   the fact that we think that, even if this time isn't

 8   excluded, that, based on -- based on the additional

 9   preparation time, that there's still no Speedy Trial Act

10   here, that we raised in the -- in the brief of -- in

11   opposition, and we would think that that should be taken

12   into account on any remand like that as well.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              What was -- what was the

14   second point you just made, Mr. Roberts?                 That, even if

15   the clock is running, you would still have an argument

16   that you come within the 70 days because?

17               MR. ROBERTS:          Because the -- on

18   September 25th, Petitioner filed a notice of intent to

19   waive pretrial motions, and then there was a hearing on

20   that on the 4th, and so that filing would be analogous

21   to a motion or a motion that would trigger it's own

22   delay, that it would trigger it's own exclusion of time

23   even if the time starting on September 7th was not

24   excluded.

25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Just for my -- just for my


                                        34
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   information, what's a motion to -- to waive?          I mean,

 2   why does he need permission to waive?

 3               MR. ROBERTS:       The -- the court had

 4   originally said -- the court had originally provided in

 5   its order that on the deadline for filing motions the --

 6   the Petitioner should either file the motions or

 7   indicate whether he wanted to waive the motions and then

 8   set a hearing on either one, on the 4th, and that's what

 9   happened.

10               After he filed that paper on the 4th, the

11   court held a hearing, and the defendant -- discussed

12   with the defendant personally whether he wanted to waive

13   his right to file motions.

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I see.

15               MR. ROBERTS:       And the defendant waived his

16   right to file motions, which had a consequence, you

17   know, in the case.

18               The second reason that the additional time

19   granted for preparation of pretrial motions is

20   automatically excluded is that the exclusion in Section

21   (h)(1)(D) for delay resulting from pretrial motions

22   themselves excludes the time that a court grants the

23   non-moving party to prepare a response.

24               And, as Justice Ginsburg, in her questions

25   suggested, it would make little sense automatically to


                                     35
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   exclude time granted to respond to motions, but not the

 2   time granted for the specific purpose of preparing them.

 3              In fact, this Court employed similar

 4   reasoning to that in the Henderson case when it held

 5   that the Act excludes the time after a court has held a

 6   hearing on a motion while the court's awaiting further

 7   written submissions.

 8              The Court reasoned that it would make no

 9   sense not to exclude that time because the act excludes

10   all the time before the hearing, as well as 30 days

11   after a motion's taken under advisement; and likewise it

12   would make no sense not to exclude time that is

13   specifically granted to prepare motions when the Court

14   excludes the time granted to respond to them.

15              Third --

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Except for the -- for the

17   language, which -- which says that you -- you time it

18   from the beginning of the time granted.

19              MR. ROBERTS:           Well, section -- Section

20   (h)(1), Your Honor, expressly states that it excludes

21   delays, including, but not limited, to the listed

22   delays, so no negative inference arises from the fact

23   that the listed examples don't specifically address

24   delays resulting from the grant of additional motions

25   preparation time.

 1                 Section (h)(1)(D) is addressing a related,

 2   but different delay, the delay from the pretrial motion

 3   itself.

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Well, what's the effect of

 5   that language then?      Why didn't (D) just read "delay

 6   resulting from any pretrial motion"?

 7                 MR. ROBERTS:       Because Congress specifically

 8   amended it in 1979, in response to previous

 9   interpretations by some courts that had excluded only

10   the time that was spent in actual court hearings, and

11   the language makes clear that all the time from the

12   filing of the motion through the hearings, including

13   the -- not just the Court hearing time -- is excluded,

14   and it -- the language continues to -- to make that

15   clear, even if preparation time is also sometimes

16   excluded.

17                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Counsel, do you disagree

18   with your adversary, that there is no statute of

19   limitations problem if we rule against you?

20                 MR. ROBERTS:       No.      I don't think that there

21   are statute of limitations problems, Your Honor, but

22   requiring judges to make superfluous ends of justice

23   findings --

24                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            But is it superfluous?

25   Because what your adversary is saying is that Congress

 1   wanted district courts to think about why some things

 2   were being -- additional time was being requested.               Not

 3   all motions by defendants would a district court

 4   actually feel were warranted and might say to that

 5   individual if they came in:           Look; that shouldn't take

 6   you three weeks; that should only take you a week.

 7               MR. ROBERTS:        Well, a court should always be

 8   doing that in considering whether to grant additional

 9   time that's requested, Your Honor.                Neither the

10   defendant nor the public is going to have an interest in

11   rushing to trial without adequate time to prepare --

12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But that doesn't answer

13   my point.   Without a requirement that the judge actually

14   has to make a finding in the interest of justice, once

15   the defense attorney comes in and says, I want a month,

16   and isn't the judge required to give him the month

17   because it's automatically excludable?

18               What, otherwise, forces the judge to look at

19   the request and say, no; is it really in the interest of

20   justice for me to give you that month?"

21               MR. ROBERTS:        The -- the judge doesn't have

22   to give him the additional time.               Presumably, the judge

23   should only give him the -- the additional time if more

24   time is needed to prepare the -- the motions, based on

25   the justification that the defendant --

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              So what -- so what

 2   additional requirements are we imposing on the judge

 3   that the statute itself doesn't command?

 4                MR. ROBERTS:         Well, what --

 5                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              If the judge always has

 6   to listen to the reason, weigh it, determine whether or

 7   not it is in fact in the interest of justice or not, how

 8   much more burden are we putting on a judge than to say,

 9   look, you are right, you need a month; I will exclude it

10   under (7)(H).

11                MR. ROBERTS:         The judge has to specifically

12   consider all of the specified factors that are in (b)(1)

13   through (4).

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              We have never required

15   the judge to give a litany of each of the factors under

16   (h)(7).    We have never required him or her to do a

17   detailed finding.     We've just required them to say

18   there's some reason for it.

19                MR. ROBERTS:         Well, the court -- the statute

20   says that the judge shall consider the specific factors,

21   and some courts at least have -- have reversed -- if

22   a -- situations where the court hasn't considered the

23   factors.

24                In addition, there have to be specific ends

25   of justice findings, which I would respectfully disagree

 1   with counsel on the other side:               The findings have to be

 2   made before the continuance is granted.                  What --

 3                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            That's what Zedner seems

 4   to suggest.

 5                 MR. ROBERTS:       What Zedner says is the

 6   findings have to be made before the continuance is

 7   granted.   They can be recorded later, but they have to

 8   be made, because otherwise the continuance isn't made on

 9   the basis of the findings.           So if the judge didn't go

10   through, consider the factors, and make the findings, if

11   only in the judge's mind, then the judge shouldn't be

12   recording them later on.

13                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Mr. Roberts --

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          And counsel wouldn't know

15   until -- wouldn't know whether the time was excluded or

16   not until -- until a later finding is either made or not

17   made.

18                 MR. ROBERTS:       Is recorded.           I guess -- I

19   guess not, Your Honor.

20                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask you,

21   Mr. Roberts, to comment on your opponent's argument that

22   you are creating a rule that if a particular district

23   has a standing order that motions be filed after seven

24   days and then another district has a standing order that

25   it be 21 days, the effect of your rule would be to make

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the seven-day district an 86-day -- give them 86 days

 2   under the Speedy Trial Act?

 3                 MR. ROBERTS:       Yes, Your Honor.          The -- the

 4   act just doesn't operate so that -- so that all the

 5   districts' excludable delays are even across districts.

 6   The exclusion in Section (h)(1)(D), the exclusion for

 7   pretrial motions, excludes the time that's allotted to

 8   prepare responses.    And there is wide variation among

 9   the different districts in the time that's allotted to

10   prepare responses.

11                 So, for example, the Northern District of

12   Florida gives 14 days after the motion.                 The Northern

13   District of Illinois gives ten days after the motion.

14                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           That's for response time.

15                 MR. ROBERTS:       For response time.

16                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           And that's automatically

17   excluded, so that won't affect the -- well, like you

18   said, it's --

19                 MR. ROBERTS:       It's going to be different.

20                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Yes.

21                 MR. ROBERTS:       So it's the same -- it's the

22   same issue.    They're just -- it isn't in lockstep.

23                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           But if the difference is

24   specifically authorized by Congress?

25                 MR. ROBERTS:       Well, this is specifically


                                       41
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   authorized by Congress, too, because section (h)(1) is

 2   -- is a general exclusion for delay resulting from

 3   proceedings concerning the defendant.

 4              And, you know, these are -- the list of

 5   things are examples only.        And this covers those

 6   proceedings and other proceedings, including those that

 7   like this one that are ancillary to the listed ones.

 8              JUSTICE STEVENS:            But doesn't it seem fairly

 9   clear that the district which has a 21-day rule, they

10   won't have to -- normally, they won't need extra time in

11   the routine case for an extra motion, whereas the

12   districts with a seven-day rule would pretty

13   automatically need another 10 days or so.

14              MR. ROBERTS:        I think it depends on the

15   particular case and what motions are in -- or what

16   motions are involved, Your Honor.

17              But the -- the rule is going to operate

18   differentially, too.    Under Petitioner's theory, people

19   come in asking for different extensions of time to get

20   (h)(7) continuances, which Petitioner says are not going

21   to be very difficult to get granted.                  So I think, both

22   in terms of the response time varying and in terms of

23   the rule having the same effect, whether it's excluded

24   under (h)(1) or (h)(7), I'm not sure that you are going

25   to ever get a complete parity.            That's really not what

 1   Congress was intending.

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, this may be

 3   the same question I was asking earlier, but I want to

 4   make sure I've got your answer.             Let's say the original

 5   date for filing motions is, as it was here,

 6   September 13th, right?      On September 7th, Mr. Bloate

 7   asks for additional time.        So the judge's, you know,

 8   runs a tight ship, and he says, I will give you one day.

 9   One more day, so now it's due on September 14th.

10              You would say the delay resulting from that

11   extension was seven days, from September 7th, when he

12   filed it, to September 14th, and not one day.

13              MR. ROBERTS:        That's the way the courts have

14   interpreted it, because once the -- once the

15   determination has been made that there should be time to

16   prepare a response, then you know that you're outside of

17   the case where you don't know whether any of this time

18   in the routine deadline is being used for response --

19   for consideration of motions or preparation of motions.

20   You know that counsel is using time for that purpose.

21              But I would say, you know, the same answer

22   back to you, that -- that the issue here is whether

23   additional time should -- is excluded when it's granted.

24   The issue isn't how much time should have been excluded.

25   And if -- if the court thinks that an incorrect amount


                                     43
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   of time has been -- was calculated as excluded, I think

 2   that the appropriate thing to do in that circumstance

 3   would be for the Court to leave that open on remand,

 4   assuming that it's -- that it's preserved.               But, you

 5   know, I think that -- that --

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And you would argue it

 7   wasn't reserved because both sides thought the period

 8   was from September 7th until October 4th, and one

 9   thought that that whole period should be excluded?                  That

10   was your position, and then the other side said none of

11   it --

12                 MR. ROBERTS:        That's right, Your Honor.         I

13   --   Petitioner never argued, at least as far as I am

14   aware, that the error was a miscalculation of the amount

15   of time, rather than the exclusion of the time under the

16   wrong statutory provision.

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:           How -- how do you think it

18   should work?     It seems to me they are two separate

19   things.     On September 7th, the defendant comes in and

20   says, "Judge, you've told me I have to have everything

21   ready by the 13th.     I would like additional time to

22   prepare."     And what he said was, "until September 25th."

23   He said that on the 13th:           "I want until

24   September 25th."     This is what I think the Chief Justice

25   is asking, in part.

 1                Now, what the judge did is excluded

 2   everything from September 7th all the way to

 3   October 4th.    And if I understand your argument -- I'm

 4   not sure I agree with it, but on the 7th to the 13th,

 5   that really wasn't additional time, but nonetheless,

 6   maybe there's something there.

 7                What about the period from the 25th to the

 8   4th?    I don't know what the theory could be on excluding

 9   that one, because what the defendant said on the 7th --

10   on September 13th, he said, "Judge, I don't want any

11   more time.   I don't even want to file any motions."

12                MR. ROBERTS:        On the 25th.

13                JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes.       On the 25th, he said

14   that.   So what is the basis of excluding the 25th to the

15   4th?

16                MR. ROBERTS:        As I was saying before, what

17   -- he did make a filing on the 25th, and the Court took

18   action in response to that filing on the 4th, by holding

19   a hearing at which he waived the motions as he indicated

20   that he was doing on the -- on the 25th.                 So --

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So the delay -- so

22   saying I'm not going to file any pretrial motions

23   results in a delay from a pretrial motion?

24                MR. ROBERTS:        Well, in this particular

25   instance, Your Honor, he made a filing and then the

 1   Court -- the Court held a hearing in response to that,

 2   and actually engaged in a colloquy with the defendant,

 3   asked the -- asked the defendant, "Do you understand

 4   what you are giving up?         Do you want to waive these

 5   motions?"     He said, "Yes, I want to do that," and the

 6   Court ruled, then, on that on the 4th.

 7                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Is that a normal course

 8   of practice?     I've never quite heard of other --

 9                 MR. ROBERTS:        I don't think it's a general

10   practice, Your Honor.        It does seem to be typical in

11   this -- in this district, but I think that --

12                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But then the Court's

13   view a decision or statement that no motions are going

14   to be filed as a request for a waiver of that

15   obligation?

16                 MR. ROBERTS:        Well, it was in fact a waiver

17   notice, a notice of intent to waive, that the defendant

18   filed.   Not just --

19                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Intent to waive.

20                 MR. ROBERTS:        Well, I mean, it was framed as

21   a waiver, a waiver of pretrial motions.                      It's Docket

22   Entry 21.     But I don't think it's -- you know, it's in

23   the record, but not in the -- in the JA.

24                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Well, I didn't see it as

25   a motion.     It didn't move to waive.                   It said, "I waive."

 1               MR. ROBERTS:          That -- that's true, but the

 2   Court didn't -- the Court held the hearing on the 4th.

 3   And it engaged in this conversation with the defendant

 4   and then made a decision on the 4th that the time was

 5   waived, that the -- the waiver, not --

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:             So it's --

 7               MR. ROBERTS:          Not at the time it was filed.

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:             That's what I understand.

 9   You get the period from the -- the 25th to the 4th comes

10   under (D) or (H).     It's a motion that is filed, and it's

11   under advisement.

12               MR. ROBERTS:          I think that the --

13               JUSTICE BREYER:             So it comes under (D) or

14   (H).   Is that right?

15               MR. ROBERTS:          It comes under -- it probably

16   comes under (h)(1), Your Honor.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:             I mean, I don't mean little

18   (h)(1).   I mean big (H).         It's attributed to a period

19   during which any proceedings actually under any

20   advisement -- or maybe it comes under (D) -- a motion

21   not to file a motion is a motion.

22               MR. ROBERTS:          I mean, it could come under

23   (D), Your Honor.    It could come under (h)(1).           I would

24   say it really comes under both -- best fits under (h)(1)

25   as analogous to a motion that's not exactly a motion.

 1                But, you know, either way, the point is that

 2   it was something that the Court required the Court

 3   action, or at least as the Court had set the rules in

 4   this proceeding required Court action, and then it did

 5   ultimately did have Court action on the Court.

 6                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Would you repeat that just

 7   so I have you:   It comes under (h)(1) -- what sub?

 8                MR. ROBERTS:       I think just under -- I would

 9   say, Your Honor, just under the general language of

10   (h)(1), because it's not strictly a pretrial motion, but

11   it's the equivalent of a pretrial motion.

12                But you could say that it falls under --

13   under (h)(1)(D), and think of it as a motion itself.

14                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Did --

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Do you have any idea of

16   how many, if we rule against you, until we -- speaking

17   hypothetically, how many convictions would be at risk

18   for --

19                MR. ROBERTS:       I couldn't say precisely, Your

20   Honor, but it is the rule that's been followed in eight

21   courts of appeals.

22                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            But it's -- it's not

23   everybody who invokes a Speedy Trial Act violation

24   objection.

25                MR. ROBERTS:       No.      That's true.   That's

 1   true.     I mean, I can't say that they are going to be --

 2   and I would have to agree with -- with Petitioner's

 3   counsel that, you know, that there are consequences in

 4   whatever ruling that the Court -- that the Court makes

 5   in a case.

 6                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             I would have been -- I

 7   would have been interested in knowing the effects of

 8   Zedner.

 9                 MR. ROBERTS:        Yeah.

10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             And how -- what kind of

11   burden it placed.

12                 MR. ROBERTS:        I'm sorry, I don't have any

13   precise -- precise information on that.                  But I think

14   that, you know, even apart from the transitional effects

15   that there are going to be on a going-forward basis,

16   sometimes judges are going -- would -- would grant

17   additional preparation time and neglect to make the

18   required finding.

19                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But that's true of all

20   Speedy Trial Act actions by the district court.                  They

21   always run the risk of forgetting to make a finding.

22   That's why you have two attorneys, presumably --

23                 MR. ROBERTS:        That's right --

24                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             -- to remind them.

25                 MR. ROBERTS:        And that would be perfectly

 1   appropriate if findings under (h)(7) were necessary.

 2   But section (h)(1) is designed to address frequently

 3   recurring situations in which the ends of justice are

 4   virtually always going to be served by delaying the

 5   trial for the purpose.         And that's exactly what we have

 6   here.

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Can I ask you about the

 8   language of (h)(1)?      Do you think it's -- do you think

 9   it's proper to consider a period of delay that precedes

10   the filing of the motion?           That is, a period of delay in

11   order to prepare the motion, as a delay resulting from a

12   proceeding that has not yet occurred?

13                 MR. ROBERTS:        No, we -- we agree with that,

14   Your Honor.    That's why Petitioner is wrong in saying

15   that (D) addresses the delay we are talking about here

16   and precludes its recognition under -- under (h)(1).

17   The delay we are talking about here is not resulting

18   from the pretrial motion, it's resulting from the grant

19   of -- the order granting additional time to prepare for

20   the motion.    And that, that is the related but different

21   proceeding and a different kind of delay related to

22   motions practice.     So I would agree with Your Honor

23   that --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           The grant of the motion is

25   the proceeding?

 1               MR. ROBERTS:       That the order granting the

 2   additional time of the proceeding --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Is the proceeding.

 4               MR. ROBERTS:       -- and if the delay results

 5   from that order and the order is ancillary to a listed

 6   proceeding, which is the pretrial motions because it

 7   facilitates that proceeding, because it provides for

 8   adequate preparation, which enabled the motions to be

 9   resolved favorably and accurately.

10               JUSTICE STEVENS:           But what -- what

11   subsection does all this?        I really -- I got lost in --

12               MR. ROBERTS:       I'm sorry, Your Honor.

13               JUSTICE STEVENS:           Because you agree, as I

14   understand it, it is not covered by (D).

15               MR. ROBERTS:       Right.

16               JUSTICE STEVENS:           And what subsection does

17   cover it?

18               MR. ROBERTS:       It's (h)(1), the general

19   provision, which courts have used to exclude numerous --

20               JUSTICE STEVENS:           But it's not governed by

21   any lettered subsection?

22               MR. ROBERTS:       No.      It's a -- another

23   proceeding that -- that is covered by the including but

24   not limited to language on --

25               JUSTICE STEVENS:           But there is no period --


                                     51
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               MR. ROBERTS:         -- (h)(1).

 2               JUSTICE STEVENS:            -- no subsection talks

 3   about another proceeding?          That's just your gloss on the

 4   statute; is that right?

 5               MR. ROBERTS:         Well, I think (h)(1) says any

 6   period of delay resulting from other proceedings

 7   concerning the defendant.          That could be a period, and

 8   it covers a whole range of proceedings that generate

 9   delay.   And then --

10               JUSTICE STEVENS:            I see.

11               MR. ROBERTS:         Then there is a list of

12   examples.   And the examples are intended only to be

13   illustrative.   And what's -- what's covered is in

14   addition to those examples, other proceedings that are

15   analogous or ancillary to them.

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:            And you say the order is a

17   proceeding for that purpose, the order granting the

18   extension of time?

19               MR. ROBERTS:         That is the proceedings

20   beforehand, Your Honor.         Yes.     But the -- that's not

21   the -- you know, first of all, as I said, a proceeding

22   is a -- is an act done by the court or under the court's

23   authority, so in order to fit squarely within that.

24   Plus I would direct you to (h)(1)(F), which indicates

25   that orders can be proceedings here because it excludes


                                       52

 1   delay following an order of removal or an order

 2   directing the transportation of the defendant.

 3                 And, so, I think that there's indication in

 4   the examples themselves when orders are sometimes

 5   proceedings.

 6                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           But just one quick

 7   question.    It seems to me that everything described in

 8   (7)(A) would fit your description of proceedings.

 9                 MR. ROBERTS:       It -- there -- there would be

10   an order, so there would be a proceeding.                 But it

11   wouldn't be a proceeding that would be covered under

12   (h)(1) because it -- to be covered it has to be a

13   proceeding of the type that is listed here.                 It has to

14   be analogous to these proceedings or ancillary to them,

15   facilitating these proceedings in some way, Your Honor.

16                JUSTICE STEVENS:            That's a tough argument.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

18                Mr. Stancil, five minutes.

19               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCIL

20                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

21                MR. STANCIL:        I would like to quickly

22   address what I hope to be just four points.                 The first

23   is the government's fundamental principle.                 The

24   fundamental tenet is that the specific treatment of

25   pretrial motions in subparagraph (D) suggests no


                                       53
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   negative inference or limiting inference on the general

 2   standard of (h)(1).

 3                 The fall on that is evident by looking at

 4   subparagraph (h), which automatically excludes up to

 5   30 days during which a matter is under advisement by the

 6   district court.     If the government's reasoning is

 7   correct, subparagraph (h) just does not address or

 8   contains -- or suggests no negative inference on whether

 9   the 31st day of a matter being under advisement is

10   automatically excludable under (h)(1).                   That's why there

11   are settle -- in the statutory interpretation.

12                 We take the general standard, first of all,

13   is it a proceeding?      There is no pretrial motion

14   proceeding until the motion is filed.

15                 Second, if you think there is any

16   uncertainty as to what a proceeding is, well, look at

17   how the enumerated subparagraphs that follow, what do

18   they describe.     One specifically addresses pretrial

19   motions.     It has a starting point and it has an end

20   point.     That's the end of this case.

21                 But even if you think you want to look

22   further.     Well, is there any support in these enumerated

23   subparagraphs for the government's rule that you would

24   treat a defense request for additional time differently?

25   No.   None of the enumerated subparagraphs distinguishes


                                        54
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   between defense requests and government requests.            None

 2   distinguishes between routinely granted time or

 3   specifically alloted time.

 4                 In fact, with respect to defense requests

 5   specifically, it was not lost on Congress how to -- how

 6   to treat government counsel and defense counsel

 7   differently.    In (h)(7)(C), which is about the end of

 8   justice exclusion, it specifies that the government

 9   cannot get an end of justice exclusion based on its

10   inability to exercise due diligence in obtaining a

11   witness or preparing.

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          I don't understand -- I

13   don't understand the government to be argue -- to be

14   arguing that they are treated differently.

15                 MR. STANCIL:       Well, the government's rule I

16   think is --

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          They are saying whoever --

18   whoever asked for the extension of time in order to

19   prepare the motion gets it.            And -- and it's the time

20   limit's suspended.

21                 MR. STANCIL:       That's not their position in

22   their brief, Your Honor.         They say the defense requests

23   for additional time --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Well --

25                 MR. STANCIL:       They don't say anything about

 1   government request.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- they made it very clear

 3   here that they think it applies to both the defendant

 4   and the government.

 5                MR. STANCIL:         If that's their position, it's

 6   more unmoored from the text of subparagraph (D), because

 7   then both types of requests -- so subparagraph -- pardon

 8   me -- so (h)(1)'s general standard is expanded even

 9   farther --

10                JUSTICE BREYER:            You are right, (D) has a

11   special time limit built into it -- I mean, (h) or

12   whatever the number is now.             It says not to exclude

13   30 days.   Okay?

14                MR. STANCIL:         Yes.

15                JUSTICE BREYER:            None of the others do.       So

16   I would say right there, Congress doesn't want the judge

17   to have it for more than 30 days.                  Congress doesn't say

18   a word in any of the others that says anything about

19   preparation time.

20                MR. STANCIL:         Well, I disagree about

21   subparagraph (D) Your Honor.              (D) says from point B

22   to --

23                JUSTICE BREYER:            No, I know.       But there is

24   not an indication about preparation time.                  Their

25   argument is a literal argument under the statute.                  Is it


                                        56
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   from other proceedings?        Yes, we know that because of

 2   (D), okay?    Does it result from other proceedings?                   Yes,

 3   because, in fact, the preparation time is a direct

 4   result of the other proceedings as defined in (D).

 5   Therefore, it is an ancillary matter related to other

 6   proceedings that was caused by the other proceedings.

 7   QED, their argument is literal and there is no policy

 8   against it.    That's what they said.

 9                 Now, as soon as you get to the last (h), you

10   would find a big policy against it.                     Called not

11   exceeding 30 days.    Now, I take it that's roughly their

12   argument.

13                 MR. STANCIL:       But there is no --

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:          At least my interpretation

15   of it.

16                 MR. STANCIL:       There is no difference, Your

17   Honor, between not exceeding 30 days and from and to.

18   And I think this is -- this case -- it comes to that and

19   that alone, which is Congress specifically addressed

20   pretrial motions, any delay resulting from a pretrial

21   motion and it said from point A to point B.                     And even if

22   you had to look behind that, you would look at the

23   legislative history and the Senate Judiciary Committee

24   was asked a specific question by the government no less,

25   can we include preparation time, and they said no.

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Counsel, is your

 2   friend correct that the issue of the proper calculation

 3   is not before us?     So that the time I spent figuring

 4   that out should be excluded from something?

 5               (Laughter.)

 6               MR. STANCIL:          As the question was presented,

 7   Your Honor, it was specific to preparation time and the

 8   period -- and the period from -- I don't want to get the

 9   dates wrong but, September 7th to October 4th.                  But I

10   would add that the government didn't raise this argument

11   below, either.   Nor did the government suggest, as I

12   understand it, that the delay that's at issue here

13   results from the grant on September 7th of additional

14   time.   Rather their argument as I have understood it and

15   understood it when reading their briefs is that the

16   delay -- the ancillary delay stems from the pretrial

17   motion, the time allotted for pretrial motions itself.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I would have thought

19   that whether or not you think that type of delay is

20   excludable depends on what that type of delay is, which

21   requires some sense of how it's going to be calculated.

22               MR. STANCIL:          Yes, Your Honor.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:             Does six days make a

24   difference to your case?          If they lose six days, do you

25   win?
