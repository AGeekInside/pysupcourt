 7                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL A. BANKER

 8                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                 MR. BANKER:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                 Tribes lack inherent sovereign power over

12   nonmembers.   This court in the Montana decision

13   recognized two narrow exceptions based on the underlying

14   principles of protecting tribal self-government and

15   controlling internal relations.                Neither of those

16   exceptions applies here.

17                 The question today is whether the tribal

18   court possessed adjudicatory jurisdiction to hear the

19   Longs' discrimination claim against the nonmember bank.

20   It did not.   There was no qualifying consensual

21   relationship here of the qualifying kind.                  There was --

22   adjudication is not another means of regulating

23   nonmember defendant conduct.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             We've said that regulation

25   does include regulation by adjudication for purposes of


                                          3

 1   -- of Federal pre-emption laws.               Why would it -- why

 2   would it be different for -- for Indian law.

 3                 MR. BANKER:       Well, I think the reason that

 4   it would be different for Indian law is the way that it

 5   bears on the nonmember defendants' rights.                   The -- if

 6   you look at what Montana was based on and the underlying

 7   principles, I think it is important to recognize that

 8   nonmember defendants in tribal court, finding themselves

 9   there to adjudicate, that is something that I think was

10   contemplated by the second exception, but not the first

11   exception.

12                 The reason that I think that is that in

13   carving out two exceptions --

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yes, I understand, but I'm

15   just talking about the first one now.                    You say it is not

16   -- it is not regulation, right, under the first?                   And

17   that's -- that's the only point I'm addressing.                   Why

18   should regulation through a process of adjudication not

19   be considered regulation for purposes of our Indian law

20   where -- whereas, we have made clear in several cases

21   that it does constitute regulation for purposes of

22   Federal pre-emption under statutes that pre-empt state

23   regulation?

24                 MR. BANKER:       I think that it is different in

25   the tribal-law context because in articulating the --


                                         4

 1   the first exception when the Court said:                    Regulate

 2   nonmember conduct through other means, if the Court had

 3   meant to say "adjudication," I think the court could

 4   have articulated that there.              And I think it's --

 5                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            We could have said the same

 6   thing about the Congress.            Congress just said -- just

 7   said "regulation," and we interpreted that term to

 8   include common-law adjudication.

 9                  MR. BANKER:       When I look at the -- you know,

10   at the -- and compare the language in the first Montana

11   exception of regulation to the language in the

12   Constitution under the Indian Commerce Clause, I see a

13   parallel there between saying that, you know, there are

14   certain types of legislative authority that tribes may

15   exercise over nonmembers versus exercising the power of

16   the courts.

17                  JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, are you saying that

18   the -- that the regulatory authority could be broader

19   than the adjudicatory authority?

20                  MR. BANKER:       I think that has been well

21   established:    That the regulatory --

22                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Can you give any example

23   of that?   I mean, I found that rather surprising your

24   brief.   The Montana -- a clear case that Montana talks

25   about is tax, the imposition of a tax.                    Well, if a


                                          5

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   jurisdiction has authority to tax, then surely it has

 2   authority to sue to collect that tax.                    So I am not aware

 3   of a case where a State or tribe or nation has authority

 4   to regulate, to legislate, but lacks authority to

 5   enforce that regulation.          And if you have an example of


 6   that, I would appreciate being enlightened.


 7                 MR. BANKER:       Well, I think that there's a


 8   tension between what the Court said in the Strate case,


 9   where it said, presumptively, if there is the power to


10   regulate, then there is presumptively the power to

11   adjudicate.   That, I believe, was called into question

12   by the second footnote in the Nevada versus Hicks

13   decision, which questioned, in my mind, whether or not

14   there was any adjudicatory power at all.                   And I think

15   that is the question that the Court has to determine, is

16   whether --

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What was the regulation

18   that was authorized but unenforceable in the courts?                     I

19   don't recall -- Montana -- Hicks having said anything on

20   that subject.

21                 MR. BANKER:       Well, there was a -- the footnote

22   number 2 in Hicks at least called into question about

23   whether or not -- you know, I think it's been made clear

24   by the Court's opinions that -- that adjudicatory

25   authority is certainly no broader than legislative


                                         6

 1   authority.    The question raised by the second footnote 


 2   in the Hicks opinion, in my mind, is whether or not 


 3   adjudicatory authority exists at all in the first 


 4   exception.


 5                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, what is a tribe

 6   supposed to do?    Let's say there is a gas station on the

 7   reservation.    The tribe has a tax.                 Anybody doing

 8   business -- it's, you know, 1 percent of gross proceeds.

 9   And at the end of the year the gas station owner says,

10   well, I'm just not going to pay it.                       What do they do

11   then?

12                  MR. BANKER:       Well, I think that there is a

13   difference between situations where there is a clear

14   ability to regulate and where you would move to enforce

15   that regulation and a situation where you are

16   adjudicating, you know, separate claims under the common

17   law of the tribe.

18                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So you think there

19   would be -- there would be tribal-court jurisdiction in

20   the case I hypothesized?

21                  MR. BANKER:       I don't think so.               I think the

22   nature of the first exception is a consensual

23   relationship.    And I think if there is going to be an

24   ability to regulate in the first instance, then the

25   regulation needs to be clearly consented to.

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So your case, your

 2   entire case, is based on whether or not there's consent

 3   to dealing with the tribe by the nonmember?

 4                 MR. BANKER:       Well, I think it goes further

 5   than that.    If I could -- you know, in your example of

 6   the taxation, if there was clear consent to be taxed --

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Who would consent to be

 8   taxed?   I mean the tax is --

 9                 (Laughter.)

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            It's being imposed.      But,

11   say, at the gas station, they don't ask you when you

12   drive up:    Now do you consent to the tax?

13                 MR. BANKER:       Well, but by engaging in commerce

14   on the reservation and by, you know -- and this Court

15   has addressed it in a number of taxation decisions

16   regarding Indian law, the -- there is a quid pro quo for

17   --

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But that's different from

19   consent.    You can say I don't consent as loudly as you

20   like and as often as you like, and you still have to pay

21   the tax.

22                 MR. BANKER:       But that -- you know, in the

23   taxation context, I think that is the price of doing

24   business.

25                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, but if that kind of


                                         8

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   implicit consent applies in the tax context, I don't see

 2   why in theory it doesn't apply in the situation we've

 3   got here.

 4                MR. BANKER:        Well --

 5                JUSTICE SOUTER:             If somebody is going to do

 6   business with the tribe, with tribal members, in a way

 7   that affects the tribe on the reservation, it makes just

 8   as much sense to say, well, they implicitly consent not

 9   to discriminate against tribal members because of their

10   Indian status.

11                MR. BANKER:        I think it is, you know, that

12   consent under the first Montana exception can't be

13   implicit.   I think it needs to be explicit.

14                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, I thought it was

15   implicit in the tax situation, as you responded to

16   Justice Ginsburg's question.

17                MR. BANKER:        Well, I think we need to be

18   specific about the taxation context.                     You know, I don't

19   think that any taxation context would carry with it

20   implicit consent.

21                JUSTICE SOUTER:             All right.         Let me take

22   another example, the other explicit example from

23   Montana, which mentioned taxing and licensing.                    Are you

24   saying that if a -- in any particular activity, say,

25   running a filling station or advertising oneself as a


                                         9

 1   certified mechanic in the -- at the filling station on

 2   the reservation, and the tribe says, well, we are going

 3   to license mechanics to make sure they are competent.

 4   Are you saying that there has got to be an explicit

 5   agreement to the licensing in order for the tribe to

 6   enforce its licensing restriction against somebody who

 7   goes to work for that gas station?

 8                 MR. BANKER:       I mean in that situation, if the

 9   tribe said, here is the licensing that we are going to

10   impose on you for being a mechanic, and the mechanic

11   then went to work at that gas station, knowing about

12   that licensing requirement, I mean, that is -- that is

13   the sort of actual --

14                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.      Then, that's --

15   that's implicit consent then, isn't it?

16                 MR. BANKER:       I think it comes --

17                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            He doesn't sign a document

18   saying "I consent"; he just goes to work.                 And your

19   answer says, okay, that's enough to catch him on

20   licensing.    In Justice Ginsburg's example, if they

21   started doing business, that's enough to catch them on

22   taxation.    And if that is so, why isn't tribal dealing

23   sufficient in effect to supply an implicit consent not

24   to discriminate?

25                 MR. BANKER:       Well, I don't know that I would


                                        10

 1   -- I would disagree that -- I would say that those

 2   examples of consent of the licensing of the taxation are

 3   much closer to being actual consent.                      I'm not saying by

 4   "actual consent" that there needs to be a written

 5   document that says --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:               You don't really mean "actual

 7   consent" by "actual consent," right?

 8               (Laughter.)

 9               MR. BANKER:          Well, yes.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Maybe you should use a

11   different term, like "implicit consent," maybe.

12               (Laughter.)

13               MR. BANKER:          The -- I think that there has to

14   be a line drawn.

15               JUSTICE SOUTER:               All right.         Why draw the line

16   where you want to draw it?            We've got a line in which

17   the -- I'll put a blank, the "X" consent -- what did we

18   want -- whatever adjective we want suffices for taxation

19   and it suffices for licensing.                Why doesn't it suffice

20   for nondiscrimination?         Why do we draw the line where

21   you want it drawn?

22               MR. BANKER:          The reason where we would draw

23   the line where I want to drawn it is that, you know, the

24   discrimination claim that was made here ultimately

25   turned out to be based on tribal common law.                     It arose


                                         11

 1   out of this -- the dealings, the contractual dealings,


 2   between the bank and a nonmember corporation.                It is


 3   important for a nonmember to know where tribal


 4   jurisdiction attaches or doesn't attach.                And it is not


 5   possible to predict when a common law, tribal -- for an

 6   outsider to determine when a tribal common-law

 7   discrimination claim is going to attach as a form of

 8   regulation --

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Oh, so one of your answers to

10   an earlier question suggests the same point that you now

11   seem to be making, although I don't -- I don't recall it

12   from your brief.   Apparently you think that it would be

13   different if this antidiscrimination law of the tribe

14   had been set forth in a tribal ordinance.                Is that

15   right?   Would you say your client could have been held

16   to it if it had been written, rather than simply a -- a

17   portion of tribal common law?

18                MR. BANKER:       If it had been a tribal

20   been the possibility of notice and the possibility of --

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's not what I asked.

22   That's not what I asked.         I asked whether you would

23   acknowledge that your client could be bound if it had

24   been written.

 1   a nonmember to tribal law is clear consent, and merely

 2   knowing about the tribal antidiscrimination --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, that doesn't make any

 4   difference.    We shouldn't place any weight on the fact

 5   that this was a common-law regulation, rather than

 6   regulation by a statute or ordinance.                     You can't have it

 7   both ways.    It either makes a difference or it doesn't

 8   make a difference.

 9                 MR. BANKER:        I -- I think that it does make a

10   difference.

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             But you just told me it

12   didn't.

13                 MR. BANKER:        I think --

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             You just told me that even

15   if it were written down, you would still need what you

16   think is express consent.

17                 MR. BANKER:        I think that that provides the

18   clearest guidance for when tribal jurisdiction attaches

19   or doesn't.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, do you recognize

21   that the bank was on notice, at least that it was a Federal

22   requirement that when you deal with individual Indians

23   or what this loan company was, it was an organization of

24   Indians -- that's what the Federal law calls it -- there

25   is a duty of fair dealing?            The Federal law requires

 1   that.    Isn't that so?

 2                 MR. BANKER:       That is so, but, you know,

 3   we're not here to, you know -- the Federal courts don't

 4   provide a substantive review on the merits.                Another

 5   side to the story about the merits of the

 6   discrimination.

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But it's not -- it's not

 8   uncommon that a State would adopt a Federal standard as

 9   its -- as its own on a question of civil rights.                A

10   State might stay, well, we choose to construe our human

11   rights law in accord with the Federal -- Federal law?

12                 MR. BANKER:       No.       That's, that's not

13   uncommon.    But I think it's important to focus on the

14   background about, out of which this discrimination claim

15   arose.    And, you, know it began in the first instance

16   with the bank, a nonmember, entering into a contract

17   with a South Dakota corporation.                And the South Dakota

18   corporation, the Long Family Land and Cattle Company, is

19   not a tribal member, cannot be --

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But it is an organization

21   of Indians?

22                 MR. BANKER:       It is closely held by tribal

23   members.    And it is organized for the purpose of

24   facilitating Bureau of Indian Affairs loan --

 1   when it grants a corporation status between non- Indian

 2   and Indian corporations.

 3                  MR. BANKER:       I don't believe so.

 4                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Can you incorporate under

 5   tribal law.


 6                  MR. BANKER:       You cannot incorporate under


 7   tribal law.


 8                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Wasn't part of the


 9   transaction the obtaining of back-up liability on the


10   part of the individual Indians who, who owned the

11   corporation?    Didn't they guarantee the loan?

12                  MR. BANKER:       You have to be specific about

13   the loan guarantees and the contracts that we are

14   talking about.    Before 1996, before the loan contracts

15   that are at issue here, there were lending relationships

16   and loan guarantees that were made.                       And after 1996,

17   when additional loans were made, there were personal

18   guarantees that were made.            There was no attempt ever to

19   enforce those personal guarantees, but they were part of

20   the record.

21                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            No, but it does give the

22   whole thing a decided flavor of dealing with, with

23   Indians on the reservation.               You're dealing with a

24   corporation that, that's majority owned or entirely

25   owned.   Is it majority or entirely?

 1               MR. BANKER:          I believe it is certainly 51


 2   percent.


 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Yes.


 4               MR. BANKER:          There is a question about


 5   whether it's more.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:               And then you get guarantees

 7   from, on reservation Indians.               It smells like dealing

 8   with Indians on the reservation to me.                    Of course, this

 9   certainty that you're -- that you're asking, your client

10   could have obtained that certainly by inserting a choice

11   of law provision providing that any disputes would be

12   resolved somewhere else, couldn't it?

13               MR. BANKER:          There is no question that this

14   whole question would have been avoided had there been a

15   choice of forum selection that placed the dispute

16   resolution squarely in South Dakota courts.                   In the

17   absence of that, in the silence of that --

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:               In the absence of that, why

19   should we bend over backwards to give something that has

20   the smell of dealing with the Indians any other name?

21   Your clients can fully protect themselves by a choice of

22   forum provision.

23               MR. BANKER:          I think that in the face of

24   silence in the contract, the general rule controls

25   rather than its exceptions.

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, your clients

 2   could they fully protect themselves.                    What if the tribe

 3   sought to enforce tribal law against them, can they

 4   bring that claim in State court?

 5                MR. BANKER:       If the tribe or if the tribal

 6   members sought to enforce that?

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Right.     Well, just

 8   like this and there was a choice of forum provision,

 9   says, well, you've got to bring this in State court.                   I

10   thought there were restrictions on whether or not tribal

11   law can be enforced in State courts.

12                MR. BANKER:       Well, I think it's the question

13   of who the plaintiff is if the Long Family Land and

14   Cattle Company, the South Dakota corporation, had had a

15   contract with the bank that said your forum for dispute

16   resolution is South Dakota courts, and the Long Family

17   Land and Cattle Company had commenced an action in South

18   Dakota courts, I think the dispute could have been

19   resolved there.

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Even if it -- well,

21   that's if it's a contract claim.               What if it's a

22   discrimination or Indian common law claim arising out of

23   the contractual relationship?

24                MR. BANKER:       That's a more difficult

25   question.   You know, there was -- it isn't part of the

 1   question presented, but there was a dispute in the

 2   underlying tribal court about the nature of the

 3   discrimination claim, whether it rose under Federal law

 4   or what was its underlying basis.                 That was resolved in

 5   favor of it being a tribal law claim.

 6               As I understand the tribal court of appeals'

 7   explanation of that on an underlying basis that there is

 8   little difference between the tribal law claim and the

 9   underlying Federal discrimination law.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Is it a contract claim?

11               MR. BANKER:         Is it a --

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Is it a contract claim?

13   Was -- was -- was the claim a claim for discrimination

14   in contracting so that it was part of the contract

15   claim.

16               MR. BANKER:         No.       I believe that the

17   discrimination --

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:              It's a freestanding tort

19   action, is that what it was?

20               MR. BANKER:         It is a freestanding tort

21   action.

22               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Would the -- would the

23   jurisdiction issue be any different if it were a

24   contract claim?   Supposing your client -- they had

25   brought suit against your client claiming a breach of

 1   contract, would there have been tribal court

 2   jurisdiction?

 3                   MR. BANKER:        Well, we have to look at, you

 4   know, who were the contracting parties.                   The contracting

 5   parties were the bank on the one hand and the Long

 6   Family Land and Cattle Company on the other.                   So the

 7   individual tribal members I don't believe would have had

 8   a breach of contract.

 9               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Well, we would assume that

10   the corporation had a breach of contract claim, could

11   they have sued in tribal court?

12               MR. BANKER:          I don't think that the Long

13   Family and Cattle Company appropriately was a plaintiff

14   in tribal court to sue on breach of contract.

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Did they --

16               JUSTICE STEVENS:              The question isn't whether

17   that was an appropriate plaintiff.                   Do you think the

18   tribal court would have had jurisdiction of such a

19   contract claim?

20               MR. BANKER:          I don't think so without some

21   sort of consent to hearing that.

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               I thought that the

23   bank -- I thought that the Long Company was a plaintiff

24   in the tribal court?

25               MR. BANKER:          The Long Company was a

 1   plaintiff in the tribal court.

 2                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And as I understand it,

 3   the Long Company asserted, along with the individuals,

 4   contract claims?

 5                  MR. BANKER:       That's correct.

 6                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But the Long Company did

 7   not make a tort claim?

 8                  MR. BANKER:       That's correct.

 9                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So why isn't this

10   judgment, even if you're right about the individuals in

11   the tort claim, why isn't this judgment good at least as

12   to the contract claim, which are not challenging and

13   which runs to the benefit of the Long Company which has

14   nothing to do with the tort claim that you are

15   challenging?

16                  MR. BANKER:       Because of the way that the

17   case was tried.    If you look at the general verdict form

18   at page 192 -- 191 and 192 in the joint appendix, you'll

19   see that the jury -- the tribal court jury was asked

20   interrogatories about liability:                 Liability for

21   contract, liability for discrimination.

22                  When they got to question 6 on page 192, the

23   question was asked of the jury if you answered "yes" to

24   question four for the other liability questions, four

25   being the discrimination claim, then award damages.              And


                                         20

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   so the jury awarded $750,000 of undifferentiated

 2   damages.   Whether it was for contract, whether it was

 3   for tort is not for us to now second-guess.             There was a

 4   general award of damages.          And the jury was instructed

 5   that they could award damages for breach -- for

 6   discrimination.

 7                So, you know, that is a feature of how the

 8   case was tried.   It is a feature of the way that the

 9   jury returned its verdict.          And at this point it's

10   impossible to know -- the $750,000 that was ultimately

11   awarded was far less than what the Longs were asking for

12   for breach of contract, and they didn't say they were

13   not asking for damages for discrimination in the

14   tribal -- in the tribal court.

15                So for this Court to say now that there was

16   no jurisdiction over the discrimination claim would

17   basically invalidate that underlying judgment.

18                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Mr. Banker, you several

19   times have raised a point which seems to me to go to the

20   nature of the first exception in Montana on an issue we

21   haven't discussed yet, and I want to get clear on it.

22   You have emphasized consistently through your argument

23   the need for consent whether we call it actual,

24   explicit, some kind of consent to at least the

25   regulatory jurisdiction upon which a judicial


                                       21

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   jurisdiction is premised.           And my understanding is that

 2   that's not what -- I don't have Montana in front of me,

 3   but my understanding is that that is not what Montana,

 4   in effect said with respect to the -- to the first

 5   exception.    As I recall what the court said in Montana

 6   it was that there may be situations in which a nonmember

 7   enters into a consensual relationship with the tribe or

 8   tribal members, and as a result of that consensual

 9   relationship, it then would be appropriate to recognize

10   jurisdiction, for example, to tax regulatory

11   jurisdiction.

12                 My understanding is that the consent that

13   Montana was talking about was not a consent to the

14   specific jurisdiction whether it be regulatory or

15   adjudicatory, but rather consent to some kind of, or a

16   consent forming some kind of a relationship that would

17   make it appropriate for the tribe to assert regulatory

18   jurisdiction.    So that the consent does not have to

19   relate to jurisdiction as such.               Am I -- if that is

20   correct, then your argument for consent seems to me to

21   miss the point.    But maybe I'm missing the point of --

22   of Montana.    What is your response to that?

23                 MR. BANKER:       Well, what Montana said, the

24   actual language of Montana said a tribe may regulate

25   through taxation, licensing or other means the


                                        22

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   activities of nonmembers who enter consensual


 2   relationships with the tribe or its members, through


 3   commercial dealings, contracts, leases or other


 4   arrangements.


 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              So the consensual

 6   relationship is what you just said, contracts, leases or

 7   other commercial.    So the consent is to the commercial

 8   relationship.

 9               MR. BANKER:         Well, I mean, my interpretation

10   of that is -- I mean, Montana in its first exception

11   meant that the consent was in the consensual

12   relationship, then any business dealings with the tribe

13   or its members would result in tribal ability to

14   regulate, and that hasn't been the case, as this Court

15   has, you know, decided --

16               JUSTICE SOUTER:              But the point of my

17   question was do you agree that there -- within the --

18   the description of the exception in Montana, that there

19   need not be a consent, either to the regulation or to an

20   adjudicatory jurisdiction to enforce the regulation?

21               MR. BANKER:         Not in the actual language of

22   Montana, but in reading Strate and in reading Hicks and

23   in reading Atkinson Trading Company, that is my

24   interpretation of the --

25               JUSTICE SOUTER:              So you're saying the


                                        23

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Montana exception has been modified by later cases.

 2               MR. BANKER:        That is correct.

 3               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Certainly not in Strate,

 5   which you quoted before as saying if you have

 6   jurisdiction to regulate, then have you jurisdiction to

 7   enforce the regulation.

 8               MR. BANKER:        True, but I think Strate is an

 9   important part of that history.

10               JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, I thought that your

11   argument was that the general principle that was adopted

12   in Montana is the tribal jurisdiction extends only to

13   those things that are necessary to protect tribal

14   self-government or to control internal relations, and

15   that merely entering into consensual commercial

16   transactions doesn't fall within that, but if one were

17   to consent to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts,

18   then that would be an additional basis for jurisdiction.

19   I thought that was what your argument was.

20               MR. BANKER:        I believe that's correct.

21               JUSTICE SOUTER:            But if that's your argument

22   what's left of the first exception?

23               MR. BANKER:        Well, what's left of the first

24   exception is certainly a tribal ability to regulate, and

25   perhaps that's all.

 1                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            So the first -- but as I

 2   understand it the first exception would have no

 3   independent application unless the second exception were

 4   met -- were satisfied, i.e., there was a tribal need

 5   based on self-government, economic self-protection and

 6   so on which, which would in effect validate the tribe's

 7   attempt to regulate, which seems in effect to say that

 8   everything turns on the second exception, not the first.

 9                 MR. BANKER:       Well, I think the first

10   exception could still have meaning, in the sense that it

11   grants the tribe the ability to regulate.                 The question

12   really is how far does that ability go and how far does

13   it stretch.   I don't think that it stretches to

14   adjudication, and I further don't think it stretches to

15   adjudication of nonconsensual tort claims.

16                 If there are no further questions I'd like

17   to reserve the remainder of my time.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, Counsel.

20             ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

21                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

22                 MR. FREDERICK:         Thank you, Mr. Chief

23   Justice, and may it please the Court:

24                 I'd like to address both standing and the

25   merits, but because there are some additional wrinkles

 1   on the standing question in light of how it was briefed

 2   in the reply brief, I'd like to make three brief points

 3   on the merits before addressing standing.

 4                  First, the bank engaged in a seven-year

 5   business relationship with the Longs, knowing that they

 6   were Indians and deriving substantial commercial

 7   benefits from the Longs' tribal status through the BIA

 8   loan guarantees.    Second, the bank has not challenged

 9   tribal court jurisdiction over the breach of contract

10   claim or the bad faith claim, which are the core claims

11   in the case.

12                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, they said they

13   don't need to because they said if they win on their

14   claim, then their whole case --

15                  MR. FREDERICK:         And I'll address that,

16   Justice Ginsburg, on the general verdict point, which is

17   there is actually some law of this which I would like to

18   describe for the Court my understanding of.                My third

19   point, though, is that both the district court and the

20   Eighth Circuit below found significant that the bank had

21   conceded tribal court jurisdiction in its motion for

22   summary judgment on its counterclaim, and they found

23   that concession to be important to note, and both courts

24   below found the Indian character of the Long family

25   company to be notable as well.                Under this Court's two


                                         26

 1   court rule, those fact findings are entitled to


 2   significant respect.


 3                 Now, as to the standing question Justice


 4   Ginsburg, let me get to your point on the general


 5   verdict.   This is ultimately a question of tribal

 6   procedural law, how the tribal court would treat

 7   vacature of a claim deemed to be an invalid claim.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Where do I look that

 9   up in tribal law?

10                 MR. FREDERICK:          Mr. Chief Justice, under

11   tribal law number 1, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe has

12   adopted the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for

13   procedure in the tribal courts, and under Federal Rules

14   of Civil Procedure 49, there are provisions for special

15   verdicts and general verdicts, and Rule 49(a)(3)

16   provides that if no specific objection is made to a fact

17   or finding requested by the jury, it is waived.                  The

18   bank here did not make a specific objection to the

19   general interrogatory number 6, therefore, they may be

20   deemed to have waived their objection to having the

21   damages collected.

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I'm sorry; I don't

23   understand.    I'm looking at joint appendix 191 to 192.

24   You have special interrogatories, including number 6 but

25   also number 4 and then they have damages.                  And it's not


                                         27

 1   clear whether those damages are based on the finding of

 2   liability under 4 or 6.

 3                MR. FREDERICK:          That's my point, Mr. Chief

 4   Justice.   In the trial transcript which is contained at

 5   roughly pages 555 through 562 of the tribal court

 6   record, there was colloquy on how these special

 7   interrogatories were to be framed.                  The bank objected to

 8   number 4, the discrimination count on the ground that a

 9   company cannot be discriminated against, only

10   individuals can be discriminated against.                 That

11   objection was sustained, and so special interrogatory 4

12   was written as you see it in the joint appendix.                 The

13   bank did not object to the general verdict question on

14   damages, so the law on Rule 49(a)(3) would be that

15   special verdict is deemed to be waived, and now there is

16   some --

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             There is no objection --

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Wait.      They are, they are

19   not objecting to a -- to a general verdict.                 They are

20   objecting to the fact that in their view, one of the

21   elements of that -- of that general verdict is based

22   upon what they assert is an invalid claim in the -- in

23   the Indian court.

24                MR. FREDERICK:          Precisely so, Justice

25   Scalia.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:              I don't know that they

 2   waive that when they when -- when they allow a general

 3   verdict to go.

 4                MR. FREDERICK:           The way cases say general

 5   verdicts should be deemed, if there is an invalid claim,

 6   there are competing views about what to do with that

 7   when the damages awarded is treated as a general

 8   verdict.   There is a circuit split on the question of

 9   what you do when there has not been a specific objection

10   preserved and there is a general verdict and one invalid

11   claim and evidence that supports a valid claim.

12                Now recall, they don't challenge the breach

13   of contract claim.      Our brief points out how the

14   evidence supports damages for breach of contract.                 Now

15   Judge Kozinski in the Ninth Circuit in a case called

16   McCord v. Maguire 83 F 2d 1271 says that this waiver

17   rule means that their ability to challenge the general

18   verdict would be waived and they would be forced to live

19   with the verdict if evidence supports it.                 Under that

20   rule --

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:              If evidence supports any

22   one of the claims contained in the general rule.

23                MR. FREDERICK:           That's correct.       That's

24   correct.   The First Circuit in a case called Gillespie

25   versus Sears Roebuck, 386 F3d 21 takes the position that


                                         29

 1   if you have not filed your objection you have not waived

 2   it.

 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Who wrote that?   You

 4   gave us the benefit of the author of the Ninth Circuit,

 5   but not the First.

 6                  MR. FREDERICK:         Chief Judge -- I was about

 7   to say that.    They are both very fine opinions; they --

 8                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            You're not asking us to

 9   resolve that circuit split in this case.

10                  MR. FREDERICK:         No.      What I'm saying is that

11   the tribal court, which would be looking to Federal law

12   to resolve the effect of a supposed tainted claim -- if

13   you were to conclude that a discrimination complaint is

14   a tainted claim -- would have to evaluate what effect

15   that has on the final judgment.                And because there is a

16   circuit conflict on that question, unfortunately, I

17   cannot give you a definitive answer as to how the tribal

18   court would resolve that.

19                  My point, though, is that if this Court

20   concludes that there is a redressibility problem in this

21   case, which we would submit, respectfully, there is, the

22   appropriate course would be to vacate and remand for the

23   lower courts to certify the question to the tribal court

24   of appeals or to make some further inquiry into the law

25   to determine how --

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:               The tribal court of appeals

 2   would have to be finding Federal law.                     It wouldn't be

 3   Indian law; it would be Federal law.

 4               MR. FREDERICK:            It is --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:               You say they have adopted

 6   the Federal rules.      So whatever the Federal law -- in

 7   other words, we would ask them to answer the question

 8   that you don't want us to answer.

 9               MR. FREDERICK:            No.      I've asked you to go

10   with the Ninth Circuit Court because that is what I

11   think is the court rule.           But, Justice Scalia, any time

12   a different jurisdiction incorporates some law into its

13   own system, it is opining as a matter of Cheyenne River

14   Sioux Tribe law.   And, as Cohen's Indian law treatise

15   points out, tribal courts would not look not only to

16   Federal sources but also to State courts, too.                     The rule

17   in South Dakota follows the general verdict rule in

18   which --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   And, presumably,

20   tribal -- whatever tribal precedent there may be, as

21   well.

22               MR. FREDERICK:            That's correct although we

23   have not been able to find precedent --

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, neither could

25   -- and neither could anybody, right?                      I mean if anybody


                                         31

 1   could find it, you could.           It's because it's not


 2   published anywhere, right?


 3                 MR. FREDERICK:         Well, there are published


 4   decisions.    This Court -- this is a question of first


 5   impression.

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Certainly, your reliance

 7   upon the Federal rules doesn't impress me as much as it

 8   did when you first told me about it, because apparently

 9   the Federal rules mean whatever the tribal courts say

10   they mean; is that right?

11                 MR. FREDERICK:         No.      I think, Justice

12   Scalia, the Court would look at the various sources of

13   law --

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            And come to its own

15   decision as to what they mean.

16                 MR. FREDERICK:         Yes.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                One of the points

18   you mentioned earlier is that this is an Indian

19   corporation, and that's a concept I don't understand.

20   If Justices Scalia and Alito form a corporation, is that

21   an Italian corporation?

22                 (Laughter.)

23                 MR. FREDERICK:         I would like to beg the

24   indulgence of the Court in not answering that question

25   specifically.

 1                   (Laughter.)

 2                   MR. FREDERICK:         My point --

 3                   JUSTICE SCALIA:            And do we get special loan

 4   guarantees?

 5                   (Laughter.)

 6                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I understand the

 7   concept of a minority-owned or an Indian-owned

 8   corporation, but the point here is you are trying to say

 9   that the corporation is a member of the tribe.                    And I

10   just don't know.     And I certainly don't think the State,

11   when it incorporated this entity, said:                    You're a

12   different type of corporation than every other; you're

13   an Indian corporation.

14                   MR. FREDERICK:         Well, to the contrary,

15   Mr. Chief Justice.       There is a State supreme court case

16   on point called Pourier, which we cited in our brief,

17   which says that a majority-owned corporation under South

18   Dakota State law shall be treated as a member of that

19   tribe for the tax purposes that were at issue in that

20   case.   So --

21                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                How would a normal

22   -- I guess a non-Indian or non-Italian or non-Irish --

23   corporation dealing with the Long Family Land and Cattle

24   Company know that it was an Indian corporation --

25                   MR. FREDERICK:         Well, I --

 1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- putting apart the

 2   particulars in this case?

 3                  MR. FREDERICK:         Mr. Chief Justice, let me

 4   step back and say I'm not here to advocate that there

 5   can be different racial characteristics of corporations.

 6   What is anomalous about this case and the way the BIA

 7   has set up this program is that the BIA establishes

 8   principles of Indian identity so that it can determine

 9   whether it satisfies congressional mandates for Indian

10   financing.

11                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, I know the BIA

12   says that.    But if you're a bank and somebody comes in

13   and says:    I'm a corporation; I would like a loan, is

14   the bank supposed to start asking questions about

15   whether there are Indian shareholders, and how many, and

16   all of that?

17                  MR. FREDERICK:         Banks typically do require

18   lots of documentation, Mr. Chief Justice.

19                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So they should have

20   a check box on their loan application that says:                  Are

21   you an Indian?

22                  MR. FREDERICK:         The difference here,

23   Mr. Chief Justice, is that the bank required BIA loan

24   guarantees as a condition of making the loans.

25                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm asking you

 1   about:   In a general case, let's say they don't require

 2   BIA loan guarantees.        They require, just as in this

 3   case, collateral.

 4                  MR. FREDERICK:         They did not.           They required

 5   more, and that's the important point.                     The facts

 6   actually matter.

 7                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, I am sure the

 8   facts here matter.      I have a hypothetical question.                 A

 9   bank dealing with an Indian-owned corporation, how are

10   they supposed to find out, or may they find out, whether

11   it's an Indian-owned corporation, particularly when

12   under your approach, when they do form that contract,

13   they are subjecting themselves to tribal-court

14   jurisdiction?

15                  MR. FREDERICK:         I would acknowledge that

16   when there are no BIA loan guarantees required, a bank

17   may or may not know of the identity of the owners of the

18   corporation.

19                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And do they subject

20   themselves to tribal-court jurisdiction because they are

21   dealing with, as you call it, an Indian corporation?

22                  MR. FREDERICK:         Without further facts, no.

23   Here, though, the bank required the BIA loan.                     It went

24   on to the reservation to scrutinize the collateral.                     It

25   required personal guarantees from the tribal members.

 1   It got collateral in guarantees on the personal effects

 3               It knew that the corporation was doing all

 4   of its business on tribal trust lands.                    It went into the

 5   tribal headquarters to determine that the tribe was

 6   comfortable with the various loan arrangements.                   It

 7   enlisted the assistance of tribal financial officers to

 8   ensure that the cash flow would be a sufficient --

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   So that if the bank

10   had two -- two different types of loans, in one

11   situation the corporation comes to the bank.                   It is an

12   Indian corporation, if there is such a thing; and the

13   bank deals with it, although it doesn't know that.                     In

14   the other situation are the facts, as you suggest here;

15   and the -- dealing through the normal, collateral

16   consequences and operations of a contract with a bank,

17   they want to know the collateral, and all of that, that

18   constitutes consent, but a commercial relationship with

19   a member does not.

20               MR. FREDERICK:            I think, in general,

21   Mr. Chief Justice, I would agree with that hypothetical.

22   But here, if you took away the BIA loan piece, I think

23   the facts very strongly point to the bank knowing it was

24   engaging in a consensual relationship with Indians

25   because it went on tribal trust lands.                    It involves the

 1   officers of the tribe for effectuating the loan.

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, there are many facts

 3   here that are favorable to your position, but I would

 4   appreciate it if you could articulate the rule of law

 5   that you would like us to adopt in this case, the

 6   general principle that you would like -- the general

 7   rule that you would like us to adopt.

 8                MR. FREDERICK:           Justice Alito I don't think

 9   I can improve on the language that's in Montana in its

10   first exception, itself, which is that there are

11   consensual relations that are licensing of commercial --

12                JUSTICE ALITO:           Can that be the case:        Any

13   consensual relationship between a member of the tribe

14   and a nonmember is subject to the jurisdiction of the

15   tribal courts?

16                MR. FREDERICK:           No.      I think that the Strate

17   case imposed a nexus requirement.                  I think the liability

18   has to arise out of that consensual relationship, which

19   it clearly does here.

20                JUSTICE ALITO:           So an Indian goes to a bank

21   off the reservation and asks for a loan and gets the

22   loan.   That contract is subject to the jurisdiction of

23   the tribal courts?

24                MR. FREDERICK:           No.      I don't think

25   necessarily any loan.        I think I answered Mr. Chief

 1   Justice's question to the effect that any kind of

 2   general loan of that nature would not necessarily give

 3   rise to --

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, it has to be a known

 5   -- a known consensual relationship, for one thing.


 6   Wouldn't you add that requirement.


 7                 MR. FREDERICK:         Yes.


 8                 JUSTICE ALITO:         All right.          So the Indian


 9   goes to the bank and says:           I'm an Indian.          Give me a


10   loan.   The bank gives him a loan.                That's subject to the

11   jurisdiction of the tribal courts?

12                 MR. FREDERICK:         No.      I think, Justice Alito,

13   that there are very fine gradations in the facts.                   And

14   we are not asking for an articulation of a general rule

15   of the kind of sweeping effect that the Petitioners are

16   asking for.

17                 We are asking for a straightforward

18   application of Montana 1 on facts here that developed

19   over a substantial number of years.

20                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, isn't it necessary for

21   there to be some kind of clear notice?                   Somebody puts an

22   ad in the newspaper to sell a used car.                   Someone shows

23   up to purchase the used car.             He purchases the used car

24   and says:    And, by the way, I'm an Indian.                 That is

25   subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts?

 1                 MR. FREDERICK:         I don't think that


 2   necessarily would give rise to the kind of consensual


 3   relationship that Montana was speaking about.


 4                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, why not?         What's


 5   missing there?

 6                 MR. FREDERICK:         I think what's missing is

 7   the longevity of a relationship, the degree to which the

 8   cause of action arose out of the answering of that ad.

 9   I mean one of the features of --

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                It's an odd sort of

11   basis on which to predicate jurisdiction.                 We usually --

12   when you're dealing with jurisdiction, we usually look

13   for a bright-line rule.

14                 MR. FREDERICK:         Well, I think that the

15   necessary concomitant of having tribes with their

16   elements of sovereignty residing within States and

17   within the United States is to have somewhat less

18   bright-line features to some of these jurisdictional

19   principles.   Our submission here is that the facts --

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You said earlier --

21   I am sorry.   You said earlier that this was a

22   straightforward application of Montana?

23                 MR. FREDERICK:         Given the facts that are

24   present in this case.

 1   facts.    But isn't it true that this would be the first

 2   case in which we have asserted or allowed Indian tribal

 3   jurisdiction to be asserted over a nonmember?

 4                 MR. FREDERICK:         Yes, it would although the

 5   court in National Farmers and in Iowa Mutual could have

 6   disposed of the case simply on a bright-line-rule basis

 7   but rejected that very notion.

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Do you think it's inherent

 9   in Montana exception number 1, that an Indian tribal

10   court in the course of adjudicating commercial dealings

11   has the capacity to elaborate common law?

12                 MR. FREDERICK:         Yes.       And -- and I don't

 1   acknowledge today that if the discrimination rule had

 2   been written down, that that would be perfectly fine to

 3   put everybody on notice.         These principles of

 4   discrimination here are --

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:            He backed off on that.      I

 6   pressed the point and --

 7                (Laughter.)

 8                MR. FREDERICK:         Well, my -- my mission here

 9   is that the bank did not avail itself of any of the

10   procedures in Rule 12 to clarify the source of the law,

11   to move to dismiss the discrimination claim, to move for

12   summary judgment on the discrimination claim.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What about -- what

14   about their point that, under our system, governing is

15   based on the consent of the governed, and in this case

16   the bank has no role to play in the nature or

17   establishment of the court to which they are being

18   subjected?

19                MR. FREDERICK:         Well, in this particular

20   case, Your Honor, this bank has availed itself

21   purposefully of tribal courts on at least 14 occasions.

22   This would be the 15th case.            These are set out in the

23   tribe's brief, the amicus brief, footnotes 27, 28, and

24   29.

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, and I suppose --

 1               MR. FREDERICK:          This is not a stranger to

 2   the tribal court, Mr. Chief Justice.

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, suppose it were the

 4   first occasion?   I mean, what's the rule?                    That doesn't

 5   help me.

 6               MR. FREDERICK:          My point is --

 7               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            In other words, if you go

 8   -- if you make a mistake 14 times, you're bound to 15?

 9   That's kind of an estoppel.

10               MR. FREDERICK:          No, I'm saying that the

11   availment of the tribal court is what creates the

12   jurisdiction.   I'm saying it responds to the point that

13   the bank can hardly claim surprise.                     They know how to

14   deal with tribal law and tribal procedures.                     They could

15   have asked the nonmember judge who presided over this

16   trial to clarify how the discrimination would be done.

17   In the tribal transcript, the colloquy on discrimination

18   was rather straightforward as to treating members in a

19   fair way as compared to treating nonmembers.                     These are

20   not difficult concepts in the law.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Frederick, before you

22   finish, I would like for to you give your best answer to

23   a lurking, underlying concern, and that is the the Chief

24   Justice brought up the outsider subjected to courts

25   where the outsider has no vote.              That happens when you


                                       42

 1   sued in a State that's not your own, but there is the

 2   right to remove and also at the end of the line is this

 3   Court.   And I think in the case of the tribal courts,

 4   neither of those exist.        There's no -- you can't remove

 5   to a State or Federal court, and this Court has no

 6   review authority over a tribal court's judgment.

 7                MR. FREDERICK:         I have two suggested

 8   responses to that, Justice Ginsburg.                     One is that, when

 9   a tribal court judgment needs to be enforced, it can be

10   brought in State court, and South Dakota follows the

11   comity rule, which means that it has to satisfy certain

12   requirements of fairness, adherence to basic principles,

13   and the law before a State -- the State court will

14   enforce the tribal court judgment.                 Under national --

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Not the same faith and

16   credit that it would give to a sister State judgment?

17                MR. FREDERICK:         That's correct.             It's not

18   full faith and credit; it's comity.                     And that comity

19   provides for a substantive review while enforcing the

20   judgment.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, what if the

22   tribal law has certain cultural principles such as

23   fairness and equity of a sort that aren't recognized

24   under Federal or State law in this type of contractual

25   relationship?   Does that preclude the State court from


                                       43

 1   giving comity or not?

 2               MR. FREDERICK:            The way the South Dakota

 3   statute is worded, Mr. Chief Justice, unfortunately, I

 4   can't give you a direct answer to that because it

 5   involves a panoply of issues whether State law deems the

 6   final judgment ultimately to be a fair one and -- and,

 7   importantly, when this Court recognized the

 8   jurisdictional point as giving rise to Federal

 9   jurisdiction in National Farmers, I would submit it also

10   perhaps created the avenue for the enforcement of

11   judgments to be brought in Federal court as well.                 I

12   don't understand why a jurisdictional challenge and a

13   challenge to the enforcement of a judgment could not

14   give rise to the same Federal question jurisdiction

15   recognized in National Farmers.

16               So I think there are two avenues to be in

17   State or Federal court when enforcing a judgment in

18   tribal court that heretofore for have not fully been

19   explored, certainly not by any decisions of this Court.

20               If the Court has no further questions.

 1                        AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 2                    SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 3                 MR. GANNON:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 4   please the court:

 5                 This court's Montana framework confirms that

 6   Indian tribes can, in some circumstances, exercise

 7   legitimate authority over nonmembers and nonmember land

 8   on their reservations.        Unlike what has happened in the

 9   criminal context, the political branches have not acted

10   to divest tribes generally of civil jurisdiction over

11   nonmembers.   Both before and after Montana was decided,

12   Congress and this Court have repeatedly articulated the

13   firm Federal policy of encouraging tribal

14   self-government and have recognized that tribal justice

15   systems are an essential part of tribal governments.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, that may be; it

17   depends on what you mean by "tribal."                    I mean, it

18   certainly would be rational to say that all disputes

19   between members of the tribe can be resolved

20   authoritatively by the tribal court, but it's quite a

21   different thing to say that a dispute between a

22   nonmember of the tribe and a member of the tribe can go

23   to the tribal court.       It's sort of the analogue to being

24   home fried in a foreign State.               It's -- is pretty close.

25                 MR. GANNON:       Well, Justice Scalia, that's of


                                        45

 1   course true, that there is a difference, but the Montana

 2   framework recognizes that the political branches have

 3   not completely divested tribes of their jurisdiction

 4   over nonmembers in circumstances like this.                And --

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, you agree with

 6   your friend Mr. Frederick that Montana did not address

 7   jurisdiction over a nonmember and that this would be the

 8   first case in which we'd recognize such jurisdiction?

 9                MR. GANNON:       Well, it did not specifically

10   address any previous cases involving jurisdiction over a

11   nonmember defendant who is hailed into Federal court.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Defendant, yes.

13                MR. GANNON:       But I think it is -- it is the

14   case that it clearly recognized a consensual

15   relationship that is established before the lawsuit

16   begins is what provides for regulatory jurisdiction in

17   some of the cases and adjudicatory jurisdiction, as is

18   now clear from Strate and the Court's subsequent

19   decisions.

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            In your view, does

21   jurisdiction follow all regulatory authority?                If it's

22   within regulatory authority, then is it your position

23   that there is necessarily jurisdiction to enforce in a

24   tribal court --

25                MR. GANNON:       Well --

 1                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           -- in civil cases?

 2                  MR. GANNON:       Well, in Iowa Mutual, this

 3   Court did state that tribal courts are best qualified to

 4   interpret and apply tribal law.                And so --

 5                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           In your position, is

 6   regulatory jurisdiction concomitant with civil judicial

 7   jurisdiction in the tribal court?

 8                  MR. GANNON:       Generally, yes.

 9                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What happens if the

10   bank deals with a corporation that is not an Indian

11   corporation, and then that --               the shareholders of that

12   corporation sell their shares to Indians?

13                  MR. GANNON:       Well --

14                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Does the bank now

15   have a consensual relationship with an Indian

16   corporation?

17                  MR. GANNON:       Well, I think, Mr. Chief

18   Justice, to expand upon the discussion that you were

19   having with Mr. Frederick, that the consensual

20   relationship that's necessary to establish jurisdiction

21   in the sense of Montana's first exception requires not

22   only that there be a consensual relationship with a

23   member, and which we do think that implicit in that is

24   some knowledge at least objective knowledge that you

25   knew you were dealing with a tribal member.                  And so if


                                         47

 1   the conceptual relationship were established and with

 2   somebody who was not a nonmember who subsequently ended

 3   up through sales of shares to become a member, we don't

 4   think that that ex post facto development would effect

 5   the establishment of the original relationship.

 6                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            You would add on the

 7   reservation?    I mean --

 8                  MR. GANNON:       Yes, absolutely, Justice

 9   Scalia.   That is something --

10                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            If he walks into some town

11   in South Dakota, the mere fact that you know he's an

12   Indian -- it has to be on the reservation.

13                  MR. GANNON:       Absolutely, Justice Scalia, and

14   that follows directly from the terms in Montana itself

15   because Montana says that the exceptions are are about

16   instances of, quote, "civil jurisdiction over

17   non-Indians on the reservation."                 And that's an

18   important factor.

19                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, but the only

20   reason -- the only reason the bank is on the reservation

21   is because the land was collateral, right?

22                  MR. GANNON:       The only reason --

23                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                They didn't want to

24   buy land on a reservation; they wanted to make a loan

25   and get the interest or whatever, and it just turned out


                                         48

 1   that the Indians defaulted, and therefore they were left

 2   with a land on a reservation.            Is that consensual?

 3               MR. GANNON:       Well, everything about this

 4   transaction is related to the reservation.               To be sure,

 5   part of it dealt with the land on the reservation, but

 6   the rest of the ranch's operations, including places

 7   where the bank possessed collateral and security

 8   interest in personal property, were on tribal grazing

 9   land.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So if it's a

11   different -- the Indian -- the corporation is owned by

12   members on the reservation, the collateral they put up

13   is off the reservation, is there consensual dealings

14   with the corporation then?

15               MR. GANNON:       Well, the thing that's key

16   here, I believe, is that the subject of the contract was

17   intimately connected with the reservation itself, and

18   that's why it comes within Montana's discussion of civil

19   jurisdiction.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Yes, but the subject

21   of the contract is loan to a corporation owned by

22   Indians on the reservation.            The collateral put up is

23   other land that the corporation owns or the individuals

24   own off the reservation.        Jurisdiction or not.

25               MR. GANNON:       Without any further facts, no,


                                      49

 1   I don't think that would be enough to establish

 2   jurisdiction.    What's important here is that the subject

 3   of the contract was actually on the reservation, and

 4   that's why it comes in --

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I guess, what I

 6   meant, what do you mean by the subject of the contract?

 7                 MR. GANNON:        Well, the loan here was for

 8   specific purposes.      It was for -- I mean, there were a

 9   lot of specific terms in which the bank dictated lots of

10   practices on the ranch, and it knew everything about the

11   way the operation was being conducted or required

12   express approval for individual purchases and things

13   like that.    And so, this is not an instance where a

14   member is engaging in business off the reservation.

15                 And indeed in Blaze Construction the court

16   addressed a case in which there was a member-owned

17   corporation that was doing business on a different

18   reservation, and the parties conceded there that that

19   would not be considered to be a member for purposes of

20   Montana -- that was actually a taxation case, but it

21   would not be considered a member for purposes of these

22   exceptions.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Am I correct that the

24   collateral here, the land, the land that was collateral

25   was within the reservation but it was not Indian land.

 1                  MR. GANNON:       Well, that's generally correct,

 2   Justice Scalia.    There is a little bit of a dispute in

 3   the probate proceedings about exactly the status of the

 4   land.   But, yes, this transaction did involve transfer

 5   of the deed to the bank, and therefore, at that point it

 6   would have been -- to the extent that that transfer was

 7   effective, it would have been a nonmember only on the

 8   reservation.

 9                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            And you think that that's

10   enough.   It doesn't have to -- when you say "on the

11   reservation," you include as on the reservation land

12   that is no longer owned by Indians but -- but is within

13   the reservation boundaries.

14                  MR. GANNON:       The thing that triggers the

15   regulation here or the jurisdictional authority of the

16   tribe is the consensual relationship with the tribal

17   member.   And so it's -- it's -- it's not -- this

18   isn't -- this isn't like a tort that occurred on a

19   particular piece of land while we are asking --

20                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            No, no, wait.       You say that

21   consensual relationship is not enough.                    If you enter

22   into relationship with Indian in South Dakota on, you

23   know -- in the State capital, that isn't enough.                    It has

24   to be on the reservation.            You acknowledge that.          And

25   for purposes of on the reservation, it's enough that

 1   you're dealing with land that is within the reservation

 2   even -- even if it is no longer Indian land?

 3                  MR. GANNON:       Yes, Justice Scalia.             And the

 4   Montana exception to deal with jurisdiction --

 5                  JUSTICE ALITO:         Does "on the land" mean --

 6   "on the reservation" mean land on the reservation or

 7   does it extend any further than that?

 8                  MR. GANNON:       I -- I -- I can't say --

 9                  JUSTICE ALITO:         Let's say an Indian gets an

10   auto loan for a vehicle to be used in a business on the

11   reservation.    Is that on the reservation?

12                  MR. GANNON:       In general, the sale of goods

13   off the reservation, unless there is some particularly

14   intimate connection with the reservation that -- that

15   the parties anticipate at the time, probably isn't going

16   to be enough to trigger jurisdiction.                     And so --

17                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What about a home

18   equity loan for home on the reservation.

19                  MR. GANNON:       For a home that's on the

20   reservation?

21                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Yes.

22                  MR. GANNON:       And it's for remodeling the

23   home --

24                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Whatever home equity

25   loans are for.

 1                  MR. GANNON:       Yes.       I think that that's -- if

 2   it were going to be used for something completely off

 3   the reservation, then maybe an argument could be made

 4   that it doesn't have enough to do with regulating

 5   activities that are occurring on the reservation.

 6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, they are going

 7   to add -- add a new wing onto the -- new room on to

 8   their home.

 9                  MR. GANNON:       And that's an example where I

10   do think that --

11                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So if Chase

12   Manhattan gets a home equity loan application from

13   somebody and they grant the home equity loan, they are

14   now subject to being sued in tribal court?

15                  MR. GANNON:       If they know that they are

16   dealing with a member and they have not included any

17   form selection or choice of law provisions that say that

18   they want to be sued and resolve disputes in some other

19   forum, then it may well be the case that they will be

20   sued in tribal court.

21                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What if the tribal

22   court has a rule that forum selection provisions are not

23   enforceable?

24                  MR. GANNON:       Well, I think it's probably

25   unlikely that the tribal courts would -- or that the


                                         53

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   tribe would adopt a rule like that, because as a


 2   pragmatic matter it would make it more difficult for


 3   their citizens to engage in business relationships if


 4   they had a categorical ban like that.                     And so --

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But then could you go

 6   into Federal court under what was in farmers and say we

 7   had no jurisdiction because we had a forum selection

 8   clause?

 9               MR. GANNON:          I -- if -- if there was a forum

10   that would be a question about the nature of the

11   underlyng consent.      And I do think that, in general,

12   forum selection clauses here ought to be enforced.                     And

13   so, it would be relevant to the scope of the consentual

14   relationship there.

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Does the judgment

16   here that the bank discriminated against the Indian

17   corporation because they didn't give them as favorable

18   terms as they gave someone who hadn't defaulted on a

19   loan impede dealings with Indian corporations by outside

20   members -- outside nonmembers?

21               MR. GANNON:          Well, as was pointed out

22   earlier, Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the -- the only

23   duties that the bank was exposed to here were a duty not

24   to breach contracts and not to discriminate.                     And the

25   only question is the source of those duties.

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   What was the basis

 2   for the finding of discrimination?

 3                MR. GANNON:          It was the -- under --

 4   according to the jury instruction it was a person or

 5   entity denied a privilege to a person based solely upon

 6   that person's race or tribal identity.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   It had nothing to

 8   do -- the bank's justification had nothing to do with

 9   the fact that the entity had defaulted earlier?

10                MR. GANNON:          No, I don't believe so, Your

11   Honor.   Thank you.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

14                  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL A. BANKER

15                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16                MR. BANKER:          I think when you step back in

17   listening to the arguments of opposing counsel, you

18   know, what is the other way that tribal courts get --

19   that the tribes get jurisdiction over nonmembers?                   Well,

20   Congress can provide it.            And if we look at this Bureau

21   of Indian Affairs loan guaranty program, which Congress

22   authorized, Congress didn't provide jurisdiction over

23   nonmembers in implementation of that program.

24                So you've got an elaborate loan program and

25   it's designed to provide capital to tribes and tribal


                                          55

 1   members, and Congress is silent on that.

 2                  Now, in other instances Congress has

 3   provided authorization for tribal courts and tribes to

 4   have jurisdiction over nonmembers.                   Congress is aware of

 5   this Court's opinion in Montana presumably and the cases

 6   that follow from it, but in the Bureau of Indian Affairs

 7   loan guaranty program Congress remained silent.                  What do

 8   we infer from that?

 9                  I think it is crucial when you think about

10   nonmember defendants in tribal court and whether they

11   can have their rights adjudicated there to think about

12   the structural problems, the lack of a right to remove,

13   the lack of a right to have this Court provide a

14   substantive review.       There is no --

15                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What general principle

16   underscores the validity of your point that it's -- is

17   it a republican form of government law, Due Process

18   Clause?   What is the general principle you rely on to

19   say we have to look to the structure of these courts?

20   If the structure is insufficient, then it violates what

21   prohibition in the Constitution?

22                  MR. BANKER:       I think that the -- you know,

23   the tribal courts stand outside of the Federal -- of the

24   Federal-State relationship.               I think it is a question of

25   due process.    I think it is a question of equal

 1   protection.

 2                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Due process for whom?          The

 3   tribal courts aren't governed -- aren't creatures that

 4   are subject to the Due Process Clause.

 5                  MR. BANKER:       Well, that's exactly the point.

 6   I mean it is the due process right of the nonmember.

 7                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What is -- what is the

 8   constitutional prohibition that is a restriction on

 9   assigning cases to a court that does not follow the Due

10   Process Clause if it's an Indian court?                   It's not the

11   same as if we assign this to the American Arbitration

12   Association.    What's the difference?

13                  MR. BANKER:       I think the difference is the

14   constitutional protections of nonmembers do not apply

15   down to tribal courts.
