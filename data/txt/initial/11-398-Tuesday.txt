 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9                  GENERAL VERRILLI:         Mr. Chief Justice, and

10   may it please the Court:

11                  The Affordable Care Act addresses a

12   fundamental and enduring problem in our health care

13   system and our economy.         Insurance has become the

14   predominant means of paying for health care in this

15   country.     Insurance has become the predominant means of

16   paying for health care in this country.                For most

17   Americans, for more than 80 percent of Americans, the

18   insurance system does provide effective access.                   Excuse

19   me.

20                  But for more than 40 million Americans who

21   do not have access to health insurance either through

22   their employer or through government programs such as

23   Medicare or Medicaid, the system does not work.                   Those

24   individuals must resort to the individual market, and

25   that market does not provide affordable health

                                      3

 1   insurance.   It does not do so because it -- because the

 2   multibillion dollar subsidies that are available for

 3   the -- the employer market are not available in the

 4   individual market.     It does not do so because ERISA and

 5   HIPAA regulations that preclude -- that preclude

 6   discrimination against people based on their medical

 7   history do not apply in the individual market.              That is

 8   an economic problem.       And it begets another economic

 9   problem.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why aren't those problems

11   that the Federal Government can address directly?

12                GENERAL VERRILLI:             They can address it

13   directly, Justice Scalia, and they are addressing it

14   directly through this -- through this Act by regulating

15   the means by which health care -- by which health care

16   is purchased.   That is the way this Act works.

17                Under the Commerce Clause, what Congress has

18   done is to enact reforms of the insurance market,

19   directed at the individual insurance market, that

20   preclude -- that preclude discrimination based on

21   pre-existing conditions, that require guaranteed issue

22   and community rating.       And it uses -- and the minimum

23   coverage provision is necessary to carry into execution

24   those insurance reforms --

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Can you create Congress --

 1   commerce order to regulate it?

 2                  GENERAL VERRILLI:           That's not what's going

 3   on here, Justice Kennedy, and we're not seeking to

 4   defend the law on that basis.

 5                  In this case, the -- what is being regulated

 6   is the method of financing health -- the purchase of

 7   health care.     That itself is economic activity with

 8   substantial effects on interstate commerce.                 And --

 9                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           So, any self-purchasing?

10   Anything I -- you know, if I'm in any market at all, my

11   failure to purchase something in that market subjects me

12   to regulation.

13                  GENERAL VERRILLI:           No.     That's not our

14   position at all, Justice Scalia.                 In the health care

15   market -- the health care market is characterized by the

16   fact that aside from the few groups that Congress chose

17   to exempt from the minimum coverage requirement -- those

18   who for religious reasons don't participate, those who

19   are incarcerated, Indian tribes -- virtually everybody

20   else is either in that market or will be in that market,

21   and a distinguishing feature of that is that they

22   cannot -- people cannot generally control when they

23   enter that market or what they need when they enter that

24   market.

25                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, the same, it

                                      5

 1   seems to me, would be true, say, for the market in

 2   emergency services:      police, fire, ambulance, roadside

 3   assistance, whatever.

 4                  You don't know when you're going to need it;

 5   you're not sure that you will.             But the same is true for

 6   health care.     You don't know if you're going to need a

 7   heart transplant or if you ever will.                So, there's a

 8   market there.     In some extent, we all participate in it.

 9                  So, can the government require you to buy a

10   cell phone because that would facilitate responding when

11   you need emergency services?             You can just dial 911 no

12   matter where you are?

13                  GENERAL VERRILLI:          No, Mr. Chief Justice.        I

14   think that's different.         It's -- we -- I don't think we

15   think of that as a market.            This is a market.      This is

16   market regulation.     And, in addition, you have a

17   situation in this market not only where people enter

18   involuntarily as to when they enter and won't be able to

19   control what they need when they enter, but when they --

20                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             It seems to me

21   that's the same as in my hypothetical.                You don't know

22   when you're going to need police assistance.                You can't

23   predict the extent to emergency response that you'll

24   need, but when you do -- and the government provides it.

25   I thought that was an important part of your argument,

                                      6

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that when you need health care, the government will make

 2   sure you get it.

 3               Well, when you need police assistance or

 4   fire assistance or ambulance assistance, the government

 5   is going to make sure to the best extent it can that you

 6   get it.

 7               GENERAL VERRILLI:            I think the fundamental

 8   difference, Mr. Chief Justice, is that that's not an

 9   issue of market regulation.            This is an issue of market

10   regulation, and that's how Congress -- that's how

11   Congress looked at this problem.            There is a market.

12   Insurance is provided through a market system --

13               JUSTICE ALITO:          Do you think there is a

14   market for burial services?

15               GENERAL VERRILLI:            For burial services?

16               JUSTICE ALITO:          Yes.

17               GENERAL VERRILLI:            Yes, Justice Alito, I

18   think there is.

19               JUSTICE ALITO:          All right.    Suppose that you

20   and I walked around downtown Washington at lunch hour

21   and we found a couple of healthy young people and we

22   stopped them and we said:        You know what you're doing?

23   You are financing your burial services right now because

24   eventually you're going to die, and somebody is going to

25   have to pay for it, and if you don't have burial

                                    7

 1   insurance, or you haven't saved money for it, you're

 2   going to shift the cost to somebody else.

 3                Isn't that a very artificial way of talking

 4   about what somebody is doing?

 5                GENERAL VERRILLI:          No --

 6                JUSTICE ALITO:          And if that's true, why

 7   isn't it equally artificial to say that somebody who is

 8   doing absolutely nothing about health care is financing

 9   health care services?

10                GENERAL VERRILLI:          It's -- I think it's

11   completely different.      The -- and the reason is that the

12   burial example is not -- the difference is here you are

13   regulating the method by which you are paying for

14   something else -- health care -- and the insurance

15   requirement I think -- the key thing here is my

16   friends on the other side acknowledge that it is within

17   the authority of Congress under Article I under the

18   commerce power to impose guaranteed-issue and

19   community-rating reforms, to end -- to impose a minimum

20   coverage provision.     Their argument is just that it has

21   to occur at the point of sale, and --

22                JUSTICE ALITO:          I don't see the difference.

23   You can get burial insurance.           You can get health

24   insurance.   Most people are going to need health care,

25   almost everybody.     Everybody is going to be buried or

 2                 GENERAL VERRILLI:         Well, one big

 3   difference --

 4                 JUSTICE ALITO:         What's the difference?

 5                 GENERAL VERRILLI:         One big difference,

 6   Justice Alito, is the -- you don't have the cost

 7   shifting to other market participants.           Here --

 8                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Sure you do, because if you

 9   don't have money, then the State is going to pay for it

10   or some --

11                 GENERAL VERRILLI:         But that's different.

12                 JUSTICE ALITO:         A family member is going to

13   pay for it.

14                 GENERAL VERRILLI:         That's a difference, and

15   it's a significant difference, that this -- in this

16   situation, one of the economic effects Congress is

17   addressing is that the -- there -- the many billions of

18   dollars of uncompensated costs are transferred directly

19   to other market participants.           It's transferred directly

20   to other market participants because health care

21   providers charge higher rates in order to cover the cost

22   of uncompensated care, and insurance companies reflect

23   those higher rates in higher premiums, which Congress

24   found translates to a thousand dollars per family in

25   additional health insurance costs.

 1                JUSTICE ALITO:          But isn't that really a

 2   small part of what the mandate is doing?           You can

 3   correct me if these figures are wrong, but it appears to

 4   me that the CBO has estimated that the average premium

 5   for a single insurance policy in the non-group market

 6   will be roughly $5,800 in -- in 2016.

 7                Respondents -- the economists who have

 8   supported the Respondents estimate that a young, healthy

 9   individual targeted by the mandate on average consumes

10   about $854 in health services each year.           So, the

11   mandate is forcing these people to provide a huge

12   subsidy to the insurance companies for other purposes

13   that the Act wishes to serve, but isn't -- if those

14   figures are right, isn't it the case that what this

15   mandate is really doing is not requiring the people who

16   are subject to it to pay for the services that they are

17   going to consume?    It is requiring them to subsidize

18   services that will be received by somebody else.

19                GENERAL VERRILLI:          No, I think that -- and I

20   do think that's what the Respondents argue.           It's just

21   not right.   I think it -- it really gets to a

22   fundamental problem with their argument.

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          If you're going to have

24   insurance, that's how insurance works.

25                GENERAL VERRILLI:          (A) it is how insurance

                                    10

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   works, but (b) the problem that they -- that they're

 2   identifying is not that problem.              The guaranteed-issue

 3   and community-rating reforms do not have the effect of

 4   forcing insurance companies to take on lots of

 5   additional people who they then can't afford to cover

 6   because they're -- they tend to be the sick, and that

 7   is -- in fact, the exact opposite is what happens here.

 8                 The -- when you enact guaranteed-issue and

 9   community-rating reforms, and you do so in the absence

10   of a minimum coverage provision, it's not that insurance

11   companies take on more and more people and then need a

12   subsidy to cover it; it's that fewer and fewer people

13   end up with insurance because the rates are not

14   regulated.    Insurance companies, when they -- when they

15   have to offer guaranteed issue and community rating,

16   they're entitled to make a profit.                They charge rates

17   sufficient to cover only the sick population because

18   healthy people --

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Could you help -- would

20   help me with this?     Assume for the moment -- you may

21   disagree.    Assume for the moment that this is

22   unprecedented.    This is a step beyond what our cases

23   have allowed, the affirmative duty to act to go into

24   commerce.    If that is so, do you not have a heavy burden

25   of justification?

 1               I understand that we must presume laws are

 2   constitutional, but, even so, when you are changing the

 3   relation of the individual to the government in this,

 4   what we can stipulate is, I think, a unique way, do you

 5   not have a heavy burden of justification to show

 6   authorization under the Constitution?

 7               GENERAL VERRILLI:         So, two things about

 8   that, Justice Kennedy.     First, we think this is

 9   regulation of people's participation in the health care

10   market, and all it -- all this minimum coverage

11   provision does is say that, instead of requiring

12   insurance at the point of sale, that Congress has the

13   authority under the commerce power and the necessary and

14   proper power to ensure that people have insurance in

15   advance of the point of sale because of the unique

16   nature of this market, because this is a market in

17   which -- in which you -- although most of the population

18   is in the market most of the time -- 83 percent visit a

19   physician every year; 96 percent over a 5-year period --

20   so, virtually everybody in society is in this market.

21               And you've got to pay for the health care

22   you get, the predominant way in which it's -- in which

23   it's paid for is insurance, and -- and the Respondents

24   agree that Congress could require that you have

25   insurance in order to get health care or forbid health

 1   care from being provided --

 2                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Why do you -- why do you

 3   define the market that broadly?              Health care.    It may

 4   well be that everybody needs health care sooner or

 5   later, but not everybody needs a heart transplant.                   Not

 6   everybody needs a liver transplant.                Why -- I mean --

 7                  GENERAL VERRILLI:           That's correct, Justice

 8   Scalia, but you never know whether you're going to be

 9   that person.

10                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Could you define the

11   market -- everybody has to buy food sooner or later.

12   So, you define the market as food; therefore,

13   everybody's in the market; therefore, you can make

14   people buy broccoli.

15                  GENERAL VERRILLI:           No, that is quite

16   different.     It is quite different.             The food market,

17   while it shares that trait that everybody's in it, it is

18   not a market in which your participation is often

19   unpredictable and often involuntary.                It is not a market

20   in which you often don't know before you go in what you

21   need, and it is not a market in which, if you go in

22   and -- and seek to obtain a product or service, you will

23   get it even if you can't pay for it.                It doesn't have --

24                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, is that a principled

25   basis for distinguishing this from other situations?                   I

                                     13

 1   mean, you know, you could also say, well, the person

 2   subject to this has blue eyes.                That would indeed

 3   distinguish it from other situations.

 4                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              It is a --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:              Is it a principled basis?

 6   I mean, it's -- it's a basis that explains why the

 7   government is doing this, but is it -- is it a basis

 8   which shows that this is not going beyond what -- what

 9   the system of enumerated powers allows the government to

10   do.

11                 GENERAL VERRILLI:              Yes, for two reasons.

12   First, this -- the test, as this Court has articulated

13   it, is:   Is Congress regulating economic activity with a

14   substantial effect on interstate commerce?

15                 The way in which this statute satisfies the

16   test is on the basis of the factors that I have

17   identified.    It --

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Verrilli, I thought

19   that your main point is that, unlike food or any other

20   market, when you made the choice not to buy insurance,

21   even though you have every intent in the world to

22   self-insure, to save for it, when disaster strikes, you

23   may not have the money.           And the tangible result of it

24   is -- we were told -- there was one brief that Maryland

25   hospital care bills 7 percent more because of these

                                       14

 1   uncompensated costs, that families pay a thousand

 2   dollars more than they would if there were no

 3   uncompensated costs.

 4               I thought what was unique about this is it's

 5   not my choice whether I want to buy a product to keep me

 6   healthy, but the cost that I am foisting on other people

 7   if I don't buy the product sooner rather than later.

 8               GENERAL VERRILLI:              That is -- and that is

 9   definitely a difference that distinguished this market

10   and justifies this as a regulation --

11               JUSTICE BREYER:              All right.     So, if that is

12   your difference --

13               GENERAL VERRILLI:              -- of common activity.

14               JUSTICE BREYER:              If that is your difference,

15   I'm somewhat uncertain about your answers to -- for

16   example, Justice Kennedy asked, can you, under the

17   Commerce Clause, Congress, create commerce where

18   previously none existed?

19               GENERAL VERRILLI:              Well --

20               JUSTICE BREYER:              Yes, I thought the answer

21   to that was, since McCulloch v.              Maryland, when the

22   Court said Congress could create the Bank of the United

23   States which did not previously exist, which job was to

24   create commerce that did not previously exist, since

25   that time the answer has been "yes."                 I would have

                                     15

 1   thought that your answer to, can the government, in

 2   fact, require you to buy cell phones or buy burials,

 3   that if we propose comparable situations, if we have,

 4   for example, a uniform United States system of paying

 5   for every burial such as Medicare Burial, Medicaid

 6   Burial, CHIP Burial, ERISA Burial, and emergency burial

 7   beside the side of the road, and Congress wanted to

 8   rationalize that system, wouldn't the answer be, yes, of

 9   course, they could?

10               GENERAL VERRILLI:             So --

11               JUSTICE BREYER:             And the same with the

12   computers or the same with the -- the cell phones, if

13   you're driving by the side of the highway and there is a

14   Federal emergency service.           Just as you say you have to

15   buy certain mufflers for your car that don't hurt the

16   environment, you could -- I mean, you see, doesn't it

17   depend on the situation?

18               GENERAL VERRILLI:             It does, Justice Breyer,

19   and if Congress were to enact laws like that, we --

20               JUSTICE BREYER:             Would be up here defending

21   it.

22               GENERAL VERRILLI:             It would be my

23   responsibility to defend them --

24               JUSTICE BREYER:             All right.   So, then the

25   question -- fine.

 1                GENERAL VERRILLI:          -- and I would defend

 2   them on a rationale like that, but I do think that we

 3   are advancing a narrower rationale.

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:          Well, then the question

 5   is whether or not there are any limits on the Commerce

 6   Clause.   Can you identify for us some limits on the

 7   Commerce Clause?

 8                GENERAL VERRILLI:          Yes.     The -- the

 9   rationale purely under the Commerce Clause that we're

10   advocating here would not justify forced purchases of

11   commodities for the purpose of stimulating demand.

12   We -- the -- it would not justify purchases of insurance

13   for the purposes -- in situations in which insurance

14   doesn't serve as the method of payment for a service --

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:          But why not?     If --

16                GENERAL VERRILLI:          -- Congress can regulate.

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:          If Congress says that

18   interstate commerce is affected, isn't, according to

19   your view, that the end of the analysis?

20                GENERAL VERRILLI:          No.     The -- we think that

21   in a -- when -- the difference between those situations

22   and this situation is that in those situations, Your

23   Honor, Congress would be moving to create commerce.

24   Here Congress is regulating existing commerce, economic

25   activity that is already going on, people's

                                   17

 1   participation in the health care market, and is

 2   regulating to deal with existing effects of existing

 3   commerce.

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               That, it seems to

 5   me, is -- and it's a passage in your reply brief that I

 6   didn't quite grasp.     It's the same point.            You say,

 7   "Health insurance is not purchased for its own sake like

 8   a car or broccoli; it is a means of financing

 9   health-care consumption and covering universal risks."

10               Well, a car or broccoli aren't purchased for

11   their own sake, either.        They're purchased for the sake

12   of transportation or, in broccoli, covering the need for

13   food.

14               GENERAL VERRILLI:           No --

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               I don't understand

16   that distinction.

17               GENERAL VERRILLI:           The difference, Mr. Chief

18   Justice, is that health insurance is the means of

19   payment for health care, and broccoli is --

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, now that's a

21   significant -- I'm sorry.

22               GENERAL VERRILLI:           And broccoli is not the

23   means of payment for anything else.               And an automobile

24   is not --

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               It's the means of

 2                  GENERAL VERRILLI:         But --

 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             -- just as your

 4   insurance is the means of satisfying --

 5                  GENERAL VERRILLI:         But I do think that's the

 6   difference between existing commerce, activity in the

 7   market already occurring -- the people in the health

 8   care market purchasing, obtaining health care

 9   services -- and the creation of commerce.                And the

10   principle that we're advocating here under the Commerce

11   Clause does not take the step of justifying the creation

12   of commerce.

13                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         General Verrilli, can

14   we go --

15                  GENERAL VERRILLI:         This is a regulation of

16   existing commerce.

17                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         Can we go back to --

18   Justice Breyer asked a question, and it kind of

19   interrupted your answer to my question.                And tell me if

20   I'm wrong about this, but I thought a major, major point

21   of your argument was that the people who don't

22   participate in this market are making it much more

23   expensive for the people who do; that is, they will

24   get -- a goodly number of them will get services that

25   they can't afford at the point when they need them, and

                                     19

 1   the result is that everybody else's premiums get raised.

 2                So, you're not -- it's not your free choice

 3   just to do something for yourself.              What you do is going

 4   to affect others, affect them in a major way.

 5                GENERAL VERRILLI:           That -- that absolutely

 6   is a justification for Congress's action here.              That is

 7   existing economic activity that Congress is regulating

 8   by means of this rule.

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Mr. Verrilli, you could say

10   that about buying a car.       If people don't buy cars, the

11   price that those who do buy cars pay will have to be

12   higher.   So, you can say in order to bring the price

13   down, you're hurting these other people by not buying a

14   car.

15                GENERAL VERRILLI:           That is not what we're

16   saying, Justice Scalia.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:           That's not -- that's not

18   what you're saying.

19                GENERAL VERRILLI:           That's not -- not --

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I thought it was.    I

21   thought you're saying other people are going to have to

22   pay more for insurance because you're not buying it.

23                GENERAL VERRILLI:           No.    It's because you're

24   going -- in the health care market, you're going into

25   the market without the ability to pay for what you get,

 2   the social norms that allow -- that -- to which we've

 3   obligated ourselves so that people get health care.

 4                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, don't obligate

 5   yourself to that.     Why -- you know?

 6                  GENERAL VERRILLI:           Well, I can't imagine

 7   that that -- that the Commerce Clause would -- would

 8   forbid Congress from taking into account this deeply

 9   embedded social norm.

10                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           No, you could do it.   But

11   does that expand your ability to issue mandates to ­

12   to the people?

13                  GENERAL VERRILLI:           I -- this is not a

14   purchase mandate.     This is a -- this is a law that

15   regulates the method of paying for a service that the

16   class of people to whom it applies are either

17   consuming --

18                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           General --

19                  GENERAL VERRILLI:           -- or inevitably will

20   consume.

21                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           General, I see or have

22   seen three strands of arguments in your briefs, and one

23   of them is echoed today.         The first strand that I've

24   seen is that Congress can pass any necessary laws to

25   effect those powers within its rights, i.e., because it

                                     21

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   made a decision that to effect -- to effect mandatory

 2   issuance of insurance, that it could also obligate the

 3   mandatory purchase of it.

 4               The second strand I see is self-insurance

 5   affects the market; and so, the government can regulate

 6   those who self-insure.

 7               And the third argument -- and I see all of

 8   them as different -- is that what the government is

 9   doing -- and I think it's the argument you're making

10   today -- that what the -- what the government is saying

11   is if you pay for health -- if you use health services,

12   you have to pay with insurance, because only insurance will

13   guarantee that whatever need for health care that you

14   have will be covered, because virtually no one, perhaps

15   with the exception of 1 percent of the population, can

16   afford the massive cost if the unexpected happens.

17               This third argument seems to be saying what

18   we're regulating is health care, and when you go for

19   health services, you have to pay for insurance, and

20   since insurance won't issue at the moment that you

21   consume the product, we can reasonably, necessarily tell

22   you to buy it ahead of time, because you can't buy it at

23   the moment that you need it.

24               Is that -- which of these three is your

25   argument?   Are all of them your argument?        I'm just not



                                     22

 1   sure what the --

 2                  GENERAL VERRILLI:         So, let me try to state

 3   it this way:     The Congress enacted reforms of the

 4   insurance market, the guaranteed-issue and

 5   community-rating reforms.          It did so to deal with a very

 6   serious problem that results in 40 million people not

 7   being able to get insurance and therefore not access to

 8   the health care market.         Everybody agrees in this case

 9   that those are within Congress's Article I powers.

10                  The minimum coverage provision is necessary

11   to carry those provisions into execution, because

12   without them, without those provisions, without minimum

13   coverage, guaranteed issue and community rating will, as

14   the experience in the States showed, make matters worse,

15   not better.     There will be fewer people covered; it will

16   cost more.     Now, the --

17                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          So, on that ground --

18                  GENERAL VERRILLI:         So --

19                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          -- you're answering

20   affirmatively to my colleagues that have asked you the

21   question, can the government force you into commerce?

22                  GENERAL VERRILLI:         So -- no.   No.

23                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          And there's no limit to

24   that power.

25                  GENERAL VERRILLI:         No, because that's -

                                     23

 1   that's the first part of our argument.

 2                  The second part of our argument is that the

 3   means here that Congress has chosen, the minimum

 4   coverage provision, is a means that regulates the --

 5   that regulates economic activity, namely your

 6   transaction in the health care market, with substantial

 7   effects on interstate commerce; and it is the

 8   conjunction of those two that we think provides the

 9   particularly secure foundation for this statute under

10   the commerce power.

11                  JUSTICE KAGAN:         General, you've talked on --

12   a couple of times about other alternatives that Congress

13   might have had, other alternatives that the Respondents

14   suggest to deal with this problem, in particular, the

15   alternative of mandating insurance at the point at which

16   somebody goes to a hospital or an emergency room and

17   asks for care.

18                  Did Congress consider those alternatives?

19   Why did it reject them?         How should we think about the

20   question of alternative ways of dealing with these

21   problems?

22                  GENERAL VERRILLI:         I do think, Justice

 1   authority to impose an insurance requirement or other --

 2   or other penalty at the point of sale, and they have

 3   agreed that Congress has the authority to do that to

 4   achieve the same objectives that the minimum coverage

 5   provision in the Affordable Care Act is designed to

 6   achieve.

 7                  This is a situation in which we are talking

 8   about means.     Congress gets substantial deference in

 9   the choice of means, and if one thinks about the

10   difference between the means they say Congress should

11   have chosen and the means Congress did choose, I think

12   you can see why it was eminently more sensible for

13   Congress to choose the means that it chose.

14                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:          I'm not sure which way it

15   cuts, if the Congress has alternate means.               Let's assume

16   that it could use the tax power to raise revenue and to

17   just have a national health service, single payer.               How

18   does that factor into our analysis?               In one sense, it

19   can be argued if this is what the government is doing,

20   it ought to be honest about the power that it's using

21   and use the correct power.

22                  On the other hand, it means that since the

23   Court can do it any way -- Congress can do it any way,

24   we give it a certain amount of latitude.               I'm not sure

25   which way the argument goes.

 1               GENERAL VERRILLI:              Let me try to answer that

 2   question, Justice Kennedy, and get back to the question

 3   you asked me earlier.       The -- the -- I do think one

 4   striking feature of the argument here that this is a

 5   novel exercise of power is that what Congress chose to

 6   do was to rely on market mechanisms and efficiency and a

 7   method that has more choice than would the traditional

 8   Medicare or Medicaid type model.              And so, it seems a

 9   little ironic to suggest that that counts against it.

10               But beyond that, in the sense that it's

11   novel, this provision is novel in the same way, or

12   unprecedented in the same way, that the Sherman Act was

13   unprecedented when the Court upheld it in the Northern

14   Securities case, or the Packers and Stockyards Act was

15   unprecedented when the Court upheld it, or the National

16   Labor Relations Act was unprecedented when the Court

17   upheld it in Jones & Laughlin, or the dairy price

18   supports in Wrightwood Dairy and Rock Royal.                 And --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:              No, no, it's not.     They all

20   involved commerce.     There was no doubt that what was

21   being regulated was commerce.              And here you're

22   regulating somebody who isn't commerce.

23               By the way, I don't agree with you that the

24   relevant market here is health care.              You're not

25   regulating health care.         You're regulating insurance.

                                     26

 1   It's the insurance market that you're addressing, and

 2   you're saying that some people who are not in it must be

 3   in it, and that's -- that's different from regulating in

 4   any manner commerce that already exists out there.

 5                  GENERAL VERRILLI:           Well, to the extent that

 6   we're looking at the comprehensive scheme, Justice

 7   Scalia, it is regulating commerce that already exists

 8   out there.     And the means in which that regulation is

 9   made effective here, the minimum coverage provision, is

10   a regulation of the way in which people participate, the

11   method of their payment in the health care market.                That

12   is what it is.

13                  And I do think, Justice Kennedy, getting

14   back to the question you asked before, what -- what

15   matters here is whether Congress is choosing a tool

16   that's reasonably adapted to the problem that Congress

17   is confronting.     And that may mean that the tool is

18   different from a tool that Congress has chosen to use in

19   the past.     That's not something that counts against the

20   provision in a Commerce Clause analysis.

21                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Wait.    That's -- it's both

22   "Necessary and Proper."         What you just said addresses

23   what's necessary.     Yes, has to be reasonably adapted.

24   Necessary does not mean essential, just reasonably

25   adapted.     But in addition to being necessary, it has to

                                     27

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   be proper.     And we've held in two cases that something

 2   that was reasonably adapted was not proper, because it

 3   violated the sovereignty of the States, which was

 4   implicit in the constitutional structure.

 5             The argument here is that this also is -- may be

 6   necessary, but it's not proper, because it violates an

 7   equally evident principle in the Constitution, which is

 8   that the Federal Government is not supposed to be a

 9   government that has all powers, that it's supposed to be

10   a government of limited powers.              And that's what all

11   this questioning has been about.              What -- what is left?

12   If the government can do this, what -- what else can it

13   not do?

14                  GENERAL VERRILLI:           This does not violate the

15   norm of proper, as this Court articulated it in Printz

16   or in New York, because it does not interfere with the

17   States as sovereigns.       This is a regulation that -- this

18   is a regulation --

19                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           But that -- no, that wasn't

20   my point.     That is not the only constitutional principle

21   that exists.

22                  GENERAL VERRILLI:           But it --

23                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           An equally evident

24   constitutional principle is the principle that the

25   Federal Government is a government of enumerated powers

                                     28

 1   and that the vast majority of powers remain in the

 2   States and do not belong to the Federal Government.                Do

 3   you acknowledge that that's a principle?

 4               GENERAL VERRILLI:             Of course, we do, Your

 5   Honor, but this is --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Okay.    And that's what

 7   we're talking about here.

 8               GENERAL VERRILLI:             And the way in which this

 9   Court in its cases has policed the boundary that -- of

10   what's in the national sphere and what's in the local

11   sphere is to ask whether Congress is regulating economic

12   activity with a substantial effect on interstate

13   commerce.

14               And here I think it's really impossible, in

15   view of our history, to say that Congress is invading

16   the State sphere.    This is a -- this is a market in

17   which 50 percent of the people in this country get their

18   health care through their employer.               There is a massive

19   Federal tax subsidy of $250 billion a year that makes

20   that much more affordable.           ERISA and HIPAA regulate

21   that to ensure that the kinds of bans on pre-existing

22   condition discrimination and pricing practices that

23   occur in the individual market don't occur.

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I don't understand your

25   point.   Whatever the States -

 1                 GENERAL VERRILLI:           This is in --

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Whatever the States have

 3   chosen not to do, the Federal Government can do?

 4                 GENERAL VERRILLI:           No, not at all.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I mean, the Tenth Amendment

 6   says the powers not given to the Federal Government are

 7   reserved, not just to the States, but to the States and

 8   the people.

 9                 GENERAL VERRILLI:           But what --

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           And the argument here is

11   that the people were left to decide whether they want to

12   buy insurance or not.

13                 GENERAL VERRILLI:           But this -- but, Your

14   Honor, this is -- what the Court has said, and I think

15   it would be a very substantial departure from what the

16   Court has said, is that when Congress is regulating

17   economic activity with a substantial effect on

18   interstate commerce, that will be upheld.               And that is

19   what is going on here.       And to embark on -- I would

20   submit with all due respect, to embark on the kind of

21   analysis that my friends on the other side suggest the

22   Court ought to embark on is to import Lochner-style

23   substantive due process --

 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Excuse me,

 2   Mr. Chief Justice.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               The key in Lochner

 4   is that we were talking about regulation of the States,

 5   right, and the States are not limited to enumerated

 6   powers.   The Federal Government is.               And it seems to me

 7   it's an entirely different question when you ask

 8   yourself whether or not there are going to be limits on

 9   the Federal power, as opposed to limits on the States,

10   which was the issue in Lochner.

11                GENERAL VERRILLI:            I agree, except,

12   Mr. Chief Justice, that what the Court has said, as I

13   read the Court's cases, is that the way in which you

14   ensure that the Federal Government stays in its sphere

15   and the sphere reserved for the States is protected is

16   by policing the boundary.          Is the national government

17   regulating economic activity with a substantial effect

18   on interstate commerce?

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But the -- the reason this

20   is concerning is because it requires the individual to

21   do an affirmative act.        In the law of torts, our

22   tradition, our law has been that you don't have the duty

23   to rescue someone if that person is in danger.                The

24   blind man is walking in front of a car, and you do not

25   have a duty to stop him, absent some relation between

                                     31

 1   you.   And there's some severe moral criticisms of that

 2   rule, but that's generally the rule.

 3                 And here the government is saying that the

 4   Federal Government has a duty to tell the individual

 5   citizen that it must act.         And that is different from

 6   what we have in previous cases.

 7                 GENERAL VERRILLI:          Well --

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:          And that changes the

 9   relationship of the Federal Government to the individual

10   in a very fundamental way.

11                 GENERAL VERRILLI:          I don't think so, Justice

12   Kennedy, because it is predicated on the participation

13   of these individuals in the market for health care

14   services.    Now, it happens to be that this is a market

15   in which, aside from the groups that the statute

16   excludes, virtually everybody participates.               But it is a

17   regulation of their participation in that market.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Well, but it's

19   critical how you define the market.               If I understand the

20   law, the policies that you're requiring people to

21   purchase involve -- must contain provision for maternity

22   and newborn care, pediatric services, and substance use

23   treatment.    It seems to me that you cannot say that

24   everybody is going to need substance use treatment --

25   substance use treatment or pediatric services; and yet,

                                    32

                                 Official


 1   that is part of what you require them to purchase.

 2                GENERAL VERRILLI:         Well, it's part of what

 3   the statute requires the insurers to offer.              And I think

 4   the reason is because it's trying to define minimum

 5   essential coverage because the problem --

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Yes, but your theory

 7   is that there is a market in which everyone participates

 8   because everybody might need a certain range of health

 9   care services.   And yet, the -- you're requiring people

10   who are not -- never going to need pediatric or

11   maternity services to participate in that market.

12                GENERAL VERRILLI:         The -- with respect to

13   what insurance has to cover, Your Honor, I think

14   Congress is entitled the latitude of making the

15   judgments of what the appropriate scope of coverage is.

16   And the problem here in this market is that for -- you

17   may think you're perfectly healthy and you may think

18   that you're not -- that you're being forced to subsidize

19   somebody else, but this is not a market in which you can

20   say that there is a immutable class of healthy people

21   who are being forced to subsidize the unhealthy.              This

22   is a market in which you may be healthy one day, and you

23   may be a very unhealthy participant in that market the

24   next day.   And that is a fundamental difference, and

25   you're not going to know in which -

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               I think you're

 2   posing the question I was posing, which is that doesn't

 3   apply to a lot of what you're requiring people to

 4   purchase.   Pediatric services, maternity services.                 You

 5   cannot say that everybody is going to participate in the

 6   substance use treatment market.              And yet, you require

 7   people to purchase insurance coverage for that.

 8                GENERAL VERRILLI:           Congress has got --

 9   Congress is enacting economic regulation here.                It has

10   latitude to define essential -- the attributes of

11   essential coverage.      That doesn't -- that doesn't seem

12   to me to implicate the question of whether Congress is

13   engaging in economic regulation and solving an economic

14   problem here --

15                JUSTICE ALITO:           Are you --

16                GENERAL VERRILLI:           -- and that's what

17   Congress is doing.

18                JUSTICE ALITO:           Are you denying this?        If

19   you took the group of people who are subject to the

20   mandate and you calculated the amount of health care

21   services this whole group would consume and figured out

22   the cost of an insurance policy to cover the services

23   that group would consume, the cost of that policy would

24   be much, much less than the kind of policy that these

25   people are now going to be required to purchase under

 2               GENERAL VERRILLI:          Well, while they're young

 3   and healthy, that would be true, but they're not going

 4   to be young and healthy forever.            They're going to be on

 5   the other side of that actuarial equation at some point.

 6   And, of course, you don't know which among that group is

 7   the person who's going to be hit by the bus or get the

 8   definitive diagnosis.     And that --

 9               JUSTICE ALITO:          That's not -- the point is --

10   no, you take into account that some people in that group

11   are going to be hit by a bus, some people in that group

12   are going to unexpectedly contract or be diagnosed with

13   a disease that -- that is very expensive to treat.            But

14   if you take their costs and you calculate that, that's a

15   lot less than the amount that they're going to be

16   required to pay.

17               So that you can't just justify this on the

18   basis of their trying to shift their costs off to other

19   people, can you?

20               GENERAL VERRILLI:          Well, no, the people in

21   that class get benefits, too, Justice Alito.            They get

22   the guaranteed-issue benefit that they would not

23   otherwise have, which is an enormously valuable benefit.

24               And in terms of the -- the subsidy

25   rationale, I don't think -- I think it's -- it would be

 1   unusual to say that it's an illegitimate exercise of the

 2   commerce power for some people to subsidize others.

 3   Telephone rates in this country for a century were set

 4   via the exercise of the commerce power in a way in which

 5   some people paid rates that were much higher than their

 6   costs in order to subsidize --

 8   calls.

 9                 GENERAL VERRILLI:            Well, right.   But -- but

10   everybody -- to live in the modern world, everybody

11   needs a telephone.     And the same thing with respect to

12   the -- you know, the dairy price supports that -- that

13   the Court upheld in Wrightwood Dairy and Rock Royal.

14   You can look at those as disadvantageous contracts, as

15   forced transfers, that -- you know, I suppose it's

16   theoretically true that you could raise your kids

17   without milk, but the reality is you've got to go to the

18   store and buy milk.      And the commerce power -- as a

19   result of the exercise of the commerce power, you're

20   subsidizing somebody else --

 2   subsidized?

 3                 GENERAL VERRILLI:           Well, that was the point

 4   I was trying to make, Justice Kagan, that you're young

 5   and healthy one day, but you don't stay that way, and

 6   the system works over time.             And so, I just don't think

 7   it's a fair characterization of it.              And it does get

 8   back to, I think, a problem I think is important to

 9   understand --

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           These people not stupid.

11   They're going to buy insurance later.              They're young and

12   need the money now.

13                 GENERAL VERRILLI:           But that's --

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           When they think they have a

15   substantial risk of incurring high medical bills,

16   they'll buy insurance, like the rest of us.

17                 GENERAL VERRILLI:           But that's -- that's --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't know why you think

19   they're never going to buy it.

20                 GENERAL VERRILLI:           That's the problem,

21   Justice Scalia.    That's -- and that's exactly the

22   experience that the States had that made the imposition

23   of guaranteed issue and community rating not only be

24   ineffectual but be highly counterproductive.              Rates, for

25   example, in New Jersey doubled or tripled, went from

                                    37

 1   180,000 people covered in this market down to 80,000

 2   people covered in this market.            In Kentucky, virtually

 3   every insurer left the market.

 4               And the reason for that is because when

 5   people have that guarantee of -- that they can get

 6   insurance, they're going to make that calculation that

 7   they won't get it until they're sick and they need it.

 8   And so, the pool of people in the insurance market gets

 9   smaller and smaller.     The rates you have to charge to

10   cover them get higher and higher.               It helps fewer and

11   fewer -- insurance covers fewer and fewer people until

12   the system ends.

13               This is not a situation in which you're

14   conscripting -- you're forcing insurance companies to

15   cover very large numbers of unhealthy people --

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You could solve that

17   problem by simply not requiring the insurance company to

18   sell it to somebody who has a condition that is going to

19   require medical treatment, or at least not -- not

20   require them to sell it to him at a rate that he sells

21   it to healthy people.

22               But you don't want to do that.

23               GENERAL VERRILLI:            But that seems to me to

24   say, Justice Scalia, that Congress -- that's the problem

25   here.   And that seems to me -

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:           It's a self-created

 2   problem.

 3               GENERAL VERRILLI:           -- to say that Congress

 4   cannot solve the problem through standard economic

 5   regulation, and that -- and I do not think that can be

 6   the premise of our understanding of the Commerce Clause.

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Whatever --

 8               GENERAL VERRILLI:           This is an economic

 9   problem.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- problems Congress's

11   economic regulation produces, whatever they are --

12               GENERAL VERRILLI:           I think --

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- Congress can do

14   something to counteract them.           Here, requiring somebody

15   to enter -- to enter the insurance market.

16               GENERAL VERRILLI:           This is not a -- it's not

17   a problem of Congress's creation.              The problem is that

18   you have 40 million people who cannot get affordable

19   insurance through the means that the rest of us get

20   affordable insurance.    Congress, after long study and

21   careful deliberation, and viewing the experiences of the

22   States and the way they tried to handle this problem,

23   adopted a package of reforms.           Guaranteed issue and

24   community rating and subsidies and the minimum coverage

25   provision are a package of reforms that solve that

 1   problem.

 2                  I don't -- I think it's highly artificial to

 3   view this as a problem of Congress's own creation.

 4                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Is your argument

 5   limited to insurance or means of paying for health care?

 6                  GENERAL VERRILLI:         Yes.      It's limited to

 7   insurance.

 8                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Well, now, why is

 9   that?     Congress could -- once you -- once you establish

10   that you have a market for health care, I would suppose

11   Congress's power under the Commerce Clause meant they

12   had a broad scope in terms of how they regulate that

13   market.     And it would be -- it would be going back to

14   Lochner if we were put in a position of saying, no,

15   you can use your commerce power to regulate insurance,

16   but you can't use your commerce power to regulate this

17   market in other ways.       I think that would be a very

18   significant intrusion by the Court into Congress's

19   power.

20                  So, I don't see how we can accept your --

21   it's good for you in this case to say, oh, it's just

22   insurance.     But once we say that there is a market and

23   Congress can require people to participate in it, as

24   some would say, or as you would say, that people are

25   already participating in it, it seems to me that we

                                     40

 1   can't say there are limitations on what Congress can do

 2   under its commerce power.          Just like in any other

 3   area -- given significant deference that we accord to

 4   Congress in this area, all bets are off, and you could

 5   regulate that market in any rational way.

 6                  GENERAL VERRILLI:           But this is insurance as

 7   a method of payment for health care services.                 And

 8   that --

 9                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Exactly.   You're

10   worried --

11                  GENERAL VERRILLI:           And that --

12                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             That's the area that

13   Congress has chosen to regulate.              There's this health

14   care market.     Everybody's in it.           So, we can regulate

15   it, and we're going to look at a particular serious

16   problem, which is how people pay for it.                 But next year,

17   they can decide everybody's in this market; we're going

18   to look at a different problem now, and this is how

19   we're going to regulate it.              And we can compel people to

20   do things -- purchase insurance, in this case; something

21   else in the next case -- because you've -- we've

22   accepted the argument that this is a market in which

23   everybody participates.

24                  GENERAL VERRILLI:           Mr. Chief Justice, let me

25   answer that, and then if I may, I'd like to move to the

 1   tax power argument.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Can I tell you what the

 3   something else is so -- while you're answering it?

 4                (Laughter.)

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:           The something else is

 6   everybody has to exercise, because there's no doubt that

 7   lack of exercise cause -- causes illness, and that

 8   causes health care costs to go up.              So, the Federal

 9   Government says everybody has to join a -- an exercise

10   club.   That's the something else.

11                GENERAL VERRILLI:           No.    The position we're

12   taking here would not justify that rule, Justice Scalia,

13   because health club membership is not a means of payment

14   for -- for consumption of anything in a market.                And --

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Right.   Right.

16   That's exactly right, but it doesn't seem responsive to

17   my concern that there's no reason -- once we say this is

18   within Congress's commerce power, there's no reason

19   other than our own arbitrary judgment to say all they

20   can regulate is the method of payment.              They can

21   regulate other things that affect this now-conceded

22   interstate market in health care in which everybody

23   participates.

24                GENERAL VERRILLI:           But I think it's common

25   ground between us and the Respondents that this is an

                                   42

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   interstate market in which everybody participates.

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Right.

 3                 GENERAL VERRILLI:            And they agree that

 4   Congress could impose the insurance requirement at the

 5   point of sale.    And this is just a question of timing

 6   and whether Congress's -- whether the necessary and

 7   proper authority gives Congress, because of the

 8   particular features of this market, the ability to

 9   impose the -- the insurance, the need for insurance, the

10   maintenance of insurance before you show up to get

11   health care, rather than at the moment you get up to --

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Right.   No, I think

13   you're just --

14                 GENERAL VERRILLI:            -- show up to get health

15   care.    And that --

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Unless I'm missing

17   something, I think you're just repeating the idea that

18   this is the regulation of the method of payment.                   And I

19   understand that argument.            And it may be --

20                 GENERAL VERRILLI:            And it is --

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                It may be a good

22   one.    But what I'm concerned about is, once we accept

23   the principle that everybody is in this market, I don't

24   see why Congress's power is limited to regulating the

25   method of payment and doesn't include as it does in any

 1   other area.

 2                 What other area have we said Congress can

 3   regulate this market but only with respect to prices,

 4   but only with respect to means of travel?               No.   Once

 5   you're -- once you're in the interstate commerce and can

 6   regulate it, pretty much all bets are off.

 7                 GENERAL VERRILLI:          But we agree Congress can

 8   regulate this market.      ERISA regulates this market.

 9   HIPAA regulates this market.            The market is regulated at

10   the Federal level in very significant ways already.                  So,

11   I don't think that's the question, Mr. Chief Justice.

12   The question is, is there a limit to the authority that

13   we're advocating here under the commerce power?                And the

14   answer is yes, because we are not advocating for a power

15   that would allow Congress to compel purchases.

16                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Could you just say--

17                 GENERAL VERRILLI:          Yes.

18                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Before you move on, could

19   you express your limiting principle as succinctly as you

20   possibly can?    Congress can force people to purchase a

21   product where the failure to purchase the product has a

22   substantial effect on interstate commerce, if what?                  If

23   this is part of a larger regulatory scheme?

24                 GENERAL VERRILLI:          We've got --

25                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Is that it?

 1               GENERAL VERRILLI:            We've got --

 2               JUSTICE ALITO:            Is there anything more?

 3               GENERAL VERRILLI:            We got two and they're --

 4   they're different.     Let me state them.             First, with

 5   respect to the comprehensive scheme.                When Congress is

 6   regulating -- is enacting a comprehensive scheme that it

 7   has the authority to enact, that the Necessary and

 8   Proper Clause gives it the authority to include

 9   regulation, including a regulation of this kind, if it

10   is necessary to counteract risks attributable to the

11   scheme itself that people engage in economic activity

12   that would undercut the scheme.              It's like -- it's very

13   much like Wickard in that respect.                Very much like Raich

14   in that respect.

15               With respect to the -- with respect to

16   the -- considering the Commerce Clause alone and not

17   embedded in the comprehensive scheme, our position is

18   that Congress can regulate the method of payment by

19   imposing an insurance requirement in advance of the time

20   in which the -- the service is consumed when the class

21   to which that requirement applies either is, or virtually

22   most certain to be, in that market, when the timing of

23   one's entry into that market and what you will need when

24   you enter that market is uncertain, and when -- when you

25   will get the care in that market, whether you can afford

                                     45

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   to pay for it or not and shift costs to other market

 2   participants.

 3               So, those -- those are our views as to --

 4   those are the principles we're advocating for, and it's,

 5   in fact, the conjunction of the two of them here that

 6   makes this, we think, a strong case under the Commerce

 7   Clause.

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             General, could you turn

 9   to the tax clause?

10               GENERAL VERRILLI:            Yes.     Thank you,so --

11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             I have looked for a case

12   that involves the issue of whether something denominated

13   by Congress as a penalty was nevertheless treated as a

14   tax, except in those situations where the code itself or

15   the statute itself said treat the penalty as a tax.

16               Do you know of any case where we've done

17   that?

18               GENERAL VERRILLI:            Well, I think I would

19   point the Court to the license tax case, where it was --

20   was denominated a fee, a nontax, and the Court upheld it

21   as an exercise of the taxing power, in a situation in

22   which the structure of the law was very much like the

23   structure of this law, in that there was a separate

24   stand-alone provision that set the predicate and then a

25   separate provision imposing the fee.

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, fees -- you know,

 2   license fees, fees for a hunting license -- everybody

 3   knows those are taxes.       I mean, I don't think there's as

 4   much of a difference between a fee and a tax as there is

 5   between a penalty and a tax.

 6                 GENERAL VERRILLI:           And that -- and I think

 7   in terms of the tax power, I think it's useful to

 8   separate this into two questions.                One is a question of

 9   characterization.    Can this be characterized as a tax?

10   And, second, is it a constitutional exercise of the

11   power?

12                 With respect to the question of

13   characterization, the -- this is in the Internal Revenue

14   Code.    It is administered by the IRS.              It is paid on

15   your Form 1040 on April 15th.             I think --

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But yesterday you told

17   me -- you listed a number of penalties that are enforced

18   through the tax code that are not taxes, and they're not

19   penalties related to taxes.

20                 GENERAL VERRILLI:           They may still be

21   exercise of the tax -- exercises of the taxing power,

22   Justice Ginsburg, as this is, and I think there isn't a

23   case in which the Court has, to my mind, suggested

24   anything that bears this many indicia of a tax can't be

25   considered as an exercise of the taxing power.

 1                 In fact, it seems to me the license tax

 2   cases point you in the opposite direction.               And beyond

 3   that, your -- the -- it seems to me the right way to

 4   think about this question is whether it is capable of

 5   being understood as an exercise of the tax power.

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           The President said it

 7   wasn't a tax, didn't he?

 8                 GENERAL VERRILLI:           Well, Justice Scalia,

 9   what the -- two things about that.               First is, it seems

10   to me, what matters is what power Congress was

11   exercising.    And they were -- and I think it's clear

12   that the -- they were exercising the tax power as well

13   as the commerce power.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           You're making two

15   arguments.    Number one, it's a tax.             And, number two,

16   even if it isn't a tax, it's within the taxing power.

17   I'm just addressing the first.

18                 GENERAL VERRILLI:           What the President

19   said --

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Is it a tax or not a tax?

21   The President didn't think it was.

22                 GENERAL VERRILLI:           The President said it

23   wasn't a tax increase because it ought to be understood

24   as an incentive to get people to have insurance.                I

25   don't think it's fair to infer from that anything about

                                    48

 1   whether that is an exercise of the tax power or not.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:         Well, isn't -- a tax is

 3   to raise revenue.    A tax is a revenue-raising device,

 4   and the purpose of this exaction is to get people into

 5   the health care risk pool before they need medical care.

 6   And so, it will be successful if it doesn't raise any

 7   revenue, if it gets people to buy the insurance.

 8   That's -- that's what this penalty is -- this penalty is

 9   designed to affect conduct.

10                 The conduct is buy health protection, buy

11   health insurance before you have a need for medical

12   care.    That's what the penalty is designed to do, not to

13   raise revenue.

14                 GENERAL VERRILLI:         That -- that is true,

15   Justice Ginsburg.    That is also true of the marijuana

16   tax that was upheld in Sanchez.             That's commonly true of

17   penalties under the code.         They do -- if they raise

18   revenue, they are exercises of the taxing power.             But

19   their purpose is not to raise revenue; their purpose is

20   to discourage behavior.

21                 The mortgage deduction works that

22   way.    When the mortgage deduction is -- it's clearly an

23   exercise of the taxing power.           When it's successful, it

24   raises less revenue for the Federal Government.             It's

25   still an exercise of the taxing power.             So, I don't -

 1                 JUSTICE KAGAN:         I suppose, though, General,

 2   one question is whether the determined efforts of

 3   Congress not to refer to this as a tax make a

 4   difference.    I mean, you're suggesting we should just

 5   look to the practical operation.             We shouldn't look at

 6   labels.   And that seems right, except that here we have

 7   a case in which Congress determinedly said this is not a

 8   tax.   And the question is why should that be irrelevant?

 9                 GENERAL VERRILLI:         I don't think that that's

10   a fair characterization of the actions of Congress here,

11   Justice Kagan.    On the -- December 23rd, a point of

12   constitutional order was called, too, in fact, with

13   respect to this law.      The floor sponsor, Senator Baucus,

14   defended it as an exercise of the taxing power.             In his

15   response to the point of order, the Senate voted 60 to

16   39 on that proposition.

17                 The legislative history is replete with

18   members of Congress explaining that this law is

19   constitutional as an exercise of the taxing power.                It

20   was attacked as a tax by its opponents.             So, I don't

21   think this is a situation where you can say that

22   Congress was avoiding any mention of the tax power.

23                 It would be one thing if Congress explicitly

24   disavowed an exercise of the tax power.             But given that

25   it hasn't done so, it seems to me that it's -- not only

                                    50

 1   is it fair to read this as an exercise of the tax power,

 2   but this Court has got an obligation to construe it as

 3   an exercise of the tax power, if it can be upheld on

 4   that basis.

 5                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Well, why didn't

 6   Congress call it a tax, then?

 7                  GENERAL VERRILLI:         Well --

 8                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             You're telling me

 9   they thought of it as a tax, they defended it on the tax

10   power.     Why didn't they say it was a tax?

11                  GENERAL VERRILLI:         They might have thought,

12   Your Honor, that calling it a penalty as they did would

13   make it more effective in accomplishing its objectives.

14   But it is in the Internal Revenue Code.                It is collected

15   by the IRS on April 15th.          I don't think this is a

16   situation in which you can say --

17                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Well, that's the

18   reason.     They thought it might be more effective if they

19   called it a penalty.

20                  GENERAL VERRILLI:         Well, I -- you know, I

21   don't -- there's nothing that I know of that illuminates

22   that.     Certainly --

23                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          General, the problem

24   goes back to the limiting principle.                Is this simply

25   anything that raises revenue, Congress can do?

                                     51

 1                GENERAL VERRILLI:           No.     There are certain

 2   limiting principles under the taxing power, and --

 3                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So, there has to be a

 4   limiting principle as to when --

 5                GENERAL VERRILLI:           -- and they -- and I

 6   think, of course, the Constitution imposes some:                  Got to

 7   be uniform; can't be a tax on exports; if it's a direct

 8   tax, it's got to be apportioned.               Beyond that, the

 9   limiting principle, as the Court has identified from

10   Drexel Furniture to Kurth Ranch, is that it can't be

11   punishment, punitive in the guise of a tax.

12                And there are three factors the Court has

13   identified to look at that.            The first is the sanction

14   and how disproportionate it is to the conduct; the

15   second is whether there is scienter; and the third is

16   whether there is an administrative apparatus out there

17   to enforce the tax.

18                Now, in Bailey v. Drexel Furniture, for

19   example, the tax was 10 percent of the company's

20   profits, even if they had only one child laborer for one

21   day.   There was a scienter requirement.              And it was

22   enforced by the Department of Labor.               It wasn't just

23   collected by the Internal Revenue Service.

24                Here you don't have any of those things.

25   This -- the penalty is calculated to be no more than, at

                                   52

 1   most, the equivalent of what one would have paid for

 2   insurance that you've forgone.              There is no scienter

 3   requirement.     There's no enforcement apparatus out

 4   there.    So, it's certainly --

 5                  JUSTICE ALITO:         Can the --

 6                  GENERAL VERRILLI:           -- consistent with those

 7   limits.

 8                  JUSTICE ALITO:         Can the mandate be viewed as

 9   a tax if it does impose a requirement on people who are

10   not subject to the penalty or the tax?

11                  GENERAL VERRILLI:           I think it could, for the

12   reasons I -- I discussed yesterday.               I don't think it

13   can or should be read that way.              But if there's any

14   doubt about that, Your Honor, if there is -- if it is

15   the view of the Court that it can't be, then I think

16   the right way to handle this case is by analogy to New

17   York v. United States, in which the -- the Court read

18   the "shall" provision, shall handle low-level

19   radioactive waste, as setting the predicate, and then

20   the other provisions were merely incentives to get the

21   predicate met, and so --

22                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           So you're saying that all

23   the discussion we had earlier about how this is one big

24   uniform scheme and the Commerce Clause, blah, blah,

25   blah, it really doesn't matter.              This is a tax, and the

 2               ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 3         ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS FLORIDA, ET AL.

 4               MR. CLEMENT:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 5   please the Court:

 6               The mandate represents an unprecedented

 7   effort by Congress to compel individuals to enter

 8   commerce in order to better regulate commerce.             The

 9   Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate

10   existing commerce.     It does not give Congress the far

11   greater power to compel people to enter commerce, to

12   create commerce essentially in the first place.

13               Now, Congress when it passed the statute did

14   make findings about why it thought it could regulate the

15   commerce here, and it justified the mandate as a

16   regulation of the economic decision to forgo the

17   purchase of health insurance.            That is a theory without

18   any limiting principle.

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Do you accept here the

20   General's position that you have conceded that Congress

21   could say, if you're going to consume health services,

22   you have to pay by way of insurance?

23               MR. CLEMENT:         That's right,

24   Justice Sotomayor.     We say, consistent with 220 years of

25   this Court's jurisprudence, that if you regulate the

                                     55

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   point of sale, you regulate commerce, that's within

 2   Congress's commerce power.

 3                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           All right.   So, what do

 4   you do with the impossibility of buying insurance at the

 5   point of consumption?      Virtually, you force insurance

 6   companies to sell it to you?

 7                 MR. CLEMENT:      Well, Justice, I think there's

 8   two points to make on that.             One is a lot of the

 9   discussion this morning so far has proceeded on the

10   assumption that the only thing that's at issue here is

11   emergency room visits, and the only thing that's being

12   imposed is catastrophic care coverage.             But, as the

13   Chief Justice indicated earlier, a lot of the insurance

14   that's being covered is for ordinary preventive care,

15   ordinary office visits, and those are the kind of things

16   that one can predict.

17                 So, there's a big part of the market that's

18   regulated here that wouldn't pose the problem that

19   you're suggesting; but, even as to emergency room

20   visits, it certainly would be possible to regulate at

21   that point.    You could simply say, through some sort of

22   mandate on the insurance companies, you have to provide

23   people that come in -- this will be a high-risk pool,

24   and maybe you'll have to share it amongst yourself or

25   something, but people simply have to sign up at that

                                    56

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   point, and that would be regulating at the point of

 2   sale.

 3               JUSTICE KAGAN:           Well, Mr. Clement, now it

 4   seems as though you're just talking about a matter of

 5   timing, that Congress can regulate the transaction.              And

 6   the question is when does it make best sense to regulate

 7   that transaction?

 8               And Congress surely has it within its

 9   authority to decide, rather than at the point of sale,

10   given an insurance-based mechanism, it makes sense to

11   regulate it earlier.      It's just a matter of timing.

12               MR. CLEMENT:        Well, Justice Kagan, we don't

13   think it's a matter of timing alone, and we think it has

14   very significant substantive effects, because if

15   Congress tried to regulate at the point of sale, the one

16   group that it wouldn't capture at all are the people who

17   don't want to purchase health insurance and also have no

18   plans of using health care services in the near term.

19   And Congress very much wanted to capture those people.

20   I mean, those people are essentially the golden geese

21   that pay for the entire lowering of the premium --

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Is the government's

23   argument this -- and maybe I won't state it accurately.

24   It is true that the noninsured young adult is, in fact,

25   an actuarial reality insofar as our allocation of health

                                    57

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   services, insofar as the way health insurance companies

 2   figure risk.     That person who is sitting at home in his

 3   or her living room doing nothing is an actuarial reality

 4   that can and must be measured for health service

 5   purposes; is that their argument?

 6                  MR. CLEMENT:      Well, I don't know,

 7   Justice Kennedy, but, if it is, I think there's at least

 8   two problems with it.

 9                  One is, as Justice Alito's question

10   suggested earlier -- I mean, somebody who is not in the

11   insurance market is sort of irrelevant as an actuarial

12   risk.   I mean, we could look at the people not in the

13   insurance market, and what we'd find is that they're

14   relatively young, relatively healthy, and they would

15   have a certain pool of actuarial risks that would

16   actually lead to lower premiums.

17                  The people that would be captured by

18   guaranteed rating and community issue -- guaranteed

19   issue and community rating would presumably have a

20   higher risk profile, and there would be higher premiums.

21                  And one of the things, one of the things,

22   Congress sought to accomplish here was to force

23   individuals into the insurance market to subsidize those

24   that are already in it to lower the rates.         And that's

25   just not my speculation, that's Finding (I) at 43a of

                                     58

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the Government's brief that -- it has the statute.              And

 2   that's one of the clear findings.

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Mr. Clement, doesn't that

 4   work -- that work the way Social Security does?

 5               Let me put it this way:            Congress, in the

 6   '30s, saw a real problem of people needing to have old

 7   age and survivor's insurance.           And, yes, they did it

 8   through a tax, but they said everybody has got to be in

 9   it because if we don't have the healthy in it, there's

10   not going to be the money to pay for the ones who become

11   old or disabled or widowed.           So, they required everyone

12   to contribute.

13               There was a big fuss about that in the

14   beginning because a lot of people said -- maybe some

15   people still do today -- I could do much better if the

16   government left me alone.       I'd go into the private

17   market, I'd buy an annuity, I'd make a great investment,

18   and they're forcing me to pay for this Social

19   Security that I don't want.

20               But that's constitutional.            So, if Congress

21   could see this as a problem where we need to have a

22   group that will subsidize the ones who are going to get

23   the benefits, it seems to me you're saying the only way

24   that could be done is if the government does it itself;

25   it can't involve the private market, it can't involve

                                  59

 1   the private insurers.       If it wants to do this, Social

 2   Security is its model.        The government has to do --

 3   has to be government takeover.             We can't have the

 4   insurance industry in it.          Is that your position?

 5                 MR. CLEMENT:       No.     I don't think it is,

 6   Justice Ginsburg.     I think there are other options that

 7   are available.

 8                 The most straightforward one would be to

 9   figure out what amount of subsidy to the insurance

10   industry is necessary to pay for guaranteed issue and

11   community rating.     And once we calculate the amount of

12   that subsidy, we could have a tax that's spread

13   generally through everybody to raise the revenue to pay

14   for that subsidy.     That's the way we pay for most

15   subsidies.

16                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Could we have an

17   exemption?    Could the government say everybody pays a

18   shared health care responsibility payment to offset all

19   the money that we're forced to spend on health care, we

20   the government; but anybody who has an insurance policy

21   is exempt from that tax?         Could the government do that?

22                 MR. CLEMENT:       The government might be able

23   to do that.     I think it might raise some issues about

24   whether or not that would be a valid exercise of the

25   taxing power.

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Under what theory

 2   wouldn't it be?

 3                MR. CLEMENT:       Well, I do think that --

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            We get tax credits for

 5   having solar-powered homes.             We get tax credits for

 6   using fuel-efficient cars.           Why couldn't we get a tax

 7   credit for having health insurance and saving the

 8   government from caring for us?

 9                MR. CLEMENT:       Well, I think it would depend

10   a little bit on how it was formulated, but my concern

11   would be -- the constitutional concern would be that it

12   would just be a disguised impermissible direct tax.              And

13   I do think -- you know, I mean, I don't want to suggest

14   we get to the taxing power too soon, but I do think it's

15   worth realizing that the taxing power is limited in the

16   ability to impose direct taxes.

17                And the one thing I think the Framers would

18   have clearly identified as a direct tax is a tax on not

19   having something.    I mean, the framing generation was

20   divided over whether a tax on carriages was a direct tax

21   or not.   Hamilton thought that was a indirect tax;

22   Madison thought it was a direct tax.             I have little

23   doubt that both of them would have agreed that a tax on

24   not having a carriage would have clearly been a direct

25   tax.   I also think they would have thought it clearly

                                    61

 1   wasn't a valid regulation of the market in carriages.

 2                  And, you know, I mean, if you look at

 3   Hylton v. The United States, that's this Court's first

 4   direct tax case.

 5                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Let me ask -- can I go back

 6   for a step?     Because I don't want to get into a

 7   discussion of whether this is a good bill or not.              Some

 8   people think it's going to save a lot of money.              Some

 9   people think it won't.

10                  So, I'm focusing just on the Commerce

11   Clause; not on the Due Process Clause, the Commerce

12   Clause.    And I look back into history, and I think if we

13   look back into history, we see sometimes Congress can

14   create commerce out of nothing.              That's the national

15   bank, which was created out of nothing to create other

16   commerce out of nothing.

17                  I look back into history, and I see it seems

18   pretty clear that if there are substantial effects on

19   interstate commerce, Congress can act.              And I look at

20   the person who's growing marijuana in her house, or I

21   look at the farmer who is growing wheat for home

22   consumption.     This seems to have more substantial

23   effects.

24                  Is this commerce?           Well, it seems to me more

25   commerce than marijuana.         I mean, is it, in fact, a

                                     62

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   regulation?    Well, why not?           If creating the bank is, why

 2   isn't this?

 3                 And then you say, ah, but one thing here out

 4   of all those things is different, and that is you're

 5   making somebody do something.

 6                 I say, hey, can't Congress make people drive

 7   faster than 45 -- 40 miles an hour on a road?             Didn't

 8   they make that man growing his own wheat go out into the

 9   market and buy other wheat for his -- for his cows?

10   Didn't they make Mrs. -- if she married somebody who had

11   marijuana in her basement, wouldn't she have to go and

12   get rid of it?    Affirmative action?

13                 I mean, where does this distinction come

14   from?   It sounds like sometimes you can, and sometimes

15   you can't.

16                 So, what is argued here is there is a large

17   group of -- what about a person that we discover that

18   there are -- a disease is sweeping the United States,

19   and 40 million people are susceptible, of whom 10

20   million will die; can't the Federal Government say all

21   40 million get inoculation?

22                 So, here, we have a group of 40 million, and

23   57 percent of those people visit emergency care or other

24   care, which we're paying for.             And 22 percent of those

25   pay more than $100,000 for that.             And Congress says

                                    63

 1   they're in the midst of this big thing.            We just want to

 2   rationalize the system they're already in.

 3               So, there, you got the whole argument, and I

 4   would like you to tell me, looking back --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:       Answer those questions in

 6   inverse order.

 7               (Laughter.)

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:       Well, no, it's one

 9   question.   It's looking back at that -- looking back at

10   that history.    The thing I concede, that you say to some

11   people go buy -- why does that make a difference in

12   terms of the Commerce Clause?

13               MR. CLEMENT:     Well, Justice Breyer, let me

14   start at the beginning of your question with McCulloch.

15   McCulloch was not a commerce power case.

16               JUSTICE BREYER:       It was both?

17               MR. CLEMENT:     It was not -- no, the bank was not

18   justified and the corporation was not justified as an

19   exercise of commerce power.       So that is not a case that

20   says that it's okay to conjure up the bank as an

21   exercise of the commerce power.

22               And what, of course, the Court didn't say,

23   and I think the Court would have had a very different

24   reaction to, is, you know, we're not just going to have

25   the bank, because that would be necessary and proper;



                                      64

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   we're going to force the citizenry to put all of their

 2   money in the bank, because, if we do that, then we know

 3   the Bank of the United States will be secure.

 4                I think the Framers would have identified

 5   the difference between those two scenarios, and I don't

 6   think that the great Chief Justice would have said that

 7   forcing people to put their deposits in the Bank of the

 8   United States was necessary and proper.

 9                Now, if you look through all the cases you

10   mentioned, I do not think you will find a case like

11   this.   And I think it's telling that you won't.             I mean,

12   the regulation of the wheat market in Wickard v.

13   Filburn, all this effort to address the supply side and

14   what producers could do, what Congress was trying to do

15   was support the price of wheat.            It would have been much

16   more efficient to just make everybody in America buy 10

17   loaves of bread.   That would have had a much more direct

18   effect on the price of wheat in the prevailing market.

19                But we didn't do that.             We didn't say, when

20   we had problems in the automobile industry, that we're

21   not just going to give you incentives, not just cash for

22   clunkers; we're going to actually have everybody over

23   100,000 dollars has to buy a new car --

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Well, Mr. Clement,

25   the key to the Government's argument to the contrary is

                                   65

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that everybody is in this market.                 It's all right to

 2   regulate Wickard -- in Wickard v. Filburn, because

 3   that's a particular market in which the farmer had been

 4   participating.

 5                  Everybody is in this market.              So, that makes

 6   it very different than the market for cars or the other

 7   hypotheticals that you came up with, and all they're

 8   regulating is how you pay for it.

 9                  MR. CLEMENT:      Well, with respect, Mr. Chief

10   Justice, I suppose the first thing you have to say is

11   what market are we talking about?                 Because the

12   government -- this statute undeniably operates in the

13   health care insurance market.            And the government can't

14   say that everybody is in that market.                 The whole problem

15   is that everybody is not in that market, and they want

16   to make everybody get into that market.

17                  JUSTICE KAGAN:         Well, doesn't that seem a

18   little bit, Mr. Clement, cutting the baloney thin?                    I

19   mean, health insurance exists only for the purpose of

20   financing health care.        The two are inextricably

21   interlinked.     We don't get insurance so that we can

22   stare at our insurance certificate.                 We get it so that

23   we can go and access health care.

24                  MR. CLEMENT:      Well, Justice Kagan, I'm not

25   sure that's right.     I think what health insurance does

                                     66

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   and what all insurance does is it allows you to

 2   diversify risk.   And so, it's not just a matter of I'm

 3   paying now instead of paying later.             That's credit.

 4   Insurance is different than credit.             Insurance

 5   guarantees you an up-front, locked-in payment, and you

 6   won't have to pay any more than that even if you incur

 7   much greater expenses.

 8                And in every other market that I know of for

 9   insurance, we let people basically make the decision

10   whether they're relatively risk averse, whether they're

11   relatively non-risk averse, and they can make the

12   judgment based on --

13                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          But we don't in car

14   insurance, meaning we tell people buy car -- not we, the

15   States do, although you're going to -- I'll ask you the

16   question:   Do you think that if some States decided not

17   to impose an insurance requirement, that the Federal

18   Government would be without power to legislate and

19   require every individual to buy car insurance?

20                MR. CLEMENT:      Well, Justice Sotomayor, let

21   me say this, which is to say -- you're right in the

22   first point to say that it's the States that do it,

23   which makes it different right there.             But it's also --

24                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Well, that goes back to

25   the substantive due process question.             Is this a

                                   67

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   Lochner-era argument that only the States can do this,

 2   even though it affects commerce?              Cars indisputably

 3   affect commerce.     So, are you arguing that because the

 4   States have done it all along, the Federal Government is

 5   no longer permitted to legislate in this area?

 6               MR. CLEMENT:         No.     I think you might make a

 7   different argument about cars than you would make about

 8   health insurance, unless you tried to say -- but, you

 9   know, we're --

10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But health insurance --

11   I mean, I've never gotten into an accident, thankfully,

12   and I hope never.     The vast majority of people have

13   never gotten into an accident where they've injured

14   others; yet, we pay for it dutifully every year on the

15   possibility that at some point, we might get into that

16   accident.

17               MR. CLEMENT:         But, Justice Sotomayor, what I

18   think is different is there's lots of people in

19   Manhattan, for example, that don't have car insurance

20   because they don't have cars.            And so, they have the

21   option of withdrawing from that market.              It's not a

22   direct imposition from the government.

23               So, even the car market is different from

24   this market, where there's no way to get outside of the

25   regulatory web.     And that's, I think, one of the real

                                     68

 1   problems with this because, I mean, we take as a

 2   given --

 3                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           But you're -- but the

 4   given is that virtually everyone, absent some

 5   intervention from above, meaning that someone's life

 6   will be cut short in a fatal way, virtually everyone

 7   will use health care.

 8                MR. CLEMENT:      At some point, that's right,

 9   but all sorts of people will not, say, use health care

10   in the next year, which is the relevant period for the

11   insurance.

12                JUSTICE BREYER:           But do you think you can,

13   better than the actuaries or better than the members of

14   Congress who worked on it, look at the 40 million people

15   who are not insured and say which ones next year will or

16   will not use, say, emergency care?

17                Can you do that any better than if we knew

18   that 40 million people were suffering, about to suffer a

19   contagious disease, and only 10 million would get sick?

20                MR. CLEMENT:      Of course not --

21                JUSTICE BREYER:           We don't know which?

22                MR. CLEMENT:      Of course not, Justice Breyer,

23   but the point is that once Congress decides it's going

24   to regulate extant commerce, it is going to get all

25   sorts of latitude to make the right judgments about

                                   69

 1   actuarial predictions, which actuarial to rely on, which

 2   one not to rely on.

 3               The question that's a proper question for

 4   this Court, though, is whether or not, for the first

 5   time ever in our history, Congress also has the power to

 6   compel people into commerce, because, it turns out, that

 7   would be a very efficient thing for purposes of

 8   Congress's optimal regulation of that market.           And I --

 9               JUSTICE KAGAN:         But, Mr. Clement, this goes

10   back to the Chief Justice's question.           But, of course,

11   the theory behind, not just the Government's case, but

12   the theory behind this law is that people are in this

13   market right now, and they're in this market because

14   people do get sick, and because when people get sick, we

15   provide them with care without making them pay.

16               And it would be different, you know, if you

17   were up here saying, I represent a class of Christian

18   Scientists, then you might be able to say, look, you

19   know, why are they bothering me?           But absent that,

20   you're in this market.     You're an economic actor.

21               MR. CLEMENT:      Well, Justice Kagan, once

22   again, it depends on which market we're talking about.

23   If we're talking about the health care insurance

24   market --

25               JUSTICE KAGAN:         Well, we're talking about

 1   the health insurance market, which is designed to access

 2   the health care market.

 3               MR. CLEMENT:      And with respect to the health

 4   insurance market that's designed to have payment in the

 5   health care market, everybody's not in the market.             And

 6   that's the premise of the statute, and that's the

 7   problem Congress is trying to solve.

 8               And if it tried to solve it through

 9   incentives, we wouldn't be here; but it's trying to

10   solve it in a way that nobody has ever tried to solve an

11   economic problem before, which is saying, you know, it

12   would be so much more efficient if you were just in this

13   -- the market.

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:          But they're in the market

15   in the sense that they're creating a risk that the

16   market must account for.

17               MR. CLEMENT:      Well, Justice Kennedy, I don't

18   think that's right, certainly in any way that

19   distinguishes this from any other context.          When I'm

20   sitting in my house deciding I'm not going to buy a car,

21   I am causing the labor market in Detroit to go south.                I

22   am causing maybe somebody to lose their job, and for

23   everybody to have to pay for it under welfare.          So, the

24   cost shifting that the government tries to uniquely

25   associate with this market -- it's everywhere.

 1                  And even more to the point, the rationale

 2   that they think ultimately supports this legislation,

 3   that, look, it's an economic decision; once you make the

 4   economic decision, we aggregate the decision; there's

 5   your substantial effect on commerce -- that argument

 6   works here.     It works in every single industry.

 7                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Of course, we do know that

 8   there are a few people, more in New York City than there

 9   are in Wyoming, who never will buy a car.              But we also

10   know here, and we don't like to admit it, that because

11   we are human beings, we all suffer from the risk of

12   getting sick, and we also all know that we'll get

13   seriously sick.     And we also know that we can't predict

14   when.   And we also know that when we do, there will be

15   our fellow taxpayers through the Federal Government who

16   will pay for this.     If we do not buy insurance, we will

17   pay nothing.     And that happens with a large number of

18   people in this group of 40 million, none of whom can be

19   picked out in advance.

20                  Now, that's quite different from the car

21   situation, and it's different in only this respect:              It

22   shows there is a national problem, and it shows there is

23   a national problem that involves money, cost, insurance.

24   So, if Congress could do this, should there be a disease

25   that strikes the United States and they want every one

                                     72

 1   inoculated even though 10 million will be hurt, it's

 2   hard for me to decide why that isn't interstate

 3   commerce, even more so where we know it affects

 4   everybody.

 5                MR. CLEMENT:      Well, Justice Breyer, there

 6   are other markets that affect every one --

 7   transportation, food, burial services -- though we don't

 8   like to talk about that either.            There also are

 9   situations where there are many economic effects from

10   somebody's failure to purchase a product.

11                And if I could -- if I could talk about the

12   difference between the health insurance market and the

13   health care market, I mean, ultimately I don't want you

14   to leave here with the impression that anything turns on

15   that.   Because if the government decided tomorrow that

16   they've come up with a great -- somebody -- some private

17   company has come up with a great new wonder drug that

18   would be great for everybody to take, it would have huge

19   health benefits for everybody; and by the way, also, if

20   everybody had to buy it, it would facilitate economies

21   of scale, and the production would be great, and the

22   price would be cheaper -- and force everybody in the

23   health care market, the actual health care market, to

24   buy the wonder drug, I'd be up here making the same

25   argument.

                                   73

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1                 I'd be saying that's not a power that's

 2   within the commerce power of the Federal Government.               It

 3   is something much greater.           And it would have been much

 4   more controversial.     That's one of the important things.

 5   In Federalist 45, Madison says the commerce power --

 6   that's a new power, but it's not one anyone has any

 7   apprehension about.

 8                 The reason they didn't have any apprehension

 9   about it is because it's a power that only operated once

10   people were already in commerce.             You see that from the

11   text of the clause.     The first kind of commerce Congress

12   gets to regulate is commerce with foreign nations.               Did

13   anybody think the fledgling Republic had the power to

14   compel some other nation into commerce with us?             Of

15   course not.

16                 And in the same way, I think if the Framers

17   had understood the commerce power to include the power

18   to compel people to engage in commerce --

19                 JUSTICE KAGAN:         Well, once again, though,

20   who's in commerce and when are they in commerce?

21                 If the effect of all these uninsured people

22   is to raise everybody's premiums, not just when they get

23   sick, if they get sick, but right now in the aggregate,

24   and Wickard and Raich tell us we should look at the

25   aggregate, and the aggregate of all these uninsured

                                    74

 1   people are increasing the normal family premium,

 2   Congress says, by a thousand dollars a year -- those

 3   people are in commerce.      They're making decisions that

 4   are affecting the price that everybody pays for this

 5   service.

 6               MR. CLEMENT:      Justice Kagan, again, with all

 7   due respect, I don't think that's a limiting principle.

 8   My unwillingness to buy an electric car is forcing up

 9   the price of an electric car.           If only more people

10   demanded an electric car, there would be economies of

11   scale, and the price would go down.

12               JUSTICE KAGAN:         No, this is very different,

13   Mr. Clement, and it's different because of the nature of

14   the health care service, that you are entitled to health

15   care when you go to an emergency room, when you go to a

16   doctor, even if you can't pay for it.           So, the

17   difference between your hypotheticals and the real case

18   is the problem of uncompensated care, which --

19               MR. CLEMENT:      Justice Kagan, first of all, I

20   do think there -- this is not the only place where

21   there's uncompensated care.           If some -- if I don't buy a

22   car and somebody goes on welfare, I'm going to end up

23   paying for that as well.

24               But let me also say that there's a real

25   disconnect then between that focus on what makes this

                                  75

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   different and the statute that Congress passed.           If all

 2   we were concerned about is the cost sharing that took

 3   place because of uncompensated care in emergency rooms,

 4   presumably we'd have before us a statute that only

 5   addressed emergency care and catastrophic insurance

 6   coverage.   But it covers everything, soup to nuts, and

 7   all sorts of other things.

 8                And that gets at the idea that there's two

 9   kinds of cost shifting that are going on here.           One is

10   the concern about emergency care and that somehow

11   somebody who gets sick is going to shift costs back to

12   other policy areas -- holders.           But there's a much

13   bigger cost shifting going on here, and that's the cost

14   shifting that goes on when you force healthy people into

15   an insurance market precisely because they're healthy,

16   precisely because they're not likely to go to the

17   emergency room, precisely because they're not likely to

18   use the insurance they're forced to buy in the health

19   care insurance.   That creates a huge windfall.          It

20   lowers the price of premiums.

21                And, again, this isn't just some lawyer up

22   here telling you that's what it does and trying to

23   second-guess the congressional economic decisions.            This

24   is Congress's findings, Findings (I) on page 43a of the

25   appendix to the Government's brief.

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:              All right.   But all that

 2   sounds like you're debating the merits of the bill.                    You

 3   asked really for limiting principles so we don't get

 4   into a matter that I think has nothing to do with this

 5   case:    broccoli.     Okay?

 6                 And the limiting principles -- you've heard

 7   three.    First, the Solicitor General came up with a

 8   couple joined, very narrow ones.                You've seen in Lopez

 9   this Court say that we cannot -- Congress cannot get

10   into purely local affairs, particularly where they're

11   noncommercial.       And, of course, the greatest limiting

12   principle of all, which not too many accept -- so, I'm

13   not going to emphasize that -- is the limiting principle

14   derived from the fact that members of Congress are

15   elected from States and that 95 percent of the law of

16   the United States is State law.                That is a principle,

17   though enforced by the legislature.                 The other two are

18   principles, one written into Lopez and one you just

19   heard.

20                 It seems to me all of those eliminate the

21   broccoli possibility, and none of them eliminates the

22   possibility that we're trying to take the 40 million

23   people who do have the medical cost, who do affect

24   interstate commerce, and provide a system that you may

25   like or not like.

 1               MR. CLEMENT:      Well, Justice Breyer, let me

 2   take them in --

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:           That's where we are in

 4   limiting principles.

 5               MR. CLEMENT:      Let me take them in turn.             I

 6   would encourage this Court not to Garcia-ize the

 7   Commerce Clause and just simply say it's up to Congress

 8   to police the Commerce Clause.           So, I don't think that

 9   is a limiting principle.

10               Second of all --

11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           But that's exactly what

12   Justice Marshall said in Gibbons.              He said that it is

13   the power to regulate; the power like all others vested

14   in Congress is complete in itself, may be exercised to

15   its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other

16   than those prescribed in the Constitution.

17               But there is no conscription in the -- set

18   forth in the Constitution --

19               MR. CLEMENT:      I agree --

20               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           -- with respect to

21   regulating commerce.

22               MR. CLEMENT:      I agree 100 percent, and I

23   think that was the Chief Justice's point, which was once

24   you open the door to compelling people into commerce

25   based on the narrow rationales that exist in this

                                  78

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   industry, you are not going to be able to stop that

 2   process.

 3                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Well, see, that's the --

 4                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           I would like hear you

 5   address Justice Breyer's other two principles.

 6                  MR. CLEMENT:      Well, the other two principles

 7   are Lopez -- and this case really is not -- I mean, you

 8   know, Lopez is a limit on the affirmative exercise of

 9   people who are already in commerce.                The question is, is

10   there any other limit to people who aren't in commerce?

11   And so, I think this is the case that really asks that

12   question.

13                  And then the first point, which was -- I

14   take it to be the Solicitor General's point, is, with

15   all due respect, simply a description of the insurance

16   market.     It's not a limiting principle, because the

17   justification for why this is a valid regulation of

18   commerce is in no way limited to this market.                It simply

19   says these are economic decisions; they have effect on

20   other people; my failure to purchase in this market has

21   a direct effect on others who are already in the market.

22   That's true of virtually every other market under the

23   sun.

24                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             And now maybe return

25   to Justice Sotomayor's question.

                                     79

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1               MR. CLEMENT:      I'd be delighted to, which is

 2   -- I mean, I -- you're absolutely right.           Once you're in

 3   the commerce power, there -- this Court is not going to

 4   police that subject maybe to the Lopez limit.           And

 5   that's exactly why I think it's very important for this

 6   Court to think seriously about taking an unprecedented

 7   step of saying that the commerce power not only includes

 8   the power to regulate, prescribe the rule by which

 9   commerce is governed, the rule of Gibbons v. Ogden; but

10   to go further and say it's not just prescribing the rule

11   for commerce that exists, but it is the power to compel

12   people to enter into commerce in the first place.

13               I'd like to say two very brief things about

14   the taxing power, if I could.           There are lots of reasons

15   why this isn't a tax.    It wasn't denominated a tax.

16   It's not structured as a tax.           If it's any tax at all,

17   though, it is a direct tax.           Article I, section 9,

18   clause 4 -- the Framers would have had no doubt that a

19   tax on not having something is not an excise tax but a

20   forbidden direct tax.    That's one more reason why this

21   is not proper legislation, because it -- it violates

22   that.

23               The second thing is I would urge you to read

24   the license tax case, which the Solicitor General says

25   is his best case for why you ignore the fact that a tax

                                  80

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   is denominated into something other.              Because that's a

 2   case where the argument was that because the Federal

 3   Government had passed a license, not a tax, that somehow

 4   that allowed people to take actions that would have been

 5   unlawful under State law, that this was some special

 6   Federal license to do something that was forbidden by

 7   State law.   This Court looked beyond the label in order

 8   to preserve federalism there.

 9                What the Solicitor General and the

10   government ask you to do here is exactly the opposite,

11   which is to look past labels in order to up-end our

12   basic federalist system.       And this --

13                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Could you tell me, do

14   you think the States could pass this mandate?

15                MR. CLEMENT:      I represent 26 States.         I do

16   think the States could pass this mandate, but I --

17                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Is there any other area

18   of commerce, business, where we have held that there

19   isn't concurrent power between the State and the Federal

20   Government to protect the welfare of commerce?

21                MR. CLEMENT:      Well, Justice Sotomayor, I

22   have to resist your premise, because I didn't answer,

23   yes, the States can do it because it would be a valid

24   regulation of intrastate commerce.              I said, yes, the

25   States can do it because they have a police power, and

                                   81

 1   that is the fundamental difference between the States on

 2   the one hand and the limited, enumerated Federal

 3   Government on the other.

 4                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Thank you,

 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN

 8           ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS NFIB, ET AL.

 9                  MR. CARVIN:      Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

10   May it please the Court:

11                  I'd like to begin with the Solicitor

12   General's main premise, which is that they can compel

13   the purchase of health insurance in order to promote

14   commerce in the health market because it will reduce

15   uncompensated care.      If you accept that argument, you

16   have to fundamentally alter the text of the Constitution

17   and give Congress plenary power.

18                  It simply doesn't matter whether or not this

19   regulation will promote health care commerce by reducing

20   uncompensated care.      All that matters is whether the

21   activity actually being regulated by the Act negatively

22   affects commerce or negatively affects commerce

23   regulation, so that it's within the commerce power.            If

24   you agree with us that this is -- exceeds commerce

25   power, the law doesn't somehow become redeemed because

                                     82

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   it has beneficial policy effects in the health care

 2   market.

 3               In other words, Congress does not have the

 4   power to promote commerce.           Commerce has -- Congress has

 5   the power to regulate commerce.             And if the power

 6   exceeds their permissible regulatory authority, then the

 7   law is invalid.

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           I thought you --

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, surely --

10               MR. CARVIN:        I'm sorry.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, surely,

12   regulation includes the power to promote.               Since the New

13   Deal, we've said there's regulation in -- there's a

14   market in agricultural products, and Congress has the

15   power to subsidize, to limit production, all sorts of

16   things.

17               MR. CARVIN:        Absolutely, Chief Justice, and

18   that's the distinction I'm trying to draw.               When they're

19   acting within their enumerated power, then obviously

20   they're promoting commerce.

21               But the Solicitor General wants to turn it

22   into a different power.        He wants to say we have the

23   power to promote commerce, to regulate anything to

24   promote commerce.    And if they have the power to promote

25   commerce, then they have the power to regulate

                                    83

 1   everything, right?     Because --

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I don't -- I don't

 3   think you're addressing their main point, which is that

 4   they're not creating commerce in -- in health care.

 5   It's already there, and we're all going to need some

 6   kind of health care; most of us will at some point.

 7                 MR. CARVIN:       I'd -- I'd like to address that

 8   in two ways, if I could, Mr. Chief Justice.                In the

 9   first place, they keep playing mix and match with the

10   statistics.     They say 95 percent of us are in the health

11   care market, okay?     But that's not the relevant

12   statistic, even as the Government frames the issue.                  No

13   one in Congress or the Solicitor General is arguing that

14   going to the doctor and fully paying him creates a

15   problem.   The problem is uncompensated care, and they

16   say the uncompensated care arises if you have some kind

17   of catastrophe -- hit by a bus, have some prolonged

18   illness.   Well, what is the percentage of the uninsured

19   that have those sorts of catastrophes?                We know it has

20   got to be a relatively small fraction.                So, in other

21   words, the relevant --

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Yet, we don't know

23   who they are.

24                 MR. CARVIN:       We don't, no, and we don't know

25   in advance, and -- but that doesn't change the basic

 1   principle, that you are nonetheless forcing people for

 2   paternalistic reasons to go into the insurance market to

 3   insure against risks that they have made the voluntary

 4   decision that they are not -- have decided not to.

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:         But the problem is --

 6                MR. CARVIN:      But even if --

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:         The problem is that they

 8   are making the rest of us pay for it, because as much as

 9   they say, well, we're not in the market, we don't know

10   when they -- the timing when they will be.

11                MR. CARVIN:      With --

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:         And the -- the figures of

13   how much more families are paying for insurance because

14   people get sick, they may have intended to self-insure,

15   they haven't been able to meet the bills for -- for

16   cancer, and the rest of us end up paying because the --

17   people are getting cost-free health care.          And the only

18   way to prevent that is to have them pay sooner rather

19   than later, pay up front.

20                MR. CARVIN:      Yes, but my point is this:

21   That, with respect, Justice Ginsburg, conflates the

22   people who do result in uncompensated care, the free

23   riders.   Those are people who default on their health

24   care payments.   That is an entirely different group of

25   people, an entirely different activity than being

 1   uninsured.

 2                 So, the question is whether or not you can

 3   regulate activity because it has a statistical

 4   connection to an activity that harms commerce.                And my

 5   basic point to you is this:             The Constitution only gives

 6   Congress the power to regulate things that negatively

 7   affect commerce or commerce regulation.             It doesn't give

 8   them the power to regulate things that are statistically

 9   connected to things that negatively affect the

10   commerce --

11                 JUSTICE KAGAN:         Well, Mr. Carvin --

12                 MR. CARVIN:      -- because -- I'm sorry.

13                 JUSTICE KAGAN:         Please.

14                 MR. CARVIN:      I was just going to say,

15   because if they have that power, then they obviously

16   have the power to regulate everything, because

17   everything in the aggregate is statistically connected

18   to something that negatively affects commerce, and every

19   compelled purchase promotes commerce.

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So, in your view, right

21   there -- in your view -- in your view right there --

22                 MR. CARVIN:      Justice Breyer --

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Can I just --

 1   something.    I'd like to just -- if it turned out there

 2   was some terrible epidemic sweeping the United States,

 3   and we couldn't say that more than 40 or 50 percent -- I

 4   can make the number as high as I want -- but the -- the

 5   -- you'd say the Federal Government doesn't have the

 6   power to get people inoculated, to require them to be

 7   inoculated, because that's just statistical.

 8                 MR. CARVIN:      Well, in all candor, I think

 9   Morrison must have decided that issue, right?             Because

10   people who commit violence against --

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Is your answer to that yes

12   or no?

13                 MR. CARVIN:      Oh, I'm sorry.       My answer is,

14   no, they couldn't do it, because Morrison --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           No, they could not do it?

16                 MR. CARVIN:      Yes.

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:           They cannot require people,

18   even if this disease is sweeping the country, to be

19   inoculated.    The Federal Government has no power, and if

20   there's -- okay, fine.       Go ahead.

23   Kagan.

 1                MR. CARVIN:      Violence against women as

 2   obviously creates the same negative impression on fellow

 3   citizens as this communicable disease, but the -- and it

 4   has huge effects on the health care of our country.

 5   Congress found that it increased health care costs by --

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:           I agree with you --

 7                MR. CARVIN:      Well, but --

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:           -- that it had big effects,

 9   but the majority thought that was a local matter.

10                MR. CARVIN:      Now --

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I think that's his point.

12                (Laughter.)

13                MR. CARVIN:      I -- I don't know why having a

14   disease is any more local than -- than beating up a

15   woman.   But -- but my basic point is that

16   notwithstanding its very profound effect on the health

17   care market, this Court said the activity being

18   regulated, i.e., violence against women, is outside the

19   Commerce Clause power.      So, regardless of whether it has

20   beneficial downstream effects, we must say no, Congress

21   doesn't have that power.       Why not?         Because everything

22   has downstream effects on commerce and every compelled

23   purchase promotes commerce.            It by definition helps the

24   sellers and existing customers.

25                JUSTICE ALITO:         Mr. Carvin, isn't there this

 1   difference between Justice Breyer's hypothetical and the

 2   law that we have before us here?                In his hypothetical,

 3   the harm to other people from the communicable disease

 4   is the result of the disease.             It is not the result of

 5   something that the government has done, whereas here the

 6   reason why there's cost-shifting is because the

 7   government has mandated that.             It has required hospitals

 8   to provide emergency treatment; and, instead of paying

 9   for that through a tax which would be borne by

10   everybody, it has required -- it has set up a system in

11   which the cost is surreptitiously shifted to people who

12   have health insurance and who pay their bills when they

13   go to the hospital.

14                 MR. CLEMENT:      Justice Alito, that is exactly

15   the Government's argument.           It's an extraordinarily

16   illogical argument.

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Fine.     Then if that's so,

18   is it -- let me just change my example under pressure --

19                 (Laughter.)

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:           -- and say that in fact it

21   turns out that 90 percent of all automobiles driving

22   interstate without certain equipment put out pollution,

23   which travels interstate -- not 100 percent, maybe only

24   60 percent.    Does the EPA have the power then to say

25   you've got to have an antipollution device?                 It's

 1   statistical.

 2                  MR. CARVIN:      What they can't do -- yes, if

 3   you have a car, they can require you to have an

 4   anti-pollution --

 5                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Then you're -- then you're

 6   not going on statistics; you're going on something else,

 7   which is what I'd like to know what it is.

 8                  MR. CARVIN:      It's this:        They can't require

 9   you to buy a car with an anti-pollution device.                 Once

10   you've entered the market and made a decision, they can

11   regulate the terms and conditions of the car that you

12   do, and they can do it for all sorts of reasons.                 What

13   they can't do it compel you to enter the market.

14                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Now we -- now you've

15   changed the ground of argument, which I accept as

16   totally legitimate.      And then the question is when you

17   are born and you don't have insurance and you will in

18   fact get sick and you will in fact impose costs, have

19   you perhaps involuntarily -- perhaps simply because you

20   are a human being -- entered this particular market,

21   which is a market for health care?

22                  MR. CARVIN:      If being born is entering the

23   market, then I can't think of a more plenary power

24   Congress can have, because that literally means they can

25   regulate every human activity from cradle to grave.                    I

                                     90

 1   thought that's what distinguished the plenary police

 2   power from the very limited commerce power.

 3              I don't disagree that giving the Congress

 4   plenary power to mandate property transfers from A to B

 5   would be a very efficient way of helping B and of

 6   accomplishing Congress's objectives.              But the Framers --

 7              JUSTICE BREYER:           I see the point.       You can

 8   go back to -- go back to Justice Kagan.               Don't forget

 9   her question.

10              JUSTICE KAGAN:          I've forgotten my question.

11              (Laughter.)

12              MR. CARVIN:         I was facing the same dilemma,

13   Justice Kagan.    I --

14              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Well, let me -- let me

15   ask a question that I asked Mr. Clement.               It just seems --

16              JUSTICE KAGAN:          See what it means to be the

17   junior Justice?

18              (Laughter.)

19              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              It just seems very

20   strange to me that there's no question we can have a

21   Social Security system -- besides all the people who say

22   I am being forced to pay for something I don't want -

23   and this, which seems to me, to try to get care for the

24   ones who need it by having everyone in the pool, but is

25   also trying to preserve a role for the private sector,

 1   for the private insurers.         There's something very odd

 2   about that, that the government can take over the whole

 3   thing and we all say, oh, yes, that's fine.              But if the

 4   government wants to get -- to preserve private insurers,

 5   it can't do that.

 6               MR. CARVIN:        Well, I don't think the test of

 7   a law's constitutionality is whether it more adheres to

 8   the libertarian principles of the Cato Institute or the

 9   statist principles of someone else.              I think the test of

10   the law is -- constitutionally is not those policy

11   questions; it's whether or not the law is regulating

12   things that negatively affect commerce or don't.

13               And since obviously the failure to purchase

14   an item doesn't create the kind of effects on supply and

15   demand that the market participants in Wickard and Raich

16   did and doesn't in any way interfere with regulation of

17   the insurance companies, I don't think it can pass the

18   basic --

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           I thought -- I thought

20   that Wickard was you must buy; we're not going to let

21   you use the home-grown wheat.           You've got to go out in

22   the market and buy that wheat that you don't want.

23               MR. CARVIN:        Oh, but let's be careful about

24   what they were regulating in Wickard, Justice Ginsburg.

25   What they were regulating was the supply of wheat.              It

                                    92

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   didn't in any way imply that they could require every

 2   American to go out and buy wheat.         And the -- yes, one

 3   of the consequences of regulating local market

 4   participants is it'll affect the supply and the demand

 5   for the product.   That's why you can regulate them,

 6   because those local market participants have the same

 7   effect on the interstate market that a black market has

 8   on a legal market.

 9              But none of that is true -- in other words,

10   you can regulate local bootleggers, but that doesn't

11   suggest you can regulate teetotalers, people who stay

12   out of the liquor market, because they don't have any

13   negative effect on the existing market participants or

14   on regulation of those market participants.

15              JUSTICE KAGAN:      Well that's why I suggested, Mr.

16   Carvin, that it might be different if you were raising

17   an as-applied challenge and presenting a class of people

18   whom you could say clearly would not be in the health

19   care market.   But you're raising a facial challenge, and

20   we can't really know which of the -- which of the many,

21   many people that this law addresses in fact will not

22   participate in the health care market and in fact will

23   not impose costs on all the rest of us.

24              So, the question is, can Congress respond to

25   those facts, that we have no crystal ball, that we can't



                                     93

 1   tell who is and isn't going to be in the health

 2   insurance market, and say most of these people will be

 3   and most of these people will thereby impose costs on

 4   the rest of us and that's a problem that we can deal

 5   with on a class-wide basis?

 6                  MR. CARVIN:      No again.         The people who

 7   impose the costs on the rest of us are people who engage

 8   in a different activity at a different time, which is

 9   defaulting on their health care payments.                It's not the

10   uninsured.     Under your theory, you could regulate

11   anybody if they've got a statistical connection to a

12   problem.     You could say, since we could regulate people

13   who enter into the mortgage market and impose mortgage

14   insurance on them, we can simply impose the requirement

15   to buy private mortgage insurance on everybody before

16   they have entered the market, because we're doing it in

17   this prophylactic way before it develops.                And that --

18                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             No, no, that's not

19   -- I don't think that's fair, because not everybody is

20   going to enter the mortgage market.                The Government's

21   position is that almost everybody is going to enter the

22   health care market.

23                  MR. CARVIN:      Two points, one of which

24   Mr. Clement's already made, which is the health

25   insurance market is different than the health care

 1   market.    But let me take it on full-stride.           I think

 2   everybody is in the milk market.             I think everybody is

 3   in the wheat product market.            But that doesn't suggest

 4   that the government compel you to buy five gallons of

 5   meat or five bushels of wheat, because they are not

 6   regulating commerce.

 7                 Whether you're a market participant or not,

 8   they are still requiring you to make a purchase that you

 9   don't want to do.

10                 And to get back to your facial example --

11                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          But then that's true of

12   almost every product.

13                 MR. CARVIN:      I'm sorry?

14                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          It's true of almost

15   every product, directly or indirectly by government

16   regulation.    The government says -- borrowing my

17   colleague's example -- you can't buy a car without

18   emission control.    I don't want a car with emission

19   control.    It's less efficient in terms of the

20   horsepower.    But I'm forced to do something I don't want

21   to do by government regulation.

22                 MR. CARVIN:      You are not forced to buy a

23   product you don't want.        And I agree with you that since

 8   goods that don't have certain pesticides but have

 9   others.     There is government compulsion in almost every

10   economic decision because the government regulates so

11   much.     It's a condition of life that some may rail

12   against, but --

13                  MR. CARVIN:      Let's think about it this way:

14   Yes, when you've entered the marketplace, they can

15   impose all sorts of restrictions on you, and they can

16   impose, for example, all kinds of restrictions on States

17   after they've enacted laws.              They can wipe out the laws.

18   They can condition them.

19                  But what can't they do?            They can't compel

20   States to enact laws.        They can't compel States to carry

21   out Federal law.     And I am arguing for precisely the

22   same distinction, because everyone intuitively

23   understands that regulating participants after A and B

24   have entered into a contract is fundamentally less

25   intrusive --

 2   let --

 3                 MR. CARVIN:      -- than requiring A to

 4   contract --

 5                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          We let the government

 6   regulate the manufacturing process whether or not the

 7   goods will enter into interstate commerce, merely

 8   because they might statistically.                We let -- there's all

 9   sorts of government regulation of manufacturing plants,

10   of agricultural farms, of all sorts of -- of activity

11   that will be purely intrastate because it might affect

12   interstate activity.

13                 MR. CARVIN:      I fully agree with you, Justice

14   Sotomayor.    And I think --

15                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          So, how is that

16   different from saying you are self-insuring today,

17   you're forgoing insurance?           Why isn't that a predecessor

18   to the need that you're eventually going to have?

19                 MR. CARVIN:      The cases you referred to I

20   think effectively eliminated the distinction between

21   participants in the intrastate market vis-à-vis

22   participants in the interstate market.                None of those

23   cases suggest that you can regulate people who are

24   outside of the market on both an intrastate and

25   interstate level by compelling them to enter into the

 1   market.    And that --

 2                  JUSTICE BREYER:           But what about -- you know,

 3   the simplest counter-example for me to suggest is you've

 4   undoubtedly read Judge Sutton's concurring opinion.               He

 5   has about two pages, it seemed to me, of examples where

 6   everyone accepts the fact that under these kinds of

 7   regulations the government can compel people to buy

 8   things they don't otherwise want to buy.

 9                  For example, he gives -- even in that farm

10   case, the farmer was being forced to go out and buy

11   grain to feed to his animals because he couldn't raise

12   it at home.     You know, and he goes through one example

13   after another.     So, what is your response to that, which

14   you've read?

15                  MR. CARVIN:      Judge Sutton is wrong in each

16   and every example.       There was no -- there was no

17   compulsion in Raich for him to buy wheat.              He could have

18   gotten wheat substitutes, or he could have not sold

19   wheat, which is actually what he was doing.              There is a

20   huge difference between conditioning regulation, i.e.,

21   conditioning access to the health care market and saying

22   you must buy a product, and forcing you to buy a

23   product.

24                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           I thought that it --

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:         It was common ground that

 2   the requirement that the insurers -- what was it -- the

 3   community-based one, and you -- they have to insure you

 4   despite your health status; they can't refuse because of

 5   pre-existing conditions.        The Government tells us and

 6   Congress determined that those two won't work unless

 7   you have a pool that will include the people who are now

 8   healthy.   But -- so -- well, first, do you agree with

 9   your colleague that the community-based -- and what's

10   the name that they give to the other?

11                 MR. CARVIN:      The guaranteed issue.

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:         Yes.      That that is

13   legitimate Commerce Clause legislation?

14                 MR. CARVIN:      Oh, sure.         And that's why --

15   but we didn't ­- don't in any way impede that sort of

16   regulation.    These nondiscrimination regulations will

17   apply to every insurance company just as Congress

18   intended whether or not we buy insurance.               We're not --

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:         Well then, what about the

20   determination that they can't possibly work if people

21   don't have to buy insurance until they are -- their

22   health status is such that the insurance company just

23   dealt with them on its -- as it will?               They'd say, I

24   won't insure you because you're -- you're already sick.

25                 MR. CARVIN:      It depends what you mean by

 1   "work."   It'll work just fine in ensuring that no sick

 2   people are discriminated against.             What -- but when you

 3   do that, Congress --

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:         But how about the sick

 5   people?   Why would they insure early if they were going to

 6   be protected if they get insurance late?

 7               MR. CARVIN:      Yes.     Well, that's -- see, this

 8   is the Government's very illogical argument.             They seem

 9   to be saying, look, we couldn't just force people to buy

10   insurance to lower health insurance premiums.             That

11   would be no good.   But we can do it because we've

12   created the problem.     We, Congress, have driven up the

13   health insurance premiums, and since we've created that

14   problem, this somehow gives us authority that we

15   wouldn't otherwise have.      That can't possibly be right.

16   That would --

17               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Do you think that there

18   is -- what percentage of the American people who took

19   their son or daughter to an emergency room and that

20   child was turned away because the parent didn't have

21   insurance -- do you think there's a large percentage of

22   the American population who would stand for the death of

23   that child --

24               MR. CARVIN:      One of the most --

 1   allergic reaction and a simple shot would have saved the

 2   child?

 3                 MR. CARVIN:      One of the more pernicious,

 4   misleading impressions that the government has made is

 5   that we are somehow advocating that people could get

 6   thrown out of emergency rooms or that this alternative

 7   that they've hypothesized is going to be enforced by

 8   throwing people out of emergency rooms.              This

 9   alternative, i.e., you condition access to health care

10   on buying health insurance, is enforced in precisely the

11   same way that the Act does.             You either buy health

12   insurance or you pay a penalty of $695.              You don't have

13   doctors throwing people out on the street.              And -- so,

14   the only --

15                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           I'm sorry.   Did you say

16   the penalty's okay but not the mandate?              I'm sorry.

17   Maybe I've misheard you.

18                 MR. CARVIN:      No.       No, no.   I was -- they

19   create this straw man that says, look, the only

20   alternative to doing it the way we've done it, if we

21   condition access to health care on buying health

22   insurance, the only way you can enforce that is making

23   sick people not get care.         I'm saying no, no.        There's a

24   perfectly legitimate way they could enforce their

25   alternative, i.e., requiring you to buy health insurance

 1   when you access health care, which is the same penalty

 2   structure that's in the Act.

 3                  There is no moral dilemma between having

 4   people have insurance and denying them emergency

 5   service.   Congress has made a perfectly legitimate value

 6   judgment that they want to make sure that people get

 7   emergency care.     Since the founding, whenever Congress

 8   has imposed that public responsibility on private

 9   actors, it has subsidized it from the Federal Treasury.

10   It has not conscripted a subset of the citizenry and

11   made them subsidize the actors who are being hurt, which

12   is what they're doing here.

13                  They're making young, healthy people

14   subsidize insurance premiums --

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Are you taking the same

 7   position as your -- as your colleague?                Congress can't

 8   say we're going to set up a public health system, but

 9   you can get a tax credit if you have private health

10   insurance because you won't access the public system.

11   Are you taking the same position as your colleague?

12               MR. CARVIN:        There may have been some

13   confusion in your prior colloquy.                I fully agree with my

14   brother Clement that a direct tax would be

15   unconstitutional.    I don't think he means to suggest,

16   nor do I, that a tax credit that incentivizes you to buy

17   insurance creates a problem.            Congress incentivizes all

18   kinds of activities.      If they gave us a tax credit for

19   buying insurance, then it would be our choice whether or

20   not that makes economic sense, even though --

21               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            So, how is that

22   different than this Act, which says if a taxpayer fails

23   to meet the requirement of having minimum coverage, then

24   they are responsible for paying the shared

25   responsibility payment?

 1                  MR. CARVIN:      The difference is that the

 2   taxpayer is not given a choice.              It's the difference

 3   between banning cigarettes and saying I'm going to

 4   enforce that legal ban through a $5 a pack penalty, and

 5   saying, look, if you want to sell cigarettes, fine; I'm

 6   going to charge you a tax of $5 a pack.              And that's --

 7                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           I think -- I think

 8   that's what's happening, isn't it?

10                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           We're paying -- I

11   thought that everybody was paying, what is it, $10 a

12   pack now?    I don't even know the price.            It's pretty

13   high.

14                  MR. CARVIN:      Right.       And everywhere that

15   it's --

16                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           I think everybody

17   recognizes that it's all taxation for the purposes of

18   dissuading you to buy it.

19                  MR. CARVIN:      That's precisely my point.             And

20   everyone intuitively understands that that system is

21   dramatically different than saying cigarettes tomorrow

22   are illegal.

23                  JUSTICE BREYER:           It is different.   It is

24   different.     It is different.           I agree with that.     But

 1   government set up these emergency room laws.             The

 2   government set up Medicaid.             The government set up

 3   Medicare.   The government set up CHIP, and there are 40

 4   million people who don't have the private insurance.

 5                In that world, the government has set up

 6   commerce.   It's all over the United States.            And in that

 7   world, of course, the decision by the 40 million not to

 8   buy the insurance affects that commerce and

 9   substantially so.

10                So, I thought the issue here is not whether

11   it's a violation of some basic right or something to

12   make people buy things they don't want, but simply

13   whether those decisions of that group of 40 million

14   people substantially affect the interstate commerce that

15   has been set up in part through these other programs.

16                MR. CARVIN:       That's the --

18   argument I'm not hearing.

19                MR. CARVIN:       Oh, let me, please.       It is

20   clear that the failure to buy health insurance doesn't

21   affect anyone.   Defaulting on your payments to your

22   health care provider does.          Congress chose, for whatever

23   reason, not to regulate the harmful activity of

24   defaulting on your health care provider.             They used the

25   20 percent or whoever among the uninsured as a leverage

 2   risk --

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:          I agree -- I agree that

 4   that's what's happening here.

 5               MR. CARVIN:      Okay.

 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:          And the Government tells

 7   us that's because the insurance market is unique.          And

 8   in the next case, it'll say the next market is unique.

 9   But I think it is true that if most questions in life

10   are matters of degree, in the insurance and health care

11   world, both markets -- stipulate two markets -- the

12   young person who is uninsured is uniquely proximately

13   very close to affecting the rates of insurance and the

14   costs of providing medical care in a way that is not

15   true in other industries.

16               That's my concern in the case.

17               MR. CARVIN:      And your -- I may be

18   misunderstanding you, Justice Kennedy, and I hope I'm

19   not.

20               Sure, it would be perfectly fine if they

21   allowed -- you do actuarial risk for young people on the

22   basis of their risk for disease, just like you judge

23   flood insurance on the homeowner's risk of flood.          One

24   of the issues here is not only that they're compelling

25   us to enter into the marketplace, they're not -- they're

 2   sensible product that we would want, catastrophic

 3   insurance.

 4                Everyone agrees the only potential problem

 5   of the 30-year-old is he goes from the healthy 70

 6   percent of the population to the unhealthy 5 percent.

 7   And yet, Congress prohibits anyone over 30 from buying

 8   any kind of catastrophic health insurance.              And the

 9   reason they do that is because they need this massive

10   subsidy.

11                Justice Alito, it's not our numbers.             CBO

12   said that injecting my clients into the risk pool lowers

13   premiums by 15 to 20 percent.

14                So, Justice Kennedy, even if we were going

15   to create exceptions for people that are outside of

16   commerce and inside of commerce, surely we'd make

17   Congress do a closer nexus and say, look, we're really

18   addressing this problem; we want these 30-year-olds to

19   get catastrophic health insurance.              And not only did

20   they -- they deprived them of that option.

21                And I think that illustrates the dangers of

22   giving Congress these plenary powers, because they can

23   always leverage them.     They can always come up with some

24   public policy rationale that converts the power to

25   regulate commerce into the power to promote commerce,

 1   which, as I was saying before, is the one that I think

 2   is plenary.

 3                  JUSTICE KAGAN:        Mr. Carvin, a large part of

 4   this argument has concerned the question of whether

 5   certain kinds of people are active participants in a

 6   market or not active participants in a market.           And your

 7   test, which is a test that focuses on this

 8   activity/inactivity distinction, would force one to

 9   confront that problem all the time.

10                  Now, if you look over the history of the

11   Commerce Clause, what you see is that there were sort of

12   unhappy periods when the Court used tests like this,

13   direct versus indirect, commerce versus manufacturing.

14   I think most people would say that those things didn't

15   really work.     And the question is why should this test,

16   inactive versus active, work any better?

17                  MR. CARVIN:      The problem you identify is

18   exactly the problem you would create if you bought the

19   government's bogus limiting principles.           You'd have to

20   draw distinctions between the insurance industry and the

21   car industry and all of that, returning to the Commerce

22   Clause jurisprudence that bedeviled the Court before the

23   1930s, where they were drawing all these kinds of

24   distinctions among industries; whereas our test is

25   really very simple.      Are you buying the product, or is

                                    108

 1   Congress compelling you to buy the product?              I can't

 2   think of a brighter line.

 3                And, again, if Congress has the power to

 4   compel you to buy this product, then obviously they've

 5   got the power to provide you -- to compel you to buy any

 6   product, because any purchase is going to benefit

 7   commerce.   And this Court is never going to second-guess

 8   Congress's policy judgments on how important it is, this

 9   product versus that product.

10                JUSTICE ALITO:        Do you think that drawing a

11   line between commerce and everything else that is not

12   commerce is drawing an artificial line, like drawing a

13   line between commerce and manufacturing?

14                MR. CARVIN:      The words "inactivity" and

15   "activity" are not in the Constitution.              The words

16   "commerce" and "non-commerce" are.              And, again, it's a

17   distinction that comes, Justice Kagan, directly from the

18   text of the Constitution.

19                The Framers consciously gave Congress the

20   ability to regulate commerce, because that's not a

21   particularly threatening activity that deprives you of

22   individual freedom.

23                If you were required -- if you were

24   authorized to require A to transfer property to B, you

25   have, as the early cases put it, a monster in

                                  109

 1   legislation which is against all reason and justice,

 2   because everyone intuitively understands that regulating

 3   people who voluntarily enter into contracts in setting

 4   terms and conditions does not create the possibility of

 5   Congress compelling wealth transfers among the

 6   citizenry.    And that is precisely why the Framers denied

 7   them the power to compel commerce and precisely why they

 8   didn't give them plenary power.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you,

10   Mr. Carvin.

11                 General Verrilli, you have 4 minutes

12   remaining.

13         REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,

14                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

15                 GENERAL VERRILLI:           Thank you,

16   Mr. Chief Justice.

17                 Congress confronted a grave problem when it

18   enacted the Affordable Care Act:              the 40 million

19   Americans who can't get health insurance and suffered

20   often very terrible consequences.                 Now, we agree, I

21   think, everyone arguing this case agrees, that Congress

22   could remedy that problem by imposing an insurance

23   requirement at the point of sale.

24                 That won't work.           The reason it won't work

25   is because people will still show up at the hospital or

                                    110

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   at their physician's office seeking care without

 2   insurance, causing the cost-shifting problem.             And

 3   Mr. Clement's suggestion that they can be signed up for

 4   a high risk pool at that point is utterly unrealistic.

 5                 Think about how much it would cost to get

 6   the insurance when you are at the hospital or at the

 7   doctor.   It would be -- it would be unfathomably high.

 8   That will never work.      Congress understood that.            It

 9   chose the means that will work, the means that it saw

10   worked in the States and -- in the State of

11   Massachusetts, and that -- and that it had every reason

12   to think would work on a national basis.

13                 That is the kind of choice of means that

14   McCulloch says that the Constitution leaves to the

15   democratically accountable branches of government.

16                 There is no temporal limitation in the

17   Commerce Clause.    Everyone subject to this regulation is

18   in or will be in the health care market.             They are just

19   being regulated in advance.             That's exactly the kind of

20   thing that ought to be left to the judgment of Congress

21   and the democratically accountable branches of

22   government.

23                 And I think this is actually a paradigm

24   example of the kind of situation that Chief Justice

25   Marshall envisioned in McCulloch itself, that the

                                   111

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   provisions of the Constitution needed to be interpreted

 2   in a manner that would allow them to be effective in

 3   addressing the great crises of human affairs that the

 4   Framers could not even envision.

 5               But if there's any doubt about that under

 6   the Commerce Clause, then I urge this Court to uphold

 7   the -- the minimum coverage provision as an exercise of

 8   the taxing power.

 9               Under New York v. United States, this is

10   precisely a parallel situation.             If the Court thinks

11   there's any doubt about the ability of Congress to

12   impose the requirement in 5000A(a), it can be treated as

13   simply the predicate to which the tax incentive of

14   5000A(b) seeks accomplishment.

15               And the Court, as the Court said in New

16   York, has a solemn obligation to respect the judgments

17   of the democratically accountable branches of

18   government, and because this statute can be construed in

19   a manner that allows it to be upheld in that way, I

20   respectfully submit that it is this Court's duty to do

21   so.

22               Thank you.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, General.
