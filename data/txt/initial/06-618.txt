 3                JUSTICE STEVENS:            We will hear argument in

 4   No. 06-618, the Office of Senator Mark Dayton against

 5   Brad Hanson.

 6                ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN M. MANNING

 7                    ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

 8                MS. MANNING:         Justice Stevens and may it

 9   please the Court:

10                If I may, I would like to quickly frame the

11   merits of the case and then turn to the jurisdictional

12   issue.    In United States vs. Gravel this Court

13   recognized that members of Congress have to delegate

14   some of their legislative authority to employees and

15   these employees are a second self to the member.                They

16   are performing some of the legislative duties the member

17   himself would otherwise perform.                Therefore, they are an

18   integral part of the legislative process of the member's

19   office.    For that reason, the member must have absolute

20   trust and confidence that these employees are in fact

21   performing as his second self, and to do that the member

22   has to have complete discretion in selecting who these

23   employees are and in managing them.

24                If a court oversees a member's selection of

25   these employees and his management of these employees,


                                         3

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   then the court and not the member is managing part of

 2   his legislative process and that is a violation of the

 3   Speech or Debate Clause because the purpose of the

 4   clause is to ensure that the legislative process will be

 5   performed independently.         Now --

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Do you think -- do you

 7   think that we owe any special measure of respect to the

 8   Congress, that is most intimately concerned with the

 9   Speech or Debate Clause, with their view that this is,

10   this legislation is compatible with that clause?

11                MS. MANNING:        I do not, Justice Ginsburg.

12   This Court has never deferred to Congress with respect

13   to its interpretation and in fact has disagreed with

14   Congress, for example, in the Gravel case.              But the

15   other reason is that the Congress of course is a

16   political body and because of that it will make

17   decisions that are politically expedient at times, which

18   means that over time their decisions can change, while

19   the Court is uniquely designed and intended to decide

20   cases on something other than what is politically

21   expedient.   This is especially important when we are

22   dealing with the Constitution and interpreting the

23   Constitution.

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But what we are involved

25   with in this case is Congress subjecting itself to the


                                        4

 1   laws that govern all other employers.

 2               MS. MANNING:           It did, Justice Ginsburg,

 3   subject itself, but it also in Section 413 recognized

 4   that there may be Speech or Debate Clause issues and

 5   maybe not all of these cases can be adjudicated in a

 6   court.   Not that they can't be adjudicated, but maybe

 7   not in a court.     So while subjecting itself to the law

 8   and doing the best it could to do that, it also cannot

 9   trump the Constitution.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Which is what the statute

11   says, and so how could the statute possibly be

12   unconstitutional?

13               MS. MANNING:           We are not --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:               I mean, the Constitution --

15   I mean, the statute has within itself a Speech or Debate

16   Clause exception.     Now, I guess you can argue that a

17   lower court might not accurately provide the Speech or

18   Debate Clause protection that is due, but that, that

19   doesn't meet, it seems to me, the, the jurisdictional

20   requirement that, that the constitutionality of the

21   statute be called into question.

22               MS. MANNING:           Well, Justice Scalia, we are

23   not arguing that the statute is unconstitutional.

24   Rather, it's an as-applied argument.                      What we are

25   arguing is that the issue that was before the circuit


                                          5

 1   court was whether the application of Section 408 to this

 2   particular case -- and of course 408 is what gives the

 3   Court jurisdiction -- whether applying that to this case

 4   violates the Constitution.

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, that doesn't comply

 6   with Section 412, which says that an appeal may be taken

 7   directly to the Supreme Court from "any interlocutory or

 8   final judgment decree of order of court upon the

 9   constitutionality of any provision of the Act."             Now,

10   and as-applied challenge is not a challenge to the

11   constitutionality of the provision.

12              MS. MANNING:          Justice Scalia, in the United

13   States versus Eichman, that statute at issue there had

14   statutory direct appeal language that was exactly the

15   language of 412.

16              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Isn't there a further

17   problem here, though, that the order of the district

18   court gave no explanation?          We have no way of knowing

19   exactly why the court ruled the way it did, and for that

20   reason the appeal, the review, was that the original

21   appeal was taken properly to the court of appeals, so

22   that we are here not on appellate jurisdiction, but cert

23   jurisdiction, if at all.

24              MS. MANNING:          I believe that you can take

25   appellate jurisdiction of this case because, as I was


                                        6

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   saying, in United --

 2               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, there'S no direct

 3   appeal.   We have appellate jurisdiction only if there's

 4   a direct appeal and there's no direct appeal.                    This is

 5   coming from the court of appeals.

 6               MS. MANNING:         Oh, Section 412 provides

 7   direct appeal from either court, unlike the Flag

 8   Protection Act direct appeal language, which must be

 9   from the district court.         Section 412 doesn't limit it

10   to an appeal from the district court.                   It can be either

11   one.

12               JUSTICE SOUTER:             What pages are the text of

13   412 set out on?   You're going to have to help me here.

14               MS. MANNING:         I'm sorry.             With respect to --

15   it's at the jurisdictional statement at page 65a.                      And

16   the direct appellate language that was at issue in the

17   Flag Protection Act did limit the appeal to appeals from

18   the district court.     But Section 412 is different from

19   that.   It doesn't --

20               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, why wasn't the ruling

21   of the district court a ruling upon the

22   constitutionality of the statute as applied?                    As I

23   understand it, you moved to dismiss the case on the

24   ground that an individual performing the duties that

25   Mr. Dayton performed cannot sue a member of Congress for


                                        7

 1   employment discrimination and the district court denied

 2   that.   Why isn't that a ruling on the constitutionality

 3   of the, of the statute as applied?

 4               MS. MANNING:          Well, Justice Alito, the

 5   argument we made was that to reach that decision there

 6   were a couple of sub-arguments the court had to reach.

 7   We had argued that, number one, is there a waiver of

 8   sovereign immunity?      If not, then is an employee who

 9   meets the I'll call the duties test that we've set out

10   in our brief, is that employee's claim jurisdictionally

11   barred from court review, and if so does Mr. Hanson meet

12   that duties test?     Now, the court could have decided

13   that Mr. Hanson doesn't meet the duties test, therefore

14   we never have to reach the constitutional issue, and

15   that would have been a decision on his duties, not on

16   the Constitution.

17               JUSTICE ALITO:           Was there a dispute about

18   the nature of his duties?

19               MS. MANNING:          I'm sorry?

20               JUSTICE ALITO:           Not how you characterize his

21   duties, but what his duties actually were.               Was there a

22   dispute about that?

23               MS. MANNING:          He did not dispute his duties.

24   What he disputed was -- what he said was that of the

25   duties we set forth in the affidavit -- and that was


                                         8

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Mr. Kimball's declaration, which is at the

 2   jurisdictional statement at 66a -- he said that they

 3   represent only 5 percent of his legislative duties over

 4   the course of his employment.               Well, of course, we're

 5   not setting forth every jurisdictional duty he had over

 6   the course of his employment.               So he --

 7               JUSTICE ALITO:            But didn't the district

 8   court rule that somebody performing those duties can

 9   constitutionally be tried -- bring suit, and it doesn't,

10   and it doesn't violate the Speech or Debate Clause?                 So

11   I don't see how that's not a ruling on the

12   constitutionality of the statute as applied.

13               MS. MANNING:           No, Justice Alito, the court

14   didn't rule that.     The court just gave us a minute

15   order, and there's a possibility that it ruled that, but

16   there is a possibility that it just said it doesn't

17   matter what test you're telling me, counsel, because

18   this particular employee doesn't meet your test to begin

19   with.   So I'm saying, the court could have said, I'm

20   saying he doesn't meet --

21               JUSTICE BREYER:               Don't you agree with

22   Justice Scalia -- Justice Alito?                 Don't you agree with

23   Justice Alito?   I thought he's saying it's a ruling on

24   constitutionality.

25               MS. MANNING:           It is a -- not the district

 1   court ruling.     Not the district court.                    The appellate

 2   court, yes.     I'm sorry, Justice Breyer.                    The appellate

 3   court, yes; the district court, no, because the district

 4   court was merely a minute order.                 And it's a possibility

 5   that it could have been unconstitutional and a

 6   possibility it could not.

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:            I see.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            My problem is, it's

 9   extraordinary.     We have very few direct appeal cases any

10   more and I, I am loathe to read Section 412 as embracing

11   a decision by a court that a particular use of this

12   statute was unconstitutional.               You say it was, the

13   statute was unconstitutional as applied.                       That's sloppy

14   language.   It really means that this application of the

15   statute or the use of the statute for this purpose was

16   unconstitutional.

17                 I think that's something different from

18   saying that it was an order of the court upon the

19   constitutionality of any provision.                       Which provision of

20   this Act has been held to be unconstitutional?

21                 MS. MANNING:         Section 408 as applied to this

22   case is unconstitutional.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Which -- but it hasn't been

24   held to be unconstitutional.              It's perfectly

25   constitutional.     You're just saying it can't be used in


                                         10

 1   this particular case.

 2              MS. MANNING:         Well, when Congress --

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:            I mean, read the language.

 4   It says "The constitutionality of any provision of this

 5   act," not "the constitutionality of the application of

 6   any provision of this act."

 7              MS. MANNING:         Yes, and in United States

 8   versus Eichman, Justice Scalia, the very same language

 9   was at issue.

10              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What is that citation?          I

11   was looking for that.     Is that cited in your brief?

12              MS. MANNING:         Yes, United States versus

13   Eichman is cited at the Appellant's reply brief at page

14   1.

15              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Thank you.

16              MS. MANNING:         And the statutory section is

17   18 U.S.C. Section 700(d), and the direct appeal language

18   is exactly the same, "upon the constitutionality of a

19   provision of this act."       And this Court accepted direct

20   appeal when the issue was whether the application of the

21   Flag Protection Act was unconstitutional.                 In any event,

22   even if this Court were not to take jurisdiction --

23              JUSTICE STEVENS:            But in the flag case the

24   whole statute was either valid or not.                 There weren't

25   different applications, were there?

 1                 MS. MANNING:        Counsel argued both, but this

 2   Court did not deal with both.              This Court actually took

 3   direct appeal just on the as-applied argument.              Counsel

 4   argued the statute was unconstitutional and the second

 5   argument was --

 6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You mean we held that the

 7   statute was constitutional on its face?

 8                 MS. MANNING:        What the Court held was --

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I'll look at Eichman, but

10   it's not my recollection of the case, that the whole,

11   the essence of the duty imposed by, under the statute

12   was held.

13                 MS. MANNING:        It was the application in that

14   particular situation.

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, but there's always

16   an application or there's no case.

17                 MS. MANNING:        Well, the --

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Absent some declaratory

19   judgment provision.

20                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           We simply didn't rule hold

21   was a right to burn flags in some cases and not others.

22                 MS. MANNING:        Well, there were questions

23   that the parties raised.          One was, is the statute

24   unconstitutional altogether.             And the Court didn't even

25   touch that.    Instead the second argument they raised was


                                        12

 1   well, is it constitutional -- unconstitutional, rather,

 2   as applied on these facts?            And that is what the Court

 3   took the case on, that was what allowed direct

 4   jurisdiction.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            What -- what had the lower

 6   court held?     It isn't a question of what we held; it's a

 7   question of what the lower court had held.                 Had the

 8   lower court held that it was unconstitutional?

 9                 MS. MANNING:         I'm sorry, Justice Scalia, I

10   don't remember what the lower court held in that case --

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I mean, but that can mean

12   -- you can always dispose of a, of a facial challenge by

13   just saying we don't have to reach the facial question;

14   we can decide it on an as applied question.                 But in

15   order to get here in the first place, it has to be a

16   challenge to the constitutionality of a provision of the

17   Act.

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And in we recite that the

19   district court held the Act unconstitutional as applied

20   to appellees and dismissed the charges.

21                 MS. MANNING:         Right.        Unconstitutional as

22   applied so it was an as applied argument.                 And now when

23   the Court wants a statute to mean that it's only an

24   unconstitutional interpretation as opposed to a

25   constitutional interpretation, the Court -- I'm sorry,


                                         13

 1   Congress makes that distinction.                 So for example in 28

 2   U.S.C. Section 1257, which was a direct appeals statute,

 3   and has since been repealed, in that statute Congress

 4   did say that there is direct appeal when the statute is

 5   found to be constitutional, or when the statute is found

 6   to be unconstitutional.          But it used -- Congress, that

 7   is, used the vague language, more vague and general

 8   language in Section 412, which is just upon the

 9   constitutionality.      In any event --

10                JUSTICE SOUTER:             I realize, before you leave

11   that I realize that on a jurisdictional issue like that

12   we have an obligation to raise it ourselves.                But I'm --

13   I'm -- I'm curious, was -- was jurisdiction contested in

14   that case?

15                MS. MANNING:          Not that I recall in the

16   Eichman case.   Not that I recall.

17                JUSTICE SOUTER:

18                MS. MANNING:          Okay.       In any case, this Court

19   should accept the petition, take this case on a petition

20   for writ because the decision of the court of appeals

21   was upon a question of Federal law that is an important

22   question.

23                Moving to my Speech or Debate Clause

24   argument, with respect to Speech or Debate Clause, this

25   Court has held that all acts that are within the


                                         14
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   legitimate legislative sphere are protected by Speech or

 2   Debate Clause immunity.          And the Court has defined what

 3   is inside that sphere as anything that is part of the

 4   due functioning of the legislative process.                      And when an

 5   employee is an alter ego, that is, a second self of a

 6   member, that employee by definition is actually

 7   performing part of the member's job.                      He is performing

 8   legislative acts so he is in this sphere.                      He is doing

 9   something that is part of the due functioning of the

10   legislative process.        He is in that sphere.

11               JUSTICE BREYER:              What does he do?         I mean I

12   looked at what he does in 74, 75, 76a.                     He seems to

13   spend a lot of time moving furniture.                     He lists that

14   twice.   He runs the office.             And he represents, he is

15   out in the local office somewhere and he talks to

16   constituents.     I mean, he doesn't even appear in the

17   Senate office except very rarely in which case he is

18   doing casework.     So I guess if he is included in that, I

19   mean so is a full-time furniture mover.

20               MS. MANNING:           Justice Breyer, he did

21   significantly more than that.               First --

22               JUSTICE BREYER:              I have the whole list here.

23   What here suggests, he ever -- he doesn't even write a

24   statement for the floor.           There is nothing here that

25   suggests one word of anything he did ever went to a

 1   committee meeting, to a floor of the Senate, anything.

 2                 MS. MANNING:        Oh, Justice --

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:           What?

 4                 MS. MANNING:        Justice Breyer --

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:           What are the words?

 6                 MS. MANNING:        Actually in the Kimball

 7   declaration, which is at jurisdictional statement 66a,

 8   and the self evaluation of Mr. Hanson which is attached

 9   thereto as a jurisdictional statement at 78a, and this

10   is his self evaluation and Mr. Kimball, his supervisor

11   at the time telling what he had done, he being

12   Mr. Hanson.

13                 Some of the things Mr. Hanson did was he did

14   talk to constituents, but remember of course the member

15   is in D.C.; he is supposed to be representing people in

16   the State.    The very people who have contact with --

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I agree with that one.   I

18   just said he doesn't do anything that gets to the floor

19   of the Senate, that gets to a committee report, that

20   gets to a committee hearing.             Now what in there -- and

21   you said it was not contested, so I guess the best

22   source if it's not contested is his affidavit.

23                 MS. MANNING:        Justice Breyer actually he did

24   both of those.    He for example, when talking to the

25   constituents realized that there was a problem with


                                        16

 1   respect to ambulance reimbursement for health care.                      He

 2   went to the Senator and said we've got a problem here in

 3   the State, and the constituents have identified it.                      He

 4   then said to the Senator, I think you should draft

 5   legislation on this and I think you should have a

 6   committee hearing on this.           Both of which the Senator

 7   did.    Mr. Hanson drafted that legislation.                 He --

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:            Oh.     Where does it say

 9   that?    He drafted legislation that was then introduced?

10                MS. MANNING:         Yes, he did.           He drafted --

11                JUSTICE BREYER:            Where does it say that?

12                MS. MANNING:         That is in the Kimball

13   declaration which is jurisdictional statements at page

14   66a.    And he also prepared the witnesses for the

15   hearings.    Justice -- I'm sorry, Senator Dayton had the

16   hearing on the health care issue, and Mr. Hanson

17   identified the witnesses for that, prepared them, wrote

18   the questions for the hearing and --

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, he didn't do

20   exclusively that stuff anyway.               We can certainly all

21   agree on that.    And why isn't it sufficient that when

22   any of those issues are, his activities in any of those

23   capacities are sought to be introduced into evidence,

24   anyone tries to contradict them, then you can bring in

25   your Speech or Debate Clause objection?

 1                MS. MANNING:         Because it is --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why is the whole suit

 3   precluded?

 4                MS. MANNING:         The whole suit is precluded

 5   because when you have as we do an employee who is in

 6   this legislative sphere, that the Court has identified,

 7   he is in that sphere because he is performing

 8   legislative acts.    So a member who decides, you know, I

 9   don't want him in my legislative duties anymore, my

10   sphere, I'm pulling him out.             Taking him out, when the

11   member takes him out of that process, he has done

12   something -- he being the member -- that is also part of

13   the functioning of the legislative process, which is the

14   test.

15                So the termination itself is part of the

16   functioning of the legislative process which is the test

17   for a legislative act.        And therefore this case is

18   predicated on a legislative act.                That is, the

19   termination.   And in Doe V. McMillan this Court stated

20   that a case that is predicated on a legislative cannot

21   be adjudicated.

22                JUSTICE STEVENS:            I'm puzzled.     Firing

23   somebody is a legislative act?

24                MS. MANNING:         I'm sorry, Justice Stevens?

25                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Firing someone is a

 1   legislative act?

 2               MS. MANNING:         Firing not anyone is a

 3   legislative act, but firing your second self is a

 4   legislative act.   And the reason for that is that you

 5   are doing something that is part of your legislative

 6   process.   You created a hole in your legislative

 7   process; you have taken out an employee who is your

 8   second self.   This is your second self.                   And you've

 9   decided, you know, I think my legislative process is

10   going to work better with him gone.

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That's part of -- how many

12   second selves would there be?

13               (Laughter.)

14               MS. MANNING:         I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg?

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             On the Senator's staff?

16               MS. MANNING:         I'm sorry.             I still didn't

17   hear.

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How many second selves?

19   Of -- what universe are you covering?                    Who is not a

20   second self, who works in a Senator's office?

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Maybe he was the 23rd self.

22               (Laughter.)

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I think you have to figure

24   out when he was hired.

25               MS. MANNING:         Well, in Gravel, in United

 1   States vs. Gravel, this Court stated not only do you

 2   have second selves, but you must -- members must

 3   delegate and redelegate and redelegate authority.                       That

 4   implies there are a lot of second selves.                     It's not one

 5   person.     So there can be --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:            What's wrong with this?           I

 7   found what you're talking about here.                     It says in

 8   paragraph 13, contrary to what he says in his own

 9   evaluation, that Senator Dayton's staff, including

10   Mr. Hanson -- that's a little uncertain, what they mean

11   by that -- introduced a bill and drafted it.                    Okay?    And

12   then on paragraph 14 they say on November 15th, 2001,

13   Mr. Hanson -- just as you said -- planned a Senate

14   Government Affairs Committee meeting, selected hearing

15   witnesses and prepared questions.

16                 Now suppose that we did as the court, lower

17   court wanted to do, say let's just see if that becomes

18   relevant.    Because it's possible, given his other tasks

19   that those two incidents, one on November 15th and the

20   other, whenever help he gave to the drafting, had

21   nothing to do with his being fired and nobody claims

22   that.   So what they said is let's wait and see if that

23   becomes relevant.     Now what's wrong with that solution?

24                 MS. MANNING:         What's wrong with that

25   solution is that when a member, as I was explaining in

 1   response to Justice Stevens' questions, when a member

 2   has a second self who is in the legislative process and

 3   the member says you know, I'm pulling him out of the

 4   process because he doesn't perform well, he -- I don't

 5   think he is my second self, that termination for

 6   whatever reason is part of the process because the

 7   member has changed the process.

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.       Let's make an

 9   absurd case out of it which I'm trying to do a little

10   bit to get you to focus on it.              Let's suppose he got

11   fired because he didn't move the furniture properly.

12               MS. MANNING:         The -- it is a whole employee.

13   When he is removed from the process for whatever reason,

14   he is gone from the process so that is part of the

15   functioning of the process.            If I may give an example,

16   let's say that the Senator is at Union Station and he is

17   buying a gift for someone and he hears someone making

18   very derogatory statements to the cashier, and he turns

19   around and lo and behold, this is his legislative

20   director.   And he says I can't have this person as my

21   second self; I don't talk to individuals that way; this

22   has nothing to do with my legislative process but this

23   is a second self and he is not my second self and I pull

24   him out of the process.

25               That has affected his legislative process.


                                       21

 1   He now has a hole in this sphere, this legislative

 2   sphere.   The person is gone.            That is a part of his

 3   legislative process.       He didn't matter, why he is gone.

 4   He is gone.

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Isn't that a -- can you

 6   give me examples of cases where that Act applies?

 7                 MS. MANNING:        I'm sorry?

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Can you give me instances

 9   in which employees of an the office of a Senator are

10   covered by these obligations and cannot invoke the

11   Speech or Debate Clause?          What's the classic example

12   where you can't invoke the Speech or Debate Clause?

13                 MS. MANNING:        Where you cannot invoke the

14   Speech or Debate Clause.

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yeah.

16                 MS. MANNING:        Was that the question, or can?

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.       Because it seems to

18   me that your argument just completely eviscerates the

19   intent of the Congress in passing this Act.

20                 MS. MANNING:        If I may answer the second

21   question first, approximately 75 percent of the people

22   who are covered by this Act, the employees who are

23   covered by this Act are not employed by members of

24   Congress or committees.         Now those employees for the

25   most part -- and not all of them, because some of those


                                        22
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   employees do work on the floor, but for the most part --

 2                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, except the Act

 3   itself has a provision for office of Senators.

 4                MS. MANNING:         And those employees --

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And so it seems to me

 6   you're giving no effect to that.                You say there is a

 7   hole in the process the minute the furniture mover is

 8   gone?

 9                MS. MANNING:         No, Justice Kennedy, those

10   employees -- first of all some of those employees can

11   sue.    For example the Court has said that writing news

12   releases or newsletters to constituents, this is in the

13   Brewster case, are not, that is not a legislative act.

14   So if we have an employee in a member's office like the

15   deputy press secretary who does those kind of things,

16   that person is not performing legislative acts.               But in

17   addition to that these employees still have a -- a

18   forum; their forum is the Office of Compliance, which is

19   unique to the Congressional Accountability Act.               And the

20   Office of Compliance has cases heard before retired

21   judges; the employees get the same remedies as they

22   would in court.    It is the same procedure except that it

 1   can't sue; it's that they cannot sue in Federal court.

 2              JUSTICE ALITO:           If this statute --

 3              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Wouldn't they get into --

 4   no, you.

 5              JUSTICE ALITO:           If this statute was set up

 6   so that the defendant here was the Senate, as opposed to

 7   the office of a Senator, would you still say that this

 8   suit couldn't go forward?

 9              MS. MANNING:          With respect to the abatement

10   issue, I would -- this is with respect to the abatement

11   issue -- I would say that the case would not be abated,

12   because the defendant would still exist.                But with

13   respect to the Speech or Debate Clause issue I would say

14   it could not still go forward, and the reason for that

15   is the immunity is, as this Court stated in Gravel, is

16   not like a badge that attaches to different people and

17   different entities.     It's an expression of a policy,

18   which means that whenever a case is going to infringe

19   into this legislative sphere, irrespective of who the

20   defendant is, then the case could not be adjudicated in

21   a Federal court.

22              And so for example in Eastland versus

23   Servicemen's Fund this Court stated that a committee of

24   the Senate is covered by the Speech or Debate Clause.

25   And in Tenney although that was a State case, the Court


                                       24

 1   did apply the Speech or Debate Clause jurisprudence.

 2   The Court there said that a committee of the State is

 3   covered by the Speech or Debate Clause and the case

 4   would be dismissed.

 5              And then in Doe vs. McMillan, in that case

 6   there was a consultant to Congress and he was sued.

 7   There was functionaries of Congress that did not work

 8   for a member, did not work for a committee and the Court

 9   held in that case that if those, if the consultant and

10   the functionaries were performing duties that were

11   within this legislative sphere, the Speech or Debate

12   Clause clause applies and the case was dismissed.

13              JUSTICE ALITO:          In what sense would the

14   member be called to answer under those circumstances, if

15   the member isn't a defendant and has no financial

16   liability and is able to invoke the clause as an

17   evidentiary privilege?       In what sense would the Speech

18   or Debate Clause be applicable?

19              MS. MANNING:         In the scenario where the

20   Congress is the defendant?

21              JUSTICE ALITO:          Yes.

22              MS. MANNING:         Well, what we are arguing is

23   that the termination itself, the termination itself is a

24   legislative act because the termination itself is part

25   of the due functioning of the legislative process.           And

 1   in Doe V. McMillan the Court stated that when a case is

 2   predicated on a legislative act, court jurisdiction is

 3   barred.    Now also in answer to your question it doesn't

 4   matter who the defendant is.             The member, let's say

 5   Congress was --

 6                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well why doesn't it matter

 7   who the defendant is?       Because I don't, this so-called

 8   office of Senator Mark Dayton is a construct that I

 9   understand, and there is no immunity problem there.                        But

10   if, if that office is gone now and getting to your

11   hypothesis, if the, if -- if the true party is the

12   Senate of the United States, has there been any

13   unequivocal waiver of immunity with respect to the

14   entire Senator or the Senate of the United States as an

15   institution?

16                MS. MANNING:         No Justice Ginsburg, there has

17   been no waiver --

18                JUSTICE SOUTER:            I'm Justice Souter.

19                MS. MANNING:         I'm sorry.             Justice Souter,

20   sorry.    Justice Souter --

 1   defendant.     Section 1408 of the CAA which of course

 2   gives the Court jurisdiction --

 3                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes, but I was just going

 4   to say if this case continues we've got to accept the

 5   proposition that the Office of Senator Mark Dayton is

 6   still a, some kind of an entity that has got to be

 7   accorded reality by the judiciary, right.

 8                 MS. MANNING:         That is correct, because --

 9                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            And how do we do it?         I

10   mean, you've said -- I don't want to go too far with a

11   metaphor, but you spoke a moment ago of there being sort

12   of a, what did you say, a hole or a space in the

13   legislative sphere when somebody is fired.                    In the

14   sphere at the moment is totally empty.                    The Senator's

15   gone.     Everybody knows that this, this office of Senator

16   Mark Dayton is a totally fictional construct.                    And in

17   reality, as you point out, the money is going to come

18   out of the Senate or some Senate fund.                    If we allow this

19   to go forward, we've got to face the reality that it's

20   the Senate which is the defendant and there hasn't been

21   a waiver of immunity.

22                 MS. MANNING:         I agree with that, Justice

23   Souter.    There is no defendant that exists any more.

24   The only defendant in the CAA, and the language is very

25   express, is the employing office and the employing

 1   office is defined in Section 1301(9) as, for purposes of

 2   this case, "the personal office of a member of

 3   Congress."    And there is no member of Congress --

 4                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Yes, but at this point

 5   that's silly.    There's no Senator.                There's no office in

 6   any sense.

 7                 MS. MANNING:        I agree with you that there is

 8   no defendant any more.        This defendant has ceased to

 9   exist and this case has abated.               There is no successor

10   and when there is no successor there are not two

11   adversarial parties in the case.                There's no case or

12   controversy, case is moot, and the case should be

13   dismissed on that basis alone.

14                 Why -- the Court does not even have to reach

15   the jurisdictional issue with respect to the Speech or

16   Debate Clause because this case became moot in January

17   when the function of the office, which was solely to

18   support Senator Dayton -- when there was no Senator

19   Dayton there was no office of Senator Dayton.                 There is

20   no defendant that is extant in this case and therefore

21   the case --

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           There's never an office.      I

23   mean, I think the office is just a fictional construct

24   anyway.   So what you say now has nothing to do with

25   whether, whether this current Senator has, has departed

 1   from the scene.     Even if he were still on the scene,

 2   there still wouldn't be any such thing as that office.

 3   It's just a fiction, and it would always be a suit

 4   against Congress, and so you say none of these suits can

 5   ever be brought.

 6                MS. MANNING:          Justice Scalia, it is not just

 7   a fiction.     The office --

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why isn't it a waiver of

 9   sovereign immunity when you set up a suit that envisions

10   a suit which will be paid off by the Senate?              Why isn't

11   that a waiver of sovereign immunity?

12                MS. MANNING:          It is, Justice Scalia, a

13   waiver of sovereign immunity that has a condition on it.

14                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Is it unequivocal?

15                MS. MANNING:          It is unequivocal --

16                JUSTICE SOUTER:             I mean, when it's done on

17   the basis of this fiction, is that what we should accept

18   as an unequivocal waiver?

19                MS. MANNING:          Well, first, I disagree with

20   the premise in that I don't think it is a fiction that

21   this office never existed.            The office, the personal

22   office of a member of Congress -- members of Congress

23   didn't work out in the hallway before the CAA was

24   passed.   There was always a personal office of a member

25   of Congress.    So in that sense it is not a fiction.

 1                I would like to reserve the balance of my

 2   time.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:             A physical, a physical

 4   office, yes.     I mean, they didn't work in the hallway.

 5   But their staff salary was not paid out of their, quote,

 6   "office."    It was paid out of the Senate.

 7                MS. MANNING:          Well, actually the structure

 8   doesn't support that.        The Senate, within the Senate,

 9   each member does pay the salary, sets the salary.                       We

10   can have legislative directors and do have legislative

11   directors in two different offices, different salaries,

12   different numbers of paid days, different number of

13   annual leave days.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Setting it is quite

15   different from paying it.

16                MS. MANNING:          It is paid for --

17                JUSTICE SCALIA               :    The Senator sets it and

18   the Senate pays it.

19                MS. MANNING:          Justice Scalia, actually the

20   Senate is given an appropriation and all of his salaries

21   must be paid from the appropriation.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Right.           The Senate puts a

23   limit on how much money it will spend for a particular

24   Senator.    That's all that amounts to.                    It doesn't hand

25   him the money.    It's still the Senate's money, isn't it?

 1   And what the Senate says is each office will have so

 2   much of a call upon our fund and no more.

 3               MS. MANNING:          It is the appropriated fund

 4   for the Senator and the Senator is the one who pays the

 9             ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. SALZMAN

10                       ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE

11               MR. SALZMAN:          Justice Stevens and may it

12   please the Court:

13               The motion to dismiss in this case raised a

14   single issue, the issue of absolute immunity; more

15   specifically, whether the employing office created by

16   Congress as the defendant in these kinds of cases can be

17   sued by a member of a Senator or a House of

18   Representatives staff.        The Dayton office argues that a

19   Senator's personnel decisions are always a legislative

20   act that are always absolutely immunized by the Speech

21   or Debate Clause.    That argument is untenable and it was

22   rejected by every one of the eight judges of the D.C.

23   Circuit en banc.

24               This case doesn't involve any administrative

25   acts.   Mr. Hanson didn't work on Capitol Hill.          He was


                                        31
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   in the Minnesota office.         His, the nature of his claim

 2   is that he was a valued employee until he became ill and

 3   disclosed his illness and need for surgery, at which

 4   point he was fired.     Senator Dayton's office first says

 5   that they were not even aware, that Senator Dayton was

 6   unaware of the need for surgery at the time he made the

 7   decision to fire Mr. Hanson, and then says that the

 8   reason for the firing was Mr. Hanson's work on a classic

 9   constituent service.

10              This case presents exactly the hypothetical

11   that Justice Breyer was asking about.                   Although

12   Mr. Hanson had a very small, he says 5 percent of his

13   duties, that were in some way related to the legislative

14   process, no one contends, not Mr. Kimball, not Senator

15   Dayton's office, that that had anything to do with the

16   reason for his firing.       In fact, the only evidence in

17   the record, in this record so far, is that on that small

18   amount of work that Mr. Hanson did with respect to

19   ambulance legislation, he did a, quote unquote, "great

20   job."

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:             The other side's contention

22   is that the firing is itself a legislative act and so

23   when you challenge the firing you are challenging the

24   legislative act.   What do you say to that?

25              MR. SALZMAN:          We say that's absolutely wrong


                                       32
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Justice Scalia, that is absolutely wrong.                  The reason is

 2   that this Court has said that conduct that is related to

 3   the legislative process, that may in fact be important

 4   to the legislative process, is not itself a part of the

 5   legislative process.      That is the fundamental holding of

 6   Brewster.   And this Court has found that some actions

 7   that affect an employee, for example in the Bogan case,

 8   where a decision that resulted in the termination of a

 9   person was clearly legislative in nature because it was

10   made in a legislative proceeding, it was voted upon by

11   the legislators, and it was based upon either budgetary

12   or policy determinations.

13               That is a legislative act.                  But this Court

14   in Bogan specifically distinguished that circumstance

15   from a classic personnel action firing such as happened

16   to Mr. Hanson here.     There was no legislative act

17   involved in Mr. Hanson's firing.               He was just fired.

18   The reason for the firing is at issue in this case.                  A

19   jury can sort out issues like whether or not Senator

20   Dayton had notice of the need for surgery, whether or

21   not Mr. Hanson's performance of classic constituent

22   services was bad or good, as we contend.

23               But none of that involves legislative

24   activity as this Court has described it under the speech

25   or debate act.   So our contention is that the only issue


                                       33

 1   in this case is absolute immunity and there is no

 2   absolute immunity in this case.                This case does not

 3   involve a legislative act, as Judge Randolph below and

 4   all of the judges below recognized.

 5                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            What if his dissent -- or

 6   defense, rather, to the charge is that he was very

 7   inefficient in giving me help in legislative hearings

 8   and so forth, or words of that kind which might be

 9   arguably a legislative act, and that Speech or Debate

10   Clause forbids inquiry into the quality of his

11   performing those duties?

12                 MR. SALZMAN:         Justice Stevens, certainly the

13   Speech or Debate Clause does incorporate -- I'm sorry.

14   The Congressional Accountability Act does incorporate

15   the Speech or Debate Clause with respect to the

16   evidentiary privilege and that is clear from Section

17   413.     In that instance, district courts will have to

18   deal with the proffered evidence on a case-by-case

19   basis.     Obviously, the context matters with respect to

20   any evidentiary privilege.

21                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            But maybe the Senator

22   might argue that this is all privileged:                  It's the

23   reason I fired him, but I can't go into it because I

24   don't want to invade my own privilege not to discuss

25   matters that are covered by the immunity.

 1                MR. SALZMAN:        Well, Justice Stevens, again

 2   if the reason for the firing would shed light if the

 3   district court would show that the allowing the evidence

 4   that is proffered in would so intrude upon a real

 5   legislative act, then the district court can excise that

 6   evidence from the case.        It either can be taken out, as

 7   in the Helstoski case.

 8                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What's the test for

 9   intruding?   If it would chill his exercise of the

10   function in future cases, or if it requires him to talk

11   about legislative decisions, or what?

12                MR. SALZMAN:        I think, as this Court has

13   described it, Justice Kennedy, if it would compel the

14   Senator to testify about his motives for legislation or

15   for a legislative act, then a district court could

16   decide that that evidence would not come in.              The firing

17   itself, however, is not a legislative act and the

18   motivation behind the firing is not precluded by the

19   Speech or Debate Clause.

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What if it required him to

21   say how he allocated his resources, that he allocate his

22   resources 10 percent to foreign affairs issues, 50

23   percent to health care issues?              Would that involve is --

24   is that a Speech or Debate Clause problem?

25                MR. SALZMAN:        I don't believe that it would,

 1   be Justice Kennedy.      I don't think that that would

 2   intrude so much on his goals with respect to a

 3   particular piece of legislation or with respect to a

 4   general legislative agenda.             I'm not sure I would see

 5   that his testifying about how he has allocated money in

 6   the office, for example, would be anything other than

 7   testimony about an administrative decision.

 8               If he were -- for example, if a plaintiff

 9   certainly attempted to introduce evidence in a case

10   about a speech that the Senator gave on the floor of the

11   Senate in which he was accused of making maybe a bigoted

12   or a sexist remark, Section 413 would clearly preclude

13   that.   And there may be circumstance, for example, where

14   if a plaintiff wanted to introduce a draft of the speech

15   or a draft of legislation, that a court, district court,

16   could in those circumstances say that that intrudes so

17   much on a true legislative act that the court could

18   preclude that testimony from going in.

19               We don't believe that in the, in the run of

20   these cases, that will be difficult for the district

21   courts to handle.

22               JUSTICE STEVENS:             That doesn't quite capture

23   the problem that I'm having.             It's not that the

24   plaintiff can't inquire.          Usually they can't.        But my

25   thought is that the defendant cannot put in his own

 1   defense without waiving the privilege that would

 2   otherwise be applicable.           So he's sort of in a dilemma.

 3   Either I give up my constitutional right not to talk

 4   about this stuff or I've got to waive that right in

 5   order to give a full explanation of why I discharged the

 6   plaintiff.

 7                 MR. SALZMAN:         Understood, Justice Stevens.

 8   I think that in most cases that will not present a

 9   dilemma.     Even if the Senator's explanation is, I

10   assigned a real legislative aide to research a piece of

11   legislation and I was dissatisfied for whatever reason,

12   suppose the reason is that the aide simply didn't turn

13   in the memo that that he was assigned to do.                 The

14   Senator testifying about, I gave an assignment to this

15   person, the due date was September 1st, I never got it

16   or he was late or it was riddled with errors --

17                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Or he just wrote a lousy

18   memo.   In order to demonstrate it's lousy, I've got to

19   talk about legislative matters.

20                 MR. SALZMAN:         If that is truly the situation

21   and if a district court assessing, once all of the

22   information is presented to the district court, that

23   requiring the Senator in that circumstance to discuss

24   really his legislative goals, we think that maybe that

25   evidence would not be permitted.                 Now, the, this court

 1   has recognized --

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Even if the Senator did

 3   not have a defense?

 4              MR. SALZMAN:            Well, in Brewster, Your Honor,

 5   this Court recognized that there may be situations where

 6   the court permits an indictment to go forward, in which

 7   the indictment itself and the proof that the prosecutor

 8   will be presenting does not so intrude on the

 9   legislative process that it would be precluded but that

10   the Defendant may decide that in order to explain the

11   accusation he needs to rely on legislative acts.                        And

12   the court recognized that that may be the situation that

13   the Senator is in.      I believe the Third Circuit in a

14   decision written by Justice Alito, the McDade case,

15   talks about that circumstance, where the Senator at that

16   point can choose to put in his explanation and be

17   subject to cross-examination simply with respect to that

18   explanation, but that the prosecution is not precluded

19   in its entirety.     And certainly that's what we are

20   talking about here.

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Yes, but what if the

22   Senator doesn't want to put it in?                   I mean, what if he

23   does not want to waive the privilege?                     Is his only

24   choice in effect to sit moot and lose the case?

25              MR. SALZMAN:            Well, if he chooses to sit

 1   moot and if the evidence --

 2                JUSTICE SOUTER:           "Mute" I guess I should

 3   have said.

 4                MR. SALZMAN:        Mute, I'm sorry.

 5                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Yes.

 6                MR. SALZMAN:        If he chooses to stay silent,

 7   then perhaps the case just goes forward without an

 8   explanation.   The defendant --

 9                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, why don't, why

10   doesn't that -- why doesn't being placed in that dilemma

11   in effect implicate the clause, and why can't he invoke

12   the clause as a basis for dismissal?

13                MR. SALZMAN:        Well, Judge Randolph below

14   thought that there may be circumstances where the

15   evidence is so, all of the evidence is so bound up in a

16   legislative act that the case might not go forward.                  We

17   respectfully disagree with that.               We think that that

18   will rarely be the circumstance.               But this is the system

19   that Congress set up and Congress created the system in

20   a, in a careful way.      The defendant is not the member.

21   The member faces no financial liability whatsoever from

22   a finding of discrimination or unlawful behavior.

23                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, yes, so far as the

24   member's immediate financial concern, they took care of

25   it.   But I'm not sure about the careful way.              They in

 1   effect said, you know, if this gets into Speech or

 2   Debate Clause issues they prevail.                 And that kind of

 3   just leaves us with no solution for the problem that

 4   Justice Stevens raised and that I'm concerning with,

 5   unless there's, there's going to be an automatic

 6   dismissal when the member says, look, I cannot respond

 7   to this without getting into, into acts within the

 8   legislative process which are privileged.

 9              Unless you want to recognize that as kind of

10   an absolute defense upon its invocation, I don't see how

11   we get out of the problem.

12              MR. CABALLERO:           Well, Justice Souter, our

13   argument is that the decision itself is certainly not a

14   legislative act, and the most -- and that is in

15   accordance with this Court's view of the judicial

16   privilege in Forrester that the decision itself is not a

17   judicial act.   The reasons behind the decision in the

18   legislative context could be shielded by the evidentiary

19   privilege, but we think there's a clear difference

20   between the employees performing a duty that is related

21   to the legislative process being different than a

22   legislative act itself.

23              It may be that in some rare circumstances

24   the Senator in order to fully defend himself feels the

25   need to actually testify about real legislative acts,


                                       40

 1   such as votes on something or his conduct in a committee

 2   proceeding.     But his assessment of an employee's

 3   performance, just as Judge White's assessment in the

 4   Forrester case of Miss Forrester's performance, is not

 5   legislative activity.        It may be activity that is

 6   important to the legislative process.                     It may provide

 7   for a sound legislative arena, just as in the judicial

 8   sphere.     But when this Court found unanimous,

 9   unanimously that when Judge White was assessing the

10   performance of Miss Forrester in the judicial context

11   and deciding, I don't think she did a good job on

12   delegated judicial functions, that's not a judicial act.

13   And we would say the same with respect to a legislative

14   act, so --

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That would go for a

16   stenographer in a committee hearing?

17                 MR. SALZMAN:         Yes, Your Honor, and I believe

18   that's the Browning case, that the D.C. Circuit

19   originally had found would be considered a legislative

20   act.   And we do believe that, yes, the assessment by

21   the, whoever supervised Miss Browning that her

22   performance was inadequate is not itself a legislative

23   activity.    Miss Browning's performance obviously was

24   involved, was closely tied to the legislative process

25   because she was a stenographer at hearings.                    If the


                                         41
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   committee, if the committee decided in a committee

 2   proceeding and took a vote that they were not going to

 3   use stenographers any more and Miss Browning had brought

 4   a challenge with respect to that, alleging that it was

 5   focused personally on her and racially motivated, then

 6   we think a legislative immunity might apply as it did in

 7   the Bogan case.

 8               But absent that, it's our belief that an

 9   assessment of an employee's performance, even if the

10   employee is performing duties that are related to the

11   legislative process, is not itself a legislative act.

12               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, it could or couldn't

13   be.   I mean, I mean if the legislator, the Senator,

14   says, I think relevant to my dismissal of this

15   individual is the individual's performance that revealed

16   itself in a speech or debate that I gave in the House,

17   and if that's relevant, then why isn't that the end of

18   the case, they can't bring it?

19               MR. SALZMAN:         Justice Breyer, I think that

20   that is one of the rare circumstances where the, the

21   Senator's assessment of the performance is very tied up

22   with a legislative act.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, all he'd have to say

24   is it's relevant to my decision to fire the person.

25   Now, surely a jury or whoever -- it's probably a jury


                                       42
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   matter, I guess, on this -- is entitled to take that

 2   into account.   If it's something the jury is entitled to

 3   take into account, you are questioning what that Senator

 4   did in the speech or debate and you are questioning it

 5   in another place, namely, a court.

 6              MR. SALZMAN:          You are, Justice Breyer.         The

 7   employee's performance, we believe, of the speech

 8   writing would not be considered a legislative act.                This

 9   Court said in Gravel that there is a difference between

10   a legislative act which goes on in a committee

11   proceeding and preparation for that proceeding, and the

12   employee's performance getting the Senator ready to give

13   his speech would not itself be considered a legislative

14   act, but in that circumstance the district court might

15   say that because the Senator's explanation is so clearly

16   tied to a real legislative act, a speech that he

17   actually gave on the floor of the Congress, perhaps that

18   might be a circumstance where judge Randolph's view that

19   that case could not go forward might apply.

20              That's not this case.                 This case deals with

21   threshold immunity issues, where the Senator's office is

22   saying that any personnel decision that it engages in is

23   by definition a legislative act if it relates to anybody

24   who works in their office.          And Congress clearly was not

25   of that view.   It defined every employee of the Senate,


                                       43

 1   including those who worked in a Senator's office, to be

 2   a covered employee and all covered employees under

 3   Section 408 have the right to go to court.

 4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Have any cases gone

 5   through a district court on the merits under this Act?

 6                 MR. SALZMAN:         I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg?

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Have any cases under this

 8   Act gone to a district court to judgment on the merits?

 9                 MR. SALZMAN:         No, Justice Ginsburg.      The

10   closest -- my understanding is the closest we have

11   gotten is the companion case in this case, the Fields

12   case, is scheduled for trial in October and it is my

13   understanding that they have gone through some discovery

14   in that case.     I don't believe that there have been any,

15   any cases under the Congressional Accountability Act in

16   court, that have made it past that.

17                 If there are no further questions --

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I have one question.    The

19   Appellants here were the ones that appealed to the court

20   of appeals?     Did they appeal from the district court?

21                 MR. SALZMAN:         Yes.

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But under 1291, the United

23   States Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction where

24   direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.              So it

25   seems to me that their position contradicts their own


                                         44
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   basis for jurisdiction here.           Do you agree with that?

 2              MR. SALZMAN:         Not entirely, Justice Kennedy.

 3   We do -- we had thought that initially and then upon

 4   reflection it seemed to us that because the minute order

 5   of the district -- because the order of the district

 6   court was a minute order that did not explain its

 7   reasoning, perhaps there was some ambiguity about

 8   whether he was simply finding that Mr. Hanson had so

 9   little contact with the legislative process that, that

10   the case should go forward or whether he was in essence

11   --

12              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, but my point is that

13   the Appellants are telling us that this is appealable

14   here directly, but if that's so they shouldn't have gone

15   to court of appeals, they shouldn't have gone to the

16   court of appeals; they're untimely when they come here.

17              MR. SALZMAN:         That is our understanding of

18   the way it generally works.           We believe that the GYRA

19   statute, which was the predecessor to the Congressional

20   Accountability Act, may have permitted appeals directly

21   from the court of appeals to this court.               So there

22   appears to be some ambiguity.            When we first responded

23   with respect to the appeal, we did argue that if Senator

24   Dayton's office wanted to appeal directly they needed to

25   do that two years ago when the district court had ruled.

 2   correct, Your Honor.

 5             ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. CABALLERO

 6             ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE

 7             AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING APPELLEE

 8               MR. CABALLERO:            Justice Stevens and may it

 9   please the Court:

10               We agree that there is no jurisdiction in

11   this Court under Section 412.               But I first would like to

12   correct one of the answers regarding cases under this

13   Congressional Accountability Act.

14               Two cases have been finally adjudicated by

15   the district courts.        One was two cases against offices

16   of members or committees where an employee worked for a

17   member.   One of those involved a finding that it was

18   outside the limitations in the statute.                   The other case

19   was a summary judgment finding of an employee who was a

20   legislative employee of the Committee on Ways and Means

21   and the Court found that the dismissal there was on an

22   allowable ground under the statute and there was no

23   violation of the employee's rights.

24               JUSTICE SOUTER:              And there's no jurisdiction

25   under 412 because?

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              MR. CABALLERO:          Because, as we said in our

 2   brief, the decision of the court of appeals was a

 3   decision on the scope of the Speech or Debate Clause as

 4   that clause is preserved in Section 413 of the act and

 5   therefore there would be no appeal under Section 412.

 6              If the court does go to the merits in this

 7   matter, I think it's important to effectuate Congress'

 8   intent in enacting the statute along with its concerns

 9   with the Speech or Debate Clause.               The Speech or Debate

10   Clause provides senators and representatives with a

11   constitutional privilege that is critical to securing

12   the independence of the legislative branch in our system

13   of government.

14              Certainly, Congress is the institution that

15   has the greatest interest in and is most sensitive to

16   maintaining a robust speech or debate privilege under

17   this Court's precedence.        In enacting the Congressional

18   Accountability Act, however, Congress concluded that it

19   could provide its own employees with the same employment

20   law protections that it had already provided Executive

21   Branch employees and private sector employees, including

22   the critical right of action for victims of illegal

23   discrimination to bring suit in the Federal court; and

24   that a suit under the Act would not infringe upon the

25   Speech or Debate Clause.

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              Congress relied on this Court's own

 2   precedent in making that determination.                Under the

 3   Speech or Debate Clause, this Court has made clear that

 4   the clause is robust, protects activities outside of

 5   just speech and debate on the floor of either House, but

 6   that it shouldn't be extended beyond what is necessary

 7   to preserve the independence of the legislative process.

 8              JUSTICE BREYER:            Can we go back a step.       I

 9   just -- you said this is appealable and your reason for

10   it being appealable was because the statute itself --

11   you said it was not appealable and the reason not is

12   because the statute itself said that this has to be

13   applied consistent with the Speech or Debate Clause?

14              MR. CABALLERO:          Correct.

15              JUSTICE BREYER:            That's your reason.       So I

16   take it, what about the reason that's been given, that

17   this is an as-applied challenge instead of on its face?

18   What about that as a reason for it not being appealable?

19              MR. CABALLERO:          Well, that is an application

20   of Section 412, the preservation of Speech or Debate

21   Clause in the statute.

22              JUSTICE BREYER:            No, no, no, I'm not asking

23   about the argument you are making.                I want to ask about

24   an argument you aren't making, that the reason -- I'll

25   ask about the one you are making in a second.                The

 1   reason I want to know about -- I want to know about the

 2   other possible reason for not being appealed, namely

 3   that this is as applied and not on its face.             They don't

 4   strike down any provision.         What's your view about that

 5   one?

 6              MR. CABALLERO:          Our view is that that is

 7   correct, Your Honor.

 8              JUSTICE BREYER:            That is correct.   And what

 9   you do about this case, what is it, Eichman?

10              MR. CABALLERO:          The Eichman case they cited.

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            In Eichman, I was able to

12   get out the district court and the last part of the

13   district court, the last line of the district court, it

14   says the law under which these three -- let me begin

15   again -- the law under which these three defendants have

16   been prosecuted is unconstitutional, which seems to me

17   to contradict what Appellant's counsel told us about

18   what happened in the district court.

19              MR. CABALLERO:          I think that's correct.

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:            It wouldn't matter anyway,

21   because our prior decisions that do not explicitly refer

22   to jurisdictional questions are not authority on

23   jurisdiction.

24              MR. CABALLERO:          That's correct.

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:            We have that firm rule:


                                      49
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   When we take a case and don't get into the

 2   jurisdictional question, it is not precedent for the

 3   fact -- -

 4               MR. CABALLERO:         For a finding of

 5   jurisdiction later, that's correct.

 6               I would say --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:           So then a holding of a

 8   district court in your opinion, the holdings say,

 9   imaginary, is that no one who actually works in an

10   office of a Senator and who ever worked on any matter

11   having to do with legislation falls within this Act

12   because that would violate the speech and debate clause.

13   That would be quite major in its implication.                But

14   you're saying there is no appeal on that because it's as

15   applied.

16               MR. CABALLERO:         Right.         Based on the court

17   of appeals decision, I would say the two arguments as

18   applied in the preservation of Section 413 aren't wholly

19   separate.

20               JUSTICE BREYER:           Does that mean if I go to

21   your argument -- I mean, the problem with your argument

22   it seems to me is that that leaves no room for this

23   appellate provision at law, because the only reason that

24   anything is likely to be unconstitutional in this area,

25   at least 99 percent of it, would be Speech or Debate


                                      50

 1   Clause violation.    So in that interpretation of the

 2   statute there is no direct appeal, or hardly ever.

 3              MR. CABALLERO:            Well, there was a lot of

 4   discussion in the legislative history about the

 5   separation of powers generally.

 6              JUSTICE ALITO:            We were told that 75 percent

 7   of the employees who were covered by the Act do not work

 8   for an individual member.           So how could, how could a

 9   provision to be facially unconstitutional under the

10   Speech or Debate Clause?

11              MR. CABALLERO:            Well, I think the provision

12   wasn't held facially unconstitutional.

13              JUSTICE ALITO:            What could it possibly be?

14   And if it couldn't possibly be then what did Congress

15   have in mind when it provided it for an interlocutory

16   appeal from a ruling on the constitutionality of the

17   statute.

18              MR. CABALLERO:            Again, there was major

19   debate in the Congress over whether or not the provision

20   of judicial hearing of suits over congressional

21   employment decisions, separate from the Speech or Debate

22   Clause, just a separation of powers concern of having

23   the judiciary oversee the workings of Congress, and

24   there was a concern about that separation of powers

25   issue, which would be a facial issue.                    Can you hear any


                                        51

 1   suits by employees of Congress who are employed in a

 2   separate branch?

 3                And that was where this provision has life,

 4   and is meant to protect the ability for a litigant to

 5   bring it before this Court immediately; it would be a

 6   facial challenge.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yes.      That, that may make

 8   sense.    I, I wondered why -- why they would provide for

 9   an appeal on constitutionality if they had in mind the

10   Speech or Debate Clause stuff, when the legislation

11   itself says that nothing herein shall be deemed a

12   violation of speech.

13                MR. CABALLERO:          Right.         It preserves a

14   member's -- exactly.       It preserves a member's speech or

15   debate.

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yeah.

17                MR. CABALLERO:          And when Congress did

18   provide these rights under the statute, it was very

19   important for the Congress under the previous regime

20   affecting the Senate, employees had employment

21   protections and they had administrative processes that

22   they could go to.    But they lacked a judicial right.

23   And Congress made a specific decision that providing

24   that right of action was an important employment law

25   protection employees needed.


                                        52

 1                 And again it relied on this Court's

 2   decisions both under the Speech or Debate Clause as to

 3   the scope of the clause and under Forrester where this

 4   Court held that a judge's employment decision as to an

 5   employee who did judicial duties was not a judicial act,

 6   did -- achieve absolute immunity.                  It was a -- it was an

 7   administrative act, an employment act.

 8                 And similarly here what is brought before

 9   the courts is an employment act.                 Again this case is

10   before the Court on a motion to dismiss.                  There has been

11   no discovery.     There has been no litigation over the

12   claims involved.     There is just a question presented

13   does the Speech or Debate Clause bar the jurisdiction of

14   Federal courts when a legislative, an employee with any

15   legislative duties brings a suit under the Act?                  And I

16   think the question, the answer to that question has to

17   be no.

18                 Indeed in the case here, you could have

19   litigation over whether the Senator knew of the alleged

20   disability.     That's one of the disputes that's been laid

21   out in the pleadings, whether that was the basis for

22   the, for the decision to terminate the employee.

23                 These are all the types of issues that play

24   out in district courts.          District courts receive

25   evidence.     They make these judgments; they see the


                                         53
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   specific context and they make specific rulings.                   To try

 2   to decide in the abstract how you would apply an

 3   employment law case with the Speech or Debate Clause in

 4   an evidentiary sense is very difficult.                   And that's why

 5   a more full record would be necessary.                   But to decide

 6   the question on appeal, I think the Court can easily

 7   decide if these cases go forward.

 8                One last point I would like to make is to

 9   address the issue of the existence of the office.                   It's

10   not a mere creation of the Act.               Senators have personal

11   offices.    Those offices incur liabilities or

12   obligations.    They buy paper; they make contracts and

13   the like.   When a Senator leaves office, the employing

14   office still has to pay the bills that were incurred

15   when the Senator was in office.               And the Senate allows

16   employing offices under the approval of the former

17   member to submit the vouchers and receive payment.                  The

18   employing office has life afterwards.

19                Similarly here, if it incurs an employment

20   liability it has life sufficient to litigate whether or

21   not that liability exists and a judgment will be paid

22   under Government funds under the Act.

23                JUSTICE SOUTER:            But it will -- the money is

24   simply Senate money.

25                MR. CABALLERO:          Yes.       The money is an


                                        54
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   appropriation of Senate -- and under the fund, the money

 2   is an appropriation for the specific fund under the Act

 3   for paying judgements in these cases.

 4              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But none of those funds

 5   are, as I understand it, are somehow subtracted from or

 6   contributed by the funds of individual senatorial

 7   offices while a Senator is in office.                  I am assuming

 8   that those, that there is a separate appropriation for

 9   the payment of -- of any such judgment, is that correct?

10              MR. CABALLERO:          Under the Act there is.

11   Congress decided to not have any personal liability for

12   a member to shield them from that, and also not to

13   require the member's office in cases such as illegal

14   discrimination cases, to pay the awards or judgments.

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       In the real world

16   then at this point isn't the Senate the -- the party?

17              MR. CABALLERO:          Perhaps it's a party in

18   interest, but I would say again that the named party is

19   not a party without any life except under the Act.

20     I thank the Court.

21              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Ms. Manning, you have

 1   which the Court has found that jurisdiction is barred in

 2   Speech or Debate Clause cases.                The first is when the

 3   case is predicated on a legislative act.                      The second is

 4   when the case cannot, that is cannot be adjudicated

 5   without questioning a legislative act or the motive for

 6   the act.     And the third is when the member will be made

 7   to answer in terms of his defense for a legislative act.

 8                 This goes to the question that Justice

 9   Stevens asked.     In Gravel the Court made it clear that

10   if the member is made to answer in his defense for a

11   legislative act, that violates the Speech or Debate

12   Clause.     Under the, these types of cases the member

13   does, would have to come forward and explain a

14   legislative act:     that is, why did I terminate this

15   employee?

16                 That is the explanation, because the

17   termination itself is a legislative act, he is being

18   questioned about a legislative act.

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Right.          I have one -- one

20   question.     Could the Senate direct you to pay this

21   judgment?

22                 MS. MANNING:         Direct me -- I'm sorry.             Me

23   personally?

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Direct your office to --

25   to do that.

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              MS. MANNING:         To pay the judgment?

 2              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Because it -- suppose they

 3   thought there was liability and if you say yes, then I

 4   need to know why you and counsel who just addressed this

 5   are on different sides of the case, if you're both

 6   representing the Senate.

 7              MS. MANNING:         They cannot direct us to pay.

 8   It of course comes out of the Treasury fund and the

 9   Senate has had absolutely no control or involvement at

10   all for 12 years in any of these cases.                They do not

11   know --

12              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Could it, if it chose?

13              MS. MANNING:         Well, I believe that it cannot

14   because the defendant in this case is the employing

15   office.

16              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            All right.

17              MS. MANNING:         So for that reason the Senate

18   has never, doesn't even know the cases exist.                Doesn't

19   know that we are negotiating settlement.                Doesn't review

20   settlement agreements.       Is not involved in strategy.            In

21   fact the CAA in Section 403 states that the, that the

22   mediation and then the counseling in the case is

23   strictly confidential.       The Senate cannot even know that

24   they are happening.     Only the employing office can know.

25   In no sense has the Senate been the defendant.                If the
