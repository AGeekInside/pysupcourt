 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. FISHER:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               To be a vessel, a structure must be

12   practically capable of maritime transportation, and this

13   case turns on how to assess such practical capability.

14               And that's a question this Court answered

15   over a century ago in Cope and Perry, explaining that

16   practical capability depends not on any physical

17   attribute the structure might have, but rather, on "its

18   purpose," that is, whether its function is to move

19   people or things across water.

20               And that test has been applied numerous

21   times before and since, across decades, providing

22   stability and overall coherence to general maritime law.

23               And of course --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You should have phrased the

25   test that way then, because it really --

 1               MR. FISHER:     Pardon me?

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:         That doesn't seem to me a

 3   very felicitous description of what -- of what the test

 4   is -- is enunciated to be.

 5               MR. FISHER:     Well, I think --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:         The test is whether it's,

 7   what, practically able?

 8              MR. FISHER:    Practically capable.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Practically capable.   Well,

10   you could be practically capable of doing something,

11   even though the purpose of -- of setting the thing up

12   has nothing to do with that.

13               MR. FISHER:     Well, that's not what this

14   Court -- case is saying --

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:         I understand.   I'm just

16   saying we ought to get a different test, and let's --

17   let's get rid of this.    If we agree with you, let's get

18   rid of this practically capable test, because

19   practically capable, frankly, would make us come out the

20   other way in this case.

21               MR. FISHER:     With all due respect, I don't

22   think that's correct.    In Evansville in 1926, this Court

23   used that exact phrase, practical capability.         And it

24   assessed that practical capability by looking at "the

25   function of the structure."

 1                Again and again, in Evansville and other


 2   cases, this Court asked, was the function of the


 3   structure to carry people or things across water.


 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, that just


 5   has -- I understand that argument.               It's got no

 6   connection whatever to the statutory language, right?

 7                MR. FISHER:     Well, I think the word capable

 8   obviously is in the statute.            And what this Court said

 9   as recently as Stewart is that capable --

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Capable is in the

11   statute, purpose is not, right?

12                MR. FISHER:     Correct.

13                And what this Court said in Stewart is that

14   capable means practically capable, not theoretically

15   capable.   There's a range of how broad the word capable

16   can be.

17                And again, going back over a century, every

18   single time this Court's been confronted with that

19   question, it's used the term function to describe

20   whether or not something is practically capable of

21   carrying people or things over water.

22                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           You -- you described

23   cases with this purpose -- or function, the briefs cited

24   the district court decision, Sea Village Marina, that

25   says floating homes like the one here that can be towed

 1   and are not in the business of carrying people or goods,

 2   but can be towed miles across the water, that those

 3   constitute vessels.

 4                 And this district court decision,

 5   Sea Village Marina, cited many, many cases.             And you say

 6   that that district judge got it wrong, or the cases were

 7   wrong?

 8                  MR. FISHER:     Justice Ginsburg, I think

 9   there's a confusion of terminology that I hope I can --

10   that I hope I can straighten out at the outset.

11                  The term floating home is generally

12   described to mean a residence that is designed to sit

13   still and is not designed to carry people or things over

14   water.

15                  The term houseboat is something that is

16   self-propelled, generally moves people or things over

17   water.

18                  What happened in the Sea Village Marina

19   case, to my understanding, is the Court simply used the

20   wrong term.    It cited a lot of cases that held that

21   houseboats, as we describe a houseboat as something that

22   is designed to move its owner and the owner's things

23   from here to there, are vessels.             And we don't dispute

24   that.

25                  But on the other hand, you have something


                                       6

 1   called floating homes, which the brief filed by the

 2   Seattle and Sausalito floating homes associations give a

 3   very thorough description of what a floating home is and

 4   how it's different.

 5               And a primary way that it's different is

 6   that, as opposed to a houseboat, which is doing its

 7   function, it's doing its job when it's moving things

 8   from place to place, a floating home can't function when

 9   it's out in the water being towed.                 None of the

10   utilities work, none of the power, no equipment is

11   aboard to do anything --

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, but in -- in your

13   brief, I really lost count, but I think it's six times

14   on the first two pages, you talk about indefinitely

15   moored.

16               Now, the facts are in dispute, and we're not

17   quite clear of the facts, but let's assume that this

18   magnificent structure is -- which was mercifully

19   destroyed -- let's assume that it was attached to the

20   dock by a rope, a garden hose and an extension cord, and

21   that it could leave within 30 minutes notice.                 Is that

22   indefinitely moored?      And if the answer is yes, is that

23   because of subjective intent of the owner?

24               MR. FISHER:        Justice Kennedy, it would be

25   indefinitely moored.      That's the term this Court used in


                                       7

 1   Stewart to describe whether something was being used to

 2   transport people or goods.

 3               It had said -- I have to emphasize that some

 4   of the assumptions we do in fact dispute in your

 5   hypothetical.   But the fact that it sat still for three

 6   years performing its function as a stationary residence

 7   shows that it was indefinitely moored.

 8               The importance of indefinite mooring,

 9   though, I want to emphasize, is actually less important

10   in this case than it might be if this were a dead ship

11   case, where you had something that was concededly a

12   vessel --

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But suppose --

14               MR. FISHER:      -- in the question --

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- you know the law school

16   game, suppose it was moved every month.

17               MR. FISHER:      It would still not be a vessel.

18   And you don't have to look any further than this Court's

19   Evansville case.

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            That would be indefinitely

21   moored, in your view?

22               MR. FISHER:      Well, I'm not sure if you'd use

23   the term indefinitely moored at that point, but it

24   certainly wouldn't be transformed into a vessel because

25   look at this Court's Evansville case.            The structure --

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Before you get to


 2   Evansville, let's say it moved around, which is one


 3   thing, but also it had a raked bow; it wasn't square.


 4   Then -- then it starts to look more like a boat.                 It


 5   moves around more frequently.

 6                 Its mooring -- I mean, if you have a

 7   sailboat and you pull it up to a dock, you hook up for

 8   water and plug in for power.              It doesn't seem to me to

 9   be terribly significant.

10                 MR. FISHER:      I think that's right if you

11   start with something that is a vessel; the fact that you

12   simply leave it at the dock for a long time doesn't take

13   away vessel status.      That's what this Court held in

14   Stewart.

15                 But if you start with something that isn't a

16   vessel -- and I give you the Roper case, which did have

17   a raked bow; it was an old Liberty ship that everybody

18   agreed had been decommissioned and turned into a

19   non-vessel.   Then, they brought it in, they towed

20   it -- Justice Ginsburg, they towed it -- they loaded it

21   up with grain.   Towed it again, let it sit still for a

22   couple years, towed it back, unloaded the grain.                 And

23   this Court said, it's not a vessel.

24                 And why did this Court say it's not a

25   vessel?    And I will quote from the opinion.               It said:

 1   "Because unlike a barge, the Harry Lane was not moved in

 2   order to transport commodities from one place to

 3   another; it served as a mobile warehouse performing its

 4   function of storing grain."          In the Evansville's case --

 5                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Counselor, can I -- can

 6   I -- I have been lost even as I have read the briefs,

 7   because there's a lot of terminology that I'm not sure

 8   -- and standards that have been proposed that -- what

 9   concepts they're tied to, okay?

10                As I see our cases, I'm -- I'm not quite

11   sure where indefinitely moored came from.           I've seen the

12   word permanently moored.

13                You seem to be suggesting a difference

14   between the two things, and I'm not sure where you get

15   the latter, indefinitely moored, from, and how that ties

16   to the concept of purpose.

17                Does it -- does the permanent status or

18   indefinite mooring of a vessel not make it -- of a

19   structure not make it a vessel, and/or does purpose get

20   layered on top of mooring?

21                MR. FISHER:     No.        Purpose is the overall

22   question.   The way where --

23                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           But it applies to

24   whether something is permanently moored or floating on

25   the sea?

 1                MR. FISHER:     That helps you determine its

 2   purpose.   So the word -- where the word indefinite comes

 3   from, Justice Sotomayor, is from the Stewart case, where

 4   this Court cited the Fifth Circuit's Pavone case with

 5   approval, which had held that an indefinitely moored

 6   floating casino was not a vessel.

 7                JUSTICE ALITO:       I just don't see how you can

 8   get purpose into this statutory language.          It says

 9   nothing about purpose.     It says, capable of being used

10   as a means of transportation on water.           How does purpose

11   get in there?   Whose purpose are we talking about?

12                MR. FISHER:     We're talking about an

13   objective purpose, Justice Alito --

14                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, then you're not

15   talking about purpose; you're talking about function,

16   right?   You're just using purpose as a kind of strange

17   synonym for function.

18                But you're not talking about purpose of

19   either the homeowner or the manufacturer of the boat.

20   You're just saying what does this -- or what does this

21   thing, this floating home, do.

22                MR. FISHER:     Exactly.       And I'm doing -- if I

23   can just say this directly, I'm trying to do exactly

24   what this Court did in Cope and Evansville and Roper.

25   The exact analysis this Court applied in those cases is

 1   precisely what we want this Court to apply here.                But I

 2   think what we're --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Can I ask about that

 4   definition?   That definition comes from the Rules of

 5   Construction Act, right --

 6                 MR. FISHER:      Yes.

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          -- which provides the

 8   meaning of all -- of the word vessel as used in the

 9   United States Code.      Okay?

10                 MR. FISHER:      Correct.

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          What -- what meaning of

12   vessel in the United States Code is at issue here?

13                 MR. FISHER:      The word vessel in the Maritime

14   Lien Act, which is what provides the Federal forum,

15   assertedly, for the plaintiff, the City, to bring this

16   case.   So the word vessel is -- is its jurisdictional

17   and substantive hook.

18                 Justice Sotomayor, if I can return to your

19   question about indefinite mooring, the importance of

20   indefinite mooring in this case, where you have

21   something that was not a vessel to begin with, is simply

22   to ask whether it's been transformed into a vessel,

23   exactly as this Court asked in Roper.                So is it being

24   used for its function for which it was created and --

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Aren't you just

 1   begging the question?     You keep saying it was not a

 2   vessel to begin with.     Why -- doesn't it just restate

 3   the question?

 4                MR. FISHER:     I'm not trying to beg the

 5   question; I'm just trying to describe our argument to

 6   you.   There are some cases where --

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, doesn't your

 8   argument beg the question?

 9                MR. FISHER:     I hope not.           I'm trying to

10   distinguish between two lines of cases, one being where

11   you have things that were -- like the Roper case, that

12   were made as boats, as vessels undisputedly, and now the

13   question is whether they've been pulled out of

14   navigation; as opposed to another set of cases, which we

15   believe this falls into, where the question itself is

16   whether this was ever a vessel.          In those kinds of

17   cases, the indefinite mooring shows that it's being used

18   for its function.

19                It hasn't -- for example, if I could give a

20   hypothetical, maybe it would help, imagine a piece of

21   floating dock.   Now, under their test, that would be a

22   vessel because you can unhook the dock, load it up with

23   stuff and tow it around, if a company wanted to use that

24   as a makeshift barge.

25                But no maritime case has ever held that a


                                    13

 1   floating dock is a vessel.         But if somebody did that,

 2   then it would no longer be indefinitely moored and would

 3   be using a different function and might be transformed

 4   into a --

 5                 JUSTICE ALITO:       I think you may -- you may

 6   very well have a good argument, but if you're relying

 7   either on purpose or on indefinite mooring, then you've

 8   lost me.    I don't see how they get -- how you get those

 9   into the words of the statute.

10                 Suppose you have a boat, and it's tied up at

11   the harbor here in Washington.           It hasn't been moved for

12   five years.   It's indefinitely moved -- or 10 years or

13   20 years.   But if it's capable, if you could untie it

14   and sail it out into the river, doesn't it fall within

15   the definition?

16                 MR. FISHER:     It absolutely does because the

17   function of a boat is to move people or things over

18   water.   So when it's sitting still, Justice Alito, it's

19   not performing its function.

20                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Right.         So you are really

21   talking about a function test.           And you are using

22   strange words, because they come out of our opinions --

23   kind of not your fault.       But you're really saying that

24   what should apply here is a function test.

25                 We are looking at this floating home.              What


                                     14

 1   does it do?   Is it just a thing that sits, or is it a

 2   thing that transports things over water.

 3                 Isn't that your test?

 4                 MR. FISHER:     Yes, it is.           In addition --

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              So it changes -- one

 6   -- the same thing is not a boat sometimes, and it is a

 7   boat.   You've got a casino that's tied up for a month.

 8   During that time, it's not a boat.                And then they move

 9   it around to go to the other side of the river, and

10   during that time it is a boat?

11                 MR. FISHER:     No, this Court in Stewart

12   rejected the snapshot test that I think is what you just

13   described.

14                 The question is whether what -- whether it

15   has the function of moving people and things over water

16   or not.   Now, some casinos go up and down the river --

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But -- but I'm just

18   -- the hypothetical -- the hypothetical I've posed was

19   meant to pose the question, well, sometimes things do

20   both, and how do we tell which it is --

21                 MR. FISHER:     If it actually does the latter

22   and is performing its function while moving, then it is

23   a vessel.    And that's what this Court held in Stewart.

24   There's not a primary purpose test.

25                 If one of its purposes is to move people or


                                     15

 1   things over water, then it's a vessel.             But that's not

 2   the purpose of a floating home.             That's not the purpose

 3   of a floating restaurant or something else that might

 4   be float --

 5                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, how do we know that.

 6                  MR. FISHER:     But you could tie it up and

 7   move it.

 8                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       How do we know that, Mr.

 9   Fisher?    I mean, maybe these floating homes are just a

10   poor man's houseboat, right?              That the point of getting

11   a floating home is actually to have a home that you can

12   hook up to a boat and move from place to place, and so

13   you don't have to, you know, have the motor running all

14   the time or have the capacity to move it all the time,

15   but when you want to move it on water and when you want

16   to move your possessions on water, you have the capacity

17   to do so.

18                  MR. FISHER:     Well, with all due respect,

19   Justice Kagan, that's not why people have floating

20   homes.    The amicus brief explains that.           Don't look

21   at -- but you don't have to look any further than the

22   history of this.    The only two times it moved any

23   significant distance were:          One, when it changed

24   ownership; and two, when a hurricane struck, so it had

25   to be moved.

 1                And look at your own cases.           In Pavone,

 2   which this Court cited with approval in Stewart, that

 3   structure moved hundreds of miles over several years.

 4   This Court said not a vessel.           The structure in

 5   Evansville moved three different ways.           It moved up and

 6   down the Mississippi-Ohio River as it changed ownership

 7   several times over the course of 14 years.           It also

 8   moved every winter to avoid the ice that would come in.

 9   And thirdly it was repositioned on literally almost a

10   daily basis to accord with the stages of the river.              And

11   again, applying this Court's well settled function test,

12   this Court said that's not a vessel.

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But it was still -- it was

14   still tied to the land with roads and ramps and so

15   forth.   Here you've got the hose and the extension cord

16   and the rope.

17                MR. FISHER:     Well, the important --

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And it seems -- and it

19   seems to me, suppose you -- you want us to make some

20   universal definition of we know what a floating home is.

21   Suppose this -- suppose there were -- another owner of a

22   structure like this, and it moved to a different slip

23   every week to get more shade or more wind or something.

24   Then that would be different?

25                MR. FISHER:     It would sound to me just like


                                    17

 1   the floating warehouse and office in Evansville as I

 2   just described that case.         But Justice Kennedy, let me

 3   say one more thing before I reserve my time.

 4                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And suppose it moved --

 5   suppose it moved up and down the canal to get better or

 6   worse weather during different seasons.

 7                 MR. FISHER:    If it's simply being

 8   repositioned and not being used for a transportation

 9   purpose, that is to move people or things, then it's not

10   a vessel.   And that's exactly what this Court --

11                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, I have the same

12   problem Justice Kagan says.            The whole point is that it

13   can move.   That's the whole -- that's the reason you

14   have it.

15                  MR. FISHER:     That is not the point,

16   Justice Kennedy, with all due respect.                There's a

17   difference between a floating home and a houseboat, and

18   I urge you to look at the briefs on this point.

19                 And this comes right back to your

20   question --

21                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Counsel, outside of your

22   floating home, what other structures would be kept out

23   of your definition of purpose or function and the city's

24   definition of practically capable?                 Can you imagine any

25   other function that's out there floating around?

 1               MR. FISHER:      Other floating commercial --

 2               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Because they disavow

 3   water skis and garage doors and say they're practical,

 4   capable tests with --

 5               MR. FISHER:      Well, I'm not sure they can


 6   actually disavow that on their tests, but --

 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Well, I know.   But --

 8               MR. FISHER:      Floating commercial


 9   establishments, floating pieces, floating docks,


10   floating trampolines and play structures.

11               And, Justice Kennedy, if I could just answer

12   your question and reserve the rest of my time.          The

13   importance of the connecting of the utilities and the

14   water hose, which was actually a specialized water hose,

15   not a garden hose, but the importance of those

16   connections is found in State codes across the country

17   that distinguish between floating homes and houseboats,

18   asking whether they're dependent on those connections to

19   operate.

20               A floating home cannot function if it's not

21   tied to land.   It doesn't matter how many amps we want

22   to fight about, it's whether it needs that power from

23   land, whether it needs those connections to land.          A

24   houseboat, like any other vessel, can fully function

25   away from port.

 5                        FOR UNITED STATES,

 6         AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 7                 MR. GANNON:     Mr. Chief Justice and may it

 8   please the Court:

 9                 I think if I could start with Justice

10   Kagan's questions, the government's position is that

11   this is an objective function test and in evaluating

12   when a structure is practically capable of being used as

13   a means of transportation this Court has repeatedly

14   recognized that function is important to that inquiry.

15                 It did so as recently as Stewart, when it

16   recognized that the function of the dredge there was to

17   carry crew and equipment across Boston Harbor in the

18   course of dredging a trench.

19                 It also did so in the cases that

20   Petitioner's counsel has already talked about,

21   Evansville, Roper --

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Can I -- can I

23   interrupt you just there on the dredging?                You say the

24   function of the dredge was to carry people and

25   equipment.    I would have said the function of the -- the

 1   dredge is to dredge in the middle of the river.

 2                  MR. GANNON:     Well, the Court --

 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Right?   And so --

 4   and I don't know which of us would be right, so it seems

 5   to me that that function test is a very difficult one to

 6   apply.

 7                  MR. GANNON:     Well, the Court in Stewart said

 8   that "dredges" -- and I'm quoting from page 492 --

 9   "serve a waterborne transportation function, because

10   they carry crew and equipment across" --

11                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, I know what it

12   said.    I guess I would say, obviously, it serves a

13   waterborne function, but I'm not sure the first thing I

14   would say when I see one of these dredges in the middle

15   of the river is its purpose is to move people and

16   equipment.   I would say its purpose is to dredge.

17                  MR. GANNON:     Well, but in general, it needs

18   to dredge not just in one place, because it's not just

19   dredging a hole, it's dredging a trench.                It usually

20   needs to move in order to do that.

21                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              No, I know but

22   that's saying that it has to be able to move, and I

23   agree with that.    But its purpose is still to dredge,

24   not to move.

25                  MR. GANNON:     Well, I think that the Court --

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               You could use it if

 2   you had a -- you know, a transportation boat, right?

 3   Any equipment you need to move, you put it on another

 4   boat and drop it off.      The people who work, you bring

 5   them over and drop it off.

 6                MR. GANNON:      Yeah, I think that you could do

 7   that.   I think that's typically not the way the dredges

 8   that -- not the way the superscoop works in Stewart and

 9   it's not the way historic dredges worked in the case

10   of --

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Sure it is, isn't

12   it?   I mean, the superscoop doesn't go to the -- maybe

13   it does -- go to the shore every morning, then come

14   right out again?   They move people back and forth with

15   other boats, don't they?

16                MR. GANNON:      Oh, but I -- what I meant is

17   that there are people and equipment on the superscoop

18   when it is moving across Boston Harbor.               They didn't

19   sort of take it out there all empty every morning and

20   then load other things on to it that they -- that they

21   brought out there.

22                And in Evansville, the Court recognized that

23   the wharf boat there, which is a large structure -- it

24   was 240 feet long, 48 feet wide -- it served as an

25   office, a warehouse, and a wharf on the side of the

 1   river, and the Court said that it performed no function

 2   that might not have been performed as well by structures

 3   permanently attached to the --

 4               JUSTICE ALITO:       Suppose someone builds a

 5   replica of an historic watercraft, a Viking boat, the

 6   kind of outrigger canoes that the Polynesians used

 7   throughout the Pacific Ocean, and the purpose of this is

 8   to display it in a museum, no one has any intention

 9   whatsoever of ever putting it in the water, but it's

10   built so that if they did, it would -- it would function

11   just like its historic antecedent, is that a vessel?

12               MR. GANNON:     I think that that would be a

13   vessel, because it really -- its objective function, if

14   you look at its design and its natural function --

15   that's just the phrase that the -- even Respondent's law

16   professor amici used.    They acknowledged that the

17   function and purpose test is appropriate if it takes

18   account of the craft's own design and natural function.

19               JUSTICE BREYER:         What about the -- I thought

20   there was a -- a kind of caveat in one of these cases,

21   maybe Stewart, that said take a thing that looks just

22   like a boat, the Queen Mary, but if it is permanently --

23   they use the word "indefinite."         I think they mean

24   "permanently."

25               MR. GANNON:     Well, the Court --

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:          But if it is permanently

 2   moored to the shore and is never going to sea again,

 3   then it isn't a vessel.

 4                MR. GANNON:      That's true.        That's because

 5   it's no --

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:          Then if the Polynesian boat

 7   is permanently in the museum, there's a lot of objective

 8   evidence of that, it would not be a vessel.            But if it's

 9   something they really could well take out on the sea,

10   then it is, is that right?

11                MR. GANNON:      It is true that the Court

12   recognized in Stewart and the Coast Guard's craft

13   routinely operated dockside policy is based upon the

14   presumption that something that used to be a vessel can

15   cease to be a vessel if it is semi-permanently or

16   indefinitely moored.     That's the phrase that the Court

17   quoted in Stewart.    And the Court recognized that even

18   something that's anchored to the seabed could --

19                JUSTICE BREYER:          That doesn't come up here.

20   That concerns the Queen Mary being sent to Long Beach

21   and used as a hotel.

22                MR. GANNON:      And the Queen Mary is behind

23   a -- is essentially behind a cofferdam.            It doesn't have

24   ready access to open water.           It's connected to shore in

25   all sorts of permanent ways.             We don't think that that's

 1   the type of case that we have here, because nobody is

 2   saying that this once was a vessel and it is now no

 3   longer one just because it's tied up to the dock in the

 4   way that it was tied up here.

 5                 And so, Justice Kennedy, we think that this

 6   isn't really a case about indefinite mooring as making

 7   the difference.   This is a case where you need to start

 8   with the question of was it ever a vessel.          And

 9   if the --

10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So I was right.   So that

11   permanent mooring is a different inquiry in your mind?

12                 MR. GANNON:     Well, permanent mooring is

13   usually going to be relevant to the question of whether

14   something ceases to be a vessel, as it's no longer

15   practically capable of being used as a means of

16   transportation.   That's the way the Court discussed the

17   point in Stewart.   And -- and that's true even for a

18   case like Roper, which was a former Liberty ship that

19   was towed up and down the James River.

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Well, that's a -- that's

21   a somewhat easy case, because the hull, I think, was

22   removed or something was removed that made it --

23                 MR. GANNON:     Well, there were things that

24   had been removed when it had been decommissioned

25   originally.   But if the court of appeals test were used


                                     25

 1   here and the court were to conclude that something is a

 2   vessel, if it is merely capable of being towed across

 3   water even to its detriment, then you can't explain the

 4   answer in cases like Evansville or in Roper where --

 5   because the Evansville wharf boat was towed at least ten

 6   times, as described in pages 21 and 22 of the Court's

 7   opinion, and nobody was asking whether it had all

 8   the office furniture and light fixtures and things like

 9   that removed when it was towed at least twice a year for

10   the seven years before that suit began.

11                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       So, Mr. Gannon, you think

12   that even at the moment that the thing is being

13   transported, and let's say that the thing has, you know,

14   various furniture and things on it, you think even at

15   that moment under section 3, it's not a -- it might not

16   be a vessel?

17                  MR. GANNON:     That's generally going to be

18   true, yes.   If the purpose of the structure, the

19   function, the objective function of the structure is to

20   operate, just to be stationary beside the dock, then

21   it's not going to be a vessel even when it's being towed

22   behind another vessel.       There may still be rules about

23   how it needs to be lit at night and things like that,

24   but --

25                  JUSTICE ALITO:       What if it was more


                                      26

 1   seaworthy so that it could be towed 200 miles without

 2   suffering any damage, even if there are, you know, small

 3   waves, let's say?

 4                And the reason why it was built that way was

 5   so that when the person moves the person wouldn't have

 6   to hire a moving company to come with a van and take out

 7   all the person's personal belongings and ship those

 8   by -- by land.   This -- this is capable of moving and

 9   moving all the stuff that's in it without having

10   anything damaged.    Would it be the same?        What would be

11   the result there?

12                MR. GANNON:      Well, I -- I understand the

13   point.   I think that, under a case like Evansville, that

14   there does seem to be a difference between relocating

15   the structure and using the structure to transport

16   people and things.

17                But under an objective function test, if it

18   really is designed to be mobile, and we look at it and

19   we say it really looks like a boat and it's designed to

20   move through water efficiently, it would probably look

21   different from this particular craft.

22                But if ultimate mobility is part of the

23   function of it, then -- then the answer could well be

24   different.

25                But, for the most part, I think my answer is


                                     27

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the same as I was trying to give to Justice Kagan, which

 2   is that this is either going to be a vessel all the time

 3   until it becomes so permanently moored that it should no

 4   longer be deemed a vessel.

 5                 JUSTICE ALITO:       I really just don't

 6   understand your answer.       Mobility surely was a -- was a

 7   purpose of this because it was moved.

 8                 MR. GANNON:     Well, I --

 9                 JUSTICE ALITO:       It can be moved.

10                 MR. GANNON:     There is a question about

11   practical capability of being used and --

12                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Okay.     Well, that's

13   something different.

14                 MR. GANNON:     And before, you were asking

15   about the hook in the statute here.               We do think that

16   the word contrivance does indicate that it's something

17   that has a function that's determinable.

18                 And there are lots of other areas in

19   maritime law where the function of a vessel is a

20   relevant question, and this is not an unanswerable

21   inquiry.   The court uses purpose and function when it's

22   deciding whether somebody is a Jones Act seaman --

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Mr. Gannon, would you

24   have said sounds like this structure is not a vessel,

25   period.    But your bottom line in your brief is that, if

 1   we disagree with the Court of Appeals, we shouldn't say


 2   this contrivance is not a vessel, we should send it back


 3   -- for what?


 4   What finding?


 5                MR. GANNON:      We think that the record here

 6   was not really compiled with an object of answering

 7   these questions, the things that we think are relevant,

 8   because the district court and the Court of Appeals

 9   flatly rejected any inquiry into the purpose or function

10   of the vessel.   And --

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So what would we tell

12   them they should look into?

13                MR. GANNON:      That they should look into the

14   purpose and function of the vessel.               They should also

15   consider whether it would be damaged when it was towed.

16   That was something that petitioner tried to get.               He was

17   proceeding pro se in the district court, offered to

18   present evidence about --

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            On the first question,

20   purpose or function, what did they know that we can't

21   know by looking at this picture and listening to these

22   arguments?

23                MR. GANNON:      Well, I think that they could

24   hear more about --

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I mean, I would be willing

 1   to stipulate they are better at this than we are, but

 2   let's -- let's assume.

 3                MR. GANNON:     Well, I -- I think that

 4   somebody -- if somebody -- I can't tell everything about

 5   the structure.   We have these pictures, and we know that

 6   it has a ten-inch draft, but we don't really know how --

 7   how well it is that --

 8                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I want to be fair to the

 9   Court of Appeals, well, now, you tell us what the

10   purpose and function is.

11                MR. GANNON:     And I -- if --

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Don't we know that?

13                MR. GANNON:     Well, I think that you -- in --

14   this is going to be a somewhat idiosyncratic case.            I

15   think that this is an unusual structure.           That's why the

16   surveyor on page J-43 of the Joint Appendix found that

17   there were no comparables for sale in the state of

18   Florida.   And so I think that most cases aren't really

19   going to -- to be like this.

20                But if I wanted to put on evidence about

21   that, I would probably compare -- decide whether this is

22   more like the floating homes that are described in the

23   Seattle floating homes brief, that are really designed

24   just to function in place near the shore.           I think that

25   there would be more evidence about its capabilities

 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, Counsel.

 4                  Mr. Frederick.

 5               ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

 6                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 7                  MR. FREDERICK:       Thank you Mr. Chief Justice,

 8   and may it please the Court:

 9                  The City brought this In Rem action against

10   Mr. Lozman's uninsured houseboat to enforce maritime

11   liens.    The houseboat was in violation of the wet slip

12   agreement, and it posed a hazard to other vessels in the

13   marina if, because of its flimsy moorings, it came

14   unmoored during a storm.

15                  The houseboat was located very close to the

16   navigable channel of the Atlantic Intercoastal Waterway

17   and next to a yacht-building facility next to the

18   marina.    So the city faced a very real specter of being

19   sued if the uninsured houseboat came unmoored and caused

20   damage.

21                  Our position is that the houseboat is a

22   vessel under section 3 because it floats, moves, and

23   carries people or things on water, as the statutory --

24                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Just like an inner

25   tube, right?

 1                 MR. FREDERICK:       No.    An inner tube actually

 2   does not --

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Floats, can be

 4   towed, can carry a person.

 5                 MR. FREDERICK:       Well, a person actually --

 6   most of the body parts of a person would be underwater

 7   and would be through the water, Mr. Chief Justice.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              One of those

 9   inflatable rafts where most of the parts of the

10   people --

11                 MR. FREDERICK:       The test would be what's the

12   practical capability, and a raft that has a bottom

13   actually could very well be a vessel under the

14   appropriate standard of practical capability.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:         This cup.       What about the

16   cup?

17                 MR. FREDERICK:       Cup is not because a cup

18   doesn't float.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Oh, well, this is lighter

20   than you think.

21                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         No.       How about a garage

22   door?

23                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Take the inner tube and, you

24   know, paste a couple of pennies on the inner tube.                 Now

25   it carries things.    There are things on the inner tube,

 1   and it floats.

 2                 MR. FREDERICK:       Justice Kagan, I -- I think

 3   we could imagine all kinds of de minimis types of

 4   hypotheticals that would satisfy the basic criteria.

 5   But what the Court in Stewart said was practical

 6   capability as viewed in a real world sense.               And I'm not

 7   aware of any case -- and they've certainly not pointed

 8   to anything -- that identifies anything with those kind

 9   of practical attributes that would be subject to

10   litigation.

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, practical

12   capability viewed in a real-world sense -- and you're

13   about transportation -- you're talking about things that

14   were built for transportation, right?

15                 MR. FREDERICK:       You're -- yes.         You're --

16   that is true in the sense that one of the purposes, as

17   manifested through its physical characteristics, is the

18   ability to be moved across water.

19                 And just as Mr. Lozman's houseboat here was

20   moved 200 miles in the first towage after the hurricane

21   wiped out every other vessel in the docks in the north

22   bay marina, and he had it towed with a speed boat

23   70 miles to the city of Riviera Beach, those physical

24   characteristics and attributes were recognized by the

25   Court of Appeals when it applied the practical


                                     33

 1   capability test.

 2                 And it said on page 15(a) of the petition

 3   appendix that certainly living, a domicile, is a purpose

 4   of a floating home, but mobility is also a purpose, and

 5   then demonstrated that mobility here.

 6                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Under your definition,

 7   how do you deal with Evansville?

 8                 MR. FREDERICK:       Evansville is a case with

 9   many layers, but let me just start first start with the

10   fact that the Court announced a practical capability

11   test in Evansville itself.         That's what it applied.   It

12   reviewed a district court record that had found no

13   practical capability on the basis of the driveways and

14   the more permanent connections to the utility system of

15   the city, and it reviewed that factual record for clear

16   error, which, of course, it didn't find, by --

17                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         What you are basically

18   saying, we reached the wrong conclusion because the

19   wharf boat floated, and it regularly was moved, and

20   there was nothing to suggest that it couldn't carry

21   people or things.   It happened not to because they would

22   empty it, I understand, before they moved it, but it

23   could have.

24                 So if it was practically capable of

25   floating, whether it was semi-tied to land or not, it


                                     34

 1   was released from land on somewhat of a regular basis.

 2   So are you suggesting that in Stewart we change the

 3   Evansville rule?

 4               MR. FREDERICK:       No.    In Stewart you said

 5   what the holding of the case was, which was that it was

 6   not practically capable of movement at the time that it

 7   sank.

 8               Now, I would like to just step back for a

 9   second because I think Evansville needs to be understood

10   in the time in which it was decided.            At that time, many

11   courts, including this one, at times, applied a snapshot

12   test, what is happening to this particular watercraft at

13   the moment in time where an admiralty tort occurs, where

14   the contract ensues, and the like.

15               This Court subsequently disavowed the

16   snapshot test; but, in Stewart, what the Court did was

17   to describe Evansville and Cope as cases about not

18   practically capable of movement or carriage because of

19   their connections to the land.

20               In Evansville, the owner of the wharf boat

21   also owned the adjoining land and had control over the

22   dock and built driveways so that trucks could come on

23   and off, and had an eight-inch concrete lining on the

24   houseboat which are not typically -- sorry, on the wharf

25   boat, which are not typically attributes one would think


                                   35

 1   of as ordinarily for vessels.

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:         I -- I got stopped here,

 3   back at Stewart.   "Practically capable of maritime

 4   transport."   Now, those are words I thought you have to

 5   interpret with some degree of common sense, and the

 6   reason for that is because each of us can of course

 7   imagine all kinds of things, from Styrofoam sofas to --

 8   to just dozens of absurd things that have nothing to do

 9   with ships or vessels and really could be used

10   theoretically to carry something on the water.

11                 So what we think of is that practical

12   capability means that there must -- this must really

13   have as a function, as one of its functions -- I'd like

14   to say purpose, but some people apparently don't like

15   that --

16                 (Laughter.)

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:         -- because it - it has some

18   other implication that I don't understand.          Okay.

19                 So call it the function or the capacity, and

20   it really does as a significant matter of carrying

21   things, and not just accoutrements like nails in its

22   walls, but -- but things from place to place to some

23   significant degree, okay?        So I've just taken the words

24   of the test and through voice -- and trying to focus

25   your mind, I've said you have to do that really as a --


                                     36

 1   it has to be some significant degree there, which this

 2   one doesn't seem to have, all right?

 3                So you see what I'm trying to do, and really

 4   it's a way of getting you to respond to that.

 5                MR. FREDERICK:       I think it certainly did

 6   have that.   It had that capability, Justice Breyer,

 7   because it was actually moved on multiple occasions.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:         But it wasn't carrying

 9   things.

10                MR. FREDERICK:       It was carrying his personal

11   effects.

12                JUSTICE BREYER:         Well, that's true.   And of

13   course a Styrofoam sofa is -- is carrying the holes, or

14   it's carrying the -- you know, the -- the coffee can or

15   something that is on top.       But when you have a thing

16   that carries itself, that isn't good enough.

17                MR. FREDERICK:       I --

18                JUSTICE BREYER:         It has to be something to

19   do with transporting a thing, transporting some stuff.

20                MR. FREDERICK:       It transported his

21   computers; it transported his clothes.           Except for the

22   fact that his guns were confiscated before the marshals

23   took it --

24                JUSTICE BREYER:         That's what part of the

25   house.

 2   they're not part of the house.           They're part of the

 3   personal effects, just as someone had personal effects

 4   in his or her dwelling.       And when the marshal towed it,

 5   it carried two people as part of the crew for the

 6   transit between --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.       Think of what

 8   it's doing and compare that with the dredge that every

 9   day the workmen get on, they go into the middle of

10   Boston Harbor, and then they start to work, and they

11   dredge.

12   And so you'd say, well, I see one of the purposes of

13   this boat is to carry those people out there.

14               Now think of this one.                This one is carrying

15   things, but that which it carries is just what is part

16   of a normal house which has nothing to do with

17   transporting things on water.

18               MR. FREDERICK:         Well, actually, I think Mr.

19   Fisher conceded that if this had a motor and it was

20   carrying exactly the same personal effects, it would be

21   a vessel.

22               JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay.       How do you then

23   distinguish -- I see where you're -- you're just saying

24   my distinction is not going to work, and so then I'd ask

 2   the back of my mind, which I will avoid -- and yet

 3   include --

 4                 (Laughter.)

 5                 MR. FREDERICK:       I think that a vessel that

 6   has practical capability, a watercraft that has

 7   practical capability to float, move and carry goods or

 8   people, that's a vessel.

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:         The floating sofa?   The

10   floating sofa?   Somebody is retired, he likes to see it

11   float around in the water, and you know, and it carries

12   a cushion.    I mean, really that's absurd.        So -- so how

13   do you distinguish -- I gave you an absurd example.              I

14   don't need to think of more.

15                 MR. FREDERICK:       I think I've given up the

16   absurd hypos because there are no litigation on them.

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Well --

18                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, suppose, Mr.

19   Frederick, this.    Suppose we had a trial on the question

20   of whether these floating homes or this floating home

21   was a vessel, and we found out that actually 99 percent

22   of people who buy floating homes move it exactly once.

23   They purchase the floating home and then they move it to

24   the place where they want the home to be, and then it

25   sits there.   And this was just a clear evidence that,


                                     39

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   you know, except if there's a hurricane or a tornado,

 2   people do not move floating homes.                They buy it, they

 3   move it to where they want to live, and then it sits.

 4                 In that case, do you think the thing is a

 5   vessel?

 6                 MR. FREDERICK:       Yes, if it has the practical

 7   capability.   That's what the statute says, Justice

 8   Kagan.    It depends on if you want to rewrite the statute

 9   to have subjective intent --

10                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, it's a statute --

11                 MR. FREDERICK:       -- of lots of vessel owners.

12                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       You're reading the statute

13   -- you're reading the statute as if it says something

14   can be transported over water.           But the statute doesn't

15   say that.   It says something can be used or capable of

16   being used as a means of transportation on water.                So

17   that -- that the question is whether this thing is

18   transporting other things over water, and whether that's

19   its function; and in my hypothetical it's not its

20   function.   Its function is to serve as a house.               That

21   house happens to be on water, but it's just a house.

22                 MR. FREDERICK:       Justice Kagan, the fact that

23   a vessel only moves once doesn't mean that it's not a

24   vessel if it has -- if it meets the attributes of the

25   statute, as explained by this Court in Stewart, of


                                     40

 1   practical capability.      The Titanic, of course, is a

 2   perfect example of that.

 3               The fact that a person may choose mobility

 4   as a -- as one of the attributes and not exercise that

 5   attribute of course goes to subjective intent, and as

 6   the Maritime Law Association's brief points out here,

 7   you do not want to apply an intent standard that goes to

 8   what the owner intends to -- which function the owner

 9   intends to exercise, because that leads to manipulation.

10   And the casino --

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Frederick, the city's

12   position, it is whatever we want it to be.           That is the

13   first time Lozman was sued by the city.           It was not

14   under admiralty jurisdiction, it was a plain old

15   landlord/tenant suit in State court, right?

16               MR. FREDERICK:         Yes, but there are some

17   exceptions and if -- I will let you finish your

18   question.

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Yes, well, my question

20   is, is it -- is it a vessel when you want it to be, and

21   just an ordinary landlord/tenant situation when you want

22   it to be that way?

23               MR. FREDERICK:         No.     I would answer that

24   question as no.

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, let's take this

 1   very incident, that is he failed to comply with the

 2   revised rules and he was behind in his payment of

 3   dockage fees.   Could the city have brought that case in

 4   an ordinary State court for the arrears?

 5               MR. FREDERICK:        No.

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Why not?

 7               MR. FREDERICK:        Because it's a vessel and

 8   the exclusive admiralty jurisdiction of the United

 9   States courts means that it has to be litigated in the

10   United States courts.

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           What about --

12               MR. FREDERICK:        That's why in the first one,

13   if I could just explain about the State court, because I

14   think that there is some misapprehension about what

15   happened.

16               His dog was not complying with the

17   ordinances, and he was not complying with the city

18   ordinances; that's why -- that's why the city brought

19   the in personam action against him in State court.

20   There was no admiralty basis there.              He was still paying

21   all of his dockage services and fees.             It became an in

22   rem action when the lien was not being discharged

23   through his payment on the dockage fees, and the city

24   had a basis under the wet slip agreement to assert a

25   maritime lien, which is a classic admiralty action under


                                    42

 1   Federal jurisdiction.

 2                So they are very different actions.            Under

 3   the State court action he could still stay at the

 4   marina, but he had to be on a houseboat that complied

 5   with the marina's rules.        He had two house boats at the

 6   marina, and this one was not in compliance, and that is

 7   why the city brought action against it.             It was the only

 8   one of the 500-plus vessels and boats in this marina

 9   that wasn't in compliance with the rules.

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             We -- we want I suppose to

11   give the courts of appeals a test that works.             I -- see

12   if this is, sums up your argument, or your position.

13                You look to see the objective

14   characteristic, the physical capacity of the -- of the

15   structure, and then you look not to purpose but to its

16   objective function:      Does it carry goods under the

17   statute.   And then I suppose you could under that say

18   that this is a vessel, but that this presumption is

19   overcome if it's permanently moored in a way the

20   Evansville dredge was.       Is -- is that your argument?

21                MR. FREDERICK:         I think that sums up in a

22   nutshell what we would regard as a proper statement of

23   the law, of what this Court has already said, and that

24   is that if it's got practical capability, those

25   practical characteristics, Justice Kennedy, will

 2   buy a domicile on land, one buys a house or a condo.                  If

 3   you buy a floating home, that has the attribute, the

 4   physical characteristics of floating, movage -- and

 5   moving and carriage --

 6                  JUSTICE BREYER:         That's where - that's

 7   exactly -- I mean, I think that works pretty well; and

 8   you think that works pretty well, but I don't agree with

 9   you at the moment hypothetically.             So something's wrong

10   somewhere.   And what I'm thinking is that you could have

11   very odd things, you know, like an advertising sign,

12   floating advertising sign and tow it around.                Is that

13   floating advertising sign a vessel?                No, it doesn't

14   carry goods but it does carry, say, the eyes on the

15   figure which might move around; and then it does -- and

16   Justice Kennedy said carrying goods.                All right.   Does

17   this structure, this houseboat have a function of

18   carrying goods?    You're tempted to say yes, because his

19   personal effects are in it.            I'm attempted to say no,

20   because there is nothing special about those personal

21   effects that isn't exactly similar to their being in a

22   similar structure on land.

23                  That's where I am wondering if there is a

24   distinction.    That's -- do you see what I -- what's

25   bothering me?

 1                MR. FREDERICK:         Justice Breyer, there is no

 2   basis, I mean, with all due respect, there is no basis

 3   in your cases to -- to hold that there is something

 4   about transportation that makes it somehow uniquely

 5   nautical or maritime as opposed to --

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:           No, it's nothing --

 7                MR. FREDERICK:         -- household effects or

 8   other goods or services or people that are transported

 9   over land.   And that's why when the normal definition of

10   transportation is to convey a person or a thing from one

11   place to another, that's perfectly satisfied under the

12   facts of this case.      And it is an undisputed record as

13   Petitioner says, on page 27 of the cert petition, they

14   ask for cert here for you to decide whether Mr. Lozman's

15   state of mind about his indefinite mooring is somehow

16   relevant to the definition of a vessel.            It clearly

17   isn't.

18                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           I guess the problem is

19   the list of absurdities that they point to, not the

20   least of which is a dry dock, which you talk about

21   whether it's permanently moored or not, but most dry

22   docks are held in place by, you know, heavy ropes but

23   you can cut them and you can stick something on them and

24   they can float away.      Under -- so how do you --

 3                 MR. FREDERICK:       The dry docks with which I

 4   am familiar are anchored to the bottom so that they can

 5   stay in one place and they don't carry anything, so they

 6   don't meet the part of the test that requires carriage.

 7                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So what do you do with

 8   the --

 9                 MR. FREDERICK:       They are simply physical

10   structures --

11                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- trampoline and the

12   other examples your adversary gave?               Is a trampoline

13   that floats on water capable of moving -- it's moving

14   the trampoline.

15                 MR. FREDERICK:       I don't think it's

16   practically capable of carrying anything.

17                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         It's carrying the

18   Trampoline.

19                 MR. FREDERICK:       And again --

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So is the difference

21   whether I attach something permanently or temporarily to

22   the top of the floating thing, the floating board, the

23   floating whatever?

24                 MR. FREDERICK:       Well, it would not be

25   subject to towage.    Here the houseboat had -- this is

 1   important because the houseboat under the testimony Mr.

 2   Lozman elicited at trial had four towing cleats that

 3   were welded into the structure of his houseboat so that

 4   it could be towed without torquing and twisting the

 5   houseboat and causing it to sink.            The hypotheticals

 6   that the other side has suggested don't have that

 7   additive feature of towing cleats that are used for the

 8   purpose of being able to convey the houseboat --

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Counsel, your

10   example of the towing cleats highlights one of the

11   difficulties I have; one, because obviously the question

12   of, well, what if they didn't have the towing cleats,

13   and then what if they had the towing cleats and then

14   took them off, what if they were temporary towing

15   cleats.    One of the things, this is a jurisdictional

16   statute and we like jurisdictional statutes to be clear

17   and easy of application.       Why do you think your test is

18   easier than your friend's test?

19                 MR. FREDERICK:       Because the physical

20   characteristics of this houseboat all point to the

21   attributes of being a vessel.            It floats, it moves, it

22   carries.   It's got nothing to do --

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              It's got -- it

24   doesn't have -- the thing that makes something look most

25   like a boat in my view is a raked bow.               That tells you

 2   through the water.    This is straight up and down.

 3                MR. FREDERICK:        Well, Mr. Chief --

 5   what are the things called on the side, the elevated

 6   sides that you'd look for in a boat.

 7                MR. FREDERICK:        We would submit that

 8   Congress did not intend a you-know-it-when-you-see-it

 9   test.   House barges, barges have been vessels since the

10   time of Cleopatra.    The fact that it is flat-bottomed

11   and it floats and it moves and it carries things does

12   not make it not a vessel.

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Mr. Frederick, this is

14   kind of an idiosyncratic case.           There are many cases I

15   think in the courts now about floating casinos.               I take

16   it on your definition the floating casino would be a

17   vessel subject to maritime jurisdiction.

18                MR. FREDERICK:        Yes, unless it has a

19   physical impediment that takes it out of one of the

20   three attributes that doesn't make it a vessel.               If --

22   stays in one place and the gambling goes on in one

24   it stays there.   You -- you say because it is able to be

 4   permanently moored with a, with a -- like the Intrepid

 5   on the Hudson River --

 6                 MR. FREDERICK:       I'm not familiar --

 7                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           With about -- aircraft

 8   carrier.   But it's really fixed in there with regular

 9   walkways and so forth.      Very -- it would cause a lot of

10   work in order to move it.

11                 MR. FREDERICK:       We suggest that the way the

12   court should think about that problem is as a physical

13   impediment.   Are physical impediments preclude its moat

14   movement or carriage or floating capacity --

15                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Mr. Frederick, if that is

16   the case, then your test really comes down to how

17   securely is something fastened.            I mean, you have to

18   deal with Evansville's wharf boat and you have to deal

19   with Cage's dry dock, and you have to deal with all

20   these floating casinos and restaurants.            And you're

21   saying that in all these cases we are supposed to look

22   to is it a rope or is it a cable, how many cables, how

23   quickly can it be disengaged, and that that's going to

24   end up being the test that you would have us adopt which

25   is how easy it is to get out of the port.

 1                MR. FREDERICK:       I think that's a fair way to

 2   view it, Justice Kagan, and it's a perfectly appropriate

 3   one.   The Belle of Orleans case --

 4                JUSTICE KAGAN:       That really does become a

 5   jury question -- a question of fact for everything,

 6   right?   You know, are there six cables, are there nine

 7   cables, what are they made of, you know, how long is it

 8   going to take to rip up the -- the I-beams, whatever?

 9                MR. FREDERICK:       Well, I think that as a

10   practical matter, this arises in only a couple of

11   instances and those are the casino boats, many of which

12   were vessels and they traversed the rivers allowing

13   people to gamble because that's how state laws required

14   them to perform.   And they have since stopped trying to

15   be vessels because of state law changes that they were

16   able to make.   And so the question as a practical matter

17   is are there physical impediments to the ability of that

18   boat to -- to use the capability to move?        The Star of

19   India, which was referenced in the Belle of Orleans

20   case, was not -- was a vessel, a sailing vessel from the

21   19th century.   In 1926 they took it out of commission as

22   a sailing vessel and they towed it to San Diego, where

23   it sat for 50 years tied to the dock, and for the

24   bicentennial, they decided let's get the boat out and

25   sail it and they sailed it for the bicentennial.        The

 1   Ninth Circuit held that's a vessel because it has the

 2   capability of being used as a vessel.             And the fact that

 3   something is moored for a long time, if it has the

 4   physical attributes to be a vessel, it is a vessel.            The

 5   United States -- the USS Constitution, the famous USS

 6   Constitution would be shocked to have heard Mr. Gannon's

 7   statement about vessel because there are 200 Navy

 8   service members who service the USS Constitution and

 9   take it out periodically for sail.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Is there any problem here,

11   which I think maybe the Coast Guard and the other people

12   who are responsible for vessels, say once we start

13   thinking that everything in the house is a vessel -- I

14   overstate -- we're going to have an impossible time

15   doing our job.   I mean, you know, you are going to see

16   some kind of a log next to a beach somewhere and

17   somebody's going to start calling it a vessel.            We've

18   got to limit this somehow to things that really are used

19   as vessels.

20                 MR. FREDERICK:       Yes --

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Is that a problem, and if

22   so, how would you deal with it?

23                 MR. FREDERICK:       If it were a problem the

24   Coast Guard would have signed the Solicitor General's

25   brief in this case which they have done in other cases

 1   in which transportation and vessel status have been


 2   relevant like in Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, United


 3   States v. Locke, in which the Coast Guard --

 4                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         This is not very


 5   compelling in this case because they have regulations

 6   that pretty much echo what the Solicitor General is

 7   saying, so it's not as if they were going to take a

 8   different position.      The Solicitor General is basically

 9   saying follow the Coast Guard regulations.

10                  MR. FREDERICK:       And the statute underlying

11   those regulations, Justice Sotomayor, is found at 46 USC

12   4302, and it provides the secretary very broad

13   discretion on what to include within the regulations and

14   what not to.    After this court decided the Stewart case,

15   the secretary suspended many regulations for dockside

16   vessels until the Coast Guard could issue new

17   regulations.    There is a hint, there is a suggestion

18   that there might be a problem, but there is not anything

19   that is really given in practical terms.

20                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, but, I mean,

21   there is some easy things to visualize as a problem.                If

22   this is a vessel, then the maid that comes on twice a

23   week is a seaman under the Jones Act, right?

24                  MR. FREDERICK:       No.    And the reason why is

25   because as this court recognized in Stewart, the in


                                      52

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   navigation requirement is something that has been used

 2   for limiting the reach of Jones Act seamen in those

 3   circumstances in which a vessel is taken out of

 4   navigation.   So I think that it would be appropriate in

 5   a case like this where this is a classic instance of a

 6   maritime lien, dockage --

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I'm sorry, taken out

 8   of navigation, but not every time it's docked, right?

 9                 MR. FREDERICK:       No.    But no -- and in fact,

10   I think the question of who is a Jones Act seaman is a

11   different test that this Court last discussed in the

12   Chandris case, in terms of its substantial connection to

13   the mission of the vessel.         And that -- I think that the

14   Court could safely leave the Jones Act issues aside,

15   because they bring in an entirely different regime that

16   focuses on the worker's connection to the vessel as

17   opposed to the definition of vessel itself.

18                 The definition of vessel itself here is, as

19   Justice Scalia pointed out, part of the Dictionary Act,

20   and it is something that does apply more broadly.               But

21   as we briefed in this case, there are two provisions

22   that take that definition and then they add an intent

23   requirement as specific language in different parts.               So

24   that if that idea, function, or intent or purpose is

25   something that is germane to that particular statutory


                                     53

 1   function, than that is a question that becomes a

 2   question for jurisdiction.

 3                  But I'd also like to point out that both, I

 4   think, the district court and the court of appeals here

 5   assumed that there was jurisdiction here because there

 6   had not been evidence that contested the basic

 7   principles that the City brought when it profiled this

 8   in rem action.

 9                  And because the case then moved into the

10   merits phase, the district judge here initially denied

11   the motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction without

12   prejudice.   And then as the evidence came in, revisited

13   the question to provide a fuller explanation, and at

14   that time made the ruling that Mr. Lozman had not put in

15   record evidence that affected the practical capability

16   of the test.

17                  The only thing Mr. Lozman argued in the

18   court of appeals as a reason for error was that because

19   he intended to live there indefinitely, even though he

20   had no contractual or property right to do so, and he

21   had signed a wet slip agreement that provided the marina

22   complete discretion to move his houseboat within any of

23   the slips, or to order of the houseboat to leave on 3

24   days' notice, the question of whether or not there was

25   any record of evidence on practical capability got to

 1   the Eleventh Circuit, and the Eleventh Circuit, in

 2   applying a practical capability test, said the things

 3   that Mr. Lozman had argued, he didn't offer record

 4   evidence.

 5                  So, Justice Kennedy, to your point, I think

 6   that with respect to the Court of Appeals and how it did

 7   do its job here is an important facet of the case as it

 8   comes.

 9                  They initially asked you in the cert

10   petition, grant cert because the Fifth Circuit and the

11   Seventh Circuit have applied an onerous intent test.

12   They've not defended that test.            And it is abjectly

13   erroneous because you can't have vessel status be so

14   easily manipulated by an individual's intent.                And now

15   by trying to morph it into some kind of function or

16   objective purpose standard, they've essentially done

17   exactly what the Eleventh Circuit said they had offered

18   no evidence in the district court to try to prove.

19                  If there are no further questions.

20                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

 1   I've heard, and some of this Court has echoed it, is

 2   that this is a vessel because it was moved around and it

 3   carried his personal effects.           The difficulty is that

 4   argument runs absolutely headlong into Evansville and

 5   Roper; it cannot be squared with those cases.           And I

 6   would be willing to rest my entire case on simply this

 7   Court reading and applying those cases.

 8                In Evansville, this Court dealt with

 9   something that carried around the effects of a business

10   office.   In Roper, this Court dealt with something that

11   carried around grain and was far more seaworthy than the

12   structure in this case.

13                Both instances, the Court said they're not

14   vessels because the function was not to carry those

15   things around, it was merely -- they were merely

16   incidental relocations.

17                Now -- so for that reason, the Eleventh

18   Circuit simply cannot be right when it says that

19   function is irrelevant.      And the City can't be right on

20   its test either.   The only way the City has proposed to

21   deal with those cases is to look at how securely the

22   structure is fashioned.

23                And Justice Kagan, you're exactly right.            If

24   you want a recipe for disaster on jurisdictional

25   questions, start asking whether it's chains or ropes.


                                    56

 1   And not only that, if you want something that's utterly

 2   manipulable, just tell the yacht owner who has his yacht

 3   down in the harbor that all he has to do is hook it up

 4   to the dock with chains instead of ropes and now he's

 5   out of maritime jurisdiction.

 6                So this Court's cases for almost a century

 7   have applied the exact test we're asking this Court to

 8   apply.   And even if you're not 100 percent persuaded

 9   that that's what the statute is best read as doing, that

10   is what we have done for over 100 years, and that is how

11   maritime law has built up and guaranteed on those -- on

12   those understandings.

13                And it's not just the questions we've been

14   talking today -- it's employment law, tort law, all the

15   rest are built on this test.            And we're asking this

16   Court simply to reaffirm what it's done in the past.

17                So I think that leaves the question of, when

18   you know the Eleventh Circuit applied the wrong test and

19   you know the City's test can't be right, do you vacate

20   or do you send -- or do you simply reverse?            And we

21   think -- Justice Kennedy, we think that you can simply

22   reverse.   You have everything in the record you need,

23   most notably in the surveyor's report.

24                And you can look at four things.           Look at

25   the -- look at the materials used, the shape of the

 1   structure, its equipment and the utilities.               The

 2   materials used were plywood and ordinary land-based

 3   structures.

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              That is -- what was

 5   used in the Higgins boats in World War II.

 6                 MR. FISHER:     I'm -- I'm not saying any of

 7   these are determinative, Mr. Chief Justice, but it's a

 8   totality that tells you what it is.

 9                 And the next thing is the shape.             Exactly as

10   you referred.    This is a rectangle that sits 10 inches

11   under the water, is not meant to be moved around.               Look

12   at the -- look at its features.           It has French doors on

13   three sides a few feet above the water line.               That's not

14   what a vessel -- not how a vessel is designed.

15                 And finally, its utilities.             Again, at Joint

16   Appendix 40, for example, it says this thing has no

17   batteries.    It is utterly dependent on being hooked up

18   to land.   That's the only way it can function.

19                 So if this Court does nothing else between

20   now and casting its vote and writing its opinion,

21   revisit this Court's prior cases and reassert the rule

22   that this Court has always applied.

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.
