 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  We'll hear

 4   argument first this morning in Case 08-1371, Christian

 5   Legal Society Chapter of the University of California-

 6   Hastings v. Martinez.

 8            ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL

 9                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10               MR. McCONNELL:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may

11   it please the Court:

12               If Hastings is correct, a student who does

13   not even believe in the Bible is entitled to demand to

14   lead a Christian Bible study, and if CLS does not

15   promise to allow this, the college will bar them from its

16   forum for speech.

17               The First Amendment -- under the First

18   Amendment, rights run the opposite way.                  Hastings is the

19   government; CLS is private.              A public forum for speech

20   must be open and inclusive, but participants in the

21   forum are entitled to their own voice.

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Now, these are fundamental

23   arguments, and I don't want to spend too much time on

24   factual matters because that's frustrating to both the

25   Court and the counsel.

 1                  But we do have the problem of the

 2   stipulation.     The stipulation makes it clear that

 3   Democrats and Republicans can both get into the other

 4   one's club.    That's the Stipulations 17 and 18 at 220 of the

 5   Joint Appendix.     You want to get away from the

 6   stipulation by what, according to your reply brief,

 7   Hastings said in its answer, but the stipulation

 8   supersedes the answer.

 9                  So if both counsel could just address for a

10   moment:   What is the case that we have here?                    You have

11   different views on what case is before us.

12                  MR. McCONNELL:            Happy to, Justice Kennedy.

13                  If you just look with me at Joint

14   Stipulation 17, I think it makes this completely clear.

15   That's on page 221 of the Joint Appendix, and it states:

16   "Both parties agreed that in order to become a

17   registered student organization a student organization's

18   bylaws must provide that its membership is open to all

19   students" --     that's the all-comers policy -- "and the

20   organization must agree to abide by" -- "abide by the

21   Nondiscrimination Policy."               That's capital N, capital P,

22   a defined term.     The "Nondiscrimination Policy" is

23   defined in Joint Stipulation Number 15.                     That is what we

24   have been calling the written policy.                     And the idea that

25   membership must be open to all students is described in

 1   Joint Stipulation 18, which is simply a description of

 2   what that policy is.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:            But doesn't -- doesn't the

 4   one -- isn't the all-comers policy broader than the

 5   nondiscrimination policy, so that if you comply with

 6   that you automatically comply with everything in the

 7   nondiscrimination clause?

 8                MR. McCONNELL:          It is broader.            It's our

 9   position that either of these justifications for

10   excluding CLS is unconstitutional.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yes, but -- but the latter,

12   the nondiscrimination policy, you assert is -- is not

13   viewpoint neutral, that it has a particular impact upon

14   a religious organization; whereas, the other policy, the

15   all-comers policy, applies to everybody, and that

16   argument is not available to you.

17                MR. McCONNELL:          Justice Scalia, our

18   argument -- there are two policies.                     They have invoked

19   both.   We believe both are unconstitutional, but for

20   slightly different reasons.             The written policy is

21   unconstitutional because it's overtly viewpoint

22   discrimination -- discriminatory and thus violating

23   the principles of cases like Rosenberger and Widmar.

24                The all-comers --

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But, Mr. McConnell,

 1   Justice Scalia had just made the point that the all-comers

 2   policy overwhelms the other, so that I would like you to

 3   deal up front with the all-comers policy that the dean

 4   in her deposition said, loud and clear:                  "Our policy is

 5   all-comers.    Yes, Republicans have to be admitted to the

 6   Democratic group and vice versa."                 So unless you are

 7   challenging the veracity of the dean after stipulating,

 8   as you did, that all-comers is the policy, I don't see

 9   how we can listen to your argument about the so-called

10   written policy.

11                 MR. McCONNELL:          Well, both policies we contend

12   are unconstitutional.       Let's begin with the all-comers

13   policy, and when you conclude that it is

14   unconstitutional, we will also need to deal with the

15   other since they have two arrows in their quiver.

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You can do that, but you --

17   it's a much different case if Hastings treats the CLS

18   differently than it treats the Democratic and Republican

19   Clubs.   That's a much different -- frankly, it's a much

20   easier case for you.       But it's -- it's frustrating for

21   us not to know what kind of case we have in front of us.

22                 MR. McCONNELL:          Your Honor, it's a case

23   where the -- where Hastings has put forward two quite

24   different justifications for denying our right and both

25   of them are unconstitutional.

 1               Let's begin with the all-comers policy.

 2               JUSTICE ALITO:          Mr. McConnell, when I

 3   read -- when I read the papers that Hastings submitted

 4   to the district court at the same time that the joint

 5   stipulation was submitted, I saw one reference after

 6   another to an allegation that Hastings was applying its

 7   policy in a discriminatory manner, that it was not in

 8   fact insisting that all registered student organizations

 9   admit all applicants.       And when I read their brief in

10   the Ninth Circuit, I saw that point reiterated again and

11   again.

12               So that led me to believe that what was

13   stipulated was not that in fact they had a policy which

14   they enforced under which anybody who applied to any

15   group would be admitted, but that this was what Dean

16   Kane had announced.     That was the stated policy, but not

17   necessarily the actual policy that was employed.                And

18   that was the argument it seemed to me that CLS was

19   making; isn't that correct?

20               MR. McCONNELL:          That's entirely correct,

21   Justice -- Justice Alito.         That's --

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, you should -- if that

23   was it you should have brought in some -- some evidence

24   of different treatment of other groups.                And there --

25   as I --

 1                MR. McCONNELL:             Justice --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:               There is none of that

 3   except your citation of the bylaws of two groups in your

 4   brief, as I --

 5                MR. McCONNELL:             Well, but that is in fact the

 6   evidence.   When --

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But, Mr. McConnell, here

 8   is a statement, a stipulation.                 It's a stipulation for

 9   summary judgment.      It says:            District Judge, you take

10   this to be the fact:         Hastings requires that registered

11   student organizations allow any student to participate,

12   become a member, seek leadership positions in the

13   organization.    That is not qualified.                    It says:

14   District Judge, here are the facts that we stipulate.

15   It doesn't say this is what the dean says, but it's not

16   really enforced.      It's not qualified at all.

17                MR. McCONNELL:             Justice Ginsburg, we -- we

18   stipulated that this was their policy.                     That stipulation

19   contains nothing about the historical facts as to how

20   Hastings has actually applied it.                   But let's talk about

21   the policy, because it is unconstitutional --

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:               I wish you would.          You are

23   going to waste your whole time just discussing this

24   stipulation point.       Let's assume -- let's assume that --

25                MR. McCONNELL:             Yes.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA: -- the latter is the policy.

 2                MR. McCONNELL:          Yes, because the policy is I

 3   think blatantly unconstitutional.                It is manifestly

 4   overbroad with respect to any purposes stated.                And, of

 5   course, in Healy v. James, this Court held that any

 6   restriction on a student speech forum may be no more

 7   extensive than is required by its purposes.                It is also

 8   a frontal assault on freedom of association.                Freedom of

 9   association is the right to form around shared beliefs.

10   To say that groups may not form around shared beliefs --

11                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So is this an exception

12   that you want to talk about as it is applied to

13   religious groups, or are you suggesting that if a group

14   wanted to exclude all black people, all women, all

15   handicapped persons, whatever other form of

16   discrimination a group wants to practice, that a school

17   has to accept that group and recognize it, give it funds,

18   and otherwise lend it space?

19                MR. McCONNELL:          Not at all, Justice

20   Sotomayor.   Our position is that --

21                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So then, what is --

22   what is wrong with the purpose of a school to say we don't

23   wish any group that doesn't -- that discriminates?

24                MR. McCONNELL:          The stipulation is that they

25   may not exclude based on status or beliefs.                We have


                                        9

 1   only challenged the beliefs, not status.                   Race, any

 2   other status basis Hastings is able to enforce.                   But

 3   they may not tell a group --

 4                JUSTICE STEVENS:         So, what if the belief --

 5                MR. McCONNELL:        -- that you just have to let

 6   you in that don't agree with you.

 7                JUSTICE STEVENS:         What if the belief is that

 8   African Americans are inferior?

 9                MR. McCONNELL:        Again, I think they can

10   discriminate on the basis of the belief, but not on

11   the basis of the status.       So that if the --

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:        You could have --

13                MR. McCONNELL:        -- if there were racist

14   organizations --

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- a student

16   organization, I suppose, of that type.                   It wouldn't

17   include many people.     But if there were such an

18   organization, I assume that they would have that -- that

19   belief required, right?

20                MR. McCONNELL:        That's right, but they could

21   not go the next step and exclude someone on the basis of

22   status, under our --

23                JUSTICE BREYER:        Doesn't this say the

24   opposite?   It says we are -- you have to let anybody in --

25   anybody -- regardless of their status or beliefs.                      So you can't

 1   discriminate on the basis of status or belief.                That's

 2   what the policy says I just read.                It doesn't say you

 3   can; it says you can't.

 4                MR. McCONNELL:          It's that the group may not

 5   confine its leadership based upon its beliefs.                That means

 6   that --

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:          That's what you say, but

 8   that's not what the policy says.               The policy says that

 9   you have to let everybody in, regardless of their status

10   or belief.

11                MR. McCONNELL:          Right.        And -- and our view is

12   that the status --

13                JUSTICE BREYER:          So you cannot discriminate on

14   the basis of status or belief.

15                MR. McCONNELL:          The status half of that is

16   perfectly constitutional and --

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:          You say you --

18                MR. McCONNELL:          -- the belief half of that is not.

19                JUSTICE BREYER:          -- you have to -- you

20   have to let these organizations discriminate on the

21   basis of belief.    And they say:            No, we don't want to;

22   that's too complicated for us to figure out which ones

23   we should, which ones we shouldn't.                 We'd rather let them

24   work off-campus.    We just don't want to get into this

25   business.    It's not just against religion.              It might be

 1   against a Turkish-speaking society that thinks Turkish

 2   is extremely important to speak or a chess club that

 3   thinks the same.   It could be a lot of people.

 4                Now, why do you -- what's wrong with us, a First

 5   Amendment -- an organization itself affected with First

 6   Amendment interests, saying we just don't want to have

 7   those on campus organizations, too much trouble.

 8                MR. McCONNELL:          What is -- what is wrong with

 9   that is that restrictions on a designated public forum must

10   be reasonable in light of the purposes of the forum.                 The

11   purpose of the forum is set forth in Joint Stipulation

12   Number 8.   It is to promote a diversity of viewpoints

13   among registered student organizations.                 If the student

14   organizations are not allowed to have a coherent set of

15   beliefs, there can be no diversity among them.

16                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But this sounds like a

17   debate over whether the policy as the school believes it

18   should be implemented is not a good one.                But isn't that

19   their choice?   Don't we give deference to an educational

20   institution in terms of the choices it makes about

21   effecting its own -- its purposes?                 And the purpose here

22   is we don't want our students to discriminate.

23                MR. McCONNELL:          There is a stipulation as to

24   what the purpose is, and the purpose is to promote a

25   diversity of viewpoints among registered student

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:        That's their way of doing

 4   that.

 5               MR. McCONNELL:        It is a stipulated fact.

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           And Hastings takes the

 7   position that it's all in favor of diversity, not only

 8   among the groups but within the groups.                   So --

 9               MR. McCONNELL:        Which is not the joint

10   stipulation.   The stipulation is that the purpose of the

11   forum is diversity among groups.            Their policy is not --

12   it's not only just unreasonable in light of it; it is

13   contrary to it.

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           It is that they --

15               MR. McCONNELL:        It defeats the purpose of the forum.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           They say, yes, we believe in

17   diversity among groups, but we also believe in diversity

18   within the group; that's a good thing.                   They are not backing

19   off from:   We think diversity among groups is fine.

20               MR. McCONNELL:        They say that in their

21   brief, but that is not the stipulated fact in the

22   case.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:        Let me make an imaginary

24   example, and that's --

 1   stipulation?

 2                  MR. McCONNELL:          It's page 216 in the Joint

 3   Appendix, Joint Stipulation Number 8.                     It is the only

 4   stipulation in the case having to do with what the

 5   purpose is of the RSO forum.

 6                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Wait a minute now.         A

 7   diversity --

 8                  MR. McCONNELL:          "Hastings seeks to promote a

 9   diversity of viewpoints among registered student

10   organizations."

11                  And note how destructive an all-comers

12   policy directed on belief is toward -- toward that.

13   That means that if, for example, there's an NAACP

14   chapter, it would have to allow a -- a racist skinhead

15   to sit on -- in on its planning meetings.                     That means

16   that if there's an environmentalist club that has a

17   demonstration in Sacramento in favor of cap-and-trade

18   legislation, they would have to allow --

19                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            It may be --

20                  MR. McCONNELL:          -- a global warming skeptic

21   to --

22                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            It may be an ill-advised

23   policy, but the school says:              It's our policy.         It's

24   working fine, and all the -- the hypotheticals about

25   sabotage, takeover, they haven't happened.

 1               MR. McCONNELL:             They haven't happened

 2   because this policy came into being -- was announced for

 3   the first time in 2005.          So there couldn't possibly be

 4   any -- any record of that.

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:               This -- this was not the

 6   policy on the basis of which CLS was excluded; is that

 7   correct?

 8               MR. McCONNELL:             That's correct, it was not.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:               It -- when they were

10   refused participation in the -- in the student

11   organization program, they were not told about the

12   all-comers policy.

13               MR. McCONNELL:             That's correct.           Joint

14   Stipulation Number 40 states clearly that the -- that the

15   -- that they were informed, and I quote:                      "They were

16   informed that CLS bylaws were not compliant with the

17   religion and sexual orientation provisions of the

18   Nondiscrimination Policy."

19               JUSTICE ALITO:             And was there any written

20   document memorializing this policy prior to the time

21   when the former dean gave her deposition?

22               MR. McCONNELL:             Never.        And --

23               JUSTICE ALITO:             And is the -- is the policy

24   as articulated by the dean in her deposition the same as

25   the policy that Hastings now claims it has in its brief?

 1                 MR. McCONNELL:          I don't think so.          Every

 2   time the policy is mentioned, it seems to morph into

 3   something else.    When the dean announced it at the

 4   deposition, she said all students may participate on

 5   the -- in all activities, period, full stop.                    Now we

 6   find out in their brief, well, their -- groups can have

 7   conduct limitations, they can require dues, they can

 8   have attendance requirements, they can have competitive

 9   contests to see whether they get in.

10                 This -- this policy is -- it changes with

11   every wind.

12                 And -- but the fundamental problem with

13   this -- with this is what -- what this Court stated in

14   Velazquez v. Legal Services Corporation, that you cannot

15   allow -- you cannot allow the terms of the policy just

16   to say that whatever their policy is, that that

17   determines the contours of the program, because that

18   would render the First Amendment a -- a nullity.

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Of course, that was not a

20   religion case.    Your argument at its most fundamental

21   level is that religious organizations are different

22   because religion is all about belief.                    But at that point

23   don't we also have a tradition of separation?                    That's

24   the whole reason why church and state for many purposes

25   are kept separate, so that States are not implicated

 1   with religious beliefs.

 2                  And it -- it -- it seems to me we have to

 3   consider that when we are considering your argument.

 4   Now, you can cite Rosenberger, but -- but I think this is

 5   different from that.

 6                  MR. McCONNELL:          The separation is between

 7   church and state, but this Court has held over and over

 8   again that speech forums -- that people participating in

 9   a speech forum are not the state.                  The state is

10   Hastings.     We are perfectly private.                   There is nothing

11   wrong with a religious organization, even on public --

12                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             You're not --

13                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Anyway, as I understand

14   your argument on the all-comers policy, it is not an

15   argument that -- that is based upon the religious nature

16   of CLS.     You would make the same argument of

17   unconstitutionality with respect to the student

18   Republican Club, wouldn't you?

19                  MR. McCONNELL:          We would.

20                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Or --

21                  MR. McCONNELL:          Now, we do --

22   there is in addition a free exercise argument, but I

23   don't -- but in this case what the Free Exercise Clause

24   protects is exactly what the associational freedom test

25   would protect for everyone.

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I had thought that an

 2   important part of the case, of your case, is that belief

 3   is inherent to the idea of religious expression and must

 4   be protected.    But if the protection causes problems

 5   within the school for other policies, then doesn't the

 6   separation policy come into play?                 That's -- that's what

 7   I'm asking.

 8                 MR. McCONNELL:          Again, separation does not

 9   apply to private parties when they are operating, even

10   on government property.

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. McConnell, let's say

12   it is the belief of this group, based on their reading

13   of the Bible, that only white men can lead the Bible

14   studies, can become officers of the group, and that's

15   based on their fundamental belief that that's what the

16   Bible instructs.    On your view, must Hastings give this

17   organization status as a recognized student

18   organization?

19                 MR. McCONNELL:          No, Justice Ginsburg.      Our

20   position is it is unconstitutional to -- to prohibit

21   groups to form around beliefs but not around status.

22                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But the belief is -- this

23   is the belief.

24                 MR. McCONNELL:          They can insist that -- that

25   everyone who participates in the group have that belief,

 1   and that, as Justice Scalia said, may mean it's going to

 2   be a very small group.        But they cannot discriminate on

 3   the basis of status.       But belief -- as this Court said

 4   in Cantwell v. Connecticut, belief, the freedom to

 5   believe, is absolute.

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So, they -- they would have

 7   to negate their belief in their practice.                They could

 8   believe this, but they couldn't implement it?

 9                 MR. McCONNELL:          Well, it's not unusual to

10   say people -- people can believe in all kinds of things

11   that are illegal.    That doesn't mean that they can do

12   them.   It's not a -- it's not an unfamiliar distinction

13   in our law.   But let's look at --

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            This was the basis -- your

15   distinction between status and belief was the basis for

16   your saying that the original policy, whatever --

17   whatever we call it -- what is the name of it?

18                 MR. McCONNELL:          The written policy?

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            The written policy -- when

20   it forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual

21   orientation was complied with by CLS because it would

22   not discriminate on the basis of orientation, only on

23   the basis of belief.

24                 MR. McCONNELL:          That's correct.

 1   person said, I want to belong to this club, and I

 2   believe in its principles, I don't believe in sexual

 3   relationships before marriage, and that's why I want to

 4   work for homosexual marriage, which I do, so my

 5   consistency there, is that person -- I am consistent in

 6   what I work for, what I believe, and on -- as far as

 7   premarital sex is concerned, it's totally 100 percent

 8   with your organization that you are representing; would

 9   they admit that person or not?

10               MR. McCONNELL:            Yes.      There's a joint

11   stipulation to that effect, Number 34.

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:             CLS doesn't have any -- any

13   belief that marriage is between a man and a woman?

14               MR. McCONNELL:            It -- it does.      I thought

15   that Justice Breyer posited the case of a person of

16   homosexual orientation who shares that belief.

19   there should be no premarital sex --

 1   be -- he can be excluded from leadership in the group.

 2                  Again, he's able to attend all the

 3   activities.    CLS has all of its activities entirely open

 4   to everyone.     And what it objects to is having -- is

 5   being run by non-Christians, because after all, this is

 6   a group whose very purpose is --

 7                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             You keep talking about

 8   being forced to let people in.                And this is where I'm a

 9   little bit confused by your yellow brief.

10                  The school has taken the position that any

11   group can apply to use its facilities; priority and

12   funding, et cetera, will only go to recognized student

13   groups.   But your group is not being excluded or

14   ostracized completely from the school.                       Presumably, you

15   can meet in the cafeteria.             You can meet in open spaces

16   in the school.     You can apply like everyone else, any

17   other nonstudent group, recognized student group.                       But

18   you have been saying repeatedly in your presentation

19   that you're barred from the campus.                       And so I'm a little

20   confused as to exactly --

21                  MR. McCONNELL:          What I -- Justice Sotomayor,

22   I believe what we consistently say is that we have been

23   denied the right to meet on campus.                       And that is

24   completely true.     Look -- if you would look at Joint

25   Stipulation Number 10, at the top of page 219, it provides

 1   that CLS, although not currently registered, is eligible

 2   to apply for permission for rooms.                  But there is no

 3   stipulation that that will ever be granted, and the

 4   record shows that every time CLS has requested

 5   permission to meet they have gotten a complete

 7   apply through your lawyer, and then their -- they don't

 8   get an answer on time and when they get an answer it's,

 9   well, because you're not a registered student group --

10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But let's -- could we --

11                 MR. McCONNELL:          -- there is not room for

12   you.

13                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Let's -- let's assume,

14   because I'm not quite sure what the record is on these

15   issues -- I'm somewhat confused on the factual assumptions

16   underlying this case.       But let's assume two things:              One,

17   that in fact you have the option of applying for use of

18   the space and that, assuming there are no conflicts and

19   other things that -- that are in the normal course would

20   preclude your use, that you would be granted use.                 Is your

21   argument different in that situation?

22                 MR. McCONNELL:          Justice Sotomayor, even the

23   access to campus communications is absolutely essential,

24   as this Court said in the -- in Healy v. James.                 We are

25   barred from access to the -- to Hastings' e-mail system;

 1   we can't post notices on the usual bulletin board; we

 2   are left out of the weekly --

 3                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             There are bulletin

 4   boards.     There are other ones.

 5                  MR. McCONNELL:          There -- there's -- there

 6   are ones for the -- for campus and student groups, and

 7   there's another one for community groups.                 We're

 8   allowed to post on the community group, but we're not

 9   allowed to post on the boards that -- that students look

10   to for where student activities occur.

11                  We are left out of the -- a very important

12   point -- the student organization fair at the beginning

13   of the year where groups introduce themselves to the

14   One L's as they -- as they come in.

15                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Are you disputing that

16   this is --

17                  MR. McCONNELL:          We're -- we're barred from

18   that.

19                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Are you disputing this

20   is a limited forum, public forum?

21                  MR. McCONNELL:          No, it's definitely a

22   limited designated public forum.

23                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But that's different from

24   Cantwell.     Cantwell is where the Jehovah's Witness

25   plays the record on the -- on the street.                 And -- and --

 1                 MR. McCONNELL:          I only cite Cantwell for the

 2   proposition that belief is absolute.

 3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           No.      No.    And Cantwell

 4   said that belief is central to -- to religions and that

 5   people would disagree.        But that's precisely why

 6   Hastings might argue to us that -- that this is

 7   inconsistent with their idea of what this forum is.                      And

 8   if -- will you just address that, please?

 9                 MR. McCONNELL:          I would address it.         The

10   forum -- the purposes of the forum are undisputed.                      They

11   are to provide a diversity of expression among student

12   groups.    Their policy disserves the purpose of the forum

13   and therefore cannot be regarded as reasonable in light

14   of that.   And what is more, what they have done is --

15   it's also not reasonable because it's independently

16   unconstitutional.     What they have done is they've said

17   you may not have fundamental freedom of association or,

18   if you do, we will withdraw an otherwise available

19   benefit from you.

20                 As recently as the unanimous decision of

21   this Court in FAIR v. Rumsfeld, the Court reiterated the

22   -- the now I think 100-year old principle that

23   constitutional rights may not be penalized by the

24   withdrawal of benefits any more than they can by -- by

25   direct prohibition.

 6                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

 7                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 8                 MR. GARRE:     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 9   and may it please the Court:

10                 This case was decided by both courts below

11   on the premise, which is not disputed at any point in the

12   petition for certiorari, that Hastings reserves the

13   funding and benefits that go to student groups that

14   obtain school recognition to groups that choose to admit

15   all students

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, then why do

17   you have --

18                 MR. GARRE:     -- regardless of their status or

19   their beliefs.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Why do you have a policy,

21   a written policy -- you don't have a written policy that says

22   anything about all-comers.           You've got a written

23   policy that says you can -- you can't discriminate on

24   the basis of only one type of belief, religious belief.

25                 MR. GARRE:     Mr. Chief Justice, first of all,

 1   this is a case about injunctive relief.                     As a matter of

 2   law, the only policy that's relevant is the current

 3   policy, and that's the one --

 4                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, then why is --

 5                  MR. GARRE:      -- that both sides agree is

 6   in place.

 7                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Is this

 8   nondiscrimination policy no longer on the books?

 9                  MR. GARRE:      No.        It's -- it's the way in which

10   Hastings implements the nondiscrimination policy in this

11   particular forum.     And, again, look at the Ninth Circuit

12   decision in this case.         It's --

13                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            That is not an

14   implementation of the nondiscrimination policy.                     I mean,

15   the two policies are quite different.                     Now, are you

16   telling us that the written policy is no longer

17   operative?

18                  MR. GARRE:      No, it -- Justice Scalia, this

19   is --

20                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            No, what?        No, it's not

21   operative or no, you're not telling me that?

22                  (Laughter.)

23                  MR. GARRE:      It is operative.              This -- the

24   all-comers policy is how it's implemented in this

25   context.     And the written policy applies not only to the

 1   enumerated characteristics; it applies to any arbitrary

 2   unreasonable discrimination, and the law school --

 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, it doesn't --

 4   it doesn't say that.

 5                  MR. GARRE:       It does, Your Honor.             It says in

 6   the first paragraph on -- this is on page 220 --

 7                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Right.

 8                  MR. GARRE:       -- of the Joint Appendix:             The

 9   college is committed to a policy against legally

10   impermissible, arbitrary, or unreasonable discriminatory

11   practices.     And then it also goes on and enumerates

12   specific factors.        And this is spelled out, I believe in

13   page --

14                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So they -- so you're

15   saying the second paragraph is totally

16   unnecessary.     You say the first paragraph says you can't

17   discriminate on any basis, and the second paragraph

18   spells out the bases.          So why do you do have the second

19   paragraph?

20                  MR. GARRE:       I think it provides additional

21   guidance.     But -- but, again, there shouldn't be any

22   debate about what policy is at issue here.                     The Ninth

23   Circuit's decision in this case is two-sentence long.

24   The first sentence describes the policy at issue in this

25   case.     And it says:     "The parties stipulate" --

 1               JUSTICE ALITO:            Do you think this case

 2   deserved a two-sentence decision in the Ninth Circuit?

 3               MR. GARRE:        Justice Alito, it was decided in

 4   the wake of the Ninth Circuit's decision in Truth, which

 5   had not only garnered a substantial panel decision but

 6   had garnered serious consideration on -- on rehearing.

 7   So this case, the Ninth Circuit properly concluded, was

 8   controlled by the Truth decision.                 So in that respect --

 9               JUSTICE ALITO:            So the answer is yes, this case

10   which is -- before us has produced hundreds and hundreds of

11   pages of amicus briefs, deserved two sentences in the

12   court of appeals?

13               MR. GARRE:        In the -- in the sense that it

14   was backed up by the Truth decision, yes.                 But look at

15   the petition for certiorari in this case.                 Nowhere did

16   -- did Petitioners challenge the Ninth Circuit's

17   characterization of the policy at issue.                 The petition

18   says on page 2 that "There are no disputed issues of

19   material fact."

20               JUSTICE ALITO:            But hasn't it been -- hasn't

21   it been CLS's position from the very beginning of this

22   case that Hastings has not in fact required every group

23   to admit any student who applies?                 Don't they say that

24   over and over again in their district court papers, in

25   the court of appeals briefs, and in the cert petition?

 1               MR. GARRE:         If -- if they believe that that

 2   caused the school to adopt a different policy, they

 3   shouldn't have stipulated to the policy that they did.

 4   And they should have challenged at a minimum --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, they stipulated that

 6   the policy exists.      They didn't stipulate that it is --

 7   is being faithfully applied by Hastings.                    What do you do

 8   about the -- the -- the two organizations' bylaws

 9   referred to in the -- in the Petitioner's brief, which

10   clearly do -- conflict with the so-called all-comers

11   policy?

12               MR. GARRE:         All of the bylaws that they've

13   pointed to, Justice Scalia --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:              All of the bylaws --

15               MR. GARRE:         -- that they have pointed to in

16   their brief --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Yes.

18               MR. GARRE:         -- Justice Scalia, either,

19   number one, explicitly say that the organization will

20   comply with the rules and regulations of the school or

21   say that they will admit all students.                    That includes

22   all the bylaws.

23               Now, they have pointed to various things

24   from the bylaws, and this evolved as they've tried to

25   create material factual issues in this Court.                    One of

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the things they've pointed to is the bylaws saying, like

 2   the Outlaw bylaw, that says that students who are

 3   members of a group can be excelled if they -- expelled

 4   if they engage in disruptive or gross misconduct.                   There

 5   is nothing inconsistent about that with the school's

 6   policy.     The school's interest is not in allowing

 7   students to disrupt the activities of students'

 8   groups --

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, they -- they

10   quite -- quote the bylaws of the National Lawyers Guild,

11   which says any member must "agree with the objectives

12   of the organization as set forth herein."                   That's not

13   all-comers.    That's a bylaw that restricts an

14   organization according to its -- members can't join

15   unless they sign on the dotted line that they believe in

16   objectives of the organization.

17                 MR. GARRE:       There's a fundamental

18   difference between a group that says people of a

19   particular sexual orientation are not allowed to become

20   members --

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, they don't say that.

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It has nothing to

23   do with --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            They don't say that.

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It's got nothing to

 1   do with sexual -- well, I don't know the National

 2   Lawyers Guild, but they say you have got to agree with

 3   the objectives of the organization.

 4                MR. GARRE:      Justice Scalia, the district

 5   court made a -- may I?

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, start with mine.

 7                MR. GARRE:      Okay.        My apologies.

 8                (Laughter.)

 9                MR. GARRE:      Mr. Chief Justice, as -- as

10   Dean -- as director of student services testified, the

11   fact that the bylaws may say we want students who are

12   interested in our activities doesn't mean that the

13   bylaws are excluding students who want to join.                 And

14   there's a fundamental difference, again, between saying

15   students that have these particular beliefs or status

16   cannot become members of our group --

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                It seems to me that

18   your position is continually evolving wherever the First

19   Amendment pressure comes.          You've got a written

20   nondiscrimination policy.          And then you say, well, yes,

21   but we use an all-comers policy.               You've got an

22   all-comers policy, and then groups don't actually follow

23   the all-comers policy, and you have another answer to

24   that.   It seems to me that we should go with -- why

25   shouldn't we go with the written policy and the written

 1   bylaws?

 2                MR. GARRE:      Well, with respect, Your Honor,

 3   I think it's my friend's position that is evolving.                     You

 4   have joint stipulations before you as to what the policy

 5   is.   You have the decisions of both courts below

 6   describing that policy consistently with the joint

 7   stipulations, and you have a petition for certiorari

 8   that never challenges that the all-comers policy is at

 9   issue.

10                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             What do we do with the

11   selective application argument, which is what

12   Justice Alito referred to and Justice Scalia, which is

13   it is troubling that some of these bylaws do limit their

14   groups?   La Raza limited it to people of Hispanic

15   descent, and the Lawyers Guild to people who adopt its

16   -- its beliefs.   What are we going to do with this

17   selective application argument?

18                MR. GARRE:      This case wasn't --

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             It's in the case, isn't

20   it?   And if it is, what does it do to your policy?

21                MR. GARRE:      Justice Sotomayor, this case

22   wasn't litigated as a pretext case.                     If you look at the

23   briefs in this case, the first time that the word

24   "pretext" is used is in the reply brief in this Court.

25   It was litigated as a challenge, which is a serious

 1   challenge, to the constitutionality of an all-comers

 2   policy in this particular forum.

 3                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            The -- the two are connected,

 4   though, Mr. Garre.      Frankly, one reason why I am

 5   inclined to think this is pretextual is that it is so

 6   weird to require the -- the campus Republican Club to

 7   admit Democrats, not just to membership, but to

12                  MR. GARRE:      But --

13                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            And is there any other

14   university in the country that has this kind of a

15   policy?

16                  MR. GARRE:      There absolutely is, Justice

17   Scalia, and it's explained --

18                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Where is that?

19                  MR. GARRE:      It's explained

20   in the amicus brief for the American Council of

21   Education, explained in the State Universities amicus

22   brief.

23                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, there are very few

24   universities.     But why doesn't this just all work out?

 1   not so sure why people that don't agree with them want

 2   to belong to them.      What -- doesn't this all just work

 3   out?

 4                MR. GARRE:        Justice Kennedy --

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And doesn't it work out that

 6   the Democrats -- they don't want to go in the Republican

 7   club and run for officership anyway.

 8                MR. GARRE:        Hastings --

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             So why -- what's --

10   what interest does this -- does the school have in this

11   policing mechanism that it's imposing?

12                MR. GARRE:        A few -- a number of things,

13   Justice Kennedy.   The first is the line-drawing issue

14   that has been made clear during the first part of the

15   argument this morning.         If you're going -- they appear

16   to take off the table race and what they say are other

17   status considerations.         I'm not sure why that excludes

18   sexual orientation.

19                But if you're going to allow religious

20   groups, or any group, to draw exceptions for some

21   people, then you have to determine where to draw the

22   line.   And I think a school can reasonably say:                We

23   don't want to get into this business at all; we want to

24   allow all comers

25                JUSTICE ALITO:            But you now say --

 1                MR. GARRE:      -- for all school-subsidized groups.

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:          You now say in your brief that

 3   it is okay for a group to impose membership requirements

 4   that are neutral and not based on beliefs.                Isn't that right?

 5                MR. GARRE:      That doesn't go to status or

 6   belief.    If you're talking about attendance

 7   requirements or competition --

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, you're talking

 9   about --

10                MR. GARRE:      -- those are merits-based

11   requirements.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- La Raza background.

13   As I understand it, the La Raza organization says you have

14   to be of La Raza background to be a policy member of the

15   organization.

16                MR. GARRE:      The La Raza bylaws -- first of

17   all, they did explicitly say that groups could not

18   exclude members on the basis of sexual orientation.

19                Now, they -- there was some confusion about

20   how La Raza had interpreted their bylaws.                The school

21   went back to La Raza and said:              Are you excluding

22   members?   La Raza said:       No, we're not; we're open to

23   all.   And to eliminate any doubt, they amended their

24   bylaws.    That's the one example they've come up in the

25   20-year history of this policy.               And what does it show?

 1   If you want to look at --

 2                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Wait, wait, wait.   Twenty

 3   years?    Do you have any evidence that this policy, the

 4   one we're arguing about now, that is to say, the

 5   all-comers policy, existed before CLS brought this

 6   litigation?     As I recall, the only evidence in the

 7   record is a letter from the dean describing this policy

 8   after the litigation began.

 9                  MR. GARRE:      Justice Scalia, it's based on

10   the sworn deposition testimony on the former dean, who

11   had been at the school since 1993, the director of

12   student services, who had been there at least since

13   1999, as this is how they had implemented the

14   nondiscrimination policy.            I don't think there's any

15   basis for this Court to overturn that sworn testimony.

16                  JUSTICE BREYER:           What we have is a rule, a

17   stipulation.     And as I read it, to try to make sense out

18   of it, it does seem to discriminate against

19   organizations in respect to which intellectual purity

20   would be important.       They're going to have a harder

21   time.    The ones that don't care that much will have an

22   easier time.

23                  Now, in trying to judge the

24   constitutionality of that, I first have no idea which

25   these organizations are.           We've got one of them, but

 1   there may be a lot of others.             I don't know if the

 2   Democratic Club is or is not.             I don't know how big the

 3   tent they want.   I don't know whether the Turkish

 4   Society even exists.      I don't know how the chess club

 5   feels about players of tiddlywinks.

 6                (Laughter.)

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:            So I have an absolute void

 8   in this record, which in turn I think would be important

 9   to fill that void, because their justification --

10                MR. GARRE:      Well --

11                JUSTICE BREYER:            -- is they don't want to get

12   into this, it's too complicated, and we're not

13   doing that much harm to them because they can meet

14   off-campus, and it's a big, disruptive influence, all of

15   these things.

16                And then sneaking in here is this anti-gay

17   bias issue, and -- and they want to say:                That isn't

18   much, because that isn't really the point here, and

19   that's what we think, anyway.             It's just an example of

20   something.

21                So with that great unclarity, asked to

22   decide a constitutional issue where I feel I'd need more

23   facts and I don't have them --

24                MR. GARRE:      Well, you --

25                JUSTICE BREYER:            -- the more justification to

 1   know what it really is, which I don't have, what should

 2   I do?

 3                  MR. GARRE:      If the Court believes that,

 4   respectfully, we think it should dismiss the writ as

 5   improvidently granted.         This case was litigated based on

 6   stipulations to avoid precisely these factual issues

 7   that we're now talking about for the first time before

 8   this Court.

 9                  Now, I think it is common ground that --

10                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But you -- Mr. Garre, you

11   did say that the evidence is the dean's deposition.

12   There's no prior evidence.             But there are schools,

13   including law schools, that have this policy.                      Is that

14   not so?

15                  MR. GARRE:      That's true.               Georgetown Law

16   School does.     Columbia Law School.                Look, there's an

17   amicus brief filed by 13 educational organizations

18   representing thousands of colleges and universities

19   across the country, including the Association of Jesuit

20   Colleges and Universities, saying that this is a

21   not-uncommon and a reasonable policy.                     We're not saying

22   it's the only approach that colleges can take in

23   balancing the competing interests here.

24                  JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, let's explore --

25                  MR. GARRE:      We're saying it's a

 1   constitutional --

 2               JUSTICE ALITO:            Let's explore the

 3   implications of this policy.             Suppose at a particular

 4   campus there is a great deal of anti-Muslim animus.

 5   And there's a small Muslim group; it has 10 students.

 6   If the group is required to accept anybody who applies

 7   for membership, and 50 students who hate Muslims show up

 8   and they want to take over that group, you say the First

 9   Amendment allows that?

10               MR. GARRE:        Justice Alito, that's the

11   claim, obviously, that the other side is making.                  And,

12   with respect, this example has never happened at

13   Hastings in 20 years.       It has really never happened in

14   the history of American education.                  If you look at cases

15   like the voter I.D. case, the partial-birth abortion

16   case --

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So if you have a law

18   that says every newspaper that's published in the

19   United States must be reviewed every day by the

20   government's censor board, and the fact that the

21   government's censor board decides not to do it, then

22   that law is okay?

23               MR. GARRE:        I think this Court would

24   ordinarily take into account the likelihood that

25   something would happen, and if you're dealing where the

 1   only experience --

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                A newspaper sues

 3   saying that law is constitutional, and we'll say it's

 4   all right; it has never been applied?

 5                MR. GARRE:       Of course this Court is going to

 6   examine the chill, but so -- just like in the voter I.D. case,

 7   where you had had people saying this was going to and,

 8   on secondhand accounts, did exclude people from getting

 9   to the -- ballot access.         This Court said, look, that might

10   happen, but it's not a basis to invalidate this law

11   across the board.    Come back with an as-applied challenge.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That was because

13   they might adopt a different policy.                  We're not dealing

14   with a future different policy in this case.

15                MR. GARRE:       And there's -- as to the

16   takeover hypothetical, there is no evidence that it has

17   happened.    Groups can take measures to prevent it.               They

18   can require attendance requirements before people become

19   members.    They can instruct into their bylaws --

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That's not going to

21   help if you have the 50 anti-Muslim students who want to

22   take over the group.

23                MR. GARRE:       People have to be -- attend a

24   certain number of meetings before they can join.                 They can

25   have --

 1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Okay.   They take

 2   over the group and the first thing they do is say we're

 3   abolishing the attendance policy.

 4                  (Laughter.)

 5                  MR. GARRE:      They can have in their -- they

 6   can -- sure.     I mean, we can entertain the

 7   hypotheticals.     But they can have in their bylaws a

 8   provision just like the Constitution of the United

 9   States, that amendments can only be made by a

10   super-majority --

11                  JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, CLS obviously thinks

12   this is a real threat.         Now, what do you propose that

13   they do?   Suppose that you win this case, and then when

14   the case -- and then when this all-applicants policy is

15   administered, then precisely what they fear begins to

16   take place.    Do they have any recourse?

17                  MR. GARRE:      I think if that started to take

18   place, the college would reconsider its policy.                    It

19   could bring a First Amendment challenge saying that --

20                  JUSTICE ALITO:          No, do they have any --

21                  MR. GARRE:      -- that would --

22                  JUSTICE ALITO:          Do they have any recourse?

23                  MR. GARRE:      I think at that point --

24                  JUSTICE ALITO:          If they have 10 members,

25   and 8 who are completely hostile to the organization

 1   sign up?

 2                 MR. GARRE:       I think obviously the members

 3   would rejoin and form another group, Your Honor.                       I

 4   mean, we're not dealing with this in a factual vacuum.

 5   CLS's predecessor existed at the schools for 10 years

 6   and in --

 7                 JUSTICE ALITO:           I understand the answer to

 8   that question.    So, if -- if hostile members take over

 9   CLS, the former members of CLS can form CLS II?

10                 (Laughter.)

11                 MR. GARRE:       If that happened Your Honor.                   I

12   mean, this has never happened ever in -- in the history

13   of --

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             It's also the --

15                 MR. GARRE:       -- education.

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- the university's

17   across-the-board rules for all student conduct against

18   disruption, against incivility.                 The list would certainly

19   carry over.

20                 MR. GARRE:       Absolutely.                And CLS, like any

21   group, can have a rule that disruptive members should be

22   expelled.

 1   from, what I can tell, that someone who disagrees with

 2   this group has applied for membership.

 3                MR. GARRE:       Well, Your Honor, the record

 4   does show that --

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I mean, that's -- that's

 6   what so puzzling about the -- the case.

 7                MR. GARRE:       The record does show, Your

 8   Honor, that there was a gay student who was a member of

 9   the group.   And that's -- let me give you that --

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That was the predecessor

11   group.

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            The predecessor group --

13                MR. GARRE:       That was the predecessor group.

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- and obviously uncomfortable

15   with their position, so he or she left.

16                MR. GARRE:       Well, actually --

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            That's the way it works.

18                MR. GARRE:       -- what the record shows is that

19   she participated in discussions that the officer of the

20   group said it was a joy to have her and that both sides

21   learned.

22                I think CLS's position depends on the dark

23   notion that students would not have any interest in

24   joining a group with different viewpoints on certain

25   issues except to disrupt that group.                     And I think that

 1   greatly undersells the intellectual curiosity of

 2   students.   It greatly undersells the fact that groups

 3   have many different interests and perspectives.

 4               The church has a stance in homosexuality,

 5   but it has stances on many other issues, too.             And if a

 6   student -- even if he or she disagrees with the stance on

 7   homosexuality, they may agree with many other aspects of

 8   the groups, and they may want to join in the fellowship of

 9   that group, they want to take advantage of intangible

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:             You have to let them teach

15   Bible classes, too, right?

16               MR. GARRE:       In fact, the record in the --

17   case shows that only officers teach Bible classes,

18   and groups are perfectly free to structure their

19   organization like that.        They can have requirements

20   that people attend certain meetings before they do that.

21   CLS isn't forced to have anyone lead Bible classes.

22               JUSTICE ALITO:           If an orthodox --

23               MR. GARRE:       CLS --

25   or a Muslim group applied for recognition and the group

 1   said part of our beliefs is -- one of our beliefs is that

 2   men and women should sit separately at religious services,

 3   would Hastings deny registration to that group?

 4                MR. GARRE:      If it was excluding students

 5   from that group on the basis of their beliefs or their

 6   status, then, yes, it would.

 7                Hastings isn't in the business of

 8   second-guessing the -- the beliefs of -- of individual

 9   groups, and the whole point of the policy really is to

10   stay out of this, to just have a blanket rule that's

11   equally neutral.

12                JUSTICE ALITO:          We have -- we have two amicus

13   briefs from orthodox Jewish groups and a brief from a

14   Muslim group.   So, your answer is that they could not be

15   recognized under Hastings' policy because of their

16   religious beliefs regarding the way religious services

17   should be conducted?

18                MR. GARRE:      Your Honor, I think even my

19   friend recognizes that a group could not exclude an

20   individual on the basis of their gender or their

21   beliefs -- on the basis of their gender or race.

22   And remember the Bob Jones case, this Court --

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, but that's because

24   gender or race is fundamentally different from religious

25   brief.   Gender and race is a status.                   Religious belief --

 1   it has to be based on the fundamental notion that we are

 2   not open to everybody.         We have beliefs, you have to

 3   subscribe to them.      And we've always regarded that as

 4   a good thing.   That type of exclusion is supported in --

 5   in the Constitution.        The other types of exclusion are

 6   not.

 7                MR. GARRE:        But not at all costs,

 8   Mr. Chief Justice.      In the Bob Jones case, the claim was

 9   from a -- a small private religious school that has a

10   sincere religious belief that people who believed in

11   interracial dating should not become members of their

12   school.   And this Court, nevertheless, held that that

13   belief, sincere as it was, did not trump a statute that

14   denied education -- denied Federal financial assistance

15   on a viewpoint-neutral basis to schools that

16   discriminated on the basis of religion.

17                Here we have a -- a group that wants to

18   exclude members on the basis of sexual orientation.                   We

19   can -- CLS has tried to change that part --

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  You phrase it that

21   way.   It's a group that wants to exclude -- a religious

22   group, a religious-oriented group, that wants to exclude

23   people who do not subscribe to their religious beliefs.

24                MR. GARRE:        They -- there is a binding

25   judicial admission.       And, again, this gets back to the

 1   Bob Jones example.      I think --

 2                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Where -- yes, let's get back

 3   to this homosexual orientation.                 You say that that's

 4   established in the case.

 5                  MR. GARRE:      Look at page -- J.A. page 460,

 6   which is where the district court said that CLS made

 7   a binding judicial admission that they wanted to

 8   discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.                       Keep

 9   in mind that this case began because CLS came back to

10   the law school and said we're happy to say we won't

11   discriminate on some grounds, but we're not going to

12   say we won't exclude students on the basis of sexual

13   orientation.

14                  JUSTICE BREYER:            What's supposed to happen?

15   I don't know the answer to this.                 Hastings, let's say,

16   or Berkeley has four or five or six different religious

17   chapels for services on Sunday or Saturday, and they say

18   we're open to all branches of religion, orthodox Jews,

19   conservative, and reformed.               And then the orthodox say

20   we want men and women to sit separately.

21                  Now, can Hastings say or Berkeley, no, we'll

22   let the reform come, we'll let the conservatives come,

23   but not the -- not the orthodox Jews.                     They can't

24   have their service.       Would -- would that be

25   constitutional?

 1               MR. GARRE:      Your Honor, I think it would be

 2   a much different case.      It --

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes, but what is your opinion?

 4               MR. GARRE:      I -- I think if the school is

 5   regulating outside of the purposes of a limited forum,

 6   public forum for recognized groups, then I doubt it

 7   could go in --

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:           So if, in fact, the --

 9   the --

10               MR. GARRE:      -- and tell the groups --

11               JUSTICE BREYER:           -- they have clubs and they're

12   not services, and what they do is they discuss -- they

13   discuss the -- the nature of the service, and there can

14   they have separate discussions --

15               MR. GARRE:      Where -- where --

16               JUSTICE BREYER:           -- men from -- men and

17   women?

18               MR. GARRE:      Where the rule operates on a

19   viewpoint-neutral basis.        Here what the -- the school is

20   doing is it is publicly subsidizing --

21               JUSTICE BREYER:           I guess your answer to that

22   is the orthodox Jews cannot.           They cannot have

23   separate women's groups in their organization, which is

24   an after religious school organization.

25               MR. GARRE:      They can exist separately.         At

 1   the school we have are numerous --

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Outside of the university,

 3   et cetera.

 4                 MR. GARRE:      In fact, Your Honor, it's not --

 5   it's not --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, that's their problem here.

 7                 MR. GARRE:      -- unusual for schools to have

 8   all male or all women clubs.             They are not recognized

 9   parts of the community.         These -- these are activities

10   that are subsidized by the students themselves through the

11   mandatory student activities fees.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:            And their reason to put in

13   a sentence as to why they don't want these orthodox Jews

14   to meet separately on the campus -- men in one group,

15   women in another -- and discuss the religious service

16   -- they want none like that, and their reason for wanting

17   none like that is?

18                 MR. GARRE:      Well, I think that's a much

19   different example than this case --

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, I'm trying to make it

21   as close as possible.

22                 MR. GARRE:      Well, I -- I may have

 1   club.

 2               MR. GARRE:       The reason why the school has a

 3   policy that all groups that it subsidizes must admit

 4   all-comers is that, number one, it ensures that all

 5   students enjoy equal access to all school-subsidized and

 6   school-recognized activities.

 7               Number two, it avoids the line-drawing

 8   problems that we've discussed early this morning and I

 9   think are necessarily going to arise and also create

10   strife in small educational communities.

11               Number three, it allows --

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Can I ask about number 2,

13   the -- the so-called line-drawing problem?                 Aren't you

14   just letting yourself into even more line-drawing

15   problems?

16               MR. GARRE:       Not with the all-comers rule.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:           I mean, the other -- it's

18   whether you were discriminating on the basis of one of

19   the forbidden bases.      But now you're saying you can't

20   discriminate on any basis, which means there're going

21   to be even more lines to have to draw.                 Why does it

22   solve your problem?

23               MR. GARRE:       I don't think it -- that

24   happens at all, Justice Scalia.              I think when you've

25   the policy that all students have to become members,

 1   regardless of their status or belief, that gets the

 2   school out of the business of determining whether,

 3   number one, people are discriminating on the basis of an

 4   essential belief, which is, is the way that Petitioner

 5   describes his -- their rule.

 6               JUSTICE ALITO:          As I understood the

 7   position, your latest position in your brief, you

 8   really don't say you have an all-comers policy.                  There

 9   are certain criteria that can be applied, like interest,

10   knowledge; is that correct?

11               MR. GARRE:      Competitive-based, merit-based

12   requirements are not excluded.             It -- they're

13   not --

14               JUSTICE ALITO:          Could a -- well, could a

15   group, consistent with your revised all-comers policy,

16   require that members who want -- anyone who wants to

17   become a member show a particular level of knowledge

18   about the subject of the group?

19               MR. GARRE:      Yes.       And I think --

20               JUSTICE ALITO:          So if the CLS required

21   anybody who wanted to become a member to pass a test on

22   the Bible, that would be okay?

23               MR. GARRE:      If it were truly an objective

24   knowledge test, it would be okay.               It would be no

25   different than the law review.             These are merits-based

 1   determinations.     There's a fundamental difference

 2   between excluding people on the basis of merit and

 3   excluding people on the basis of status or belief that

 4   has no connection to merit.               That -- that, I think, is a

 5   long-standing understanding of discrimination.

 6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, that --

 7   that -- that's pretty tough.              That has no connection to

 8   merit.     I assume there are groups that think subscribing

 9   to their beliefs is evidence of merit, particularly

10   religious groups.     So, how can you have a -- a test that

11   allows distinctions based on merit but not -- not

12   beliefs?

13                  MR. GARRE:      I think it goes to the nature of

14   whether it's discrimination under the school's policy,

15   and I think status or belief.               People understand -- that's

16   why we are talking about things like race or gender or

17   sexual orientation, disability, military status, any

18   number of these things.          And I think the school's policy

19   avoids having to draw lines as to whether or not a group

20   has a sufficient enough belief that military members

21   should become a member of the Amnesty International club

22   because they disagree with the war, that disabled

23   members should be -- disabled students should be a

24   member of a particular group.               And the school's policy

25   avoids these line-drawing --

 4   Mr. Garre?

 6                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask one question?

 7   I'd like you to answer, and I'd like your opponent, too:

 8   Do you think that, in order to decide this case, we have

 9   to pass on the constitutionality of an all-comers policy?

10                  MR. GARRE:      Yes, that's the policy before

11   this Court.

12                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           That we must do that to decide

13   the case?     And I want to ask your opponent the same

14   question.

15                  MR. GARRE:      I believe you have to do that,

16   because that is the policy --

17                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           So they're all --

18                  MR. GARRE:      -- before this Court.

19                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           There may be a lot of

20   other things we can decide, but in all events, we must

21   decide that much?

22                  MR. GARRE:      Absolutely.                Absolutely.   If I

23   could just discuss briefly the --

25   quick question relating to that?

 1                  If -- if an all-comers policy is adopted for

 2   the purpose of discriminating on the basis of viewpoint,

 3   does it violate the First Amendment?

 4                  MR. GARRE:      If it's pretextual in the Church

 5   of Lukumi Babalu Aye sense, yes.                 No -- no school can

 6   purposely discriminate at a group, no matter what policy

 7   it adopts.

 8                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And what if we think that

 9   the policy has not been evenhandedly applied?                 Can't we

10   decide the case on that basis, and then we could just

11   assume arguendo Justice -- the answer to Justice

12   Stevens' question.

13                  MR. GARRE:      I don't think so, Justice --

14   Justice Kennedy, because that --

15                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is -- was there any proof

16   in this record?     I mean, there's a stipulation for summary

17   judgment.     Was there any proof showing that it wasn't

18   evenly applied?

19                  MR. GARRE:      No.        And I get back to the

20   petition for certiorari.           On page 2 of the petition, the

21   petition --

22                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Let me just say, suppose

23   it were shown that it were not applied evenhandedly, you'd

24   have no problem with our saying that it's then

25   unconstitutional.

 1               MR. GARRE:       It -- yes.            We don't think that

 2   that's the case here.       But if a policy is applied

 3   evenhandedly -- unevenhandedly, in a viewpoint-neutral

 4   way and it burdens religious groups, then there's

 5   common ground that that policy violates the

 6   Constitution.    Of course, we think the policy here is --

 7               JUSTICE ALITO:           If this were an employment

 8   case, and when an employee is denied promotion the

 9   employee said it's for reason A, and then after

10   litigation begins the employer says, well, no, it really

11   wasn't for reason A, it was for reason B because of a

12   policy that we've long had, but there's never --

13   there's no written documentation of this new policy;

14   and then at a later point in the litigation the employer

15   says, well, it wasn't really either for reason A or

16   reason B; it was for reason C -- do you think that summary

17   judgment could be granted in favor of the employer on

18   the issue of pretext?

19               MR. GARRE:       I think that that would create a

20   factual issue and that that issue might well be tried,

21   Justice Alito.

22               And the one thing that is important to keep in

23   mind is that this is a request for injunctive relief and not

25   Austin makes this clear -- is the current policy; all

 1   parties agree that the current policy is the all-comers

 2   policy.   That's the policy supported by the record in

 3   this case.

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, I'm sorry.   All

 5   parties do not agree that the policy is the all-comers

 6   policy.   Your friend argued repeatedly that the policy

 7   was the written nondiscrimination policy.

 8                MR. GARRE:      I understood my friend's opening

 9   brief to acknowledge at the least that that's the policy

10   the school has said it has today.                It is the school's

11   policy.   It's supported by substantial history and

12   sworn deposition testimony.

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Garre, the -- the

14   so-called written policy, that has a -- that list has a

15   correspondence to the State's law, doesn't it?

16                MR. GARRE:      It does.

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The categories that are

18   listed there are the categories that under California

19   law are proscribed bases for discrimination?

20                MR. GARRE:      It does.          And that is an

21   additional basis for the school's policy.                 Look at

22   California Education Code 66270.               It explicitly

23   prohibits discrimination in -- in programs and

24   educational activities by public schools like Hastings.

25   Hastings has an obligation under State law to prohibit


                                       57

 1   discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.                 The

 2   reason why we're here today is because CLS insisted

 3   on the right to discriminate, to exclude students on the

 4   basis of their sexual orientation.

 5               JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, section 66270 applies

 6   to programs conducted by a post-secondary educational

 7   institution, and your position is that if -- if a

 8   religious group complies with your policies and then it

 9   conducts religious services, those religious services

10   are conducted by Hastings?

11               MR. GARRE:       Our position is that the

12   registered student organization program is a program

13   of the university; it's subsidized by the university;

14   it's recognized by the university; and that all students

15   should be able to enjoy access to that program.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 In your response to

17   Justice Ginsburg concerning California law, is it your

18   position that California law requires religious groups

19   to admit people who do not believe in their religious

20   beliefs and in fact to conduct services of that group?

21               MR. GARRE:       Your Honor, our position is that

22   the provision that we've cited to, 66270, does not carve

23   out an exemption in this program for a religious student

24   organization.   On its face --

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So the answer to my

 1   question is "yes"?

 2                 MR. GARRE:       Yes.       On its face, it excludes --

 3   it has an exemption for religious schools; it does not

 4   include an exemption for religious organizations within

 5   the context of this program.              And we think that the

 6   program is reasonable.

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, Mr.

 8   Garre.

 9                 MR. GARRE:       Thank you very much.

12              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL

13                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14                  MR. McCONNELL:          Well, thank you,

15   Mr. Chief Justice.

16                 First, in answer to Justice Stevens'

17   question, we do believe that the Court needs to

18   reach the constitutionality of the all-comers policy as

19   applied to CLS in this case.              We brought only an

20   as-applied challenge.

21                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Put -- put to a side a

22   moment -- forget the as-applied.                 Just take a -- a pure

23   all-comers policy.      Must we decide the constitutionality

24   of that?

25                 MR. McCONNELL:           Not facially, but as applied


                                         59

 1   to CLS, yes.   Several other points, I know --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Could you talk about -- I had

 3   understood from your brief that CLS did not have a -- a

 4   policy of excluding people with homosexual disposition,

 5   but that it was only homosexual conduct.

 6                MR. McCONNELL:          That's correct as

 7   stipulated to, undisputed.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, you -- but your

 9   complaint said otherwise.          Your -- your --

10                MR. McCONNELL:          That's -- that's because we

11   -- the complaint is accepting the -- Hastings'

12   definition of sexual orientation.                We were told that our

13   conduct rule, our nonmarital conduct rule, violated their

14   sexual orientation provision, and therefore we sought

15   relief from their sexual orientation provision.                It was

16   nothing more than that.

17                There -- it is -- it is stipulated in Joint

18   Stipulation 40, I believe it is, that -- that CLS's rule

19   is based on conduct --

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Oh, okay.

21                MR. McCONNELL:          -- not orientation.

22                Several other points:               My friend twice in

23   his presentation stated that the all-comers policy is

24   simply their way of implementing the nondiscrimination

25   policy.   But if so, it is so absurdly overbroad as to be


                                       60

 1   unconstitutional.    There is no reason to stop the

 2   environmentalist club from leading -- from requiring its

 3   leaders to share environmentalist views --

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. McConnell --

 5                MR. McCONNELL:           -- in order to --

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. McConnell, you don't

 7   challenge that there are universities, including four

 8   law schools, that have an all-comers policy?

 9                MR. McCONNELL:           So far as we've been able

10   to tell, there is no public university law school in the

11   country that has such a policy.

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             There are private

13   universities.

14                MR. McCONNELL:           There are some private

15   universities that, according to the AALS, have such a

16   policy.   We know nothing about them.                    They are not in

17   the record, and, frankly, I'd be a little bit

18   surprised, because the policy is so absurd.

19                Think of how it would apply to the law

20   school itself, and this policy does apply to the law

21   school itself.   Does Hastings really mean to say it is

22   committing itself to an all-comers policy when it hires

23   faculty or admits students?             Do they not care about the

24   belief of its dean of admissions, about beliefs of --

25   about, say, affirmative action?                The very idea of it is

 1   preposterous.

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:           It's not totally, if -- but

 3   it's imaginary, it's fantastical.               The -- you could imagine

 4   a school in the '60s that said that we think the way to

 5   advance learning is everyone gets together in a nice

 6   discussion group and hugs each other and talks, all

 7   right?

 8               (Laughter.) 


 9               JUSTICE BREYER:           Now, that's a possible 


10   educational theory.

11               MR. McCONNELL:          It's possible, but --

12               JUSTICE BREYER:           They say that we are going to

13   apply that to everybody because that's how we do it.               And --

14               MR. McCONNELL:          Yes, but Hastings has --

15               JUSTICE BREYER:           -- if there are any

16   ideological organizations that suffer --

17               MR. McCONNELL:          But Hastings has --

18               JUSTICE BREYER:           -- so be it, but it's

19   fantastical, and therefore --

20               MR. McCONNELL:          Hastings has a perfectly

21   conventional RSO program just like the ones in Healy,

22   and Widmar and Rosenberger.           They just have a policy

23   that is destructive of that --

24               JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, my --


25               MR. McCONNELL:          -- of that program.

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:            -- my question is, if I can

 2   think of this policy -- but I tend to sympathize with

 3   your view that it's so hard to believe that they really

 4   hold it, maybe they do, I don't know about it -- what do

 5   I do with this case?

 6                How can I say whether this, let's call it

 7   "hug your neighbor policy" is -- to put a label on it

 8   that's catchy --

 9                MR. McCONNELL:          What can --

10                JUSTICE BREYER:            -- how do I -- how do I

11   evaluate that?

12                MR. McCONNELL:          What you can say is that

13   Healy v. James requires a substantial justification for

14   exclusion of a student group from a registered student

15   activity forum, and this is not a substantial

16   justification; it is a silly justification.                 If it is

17   silly, crazy, and preposterous, it is not even reasonable,

18   let alone compelling or substantial.
