 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Case 06-11429, Burgess versus

 5   United States.

 6                 Mr. Fisher.

 7                     ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

 8                          ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                 MR. FISHER:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10   and may it please the Court:

11                 The rule of lenity requires that any penal

12   statute the government seeks to enforce against an

13   individual must clearly and unambiguous apply to him

14   and, as the government acknowledges its brief in this

15   case, this Court has applied the rule of lenity in

16   numerous recent cases involving mandatory sentencing

17   provisions.    A reaffirmation of that time-honored

18   principle is all that is necessary to decide this case.

19                 The 20-year mandatory --

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Is it time-honored since

21   Granderson?    Is that the first time we did it?

22                 MR. FISHER:       Well, the rule of lenity has

23   been --

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           As to sentences?      As to

25   sentences?


                                         3

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              MR. FISHER:           As to sentencing?              No, in the

 2   mid-20th century, Justice Kennedy, in the Bell decision

 3   written by Justice Frankfurter and in Ladner, both

 4   involved the degree of punishment which the defendant

 5   would receive.     There are other cases:                   In 1980 the

 6   Simpson case, and Bifulco around the same time.                      So this

 7   Court has a history of applying the rule of lenity with

 8   equal force to sentencing provisions as it does to

 9   statutes demarcating criminal conduct or not.                      And of

10   course, as the green brief specially highlights, the

11   very essence and the core of the rule of lenity derives

12   from the English common law, which is -- which was

13   designed to invoke the rule of lenity to avoid mandatory

14   punishment, not -- not so much whether conduct was

15   criminal or not.

16              So we think that applying that rule in a

17   straightforward manner to this case requires a reversal.

18   The 20-year mandatory minimum in Section 841(b)(1)(A)

19   applies only to defendants who have a prior conviction

20   for a, quote, "felony drug offense."                      Now, a sensible

21   reading of that provision is that a State law

22   misdemeanor simply does not constitute a felony drug

23   offense.

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, but if the

25   rule of lenity depends upon of course some ambiguity in


                                          4

 1   the term, the definition says "'felony drug offense'

 2   means an offense that is punishable by imprisonment for

 3   more than 1 year."      It doesn't say anything about State

 4   classification.

 5                 MR. FISHER:        That's right, Mr. Chief

 6   Justice, and if that's all you had on the statute books

 7   this might be an easier case.               But as you know, I think,

 8   above section 44 and section 13 the term "felony" is

 9   described and defined as "a crime that is classified as

10   a felony under Federal or State law."                     And so when you

11   start with section 841(b)(1)(A), which uses the term

12   "felony drug offense," and you go to the definitional

13   section, the first thing you come to is the definition

14   of felony, which says a crime classified as such.                     And

15   then, as you say, in section 44 you reach another

16   definition.    So we think that at the very least you have

17   an ambiguity here in which Congress has given two

18   facially applicable definitions to the operative

19   provision of the statute.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, obviously one

21   is a definition of "felony" and the other is the

22   definition of "felony drug offense" and the term that's

23   at issue here is "felony drug offense."

24                 MR. FISHER:        Well, in a sense it's our

25   position that both are at issue here.                     The term


                                          5

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   "felony," which is within the term "felony drug

 2   offense," is also at issue here.               And as we've pointed

 3   out in pages 11 and 12, 11 and 12 of our yellow brief,

 4   it's not uncommon for Congress to have two separate

 5   definitions one of which is a single term within a

 6   broader term in a statute.          And so the mere fact, as the

 7   government would argue, that the word "felony" is not

 8   repeated in the definition of subsection 44 does not

 9   mean that Congress meant that to be the sole definition.

10               We've given three examples on pages 11 and

11   12 where the sensible reading of the statute is that

12   Congress attempted to nest the definition of a single

13   term within the definition of a broader term.

14               JUSTICE ALITO:          Could I -- could I ask you

15   what you think Congress might have been trying to do

16   with the 1994 amendment under -- under your reading?

17   Before 1994 the offense had to be classified as a

18   felony.   Then they added this definition of "felony drug

19   offense," and as I understand it your reading is that

20   now the offense must be classified as a felony and it

21   must be punishable by more, by imprisonment for more

22   than a year.   What would be the reason for adding this

23   new requirement as you see it, that it be punishable by

24   more than a year, if there were not offenses that were

25   classified by States as felonies but were punishable by


                                        6

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   less than a year?    I can't see the point unless the

 2   point was to rule those out.

 3               And you haven't cited any State statute in

 4   your brief that involved an offense that was classified

 5   as a felony and is punishable by less than a year.                 You

 6   cited a couple that were punishable by exactly a year,

 7   not more than a year but exactly a year.                 So is it your,

 8   your theory that the reason for adding this new language

 9   was to make it clear that those offenses where the

10   maximum was 12 months, as opposed to 12 months and a

11   day, would not be counted?

12               MR. FISHER:         I think there is an agreement

13   between us and the government on this point.                 We cite in

14   our blue brief statutes from Arizona as well as a couple

15   of other States where there are crimes that are

16   classified as felonies but punishable in less than a

17   year.   And in those cases we agree with the government

18   that that is the effect of the 1994 conforming

19   amendments, is to exclude those outlier States that take

20   low-level crimes and nonetheless classify them as

21   felonies.   What this case is about --

22               JUSTICE ALITO:           But if I could just come

23   back to that.   I looked at those.                You cite Ohio, North

24   Carolina, and Arizona and those are all punishable by --

25   they all have a maximum term of 12 months, not less


                                         7

 1   than.   So the difference is between 12 months and 12

 2   months and a day?

 3               MR. FISHER:         Well, that works on the

 4   language of the statute, Justice Alito.

 5               JUSTICE ALITO:           But is it plausible that's

 6   the reason why Congress added this language?               They

 7   didn't want -- they wanted to make sure that these

 8   felonies that were punishable by just 12 months would

 9   not be counted?

10               MR. FISHER:         Well, I think it is quite

11   plausible that the language that Congress added has very

12   little practical effect.          And that flows from the fact

13   that Congress called these nothing more than conforming

14   amendments, so Congress apparently wasn't trying to

15   accomplish any dramatic change here and I think it might

16   help to understand by looking at the other outlier

17   states that the government claims got swept in with the

18   1994 amendments.    We cite statutes from States like

19   Colorado.   Perhaps if I used a concrete example.              Take

20   possession of a single ounce of marijuana.               That is one

21   of the crimes in Arizona that we were just talking

22   about, that is a felony punishable by no more than a

23   year.   There are a few other States who are outliers in

24   a different sense, in which they call these crimes

25   misdemeanors, like the vast majority of States, but make


                                         8

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   them punishable by 18 months or more.

 2                 And so what the government's position is is

 3   that in 1994 when Congress passed a conforming amendment

 4   to exclude a couple of outlier States like Arizona, it

 5   was trying to sweep in for the first time into section

 6   841(b)(1)(A) outlier States like Colorado that treat

 7   low-level drug crimes, low-level drug possession crimes,

 8   as misdemeanors that are punishable by more than a year.

 9                 So we think, for the very reasons the

10   government explains, that Congress is trying to avoid

11   disuniformity and happenstance according to how a few

12   local jurisdictions might treat certain drug crimes,

13   that it makes sense to read the '94 conforming

14   amendments as requiring both the one-year punishment

15   rule and the felony classification requirement.

16                 And if you have any doubt on that, we submit

17   it really makes sense to remember that what we're what

18   talking about here is a mandatory minimum.                    And so --

19                 JUSTICE ALITO:         What would you do with

20   someone who was convicted -- had a prior conviction of

21   -- for importing 10 tons of heroin in New Jersey, for

22   example, where there are no felonies?                    What would you do

23   with that, a very serious drug offense in a State that

24   doesn't use the term "felony" at all or a foreign

25   conviction?

 1              MR. FISHER:        Well, we've cited a case in our

 2   brief in the Second Circuit that deals with that exact

 3   problem, at least with the New Jersey problem.                    And what

 4   the courts did and what they have done in other

 5   circumstances where there's a felony classification

 6   requirement is they simply take the crime in New Jersey

 7   and analogize it to a comparable Federal or local State

 8   crime, and if it was -- if it would be classified as a

 9   felony in that local jurisdiction, then courts -- and

10   this is even before the 1994 amendments -- courts have

11   treated it as a felony.

12              JUSTICE ALITO:          But what they did -- what

13   they did in the Second Circuit case was to say this is

14   punishable -- this offense is punishable by more than a

15   year in New Jersey and therefore it's a felony.

16              MR. FISHER:        I believe, Justice Alito, this

17   was a case before 1994, so that's --

18              JUSTICE ALITO:          I know.             And that's how they

19   analogized it to a felony.

20              MR. FISHER:        Right, because that is the

21   Federal definition of a felony, and so that was the

22   analogy that the Second Circuit was able to draw here

23   and reach what we think is a commonsense way to deal

24   with the unusual problem of New Jersey.                    Another --

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:            You say there are other


                                      10

 1   examples where a -- a noun that is nested in another

 2   definition is separately defined and the two are read

 3   together.     How are those phrased?               I mean, I could

 4   understand what you say if this provision here read "The

 5   term 'felony drug offense' means a felony that is

 6   punishable by imprisonment for more than one year."

 7   Then I'd go back to the "felony" definition for what a

 8   felony means, but it doesn't repeat the "felony."                    "The

 9   term 'felony drug offense' means an offense that is

10   punishable by imprisonment for" -- do any of the

11   examples of nesting that you -- that you bring forward

12   read this way?

13                 MR. FISHER:        All three of them do, Justice

14   Scalia.

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Which ones are they?        Where

16   are they --

17                 MR. FISHER:        They're pages 11 and 12 of the

18   yellow brief.    And so the first place to start is

19   looking at the bottom of page 11, where the term

20   "employee" is defined in one provision of the Federal --

21   of the Federal statutory code.                And then the terms

22   "employee of the Capitol Police," "employee of the House

23   of Representatives" are also defined, and they're

24   defined -- and those broader definitions are in the

25   footnote at the bottom of page 12.                   And so you see that


                                         11

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   there, after having defined the term "employee," the

 2   word "employee" is not repeated in those definitions.

 3   They talk about "a member" or "an officer" or "an

 4   individual."     And so it's much like the circumstance

 5   here, where a more generic term is used in the broader

 6   definition, but it makes sense to read in the original

 7   definition.

 8                 The same thing I think you can see in the

 9   middle of page 12 with the part of the Bankruptcy Code

10   that we've given this Court.              The word "debtor" is

11   defined in a certain way, and then later on in the

12   definitional provision, the term "debtor's principal

13   residence" is defined as "a residential structure" and

14   such and such.    Again the word "debtor" is not repeated

15   in the broader definition, but we think the only way to

16   make sense of it is to import the definition of the

17   single term into the broader term.                   If Congress had

18   wanted --

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Just on that -- just

20   on that last one, are you saying that if it doesn't say

21   "debtor's residential structure," you'd think it was

22   somebody else's residential structure?

23                 MR. FISHER:        Well --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I don't understand

25   the point.

 1                 MR. FISHER:       Well, there might be, you know,

 2   a very rigid plain-text argument that might be made.

 3   The point is that Congress used -- defined the term

 4   "debtor's principal residence" without using the term

 5   "debtor" again and defined it somewhere else.                     My --

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, in a provision

 7   of the Bankruptcy Code that deals with debtors I don't

 8   think there's any question about whose residential

 9   structure they would be talking about, even though they

10   don't repeat "debtor."        It strikes me as quite different

11   than the provision we have before us today.

12                 MR. FISHER:       Well, then I think I'd refer

13   you back to the employee example.                 I mean, no example is

14   going to be exactly on all fours.                 I'm happy to

15   acknowledge that.    The idea that I'm trying to get

16   across is it's not unusual for Congress to define single

17   terms that are nested within larger terms.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           And --

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           -- better example.         It

20   doesn't quite work because it does not supersede the

21   term "debtor" that was used earlier.                     In the

22   government's submission at least in this case, "felony

23   drug offense" supersedes the earlier provision in

24   section 13.

25                 MR. FISHER:       I think that's right.             And I

 1   think one way to --

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So it seems to me they're

 3   not comparable in that sense.

 4                 MR. FISHER:        Okay.        I think one way to

 5   understand how this statute -- if Congress had wanted to

 6   do what the government says it wanted to do, how

 7   Congress could have made it absolutely clear -- while we

 8   have the yellow brief open, we can look at page 13.

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             May I ask you a question

10   before going on with this line?                You say that both the

11   802(13) definition has to be satisfied and the 44

12   definition, right?      But was 802(13) ever applicable to

13   this situation?    What was the law prior to the 1994

14   amendment?    There was a section, wasn't there, that

15   defined "felony drug offense"?

16                 MR. FISHER:        For a time, yes, Justice

17   Ginsburg, but -- so when the statute was originally

18   passed, 802(13) was the sole definition of "felony," and

19   then somewhere along the line between the original

20   enactment and the '94 amendments, a definition of

21   "felony drug offense" was put into 841(b)(1)(A) --

22                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Right.

23                 MR. FISHER:        -- but that itself just used

24   the word "felony," which again referred the reader back

25   to 802(13).    So, again, I think there is an agreement

 1   between --

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Would you take a look at

 3   that provision that was in 841(b)(1)?                       Because it seems

 4   that it would be duplicative of 802(13).

 5                 MR. FISHER:        Are you looking, Justice

 6   Ginsburg, at the 1988 version of the statute?

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Yes.

 8                 MR. FISHER:        No, because --

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Where would we find this?

10                 MR. FISHER:        Oh, this is at 13a of the blue

11   brief, Justice Scalia.

12                 So, at page 13a it says, "For purposes of

13   this subparagraph, the term 'felony drug offense' means

14   an offense that is a felony under any provision of this

15   subchapter, under any Federal law."                       Now, the word

16   "felony" again would have referred the reader back to

17   802(13).     If I understand --

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But read -- read the end

19   of it.     Read on where it says, "or a felony under any

20   law of a State or foreign country," et cetera.

21                 MR. FISHER:        Right.        But I think, again, the

22   word "felony" as it appears in -- in that provision --

23   and I think that the government agrees with us on this

24   -- would have referred the reader back to 802(13) as of

25   1988 --

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, what --

 2                MR. FISHER:       -- because there isn't the

 3   explicit classification requirement.

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But it defines what the

 5   felony is:   "A felony under any law of a State or

 6   foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct

 7   relating to narcotic drugs, marijuana," et cetera.

 8                MR. FISHER:       Well, I think the latter

 9   language, Justice Ginsburg, is defining --

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Why would you need to

11   look --

12                MR. FISHER: -- "drug offense," whereas the

13   word "felony" I think is not a self-defining term in

14   that statute as it's written.             And to understand whether

15   we're talking about something like a one-year rule or a

16   classification requirement, the reader needs to go back

17   to the definitional section.

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't -- the definitional

19   section contradicts -- contradicts what's in (b)(1)(A).

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Yes.

21                MR. FISHER:       As of 1988?

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes.      It contradicts it

23   because the "felony" definition is classified as felony

24   by Federal or State law.

25                MR. FISHER:       Well, it says "a felony under


                                       16
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the law of a State."     So I think the classification

 2   requirement -- I don't think it's inconsistent with it.

 3   It might clarify it.

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Which is "under any

 5   provision of this subchapter or any other Federal law

 6   that prohibits or restricts."            And then in the last

 7   part, "under any law of a" -- of "State" -- it picks up

 8   "State" -- "or a foreign country."                "Foreign country" is

 9   not included in 802(13).

10              MR. FISHER:        That's right, Justice Scalia.

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:            So you have to say that

12   there "felony" stands on its own, right?

13              MR. FISHER:        Well, I guess you could, but

14   then you wouldn't have a definition; then you'd have to

15   figure out how to define "felony," whether it was a

16   classification or a one-year rule or something else.               I

17   think the natural reading, again, would be a

18   classification requirement to the extent to which you

19   couldn't look further than that provision of the

20   statute, but --

21              JUSTICE BREYER:            Is the following true, that

22   if you are right the reason Congress passed this new

23   definition was it wanted to take those handful of States

24   which have felonies as a year, the ones Justice Alito is

25   talking about, and make clear that they are not covered?

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               MR. FISHER:        Yes.

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.       But if the

 3   government's right, then the reason Congress did this is

 4   that it recognized what I think is the truth, that

 5   felonies and misdemeanors are defined differently in

 6   many different ways under the laws of many different

 7   States and, in a matter where so much prison time turns

 8   on it, wished to create a single, uniform definition.

 9               Now, if that's right, I'm asking myself

10   which is a more plausible purpose.

11               MR. FISHER:        Well, we don't disagree with

12   the government that the one-year rule does serve the

13   purpose of helping iron out --

14               JUSTICE BREYER:            No, it doesn't, because if

15   you're right, then you first have to look to the

16   patchwork quilt of laws in all the different States to

17   see whether those different States define the conduct as

18   misdemeanors or felonies.          And then, having solved the

19   patchwork problem, we add on the requirement of one

20   year.   And so the bite of the new definition would be

21   what Justice Alito said and nothing else.

22               Now, that's -- and, yet, on the government's

23   interpretation, the bite is to create a single, readily

24   applied, uniform rule.

25               Now, if I ask myself which of those is most

 1   plausible, I hate to tell you which answer I get.

 2              MR. FISHER:         Well, I think, Justice Breyer,

 3   with due respect, if you look at the way different

 4   States treat drug crimes --

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:             Am I right?        Am I right?     I

 6   mean, I put that out to give you a chance to say.                  I'm

 7   not sure I am right.

 8              MR. FISHER:         That's what I'm trying to

 9   respond -- different States treat drug crimes

10   dramatically different, and this is so -- I think it's

11   common sense that States treat different crimes -- treat

12   -- different States punish the same crime differently.

13   And that's nowhere more true than in drug crime, because

14   there's a great amount of experimentation that goes on

15   in the States.   And one of the things that certain

16   States do, like Colorado, is take very low-level drug

17   crimes and punish them by more than a year, in part so

18   they can give treatment and keep people in, prison, long

19   enough to have treatment take hold, whereas some other

20   States treat drug crimes very differently.                  So you have

21   a patchwork whether you look to the classification or

22   whether you look to the one-year rule.                  That's why we

23   think it makes sense to use both.

24              Now, if Congress had wanted to do what the

25   government is suggesting, which is have the one-year

 1   rule be the sole and exclusive way of determining

 2   whether you have a felony before you, it could have very

 3   easily said so.   And there's an example -- and this is

 4   at page 13 of the yellow brief -- of what -- of what the

 5   Federal Sentencing Guidelines do.

 6                They define -- in a "career-offender

 7   provision" there is a definition of "felony" there that

 8   is quite explicit.      They say a "felony" is "an offense

 9   punishable by more than a year, regardless of whether

10   such an offense is specifically designated as a

11   'felony.'"

12                So there are other provisions where Congress

13   could have looked and it would have been well aware of

14   how to make absolutely plain what it was trying to

15   accomplish in the statute.

16                Now, we don't think that the government's

17   reading is implausible, Justice Breyer, for the reason

18   --.

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Fisher, could I just

20   go back to what you quoted.              Are you quoting -- you're

21   quoting a Sentencing Guideline, right?

22                MR. FISHER:         Yes.

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Not a statute.

24                MR. FISHER:         Yes, I'm quoting the Sentencing

25   Guideline, although in the Armed Career Criminal Act you

 1   can find another place where Congress dealt with this

 2   problem explicitly.

 3                It said that felonies are crimes punishable

 4   more than a year; however, if the State classifies the

 5   crime as a misdemeanor, it has to be punishable by more

 6   than two years.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:           You think -- you think it

 8   would mean something different if you just left out the

 9   "regardless of" clause?

10                MR. FISHER:       Well, Justice Scalia, with the

11   problem --

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:           The "prior adult Federal or

13   State conviction for an offense punishable by death or

14   imprisonment for a term exceeding one year," you think

15   it means something different without the "regardless".

16                MR. FISHER:       Not necessarily, but leaving

17   that clause --

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Not at all?      Not possibly.

19                MR. FISHER:       Well, our position is, Justice

20   Scalia, that, standing alone, I will grant you; but the

21   problem as we see it in this case is that that is left

22   out.   In a very common problem, how to define a felony,

23   they leave out that explicit statement of whether

24   classification is important.            And what is more, in the

25   same definitional provision --

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I would say that

 2   "regardless" clause is extraordinary and I would not

 3   want to have to deal with such prolix statutes on a

 4   regular basis.

 5                 MR. FISHER:        Well, I think there's a good

 6   reason why Congress put it in, and that's because it is

 7   a continually vexing problem, how to define what is a

 8   felony.     That's why Congress did it explicitly in the

 9   Armed Career Criminal Act.            That's why the Sentencing

10   Guidelines are explicit here.               And leaving that out, and

11   against the backdrop of a statute where the

12   classification rule was the controlling rule for over a

13   decade, and where they leave that classification rule in

14   the very same definitional provision of the statute, we

15   think, gives rise to an ambiguity.

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 If it's such a

17   vexing problem, why would Congress have incorporated the

18   problem into the definition of "felony drug offense"?

19                 MR. FISHER:        Well, I'm not sure I follow the

20   question.

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, you seem to

22   suggest that it's a vexing problem that "felony" is

23   defined differently in different States.                   And, yet, you

24   say that the term "felony," which relies on how it's

25   defined by different States, was incorporated in the


                                         22

 1   felony drug offense, which seems to have a quite clear

 2   definition of punishable by more than one year.

 3              If they don't want to repeat the problem

 4   that "felony" is defined differently in different

 5   States, they would not do what you're suggesting, which

 6   is incorporate it wholesale into the latter definition.

 7              MR. FISHER:           Well, with all due respect,

 8   what Congress did is they left 802(13) on the books,

 9   which does turn on classifications.                       And it's not --

10   even though it is a -- it is something of a patchwork,

11   it is not unusual at all to have very serious

12   consequences turn on whether something is classified as

13   a "felony" or not.

14              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                But, of course, they had

15   to leave it on the books because they need a definition

16   of "felony."   "Felony" has to be defined in many places,

17   but this is a definition of "felony drug offense."                      So

18   --

19              MR. FISHER:           Well, again, Justice Ginsburg,

20   I think that is right.         But then what Congress could

21   have done is use the language that the Federal

22   Sentencing Guidelines use, or something comparable to

23   make clear its intent.

24              And the classification of a felony or not a

25   felony, as this Court knows, has a time-honored import.

 1   Things like the right to vote, the right to bear arms,

 2   the right to various civil rights turn on whether

 3   somebody has been convicted of a felony or a

 4   misdemeanor.

 5              And, again, this brings us in a sense back

 6   to the rule of lenity because one of the principal

 7   reasons for the rule of lenity is fair notice.                   Now,

 8   this Court, as early as the McBoyle decision recognized

 9   that we're dealing with something of a fiction when we

10   imagine an offender is looking at the statutory books to

11   decide whether certain conduct is prohibited or not.

12              But in the context of recidivist

13   enhancements that lead to mandatory minimums, we're

14   talking about very real and serious notice problems.

15   Imagine the conscientious public defender advising

16   someone like Mr. Burgess as to whether he should plead

17   guilty to a misdemeanor or a felony.                   This happens in

18   States across the country that have three-strike

19   provisions, that have very serious immigration

20   consequences turning on "felony" or "misdemeanor."                   That

21   lawyer might have concluded, as the District of Columbia

22   Circuit did, that pleading to a misdemeanor here would

23   not expose Mr. Burgess in the event he was convicted of

24   a later crime to such a serious punishment as the

25   20-year mandatory minimum in this case.

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Can you tell me what

 2   happened in South Carolina?            Could he on those facts and

 3   under the charges have been sentenced to more than a

 4   year?   It was just that the judge gave him less than a

 5   year?

 6               MR. FISHER:        Mr. Burgess's crime, possession

 7   of cocaine, was punishable by up to two years.                So, yes,

 8   he received a sentence far less than that.

 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But he, himself, was

10   eligible for the --

11               MR. FISHER:        Yes.       The crime to which he

12   pled guilty was punishable by two years.                But you should

13   understand that that kind of hypothetical, punishable-by

14   problem is one I know this Court dealt with a couple of

15   months ago in the Rodriguez case.                And you should

16   understand that not just what Congress, under the

17   government's view, had been looking to sweep in outlier

18   States like Colorado, but if the government prevails in

19   the Rodriguez case where the term "punishable by" turns

20   on recidivist enhancements, then the 1994 amendments,

21   which were termed "conforming amendments," have an even

22   far more sweeping effect and bring in lots of State-law

23   misdemeanors that were never covered by the prior act.

24               If there are no more questions, I will

25   reserve my time.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Just one.      You said that

 2   in most States what Burgess did, his crime, simple

 3   possession, would not encounter a sentence of upward of

 4   one year.   Did you do a survey?              Did you document that

 5   in your brief?

 6               MR. FISHER:         No.      But I said earlier,

 7   Justice Ginsburg, giving the example of possession of

 8   one ounce of marijuana, that the vast majority of States

 9   punished that as a misdemeanor by less than a year.

10               Mr. Burgess's crime, at best, was a

11   misdemeanor punishable by less than a year under Federal

12   law, but different States treat that crime differently.

13   And I think a majority of those, a majority of States,

14   would treat that as a crime punishable by more than a

15   year and classified as a "felony.

16               If there are no more questions --

19                ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE SAHARSKY

20                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

21               MS. SAHARSKY:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

22   please the Court:

23               Congress answered the question presented in

24   this case when it adopted an express definition for

25   "felony drug offense."        Under that definition, "felony


                                        26
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   drug offense" means an offense punishable by more than

 2   one year of imprisonment under certain State, Federal,

 3   or foreign drug laws.

 4              There is no textual basis for going beyond

 5   that definition to also require that an offense be

 6   classified as a "felony."           The enhancement trigger in

 7   the sentencing-enhancement provision is a felony drug

 8   offense, and the way that the definition works is that

 9   you take the definition Congress provided for "felony

10   drug offense."

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Is "drug" a nested

12   term in that?    It doesn't really define "drug."                Do they

13   look somewhere else for that definition?

14              MS. SAHARSKY:            Well, the term "felony drug

15   offense," the "drug" component we understand to be the

16   component that says "an offense" that prohibits --

17   "under law that prohibits or restricts conduct related

18   to narcotic drugs, marijuana, anabolic steroids" --

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Is there a place you

20   would -- is that a place you would look if you didn't

21   know what they meant by "drug"?               If an issue arose

22   whether, you know, a natural narcotic, I mean is that a

23   drug or not?

24              MS. SAHARSKY:            There is a definition of

25   "drug" at the beginning of the Controlled Substances Act


                                        27
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   in section 802.   It refers back to the general

 2   definition of "drug," I believe in section 321 of the

 3   Controlled --

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So that is nested in

 5   this definition, "felony drug offense"?

 6              MS. SAHARSKY:           The term "felony drug

 7   offense" has only the meaning that Congress gave to it.

 8   In the words it shows that it be punishable by more than

 9   one year under State, Federal or foreign law relating to

10   those particular drugs.

11              In fact, the question that you asked shows

12   why Petitioner's reading of the statute cannot be

13   correct, that you can't use both the definition of

14   "felony drug offense" that Congress provided and try to

15   import in separate definitions for "felony" and separate

16   definitions for "drug," because the definition of "drug"

17   in the Controlled Substances Act is very broad and

18   applies to many different kinds of drugs, whereas the

19   definition of "felony drug offense" only refers to

20   offenses that involve narcotic drugs, anabolic steroids,

21   marijuana or depressant or stimulant substances.

22              In the same way, this shows why Petitioner

23   cannot be correct that the definition of "felony" also

24   must be brought into "felony drug offense," because

25   Congress chose that the measure of seriousness in


                                       28
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   "felony drug offense" is an offense punishable by more

 2   than one year.    And it actually took out of the statute

 3   the measure of seriousness which is classification as a

 4   felony.   So to bring that requirement back in would undo

 5   the change that Congress made in 1994.

 6               That's the language, Justice Ginsburg, that

 7   we were looking at at the bottom of the -- at the back

 8   of the blue book.    In 1988 it said "'Felony drug

 9   offense' means an offense which is a felony."                  And that

10   language was taken out and Congress replaced it with

11   this new language, which says "punishable by more than

12   one year of imprisonment."

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  What do you do with

14   your friend's argument that the classification -- or the

15   term, more than one year or less than one year, doesn't

16   always have to do with how serious they view the

17   offense, but they may impose a sentence of more than one

18   year to allow time for rehabilitation?

19               MS. SAHARSKY:           Congress chose the words that

20   it did, "punishable by more than one year," because it

21   believed it to be a good measure of seriousness.                  This

22   Court has recognized in cases like Blanton versus City

23   of North Las Vegas that the term of imprisonment that a

24   legislature chooses is a good measure of the seriousness

25   of the offense.   There may be offenses that a State


                                        29

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   classifies as more or less serious based on punishment,

 2   but Congress wanted to do its best to get uniformity in

 3   provision -- in this provision.                So what it did here was

 4   to take out this requirement that would look to varying

 5   State and foreign laws and instead have one that was

 6   just based on term of imprisonment.

 7              And actually this -- this raises a very

 8   serious problem with Petitioner's reading of the

 9   statute, which is with respect to foreign offenses.                  The

10   "felony drug offense" definition allows an enhancement

11   based on State, Federal or foreign offenses, and the

12   definition of "felony" unadorned and standing by itself

13   doesn't refer to foreign offenses at all, which means

14   that there is a serious ambiguity if both apply as to

15   what would be done in the case of trying to enhance

16   based on a foreign offense.

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Well, I suppose it might

18   for countries that use that classification, for common

19   law countries.

20              MS. SAHARSKY:             There are countries that do

21   use the felony- misdemeanor distinction.                  There are some

22   that do not.     But we understand in 1994 that Congress --

23   the change Congress made to be one that eliminates those

24   kinds of ambiguities.

25              And certainly, if Congress had thought in


                                         30

 1   1994 that both the separate definition of felony and the

 2   definition of felony drug offense mattered, that it

 3   would have placed foreign offenses in the definition of

 4   felony, and it didn't do that here.

 5              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               The -- the information we

 6   have in the brief says that there are two States that

 7   have dropped those labels.           Are there more than New

 8   Jersey and Maine?

 9              MS. SAHARSKY:            New Jersey and Maine are the

10   only ones that I'm aware of.

11              Certainly, as this Court discussed in some

12   previous questions, there may be ways in which courts

13   could try to work around ambiguities that, for example,

14   existed in the statute 1990 -- prior to 1994, to figure

15   out how offenses in New Jersey should be treated.             But

16   the fact that Congress made the change in 1994 to pick

17   clear language that would just turn on the authorized

18   term of imprisonment shows that that's what should be

19   used, that choice should be given effect.

20              The fact that courts might be able to deal

21   with an ambiguous statute certainly does not give

22   license to create one where it doesn't otherwise exist.

23              There's an example the Petitioner raised,

24   which is how violent felonies are treated in the Armed

25   Career Criminal Act, and I think that that -- that


                                        31
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   illustrates how Congress could have done what Petitioner

 2   wanted if that was, in fact, its intent.                     In the ACCA, a

 3   violent felony, which could be the basis for a sentence

 4   enhancement, is defined as various violent offenses that

 5   are punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year.                        But

 6   then Congress specifically decided that it wanted to

 7   exempt state misdemeanor offenses that it didn't

 8   consider serious enough to qualify as violent felonies.

 9   So it exempted State offenses that are classified as

10   misdemeanors and punishable by less than two years.                       And

11   we think that the Congress' treatment in the ACCA

12   exempting specific State offenses shows that if Congress

13   had wanted to exempt offenses classified as misdemeanors

14   in the way that Petitioner suggests, then it would have

15   done so in that way.

16              Congress chose a meaning here for "felony

17   drug offense" and we think that it needs to be given

18   effect.

19              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Could you tell us just a

20   little bit about the rule of lenity?                     You want us to

21   apply sort of a watered down discount rule of lenity in

22   sentencing cases?    And do you have authority for that?

23              MS. SAHARSKY:            The government --

24              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              After we said in

25   Granderson the rule of lenity applies without qualifying


                                        32
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   or modifying it at all.

 2                 MS. SAHARSKY:          The government's position is

 3   that the rule of lenity operates in the same manner in

 4   both the defining the offense context and in the

 5   sentencing context.       The point that we were making in

 6   our brief is that the purposes behind the rule of lenity

 7   are really implicated to a lesser extent when we're

 8   talking about sentencing, and particularly with respect

 9   to mandatory minimums, because there's not a question of

10   whether the offense conduct at issue is illegal, and

11   there's not a question about the maximum offense, the

12   maximum term of imprisonment that the person could be

13   subject to.

14                 So, our brief should be best understood as a

15   response to Petitioner's extensive historical discussion

16   of the rule of lenity and a suggestion that it applies

17   with even more vigor in the context of mandatory

18   minimums.     We don't think that that's the case, but at

19   the same time we are not suggesting there is a new

20   different rule of lenity in this context.

21                 And again, we don't see this as a rule of

22   lenity case.     Congress picked a particular definition

23   and it used those terms -- that term "felony drug

24   offense" to trigger each of the sentencing enhancement

25   provisions here.     We don't think there is any reason to


                                         33

 1   look beyond it.

 3   Government submits the judgment below should be

 4   affirmed.

 9                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10               MR. FISHER:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

11               If I might pick up where Justice Kennedy

12   left off with the rule of lenity, because we don't want

13   this Court to lose sight of the importance of the rule

14   of lenity in this case.         It's not our position that the

15   government's reading is unreasonable.                    It is simply our

16   position that our reading of the statute is a possible

17   one and that Congress may have been --

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, but there has to be

19   a real ambiguity.    I mean, if there is a plausible

20   defendant-friendly interpretation, that doesn't trigger

21   the rule of lenity, does it or doesn't it?

22               MR. FISHER:         I think, Justice Kennedy, a

23   fair way to ask yourself the question is, would the

24   statute here rise to the level of a plain statement of a

25   kind that is required to, for example, abrogate


                                        34

 1   sovereign immunity or to realign the Federal State

 2   balance.     The term "clear statement" and "clear and

 3   definition statement" that is used in the historical

 4   context --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            How many statutes exist

 6   like that, my goodness?          You want the government to be

 7   held in all statutes to a level that is clear enough to

 8   satisfy the clear statement --

 9                 MR. FISHER:        With all due respect, Justice

10   Scalia, that's what the historical cases say.

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's what the rule of

12   lenity means.

13                 MR. FISHER:        Yes.       With all due respect.    If

14   you look at the examples in Blackstone, that's the

15   Greenbury cite, if you look at this Court's earliest

16   cases, Chief Justice Marshall wrote for the court in

17   Wiltberger that even though it's extremely improbable

18   that Congress wanted the result that the defendant

19   presses, the Court is nevertheless going to insist on

20   it, because it is not unambiguously clear this was

21   Congress' intent.

22                 And so, it's easy to forget given the modern

23   proliferation of Federal criminal statutes how rare

24   criminal cases used to be in this court.

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Do our cases reflect what


                                         35

 1   you're saying?   I thought our cases on the rule of

 2   lenity say that where there is an ambiguity you give the

 3   tie to the defendant.

 4               MR. FISHER:        Well, I think this is very

 5   important, Justice Scalia, your cases, especially the

 6   historical cases and the modern ones, I think, waffle in

 7   different directions, but there are plenty of cases from

 8   this Court that are much more than a tie-breaker in the

 9   sense of the rule of lenity and say, we require clear

10   and definite terms, that's the phrase Justice

11   Frankfurter used to repeat.            Justice Holmes said the

12   statute must be clear.       Even up to Granderson it says --

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            That was in a context

14   where the question was whether or not the conduct was

15   criminal at all not since.

16               MR. FISHER:        That's right.            But for the

17   reason --

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            If you apply clear

19   statement rule to the sentencing code, I don't think we

20   are going to be able to get beyond the second sentence.

21               MR. FISHER:        Well, I think with due respect

22   what you're going to do is actually reduce the number of

23   cases this court hears, because once you have a clear

 1   resolve these kinds of cases because just like in the

 2   sovereign immunity and Federalism context, it's much

 3   easier to look for a clear statement.                  And even more

 4   importantly, Congress will know that when it legislates

 5   in the realm of criminal sentencing, that it needs to be

 6   clear, and it will solve this case -- this Court the

 7   problem, perhaps, of having four or five cases on its

 8   docket every term involving circuit splits and how to

 9   apply mandatory minimums in the vast labyrinth of

10   Federal criminal sentencing provisions.

11              So we think this Court can rest assured, of

12   course, that if it rules for the Petitioner in this case

13   and Congress doesn't like the result, that it is well

14   and able and ready to step in to solve that problem.

15   The problem is, is that if this Court accepts broad

16   readings of the government, from the government of

17   criminal statutes, that the institutional forces that

18   drive legislation are -- make it much less likely that

19   Congress can step in to solve that problem in favor of

20   criminal defendants.

21              So for the reasons we've explained, we think

22   this Court should go back to the historical

23   understanding brought forward to the present of the

24   importance of the rule of lenity, and in this case find

25   that the statute does not clearly and unambiguously

 3   submit the case.

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

 5   Mr. Fisher.    The case is submitted.
