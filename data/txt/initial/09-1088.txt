 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              We'll hear argument

 4   next in Case 09-1088, Cullen v. Pinholster.

 5               Mr. Bilderback.

 6           ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. BILDERBACK, II,

 7                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8               MR. BILDERBACK:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 9   it please the Court:

10               There are three main points I wish to

11   emphasize to the Court this morning:              First, because the

12   California Supreme Court rejected Mr. Pinholster's claim

13   of ineffective assistance of counsel on its merits,

14   Federal habeas corpus relief is unavailable under 28

15   U.S.C. section 2254(d)(1) unless Mr. Pinholster first

16   met his burden of demonstrating that the State court

17   rejection of his claim was unreasonable.              He did not do

18   that in this case, and thus the lower courts erred in

19   granting him habeas corpus relief.

20               Second, because Mr. Pinholster never even

21   alleged, let alone proved, that he could not have

22   presented the factual basis upon which the Ninth Circuit

23   predicated its decision to grant relief when he was in

24   the State court, 2254(e)(2) should have been a barrier

25   to the State court Federal evidentiary hearing.

 1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Could we just clarify

 2   what you mean by "factual basis"?              To be precise, he

 3   didn't -- because he didn't present the expert opinion

 4   with the diagnosis, or because the diagnosis was based

 5   on a series of facts that, to me, appear to have been

 6   presented fully to the State court; is that correct?

 7               MR. BILDERBACK:           Yes.

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           With the exception of

 9   the fact that the defense attorneys only worked 6 hours,

10   the billing records.    That -- I think that's the only

11   underlying facts to the opinion that appear new; am I

12   correct?

13               MR. BILDERBACK:           No, Your Honor.     The

14   diagnosis itself is a fact.           The -

15               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           All right.     So we are

16   only talking about the expert opinion facts being new?

17               MR. BILDERBACK:           We -- there are a number of

18   facts that were new in the Federal -

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           What -- besides the

20   opinion, what were they?

21               MR. BILDERBACK:           Well, as the Court

22   adverted, there was also the notion that there was

23   somehow a limited amount of time, specifically -

24               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Well, he did allege that

25   in his petition before the State court?

 1               MR. BILDERBACK:           He did not allege 6 and a

 2   half hours, Your Honor.

 3               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Not specifically, but he

 4   said that his counsel didn't prepare.

 5               MR. BILDERBACK:           That's precisely correct,

 6   Your Honor, but the court -

 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           And he pointed to the

 8   fact that counsel basically said at the trial, I didn't

 9   think we were going to have a mitigation hearing, as

10   proof of that, correct?

11               MR. BILDERBACK:           He did point to that, Your

12   Honor, but we would note that the 6-and-a-half-hour

13   conclusion drawn by the Ninth Circuit and drawn by the

14   district court is not fairly supported by the record.

15               But, putting that aside, the principal fact

16   that we are focusing on that we think is a new and

17   significant change in the factual posture of the case

18   from the time he was in State court to the time that he

19   was in Federal court is the diagnosis of organic brain

20   damage by the expert, which is not simply the opinion of

21   the expert, but a question of material fact that was

22   relied upon by the Ninth Circuit in its decision to

23   grant relief.

24               The failure to ever tell the California

25   Supreme Court that petitioner has organic brain damage

 1   and the centrality of that factual determination on the

 2   Ninth Circuit's decision making is -- was a substantial

 3   difference between the facts upon which the State -

 4   with which the State court was presented and the facts

 5   that the Ninth Circuit granted -- rested its decision to

 6   grant relief.

 7                JUSTICE KAGAN:         Mr. Bilderback, I know that

 8   that's the principal fact that you rely upon, that

 9   there's a difference, but could you give us a full

10   catalogue of the facts that are different in the Federal

11   court record from the facts that are different in the

12   State court record?    Was there anything other than the

13   medical testimony and the billing sheets, or is that the

14   extent of it?

15                MR. BILDERBACK:           Those are -- those are the

16   significant facts that we think are -- are relevant to

17   -- to the discussion of whether or not the State court

18   determination should be or could properly be found to

19   have been unreasonable, was -- was the difference in the

20   specificity of the -- of the nature of the claim of

21   deficient performance in terms of the time sheets and -

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             What about

23   Dr. Stalberg's new deposition?            Doesn't that count as a

24   new fact?   I'm looking at your brief on page 11.            At a

25   deposition just before the evidentiary hearing,

                                    6

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   Dr. Stalberg revealed that nothing in the new material

 2   called into question his original diagnosis.

 3               MR. BILDERBACK:             Oh, certainly, Your Honor.

 4   I -- I understood the questions from the Court to be

 5   asking which new facts were relied upon in the decision

 6   to grant relief.    Certainly, there were new facts

 7   adduced during the Federal proceedings that we think

 8   inveighed against a grant of relief, and I think that

 9   the fact that Your Honor points to is precisely one of

10   those.

11               But, in terms of the new facts -- and let's

12   be clear that 2254(d)(1) is a rule that says that relief

13   cannot be granted if the State court determination was

14   unreasonable.   To the extent that relief is denied, the

15   inclusion of new facts in the analysis may not run afoul

16   of (d)(1) at all.    So here, because the Ninth Circuit

17   relied so heavily upon the organic brain damage

18   diagnosis and because that diagnosis -

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Could we just be clear?

20               MR. BILDERBACK:             Yes.

21               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             I thought that

22   Dr. Stalberg's affidavit in the State court said that he

23   had brain damage of some sort.

24               MR. BILDERBACK:             That's not accurate, Your

25   Honor.

 1                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           I thought it said that

 2   he -- the school records show evidence of mental

 3   disturbances and some degree of brain damage.

 4                  MR. BILDERBACK:           I believe that -

 5                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           What he did say -- I

 6   think there's a difference between -- because he pointed

 7   to epilepsy.     He pointed to a series of things that

 8   showed some brain damage.          I just want to clarify.

 9                  MR. BILDERBACK:           Certainly.

10                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           It's not organic damage;

11   the issue is whether the organic damage created a

12   dysfunctionality that contributed to the events.                 That's

13   what he didn't know, and he said:                 It's not -- I would

14   have needed more information to figure that out.

15                  MR. BILDERBACK:           Well, he -- he never said

16   that if he had had the additional information, that he

17   would have diagnosed Mr. Pinholster as suffering from

18   organic brain damage.       He -

19                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           No, no, no.     Organic

20   brain damage dysfunctionality.              There's a difference

21   between the two diagnoses.

22                  MR. BILDERBACK:           Absolutely, Your Honor, but

23   I want to be clear that Dr. Stalberg never diagnosed

24   Mr. Pinholster with organic brain damage, even at the

25   conclusion of the Federal evidentiary hearing, following

                                      8

 1   which he had access to all of the facts that habeas

 2   counsel was -- managed to unearth during the course of

 3   the Federal proceedings.

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Your adversary points to

 5   the difference in language between (d)(1) and (d)(2).

 6               MR. BILDERBACK:           Yes.

 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           (D)(2) refers to

 8   unreasonable in light of the facts, unreasonable

 9   determination of facts in light of the record before the

10   court, and subdivision (1) doesn't.            It speaks only an

11   unreasonable decision.

12               Could you address the difference in the

13   language and why that difference doesn't suggest that

14   the question of an unreasonable legal determination

15   should be based on the record before the Federal court,

16   which in most instances, the vast majority of instances,

17   is just a State court record?

18               MR. BILDERBACK:           That's correct, Your Honor.

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           But there are exceptions

20   in (e)(2) for hearings.

21               MR. BILDERBACK:           Yes.

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So why shouldn't the

23   first subdivision be read to mean unreasonable legal

24   determination in light of the record before the court?

25               MR. BILDERBACK:           Because subdivisions (d)(1)

                                   9

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                                Official


 1   and (d)(2) serve very different purposes.          Subdivision

 2   (d)(2) is concerned with determinations of fact, and the

 3   additional language that the Court points to was an

 4   attempt to limit the bases upon which a Federal court

 5   could overturn a State court factual determination.

 6               Prior to the passage of AEDPA, a Federal

 7   court could overturn a State court determination of fact

 8   not simply because the evidence was lacking, which is

 9   the current state of the law, but also because it found

10   some sort of procedural defect or a number of other

11   bases that had grown up in the common law.          With the

12   passage of AEDPA, Congress limited the bases upon which

13   a State court factual determination could be rejected to

14   only one.

15               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Are you suggesting that

16   if a State court gets a proffer of evidence from a State

17   petitioner who says, I have a billing record that shows

18   that my attorney worked only 6 hours; and the State

19   says, we're not admitting that billing record because it

20   hasn't been authenticated, so we're not looking at that

21   fact; and the Federal habeas looks at what was proffered

22   and says, this is authentication under any rule, State

23   or Federal -- it was improperly admitted, so their legal

24   determination was wrong?      Not unreasonable legal

25   determination as to the IAC, because in fact -- I used

                                  10

                                  Official


 1   the example of 6 hours.        The billing record could show 5

 2   minutes, so that there's no dispute that the person

 3   spent essentially no time on mitigation, didn't present

 4   anything.    The clearest case you want.           You're

 5   suggesting that a habeas corpus court is no longer

 6   permitted to look at that new evidence?

 7                 MR. BILDERBACK:           Well, what I'm suggesting

 8   is that the language of (d)(2) was designed to limit the

 9   bases upon which a Federal court could overturn a State

10   court factual finding.       Of course, our case doesn't

11   really involve (d)(2).

12                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           No, but I'm going back

13   to (d)(1).

14                 MR. BILDERBACK:           Yes, and the -- the

15   symmetrical language in (d)(1) is the language -

16                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           It's not symmetrical,

17   though.

18                 MR. BILDERBACK:           I would -- I would

19   disagree, because I believe the symmetrical language in

20   (d)(1) is the limitation on the Federal court's reliance

21   on lower Federal court authority to overturn State court

22   factual determinations.

23                 Prior to the passage of AEDPA, lower Federal

24   courts were free to look to their own prior precedent,

25   the prior precedent of the circuit courts, to say that

                                    11

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   the State court determination of a question of law was

 2   unreasonable.    In both statutes -- statute -

 3   subdivision (d)(1), which has to do with questions of

 4   law and mixed questions, the additional language

 5   narrowed the focus to a new and more limited basis for

 6   Federal review or to find the State court determination

 7   unreasonable.

 8               In (d)(2), there is this symmetrical

 9   limiting language which overturned what had historically

10   been several bases for rejecting a State court factual

11   determination.

12               But, in both sections, the law is clear that

13   the - the examination is of the application that was

14   conducted by the State court.           The section itself speaks

15   in the past tense, and the very concept of

16   reasonableness compels the conclusion that the State

17   court determination can only fairly be read in light of

18   -- in light of the facts that were squarely presented to

19   the State court.   Otherwise we could be in a situation

20   where all of the facts before the State court are

21   entirely removed, an entirely new set of facts are

22   proven up in the Federal court, and we're going to say

23   that, notwithstanding that wholesale change in the

24   factual basis of the claim, that the State court

25   determination was not merely wrong, but unreasonable.

                                    12

 1                  And it is this notion of unreasonableness,

 2   and it is the primacy of the State court determination

 3   of the claim that is the central feature of the AEDPA

 4   reforms to Federal habeas corpus.                 The point was to make

 5   State court determinations the primary forum for

 6   adjudicating Federal constitutional claims, and Federal

 7   courts were only supposed to interfere in those

 8   determinations reluctantly.              And if you examine the

 9   language of AEDPA, you'll see that, in -- in many

10   respects, it mirrors the language of 2244, the "second

11   or successive" language in Federal court.

12                  The purpose of AEDPA was to enforce upon

13   Federal courts the same respect for State court

14   determinations of claims that Federal courts showed to

15   their own prior State court determinations of claims.

16   State court determinations of Federal constitutional

17   claims are not lesser creatures deserving of less

18   respect than Federal court determinations of claims.

19   And here they put very specific language in the statute

20   that was designed to ensure that when a Federal court is

21   examining a State court determination of a claim, it

22   limits itself to only those facts that were before the

23   State court.     And, indeed, this Court has specifically

24   said so in Holland v. Jackson, that the (d)(1)

25   determination is done in light of the record before the

                                     13

 1   State court.     Similarly, in Michael -

 2                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Well, there's a

 3   paragraph right after what you cite that basically says

 4   unless there's a hearing.          So Holland works -- doesn't

 5   stop at the point that you're quoting.                 It goes on in

 6   the very next sentence to say "unless a hearing has been

 7   held."

 8                  MR. BILDERBACK:           And if a hearing is

 9   appropriately held, that's a very different question.

10   But as this Court stated in Michael Williams, if the

11   2254(d)(1) question is dispositive, no Federal

12   evidentiary hearing is required.                 And that would be our

13   position in this case.        Because this claim survived

14   2254(d)(1) scrutiny, the Federal evidentiary hearing

15   should not have been held, just as, in the Michael

16   Williams case, this Court ratified the decision of the

17   district court not to hold an evidentiary hearing

18   because the claim failed under (d)(1).

19                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So why don't we start

20   the way that you are proposing, which is to start with

21   (e)(2):   Was the hearing appropriately held, first?                   And

22   if it was, why are we excluding the evidence that was

23   developed at that hearing?            What you're proposing is the

24   reverse, to say we start at (d)(1) -

25                  MR. BILDERBACK:           I am.

 1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           -- and only if the

 2   petitioner wins under (d)(1), on proving that the

 3   decision on the facts before that -- the State court

 4   were reasonable, that you ever get to (e)(2).

 5               MR. BILDERBACK:           And that's why -

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Why is that logical?

 7   Why isn't it logical to start with (e)(2), which is -

 8   it says in (e)(2) these are the prerequisites to having

 9   a hearing, you prove you're entitled to it.           Why are we

10   excluding those facts from the decision makers'

11   consideration?

12               MR. BILDERBACK:           Well, setting aside for the

13   moment a point I hope to get to, which is I believe that

14   they did fail under (e)(2); but assuming the premise of

15   the question, which is that (e)(2) has been satisfied

16   and that the Federal evidentiary hearing might be

17   appropriate, it makes no more sense to conduct a Federal

18   evidentiary hearing before you conduct a (d)(1) analysis

19   than it would to conduct a Federal evidentiary hearing

20   before you do the 2254(a) analysis of whether there's a

21   Federal question, the 2254(b) and (c) analysis of

22   whether the claim is properly exhausted, or the 2254(d)

23   analysis of whether the State court resolution of the

24   claim was reasonable.

25               The statute is laid out in a methodical,

 1   calculated, and logical manner.           And if the court just

 2   adheres to the calculated, methodical, and logical

 3   manner of the statute -

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Counsel, I can tell you

 5   the one thing you've said that makes no sense:                There's

 6   nothing logical about this statute, or clear about this

 7   statute, as the legion of cases that the lower courts

 8   have addressed in trying to interpret it and as the

 9   legion of Supreme Court cases that have dealt with this

10   statute -

11               MR. BILDERBACK:           Well, I would submit that

12   we could bring some much-needed clarity to some of the

13   confusion on these issues if the -- I think the plain

14   language of 2254(d)(1), which is retrospective and

15   contextual, is -- was -- is given its full force and

16   effect.

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             How does that

18   work -

19               JUSTICE KAGAN:         Have you thought about -

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             How does that work,

21   counsel, if you have new evidence?             My claim was

22   decided, it was reasonable under (d)(1) based on what

23   they knew, but I've come up with new evidence that I

24   think could not have been reasonably discovered before

25   the (d)(1) hearing?   What happens to that?            It seems to

                                  16

 1   me you determine whether that evidence can come in under

 2   (e)(2).

 3               MR. BILDERBACK:             Well, the -- the question

 4   -- and I think the question the Court's asked seems to

 5   implicate the ACLU's hypothetical in their amicus brief.

 6   But the problem with doing the (e)(2) analysis before we

 7   examine the reasonableness of the State court

 8   determination is those new facts that were never

 9   presented to the State court are going to, as it did in

10   this case, confound the court's analysis of whether the

11   State court determination was reasonable.

12               If new facts arise which call into question

13   some factual determination by the State court, or let's

14   say new evidence arises which calls into question a

15   State court factual determination, of course that

16   implicates subdivision (d)(2) and that -- that

17   implicates subdivision (e)(1), neither of which are in

18   play in our case.    But, under those circumstances, we

19   might find ourselves asking the question, depending upon

20   the nature of the new evidence, whether or not that

21   evidence is of such a caliber that it's going to

22   transform the claim.      And if it so transforms the claim

23   that we're no longer going to consider it the same claim

24   that was adjudicated by the State court -

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So -- so you

                                    17

 1   think -- and I have trouble understanding the parties'

 2   position on this.    When you talk about claims, you don't

 3   mean totally different legal bases; you mean different

 4   evidentiary support.      The claim that it's ineffective

 5   assistance of counsel based on organic -- the failure to

 6   discover the organic brain damage you say might or might

 7   not be considered a new claim, and, therefore, (d)(1)

 8   would not be a bar to that.

 9                MR. BILDERBACK:            Oh, it's our position that

10   the introduction of the organic brain damage evidence

11   fundamentally changes the nature of this claim.               So that

12   this -- the claim upon which the Ninth Circuit granted

13   relief is a claim that was never presented to the State

14   court.   It is not simply a matter of -- of additional

15   evidence that tends to support.             And the best

16   evidence -

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              So then -- and the

18   reason that doesn't undermine your position is because

19   you think it's evidence that could have been discovered

20   and presented earlier?

21                MR. BILDERBACK:            Well, indeed, the very

22   nature of their claim compels the conclusion that it

23   could have been presented.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I understand that.

25   But if it were evidence that could not have been

                                    18

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   discovered previously, then (d)(1) does not bar looking

 2   at (e)(2)?

 3                MR. BILDERBACK:           Depending upon the nature

 4   of the new evidence.

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             If it's really a new

 6   claim?

 7                MR. BILDERBACK:           And, again, I think we have

 8   a pretty well-settled body of jurisprudence that's

 9   instructive on that, and that is the 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii)

10   analyses of when a claim that was previously adjudicated

11   on the merits by a Federal court can be revisited in a

12   subsequent petition that is filed in the Federal court.

13   If the nature of the claim is so fundamentally changed

14   that we're going to consider it a new claim, then it is

15   not the same claim that was presented to the State

16   court.

17                However, because it wasn't presented to the

18   State court, depending upon the availability of a State

19   remedy or any State procedural bars, those sort of

20   traditional habeas corpus limitations -

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             I suppose -- I

22   suppose the Federal court can send it back to the State

23   court for exhaustion.

24                MR. BILDERBACK:           If -- if that's -- if

25   that's an appropriate remedy.            But the -- the problem

                                   19

 1   with the procedure that was used in this case, and -

 2   and some of this I acknowledge is idiosyncratic to this

 3   case because the district court was unaware that AEDPA

 4   applied until very late in the proceedings.

 5                But the problem with following a procedure

 6   that allows the development of evidence notwithstanding

 7   the reasonableness of the State court determination is

 8   you are very often, if not typically, going to find a

 9   situation where, even if the State court determination

10   of the claim was wholly reasonable, the claim has

11   changed based upon these new facts developed for the

12   very first time in Federal court, and then that's going

13   to mean that it's a substantially transformed claim.

14                JUSTICE ALITO:         What happens to the -

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I'll -- I'll think it

16   through, but it seems to me that it's not consistent

17   with what I thought the theory of your brief was for you

18   to tell the Chief Justice that this is -- the

19   hypothetical was a new claim.

20                Take -- take the ACLU hypothetical that you

21   discuss in your reply brief.            Is -- is that a new claim?

22                MR. BILDERBACK:           I don't think that the ACLU

23   hypothetical states a new claim.            I was speaking of in

24   our case -

 2   organic brain damage evidence.            So I think that in -- in

 3   the hypothetical that the ACLU -

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But if it's a new claim,

 5   then if -- we don't look to (d) because it wasn't

 6   adjudicated on the merits.

 7                MR. BILDERBACK:           Right.

 8                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           -- and so you go to (e).

 9                MR. BILDERBACK:           Well, if it was -- yes,

10   that's -- that's absolutely correct, Your Honor.            If you

11   have a claim presented to the Federal court that was

12   never adjudicated on its merits by the State court, and

13   if we're further -- further positing that there's no

14   available State court remedy -

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well then, now it seems to

16   me that you're saying that this is an (e) claim and that

17   you'll just fight the battle on whether or not it could

18   have been discovered through the exercise of due

19   diligence.   You're -- and you're out of the

20   (d)(1)/(d)(2) framework that you've been arguing up to

22   your response.

 1   you agreed that it was.

 2                  MR. BILDERBACK:           In my case, I agree that

 3   the facts presented to the Federal court were never

 4   presented to the State court, and those facts

 5   fundamentally transformed the claim such that the claim

 6   upon which the Ninth Circuit granted relief was never

 7   presented to California.

 8                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Okay.    So then this is an

 9   (e)(2) case.

10                  MR. BILDERBACK:           No, Your Honor, because you

11   only can leap to (e)(2) if the State court never had the

12   opportunity to examine the facts of the claim and if the

13   petitioner can show that he could not have previously

14   presented the claim to the State court.

15                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           No -

16                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Then it's a procedural

17   bar?    Is that -

19                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Then it's a procedural bar

20   case?

21                  MR. BILDERBACK:           Well, depending on how the

22   State court reacts to the new evidence.                Yes, if the

23   State court erects a procedural bar then, yes, this

24   Court's well-settled jurisprudence on the question of

25   procedural bars is going to control whether or not we

 1   can reach the merits of the claim in Federal court.

 2   That's absolutely correct.

 3                But here part of the problem in the instant

 4   case is that the very nature of the claim that they have

 5   presented precludes the conclusion that they could not

 6   have presented this evidence to the State court in the

 7   exercise of reasonable diligence.               They have asserted

 8   that any reasonable attorney in 1984 at the time of the

 9   trial had to discover the organic brain damage diagnosis

10   that Dr. Vinogradov offered in Federal court, but the -

11                JUSTICE KAGAN:         Well, Mr. Bilderback, going

12   back to your question of what's a claim.               So the claim

13   here could be ineffective assistance at the penalty

14   stage.   Or you could be saying, no, the claim is

15   ineffective -- ineffective assistance for failing to

16   present evidence of organic brain damage.               That would be

17   a narrower understanding of the claim.               Or still

18   narrower, it might be ineffective assistance for failing

19   to present evidence of a particular kind of brain

20   damage, frontal lobe brain damage, which is what the new

21   doctor said, as opposed to what the old doctor said,

22   which was bipolar disorder.

23                So how do we choose the level of generality,

24   if you will, when we try to figure out what the claim

25   is?

 1                 MR. BILDERBACK:           Well, of course, a claim is

 2   made up of two components, and one of them is -- is the

 3   legal theory of the claim, and the other is the factual

 4   landscape that we're asking that legal theory to be

 5   applied to.    So, for example, if someone were to present

 6   to a State court or, frankly, to a Federal court, a

 7   claim as general as the first statement that you made,

 8   Justice Kagan, that my trial attorney gave me

 9   ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase,

10   that's a claim that's void for vagueness.

11                 Rule 2 requires that you specifically

12   identify the factual bases of your claim to the Federal

13   court in your Federal petition.             And California has a

14   similar rule that requires you to communicate the

15   factual bases of the claim.             If we utterly change the

16   factual basis of the claim, then it is in essence a new

17   claim.

18                 I see that I'm almost out of time.                I'd like

19   to reserve the balance for rebuttal.

 1   Justice, and may it please the Court:

 2                  There has been a lot of discussion about

 3   changes from State to Federal court, but if we limit

 4   ourselves, even to the evidence that was only presented

 5   in State court, the mitigation evidence demonstrates an

 6   objectively unreasonable application of Strickland, and

 7   the judgment of the Ninth Circuit should be affirmed on

 8   that basis alone.

 9                  We presented a substantial amount of legal

10   specificity and factual specificity in support of our

11   claim.     We alleged in State court that his mom had run

12   over his head, that -- at age 2 and a half, and a year

13   later his head had propelled through the windshield in a

14   car accident, and that it caused mental and organic

15   impairments that affect intent and culpability.

16                  And Justice Kagan asked, what is the rule

17   for the generality of the claim?              I believe it is that

18   which focuses on what is legally relevant in the habeas

19   hearing.

20                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes, but, look, you say

21   that, even on the basis of the facts before the

22   California court, your client deserved relief.              That may

23   well be, but that's not what the -- what the Ninth

24   Circuit said.     The Ninth Circuit said that your client

25   deserved relief in light of the facts before the

                                     25

 1   California court plus other facts.

 2               Now, I'm not going to go back and answer a

 3   hypothetical question of whether, if the Ninth Circuit

 4   said on the basis of those facts alone that were before

 5   the California court, if -- if the Ninth Circuit had

 6   said that, would that opinion be affirmed?            That's not

 7   the opinion they came up with.          They added facts.    So it

 8   seems to me that you have to live with what they wrote.

 9   And the basis of their decision included additional

10   facts.

11               MR. KENNEDY:      We do have to live with the

12   basis that the Ninth Circuit wrote, and the Ninth

13   Circuit majority en banc said that there were alternate

14   bases for granting relief.         It felt that the (e)(2)

15   Federal hearing was compelling, but it specifically

16   stated that if you set aside the new mental health

17   theories that were introduced in Federal court and

18   focused only on the historical upbringing and childhood,

19   and the mental health facts alleged in State court, that

20   basis and that basis alone would support a finding.            And

21   the dissent mentions this as well.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             A finding under -

23   under the standards that we've applied under AEDPA?

24               MR. KENNEDY:      Yes, an objectively

25   unreasonable application of Strickland.            And -

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:             That in this case presents

 2   no -- no issue.     I mean, the -- if their holding is that

 3   in the -- in your habeas hearing in State court, the

 4   evidence presented in State court at that hearing was

 5   sufficient and was required -- required that State court

 6   to find that you win on this issue, the State court in

 7   holding to the contrary is objectively unreasonable,

 8   then you win.     And why are we all here?

 9                MR. KENNEDY:        Yes, and -

10                (Laughter.)

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:             That's your very point,

12   isn't it?

13                MR. KENNEDY:        In -- in our opposition for

14   cert, we said this, that we thought it should not be

15   granted because of the presentation in State court -

16                JUSTICE BREYER:             I mention it not because it

17   wouldn't -

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               We have to determine

19   under AEDPA that it was objectively unreasonable for

20   this lawyer to get a psychiatrist, or whatever his

21   status was; to get a report, which he did, and which he

22   looked at, in which the psychiatrist or psychologist

23   said, look, there's nothing here, and he went through

24   all the stuff that was there; and, in fact, after the

25   Federal evidentiary hearing, he said, well, in light of

                                     27

 1   this new evidence, I'm still correct; and objectively

 2   unreasonable for this lawyer to say, look, my best bet

 3   is to put his mother on the stand, that that might

 4   engender sympathy and portray him as not as bad a guy as

 5   everybody says, as opposed to putting on all this

 6   evidence that explains why he's such a bad guy.             Those

 7   are two -- we've said those are reasonable choices.

 8                If you're relying on that basis, we have to

 9   decide that it is objectively unreasonable for a lawyer

10   to proceed on that basis.

11                MR. KENNEDY:      Yes, and it is in the facts of

12   this case, Mr. Chief Justice.           First, counsel didn't

13   make a reasoned strategic decision to -- to put forward

14   a certain mitigation strategy based on the mother.

15   Counsel didn't think the case was proceeding to penalty

16   phase.

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          What about the argument

18   that a good deal of mitigation evidence came out during

19   the trial on the guilt?

20                MR. KENNEDY:      It did not come out, Justice

21   Ginsburg.   A few little pieces of information were given

22   by Mrs. Brashear, Mr. Pinholster's mom.             But there was

23   no relationship of how his traumatic head injuries then

24   affected him and caused him damage.             And so the -- the

25   presentation was incomplete.           And even the State's own

                                   28

 1   expert, Dr. Stalberg, after he had actually seen all the

 2   documents that he would have wanted to receive if he was

 3   doing a mitigation mental health phase, he said it was

 4   profoundly misleading.      And it was.

 5               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           All right.      And this goes

 6   back to Justice Scalia's question.               The question which

 7   we granted -- question 1 is whether the Federal court

 8   may reject a State court adjudication of a petitioner's

 9   claim as unreasonable based on a factual predicate for

10   the claim that petitioner could have presented in the

11   State court but did not.       And that describes what you're

12   talking about in response to Justice Ginsburg.

13               Now, the Petitioner, unaccountably, has told

14   us a few minutes ago that this is a new claim, which I

15   think changes the whole question.               But it seems to me

16   the claim is whether there's ineffective assistance of

17   counsel by reason of the mitigation evidence.               And in

18   that case, we go back to Justice Scalia's opening

19   question to you:   Was it the court relied on different

20   evidence, evidence that was not in the State hearing?

21   And that's the question, whether or not they can do

22   that, if this evidence could have been presented.

23               And certainly it could have been presented.

24               MR. KENNEDY:       Well, Justice Kennedy, the

25   Ninth Circuit did make alternative rulings, but turning

                                   29

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   to the question of the new evidence, we believe the new

 2   evidence was properly considered, although the court

 3   made it clear that it would affirm based only on what

 4   was on State court, because that showing was so

 5   substantial in and of itself.

 6                  But, turning to the new evidence, there is a

 7   reason things like this happen.              In California, the

 8   claim was denied without any hearing and without any

 9   explanation.     And then the -- the case moves to Federal

10   court.   And for the first time, it's the State that

11   starts bringing forth its mental health theory to rebut

12   the offered theory and starts to question whether or not

13   Dr. Stalberg, who is our expert, has a neurology license

14   and can opine on how epilepsy affects intent and

15   culpability.

16                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Just to pause for a

17   moment, you said there was no hearing in the State

18   court.   Well, that was because the State court, pursuant

19   to the established procedures, assumed everything you

20   wanted to show was true.         It's a little bit much.          I

21   mean, you were not going to be in any better position

22   after a hearing than you were before the State court.

23                  MR. KENNEDY:      Mr. Chief Justice, the

24   California Supreme Court didn't tell us what I -- what

25   they did.   It is true that there is a procedure for

                                     30

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   provisionally assuming facts are true.              They didn't say

 2   that they did that here.

 3                And the backdrop against how this case

 4   happened in State court is we presented all of the

 5   allegations with affidavits in support of them, and the

 6   California Supreme Court issued an OSC, which normally

 7   means they think if the showing is true, it's got to be

 8   granted, and there has to be a hearing and a ruling that

 9   describes the reasoning.

10                Then the State filed in State court

11   documents, fairly conclusory, saying:              You shouldn't

12   believe Dr. Woods.     He came into this evaluation 10

13   years after the fact.       You shouldn't believe him.            You

14   shouldn't believe trial counsel.              Trial counsel was

15   disbarred.

16                And after that, the State Supreme Court

17   withdraws the OSC and issues a postcard denial.              That

18   suggests that we didn't get the procedures that are

19   referred to, at least from the State's perspective.

20                JUSTICE ALITO:           But isn't it the California

21   rule that a hearing had to have been conducted unless

22   they concluded that the petitioner was not entitled to

23   relief based on the facts alleged in the petition?

24                MR. KENNEDY:        I think that's the rule,

25   Justice Alito, but if that is what was done here,

                                     31

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                Official


 1   because it is the most commonly invoked rule, it was

 2   objectively unreasonable, because in light of the

 3   presentation that was made in State court -- and I've

 4   given the Court some of it -- that was definitely a

 5   showing of an unreasonable application of Strickland,

 6   because -

 7               JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, to get back to the

 8   question the Chief Justice asked before, trial counsel

 9   did consult a psychiatrist, Dr. Stalberg, and his report

10   was very unfavorable.

11               Now, it's your -- it's your argument that it

12   was ineffective for them not to continue their search

13   for a helpful expert and come upon Drs. Vinogradov and

14   Olson or someone like them during that period of time?

15   Is that -- is that the claim?

16               MR. KENNEDY:      I'm sorry, Justice Alito,

17   that's not my argument.      I think there are many times

18   where it would be perfectly acceptable for trial counsel

19   to hire a mental health expert, receive a report, and

20   say, based on what we have, we're not going to use this

21   route.

22               But it wasn't acceptable here, because what

23   happened here is they hired a mental health expert in

24   the middle of the guilt phase who went down on a Sunday

25   for 1 to 2 hours without any of the documents that he

                                  32

 1   said -- he said -- that he needed to do a proper

 2   mitigation investigation.        And he gave them a letter

 3   that they had to have known on its face showed

 4   Dr. Stalberg did not have enough information to render a

 5   competent psychiatric opinion.

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:           That's -- again, it would

 7   be helpful -- maybe you can't do this from the top of

 8   your head, but when I looked at the Ninth Circuit en

 9   banc decision, I found a long discussion on page 79

10   following by Chief Judge Kozinski in dissent, from which

11   I got the impression that the majority was not saying:

12   We think the State court decision here was unreasonable

13   or violated clearly established law, based on the record

14   before the State court on habeas, State habeas.

15                Now, you've just told me in the 70-page

16   opinion by Judge Smith, there's a paragraph or something

17   that says:   Even were all this issue out of it, the

18   extra evidence, we still think that looking just at the

19   evidence before the State court habeas, and just at

20   their decision, we think in light of all these things

21   you now are bringing up that that was a -- was an

22   unreasonable application of clearly established Federal

23   law, or at least was based on an unreasonable

24   determination of the facts; in other words, satisfied

25   (d).

 1                Where does it say that?              That would save me

 2   a lot of time if you know that off the top of your head.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Page 35.     I've spent all

 4   that time.

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, that's very good.

 6                (Laughter.)

 7                MR. KENNEDY:      Justice Breyer, the Ninth

 8   Circuit said:   "Although Pinholster substituted experts

 9   during the proceeding who ultimately developed different

10   mental impairment theories, these experts nonetheless

11   relied on the same background facts that Pinholster" -

12   "Pinholster presented to the State court.               Accordingly,

13   if 2254(e)(2) were to limit the scope of the evidence

14   before us, it would exclude only the new mental

15   impairment theories introduced in federal court, and

16   their exclusion would not affect our result."

17                JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, there you are, and I

18   should have asked Justice Scalia beforehand.

19                (Laughter.)

20                JUSTICE KAGAN:         Mr. Kennedy -

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             So you're putting

22   your eggs in the basket that, under AEDPA, what happened

23   here was objectively unreasonable?

24                MR. KENNEDY:      Well -

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Or do you want to go

 1   on and look at the question on which we granted cert and

 2   argue that we should look at the new evidence or that

 3   the State court should look at the new evidence?

 4                MR. KENNEDY:      Well, we think what happened

 5   here was perfectly appropriate for the court to hold a

 6   hearing.   No hearing had been held in State court, and

 7   the Federal court determined that a hearing was

 8   appropriate because Pinholster had been diligent in

 9   attempting to develop the facts, and that is the test

10   that this Court has set forth in Michael Williams.

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Well, this -- your

12   friend pointed it out, and I have to say it's a logical

13   conundrum for me, too -- you have to show under (e)(2)

14   that the factual predicate could not have been

15   previously discovered, and your claim is that his lawyer

16   should have discovered this.           They both can't be true.

17   And if the former is not true, you don't get a hearing;

18   and if the latter is not true, you don't get relief.

19                MR. KENNEDY:      Well, I guess it depends on

20   how one interprets the term "factual predicate," because

21   if we focus on mental health impairments and how

22   impairments affect intent and culpability and how it

23   plays out on the specific facts of the crime, Pinholster

24   did discover those, even though he didn't have discovery

25   or an evidentiary hearing.          He did allege them, and he

                                   35

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   should have been given a hearing where he would have

 2   then further developed those facts, just as he did in

 3   Federal court, when he received the hearing that he

 4   should have received in State court but did not.

 5                 There's nothing wrong with that.           But we

 6   don't need that view -

 7                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Could you go back to

 8   Justice Kagan's earlier question of how we draw the

 9   line?   At what level of generality is sufficient to say

10   that a factual basis of a claim has been developed?

11                 MR. KENNEDY:       I think we draw the line by

12   focusing on what is legally relevant, not a DSM opinion.

13                 I have to say, as a long-time public

14   defender, my experience is that the mental health

15   professionals often speak about the legally relevant

16   facts in different ways based on the DSM, but to focus

17   on what matters:     What was his impairment?          How did it

18   affect him?

19                 He was, right before the homicides, at the

20   house of a friend in an erratic state, saying he had a

21   message from God, brandishing a knife and putting it

22   into the door.     Dr. Stalberg, who did this mid-trial

23   evaluation, said that that was extraordinarily important

24   to him, because it showed that this was not a cold and

25   calculated murderer, as he thought when he didn't have

                                     36

 1   the information, but it showed we had a severely

 2   impaired person.    And he thought, because of his

 3   epilepsy and mental health condition, he was

 4   hypersensitive.

 5                JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, suppose a petitioner

 6   in the State post-conviction proceeding proffers an

 7   affidavit from one mental health expert alleging one

 8   type of mental disorder, and then after relief is denied

 9   in the State court, the petitioner files in Federal

10   court and asks for an evidentiary hearing at which the

11   petitioner is going to call a dozen highly distinguished

12   mental health experts who will testify to a very

13   different mental disorder.            Now, has the petitioner

14   developed the factual predicate for that claim in the

15   State proceeding?

16                MR. KENNEDY:        I think it's going to depend

17   on the facts of the case, but he's going to have a very

18   difficult time.     And that's the reason why there's -

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            But why?   Explain why

20   that -- the opinion is not a fact that's different.

21                MR. KENNEDY:        Because the opinion is based

22   on facts.   So the more differently the cases look, the

23   more they focus on different underlying facts, different

24   reasons and how they affect conduct differently, the

 1   Court's doctrines, you have to -- a petitioner who wants

 2   to go to Federal court with new experts, he's got to

 3   show first that he's exhausted, and, you know, that's

 4   going to be a problem.       And, second, that if he's

 5   exhausted, that he was diligent in trying to develop the

 6   facts in State court -

 7                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, that's very

 8   complicated, just as your opponent's idea of what

 9   constitutes a claim is very complicated and

10   fact-dependent.    What -- would it not be better to say

11   that the petitioner in the example that I gave did

12   not -- was not diligent in developing all of the

13   additional evidence that could have been brought forward

14   at the State proceeding, assuming that it could have

15   been, but was not brought forward until the Federal

16   proceeding?

17                 MR. KENNEDY:      I -

18                 JUSTICE ALITO:         The factual predicate of the

19   claim is the new evidence that's brought forward in -

20   in the Federal proceeding, and unless there is a good

21   reason why that wasn't brought forward in the State

22   proceeding, it shouldn't be considered.

23                 MR. KENNEDY:      Justice Alito, I think that

24   can and should be a part of analyzing diligence, and in

25   the particular hypothetical that Your Honor has posed,

                                    38

 1   it seems like it's going to be tough to show diligence.

 2   In this case, he does have good reasons.            The State sat

 3   back in State court and didn't really address the

 4   allegations of mental health mitigation that weren't

 5   developed.   They just simply said you shouldn't believe

 6   it; it happened too late.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Mr. Kennedy, can I bring

 8   you back to page 35?     The -- the court of appeals'

 9   opinion, Ninth Circuit's opinion, says, "Accordingly, if

10   2254(e)(2) were to limit the scope of the evidence

11   before us, it would exclude only the new mental

12   impairment theories" -- the new mental impairment

13   theories -- "introduced in federal court, and their

14   exclusion would not affect our result."

15                The State contends that there -- there was

16   other factual material, not just those theories but also

17   the 6-and-a-half-hour time sheet evidence.

18                MR. KENNEDY:      Well -

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:           So at least, you know, that

20   really doesn't cover the waterfront of -- of all new

21   evidence.

22                MR. KENNEDY:      Well, the State also says in

23   its reply brief that it's not just the affidavits; it's

24   the affidavits looked -- looked at against the backdrop

25   of the whole State court record.

                                   39

 1                JUSTICE KAGAN:           But, Mr. Kennedy, do you

 2   agree with the State that there are two things at issue

 3   here?   There's the new medical testimony, and there's

 4   also the billing sheets?

 5                MR. KENNEDY:        Well, I -- I respectfully

 6   don't, because the billing sheets in our State -

 7   there's a procedure where counsel has to submit the

 8   billing sheets to the court, and where the information

 9   comes from is the clerk's transcript in this case from

10   the State court record.

11                JUSTICE KAGAN:           Oh, but that's not -- that

12   was not presented as evidence in the State court, the

13   billing sheets?

14                MR. KENNEDY:        No, we -- we said he didn't

15   prepare at all in State court.             And then when the

16   billing sheets were revealed, Mr. Brainard, who is the

17   lawyer who did all of the witnesses at penalty phase,

18   has an entry, "begin preparing for penalty phase," and

19   every one -- that entry and every one after it is

20   6.5 hours.

21                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Could you just clarify

22   again for me?     I'm not sure I understand.          Do the

23   billing records in -- when do they get disclosed to -

24                MR. KENNEDY:        In our State, the -- the

25   appointed counsel submits a 987 form under penalty of

                                     40

 1   perjury saying these are the hours I worked; I want to

 2   be paid.   And it happens in real time, and it was done

 3   throughout the trial, and it's part of the clerk's

 4   transcript.    And the reason the district court admitted

 5   them in this case, they were -- they were exhibits 67

 6   through 72, and it's -- they were admitted because they

 7   were the records from the State court record, from the

 8   clerk's transcript.

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:           But what about -

10                 JUSTICE KAGAN:         I think what's important is

11   that they are not -- I mean, tell me if I am wrong, but

12   they were not part of the State court record on which

13   the State court made the 2254(d)(1) determination; is

14   that right?

15                 MR. KENNEDY:      Well, the -- they were not,

16   but the allegation was that they did nothing.              So it was

17   an even stronger allegation in State court than was

18   ultimately pursued at the (e)(2) hearing.

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           To say that they were on

20   record in the State court is not to say that they were

21   part of the record, of the trial record.             And these

22   things were not part of the trial record, right?

23                 MR. KENNEDY:      Well, the clerk's transcript

24   is part of the trial record.             The transcript is -- part

25   of the record is usually the reporter's transcript, the

 3   goes to the fact-finder?

 4               MR. KENNEDY:        Well -

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:             All that goes to a jury in

 6   criminal cases?

 7               MR. KENNEDY:        Oh I'm sorry, Your Honor, I

 8   didn't mean to say that.        It's not in the evidentiary

 9   portion of the record before the jury; it is part of the

10   State court record.

11               JUSTICE KAGAN:           I'm sorry, I don't know -

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               When you say the

13   State court -- you just told us that this was better off

14   because it's only 6 hours, and you said in State court

15   they did nothing; is that right?

16               MR. KENNEDY:        Yes.       Are they -

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               When you say they

18   did nothing, surely that was rhetorical hyperbole, and

19   you took the 6 hours to say this proves what we said,

20   they did nothing; they did next to nothing.               You're not

21   saying, oh, well, it was 6 hours, so we're sorry we said

22   they did nothing.

23               MR. KENNEDY:        I think what we did is we

24   confirmed the allegation that we had made in State

25   court, which is just another example of why it was

                                    42

 1   important based on these allegations for Pinholster to

 2   get a hearing to develop the record -

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Well, that's -- that

 4   gets back to the point Justice Scalia was making, is

 5   that this is new evidence that the Ninth Circuit

 6   considered with respect to the original.             In other

 7   words, they were not just saying, okay, even if none of

 8   this happened, we'd still rule against you, because one

 9   of the new things they had was the 6-hour evidence,

10   which you've just said makes your case stronger.                I

11   think it does make your case stronger, but it also makes

12   clear that we can't say let's just look -- the Ninth

13   Circuit just looked at what was there originally.

14               MR. KENNEDY:      Well, I think you can, because

15   the Ninth Circuit -- I mean, if you look at the -- if

16   the Court looks at the allegations in State court, there

17   were -- the allegations regarding counsel's performance

18   was that they did not believe that they were going to a

19   penalty phase; that, because they did not look at the

20   prosecutor's open file, they did not know that their

21   theory that they would not have a penalty phase was

22   wrong; and that they had no strategic reason

23   whatsoever -

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             You're going back to

25   arguing that you win under the original proceeding, and

 1   the question on which we granted cert -

 2                  MR. KENNEDY:      Yes.

 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             -- shouldn't be

 4   addressed.

 5                  MR. KENNEDY:      Yes.

 6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Okay.

 7                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Is -- I just want to be as

 8   clear as possible.     Justice Scalia read the sentence on

 9   page 35.     I read the heading from what Judge Kozinski

10   says, "Our review is limited to the record presented in

11   the state habeas petitions."              That's what he says.

12                  All right.     Now, you told me that the

13   sentence he read means the majority there says if our

14   record is limited to the record -- our review is limited

15   to the record presented in the State habeas petitions,

16   you still win.

17                  MR. KENNEDY:      Yes.

18                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay.    But that's not what

19   it said.     It said exactly what Justice Scalia said it

20   said, so -- which is talking about the evidence coming

21   in under (e)(2) or something.              Now, I see a nightmare in

22   front of me where I have to go through hundreds or

23   thousands of pages to try to figure out whether they did

24   or didn't mean our review is limited to the record

25   presented in the State habeas petition.

 1                  MR. KENNEDY:      Well, the -

 2                  JUSTICE BREYER:           And I can ask you, is that

 3   conceded on both sides?

 4                  MR. KENNEDY:      Well, what the Ninth Circuit

 5   majority was saying is that if there was some bar that

 6   (e)(2) had to holding a hearing where new evidence could

 7   be properly presented, that it wouldn't matter, because

 8   based on the record before it in State court, it proved

 9   a Strickland violation under Williams, Wiggins, and

10   Rompilla; and it was objectively unreasonable.

11                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes, but that -- that was

12   on the assumption that the only new evidence would have

13   been the evidence of -- how did they put it?              "The new

14   mental impairment theories introduced in federal court."

15   That that's the only new evidence that would be -- would

16   be excluded.     And the other side contradicts that.

17                  MR. KENNEDY:      Well, but I'm -- I'm sorry.

18                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Counsel, could I just

19   ask one clarifying question?              In the Second Circuit for

20   many years, you had the record on appeal which the

21   parties prepared, but you also had the record below

22   which was sent automatically to the judges to review as

23   well.   The billing records that we're talking about -

24   you say they were part of the record below -- would that

25   automatically have been sent under California law to the

                                     45

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   reviewing court?

 2                MR. KENNEDY:      Yes, because it's the same -

 3   we have automatic appeals, and the habeas is done in

 4   front of the Supreme Court.            So the entire record, I

 5   believe, is before the California Supreme Court, and

 6   it's also my understanding that the State makes the same

 7   argument in its reply brief, that it's not just

 8   Pinholster's allegations; it's Pinholster's allegations

 9   considered against the total record.

10                But even if the specific allegation of

11   6.5 hours was not there, the allegation was that counsel

12   had done nothing to prepare, that they had not spent any

13   time preparing because they wrongly believed that they

14   were not in a death penalty -

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I wouldn't believe that.   I

16   mean, you had nothing to support it.            I mean, I'd say

17   that's just lawyer's puffery -

18                MR. KENNEDY:      Well -

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- whereas you come up with

20   a record that shows 6.5 hours.            I mean, that's

21   something.

22                MR. KENNEDY:      Your Honor, the lawyers made

23   this revelation in court at trial in front of the

24   famously aggressive prosecutor and the trial judge, who

25   knew these lawyers and had sat through the hearing, and

                                   46

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   no one had any suggestion that it was puffery or it was

 2   false.    In fact, the trial prosecutor started

 3   to staunchly defend her conduct by saying, look, I

 4   offered them to look at my file and they didn't show up.

 5   Which sounds, you know, strikingly similar to Rompilla,

 6   where counsel doesn't even look at the file that will

 7   reveal that their whole defense is problematic and built

 8   on a lie.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               How long does it

10   take to read Dr. Stalberg's report that says I've looked

11   at this, I've examined this, this, and this, and there's

12   nothing here that's going to support a mental impairment

13   theory?

14                 MR. KENNEDY:       It's very short, but the

15   report, when they read that quick report on its face,

16   they had to know that he wasn't prepared enough to

17   render an opinion.     He seemed not to know about this

18   incident about I have a message from God and all of the

19   drinking and drug use beforehand.                 And the report

20   doesn't even mention the head injuries, being run over

21   by his mother and going through the window.                 Counsel had

22   to know these things, first, because that witness

23   testimony had occurred days before Dr. Stalberg's Sunday

24   interview.    And, two, at least at some point in time the

25   mother said these things happened, and they had to know

                                     47

 1   that that report didn't appear to know that there were

 2   serious traumatic head injuries.

 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Counsel, just to get

 4   back to (e)(2), what is specifically the factual

 5   predicate that could not have been previously discovered

 6   in this case?

 7                  MR. KENNEDY:      The factual predicate that

 8   could not be discovered was the evolution of the mental

 9   health testimonies, as it moved from affidavit to live

10   testimony, and the State gave for the first time

11   specific notice of how it was going to attack the

12   presentation in State court.             And all of the arguably

13   new mental health theories were in response to the

14   changes in -- that the State itself had made in Federal

15   court.

 4   the 6-hour one didn't go up?

 5                MR. BILDERBACK:           Well, of course, part of

 6   the problem is that the 6-and-a-half-hour figure is -

 7   is arrived at by purportedly adding up all of the hours

 8   spent in preparation -

16   that the Ninth Circuit relied upon were before the

18   transcript that was presented to the California Supreme

19   Court in the appeal.

20                However, there were important -- indeed, the

21   most important records, that might have shed light on

22   the amount of time that counsel actually spent

23   preparing, were never presented to the California

24   Supreme Court.   Indeed, those records were never

25   presented to the Federal court, and those were the

 1   records of Mr. Dettmar.

 2                Mr. Dettmar was the lawyer principally

 3   tasked with preparation of the case in mitigation at the

 4   penalty phase, and there were no records for Mr. Dettmar

 5   for the 6-week period leading up to and through the

 6   penalty phase.   And it -- given -

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Is that where the 6 and a

 8   half hours came from?

 9                MR. BILDERBACK:           No, the -

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:           His records -

11                MR. BILDERBACK:           No, the 6 and a half hours

12   came from Mr. Brainard's records.               Mr. Brainard was -

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Which the California court

14   had.

15                MR. BILDERBACK:           Yes.     The California court

16   had Mr. Brainard's records.            They did -

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:           So it's not new evidence,

18   then.   It wasn't new evidence before the Federal court.

19                MR. BILDERBACK:           Well, the -- again, the

20   allegation that there were only 6 and a half hours spent

21   in preparation, that allegation was never made to the

22   California Supreme Court.

23                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           But if I'm a reviewing

24   court and I'm told the lawyer spent no time preparing -

25                MR. BILDERBACK:           I beg your pardon, Your

 1   Honor.

 2                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            When I was a reviewing

 3   judge on the court of appeals, someone said he didn't

 4   spend any time doing X, Y, and Z, the first thing I went

 5   to was the billing records.              What -- do the billing

 6   records dispute that or not?

 7                 MR. BILDERBACK:            Yes.     The billing

 8   records -

 9                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            So I'm assuming -- I

10   have to assume -- I don't have to assume, but it's not

11   new evidence.     They had it before them.

12                 MR. BILDERBACK:            The billing records -

13   again, the billing records upon which the Ninth Circuit

14   arrived at its conclusion that there were only 6 and a

15   half hours was before the State court.                 However, the

16   allegation that there were only 6 and a half hours spent

17   in preparation was never presented to State court, and,

18   indeed, the records presented to the State court were

19   incomplete in a way that would not admit to that

20   conclusion.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            If you're relying on

22   allegations rather than the evidence, the allegation was

23   even worse.     The allegation was zip.

24                 MR. BILDERBACK:            Exactly.

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            No time.

                                     51

 1               MR. BILDERBACK:           But that allegation -

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, exactly, that doesn't

 3   help you.

 4               MR. BILDERBACK:           No, it does, Your Honor,

 5   because that allegation was plainly false, based upon

 6   the State court record.      The State doesn't blindly

 7   accept any factual allegation made in the petition.              It

 8   -- it reviews those allegations in light of the State

 9   court record.

10               And, in this case, as the Court indicates,

11   the State court record plainly showed that the

12   allegation that they did nothing to prepare for the

13   penalty phase was false, and, indeed, the State court

14   records showed that they began preparing for the penalty

15   phase well before the penalty phase began.

16               So the factual allegation that was presented

17   to the State court was not only false, based on the

18   State court record; it was affirmatively disproved

19   during the Federal evidentiary hearing.           It's very

20   difficult to see how we can arrive at the conclusion

21   that the State court determination was unreasonable,

22   when in fact it was correct.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:           Is this right, then?

24   First, for you to win, the first thing we have to say is

25   we're going to look at page 35, and they say, we're

                                  52

 1   looking at the State court record, the State courts

 2   were, in effect, unreasonable.            We have to say that was

 3   wrong.   We have to look through the evidence and say

 4   that was wrong.   Then you're at first base.

 5                MR. BILDERBACK:           Yes.

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:           And to get home, we now

 7   have to look at the new evidence, and there it's some

 8   combination of (a) there was nothing to have a hearing

 9   about because there's nothing here that lets you have a

10   hearing; or (b) there was something to have a hearing

11   about because this was so new that it was a new claim,

12   and you should have gone to the State court first on

13   that one, but there's no room to do it.              They don't let

14   you do it.

15                So, okay, judge in the Federal court, you

16   have the hearing, and now, when you have the hearing,

17   first see if there was the diligence.              And there wasn't.

18   That gets you home.    That's the whole argument.

19                MR. BILDERBACK:           The only point with which I

20   would -- I would take issue with the Court's

21   characterization is -- I assume the Court was not

22   speaking hypothetically.       The Court is speaking about my

23   case.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes, yes.

25                MR. BILDERBACK:           In my case, the State

                                   53

 1   court's doors are not closed.            That -

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, then why isn't this a

 3   part of the thing, if you have a new claim here, go to

 4   the State first?

 5               MR. BILDERBACK:            Because the exhaustion

 6   difficulty in this case, the exhaustion problem in this

 7   case, is a consequence of the errors that the Federal

 8   court made in doing the (d)(1) -- in failing to do the

 9   (d)(1) determination at all and in taking evidence in

10   clear derogation of (e)(2).            If you ever take evidence

11   in derogation of (e)(2), you're going to end up with an

12   unexhausted claim, and that's precisely what happened

13   here.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

15               The case is submitted.

16               (Whereupon, at 12:05 p.m., the case in the

17   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
