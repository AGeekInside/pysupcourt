 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMY FRIEDLANDER

 7                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8              MR. FRIEDLANDER:             Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 9   it please the Court:

10              Respondent has agreed with us that the ninth

11   circuit was wrong when it said that the error here and

12   the one in Stromberg were structural defects.

13              The remaining question is whether Respondent

14   can salvage the Stromberg rule by making it part of a

15   proper harmless error test as he attempted to do.

16              His harmless error test is wrong for several

17   reasons, but the Stromberg part of it was wrong for

18   basically one reason.      He makes the Stromberg rule into

19   a rule of harmless error, and it is not even a correct

20   rule of error.

21              This Court has defined "instructional error"

22   to require not merely a mistake in instruction, but a

23   reasonable likelihood that the jury misapplied the law.

24   So when Respondent says, invoking Stromberg, that to

25   instruct the jury on valid and invalid theories is


                                        3

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   harmless error if the jury adopted a valid theory, what

 2   Respondent is saying is nothing more than that no error

 3   occurred in the first place.               Because the jury found

 4   everything it needed to find in order to convict and,

 5   therefore, did not misapply the law.

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Do that again, will you?

 7                 MR. FRIEDLANDER:             We need to have a

 8   reasonable likelihood that the jury misapplied the law.

 9   That's how we get to error.               Respondent invokes

10   Stromberg to say if the jury is instructed a right way

11   and a wrong way and they went the right way, we have

12   harmless error.

13                 No.   What we really have is no error at all.

14   Because there is the -- the jury did not misapply the

15   law.     Moreover, Stromberg is not even a correct rule of

16   error.     Because under Stromberg you have error if the

17   jury could have misapplied the law.

18                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Can I interrupt you?       You

19   are saying no error occurred, and on page 11 of your

20   brief you say, "An unconstitutional instructional error

21   occurred in this case because there was a reasonable

22   likelihood the jury found," and so forth and so on.

23                 MR. FRIEDLANDER:            Yes.       I agree that error

24   occurred in this case.         What I'm trying to argue here is

25   that Respondent is entirely off base in importing the


                                          4

 1   Stromberg rule into a harmless error determination.

 2   Stromberg is, at most, a rule of error.                  The jury went

 3   the wrong way.    That is a rule of error, but it is not

 4   even a correct rule of error because under Stromberg you

 5   say, could the jury have gone the wrong way; whereas,

 6   under this Court's modern precedent you have to have a

 7   reasonable likelihood that the jury --

 8              JUSTICE STEVENS:               But you said that's what

 9   happened here.    That's what your brief says.

10              MR. FRIEDLANDER:               Yes.      I agree that there

11   was an error here but not because of Stromberg.                  Because

12   this was a reasonable likelihood that the jury

13   misapplied the law.

14              JUSTICE BREYER:               But you should have said

15   "no" to the question, I think.               Because I thought the

16   question -- whatever it was, you are saying that there

17   isn't a reasonable likelihood that its error influenced

18   the outcome.   You are not saying that?

19              MR. FRIEDLANDER:               There is a reasonable

20   likelihood that the jury misapplied the law.                  That's the

21   error question.

22              JUSTICE BREYER:               Yes.

23              MR. FRIEDLANDER:               Then the harmless error

24   question is:   Given that they misapplied the law, do we

25   know under the requisite degree of certainty --                  Chapman

 1   on direct review, Brecht here -- that they would still

 2   have found him guilty of felony murder under a proper

 3   instruction?

 4              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Do you agree that the

 5   California Supreme Court gave an incorrect explanation

 6   to the answer to that question?              They said there was no

 7   harmless error because the -- the jury made a specific

 8   finding that rebutted that, and that finding depended on

 9   the difference between the word "and" and "or."

10              MR. FRIEDLANDER:            I'm not sure I followed

11   the last part of the question, but I agree with you if

12   what you are saying is that the California Supreme

13   Court, in effect, applied a Stromberg-like test.             They

14   said "necessarily resolved."

15              JUSTICE STEVENS:            No.      I'm -- I'm

16   questioning the basis for the Supreme Court's conclusion

17   that the error was harmless.

18              MR. FRIEDLANDER:            Their basis for the

19   conclusion was the jury's "special circumstance"

20   finding.

21              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Right.

22              MR. FRIEDLANDER:            Now, they did not

23   consider, when they made that "special" -- when they

24   interpreted that "special circumstance," the "and/or"

25   mistake that was embedded in the instructions.

 1               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Which meant that the jury

 2   really hadn't answered the question they thought it had

 3   answered.

 4               MR. FRIEDLANDER:            No, it didn't mean that.

 5   We don't agree with that.          We don't believe that that is

 6   a correct interpretation of the instruction.

 7               But let me skip past that if you'll allow

 8   me.   Even if you -- even if you accent any meaning from

 9   that "special circumstance" finding -- and we don't

10   agree with that but even if you did -- you had at a

11   minimum here the nature --

12               JUSTICE STEVENS:            If you do that, you are

13   removing the basis for the California Supreme Court's

14   decision.

15               MR. FRIEDLANDER:            Well --

16               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Is that not right?

17               MR. FRIEDLANDER:            The basis --

18               JUSTICE STEVENS:            At least the basis --

19               MR. FRIEDLANDER:            The basis for the

20   California Supreme Court --

21               JUSTICE STEVENS:            The basis --

22               MR. FRIEDLANDER:            I think -- I think that --

23               JUSTICE STEVENS:            -- for the decision was a

24   -- was a specific finding --

 1   decision, yes, I think that's right.

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:             All right.

 3              MR. FRIEDLANDER:             Okay.           But it doesn't

 4   matter because we are going to apply Brecht anyway.

 5              JUSTICE ALITO:           Could you clarify the -- the

 6   category of cases that would be affected if your

 7   argument is accepted?      There would be -- an error would

 8   be -- would not be harmless under Brecht if it had a

 9   substantial or -- or injurious effect, right?

10              MR. FRIEDLANDER:             True.

11              JUSTICE ALITO:           Now, what is the standard

12   under California law for submitting a theory of

13   liability to the jury?       Presumably, you have to have

14   some evidence in support of it.

15              MR. FRIEDLANDER:             I'm not sure I understand

16   the question.   I think that goes to the question of

17   whether there is error in the first place in submitting

18   a factually unsupported theory.

19              JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, you are -- you are

20   arguing that there are instances in which, when a theory

21   of liability is submitted to the jury, the error -- and

22   it's erroneous -- the error can be harmless.

23              MR. FRIEDLANDER:             Yes.

24              JUSTICE ALITO:           Correct?            Now, what are the

25   -- what is the standard under California law for

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   submitting the theory of liability to the jury in the

 2   first place?   You have to have -- presumably, there has

 3   to be some evidence in support of that, right?               How

 4   much?

 5              MR. FRIEDLANDER:             I don't think -- I don't

 6   think I know the answer to that question.               It would

 7   certainly be error under California State law if there

 8   is a reasonable -- if they have the same reasonable

 9   likelihood standard that the Federal courts have, if

10   there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury

11   misapplied the law.

12              Now, in a -- but you seem to be focusing on

13   an evidentiary sufficiency, and I think that's governed

14   by Griffith where if you -- if you have an insufficient

15   -- if you have insufficient evidence to support the

16   theory, then it's inappropriate --

17              JUSTICE ALITO:           What I'm asking is:      When is

18   there going to be a case in which a theory of liability

19   is submitted to the jury and it's -- and it's erroneous

20   -- multiple theories are submitted; one erroneous.                 And

21   yet it would turn out that the submission of the

22   erroneous theory did not have a substantial or injurious

23   effect.

24              MR. FRIEDLANDER:             This one -- this case --

25   this case was submitted to the jury on two alternative


                                        9

 1   theories:   One of them correct, pre- killing aiding and

 2   abetting; one of them incorrect, post-killing aiding and

 3   abetting.   And it didn't have a substantial injurious

 4   effect because we know that at an absolute minimum here

 5   the jury found that the defendant acted -- aided and

 6   abetted robbery with reckless indifference to human life

 7   and was a major participant in the robbery.             And those

 8   findings were not compatible with post-killing aiding

 9   and abetting.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought there was --

11   that there was this -- there were three possibilities,

12   and one was that the defendant didn't do anything

13   before, didn't do anything during, but was simply an

14   accessory after the fact.

15               If the jury believed that, then there was no

16   way it could convict him of the crime that he was

17   convicted of.

18               MR. FRIEDLANDER:            Well, the jury rejected

19   accessory after the fact but --

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How do we know that?    Was

21   there a special verdict?

22               MR. FRIEDLANDER:            They were instructed on

23   accessory after the fact as the lesser offense and they

24   found in essence robbery and felony murder.

25               JUSTICE SOUTER:            They found the greater


                                       10

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   offense, so there would have been no need for them to go

 2   to the lesser included offense.              Your trouble is -- and

 3   I think the problem that we are having is that in

 4   finding the greater offense, they may have done so under

 5   a theory of accomplice liability that was consistent

 6   with the accomplice simply coming in at a late stage in

 7   the proceedings.

 8              MR. FRIEDLANDER:             Yes.       That's right.

 9              JUSTICE SOUTER:             I mean, that's the

10   difficulty we are having.

11              MR. FRIEDLANDER:             Yes.       There is a

12   reasonable likelihood that in deciding felony murder

13   they failed to decide that he engaged in the robbery

14   before the killing.

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Right.

16              MR. FRIEDLANDER:             However, they went and

17   found the special circumstance in which they found

18   reckless, aiding and abetting with reckless indifference

19   to human life and as a major participant.

20              JUSTICE SOUTER:             I thought the, the

21   difficulty with using that as a means of answering the

22   first error was that the way the special circumstance

23   instruction was phrased, they could have found the

24   special circumstance without finding anything more than

25   that he came in at a late stage.

 1              MR. FRIEDLANDER:            No.      That's not correct.

 2   I don't believe that's correct.              It is true that part of

 3   the instruction, that and/or difficulty, focused on a

 4   different question, a different point, said that if you

 5   -- if they -- I'm blanking out but --

 6              JUSTICE SOUTER:            The second -- go ahead.

 7              MR. FRIEDLANDER:            It didn't address the

 8   reckless indifference to human life and the major

 9   participant, but that was embedded in the instructions,

10   and from the start the courts that have looked at this

11   and have reached this question have all agreed that

12   there was a jury finding of reckless indifference to

13   human life and major participant, and they have

14   disagreed as to what it might have meant.                    Okay?   Now,

15   the U.S. district court --

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How do we -- in this --

17   how do we know what the jury found?                    They just came in

18   with a guilty verdict; is that right?

19              MR. FRIEDLANDER:            No.      They came in with a

20   special circumstance finding.            The special circumstance

21   finding that this was --

22              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Isn't the special

23   circumstance finding the one that had the word "or" in

24   it, and therefore allowed the jury to give a post-

25   killing interpretation of the event.

 1                MR. FRIEDLANDER:            No.      The special --

 2                JUSTICE STEVENS:            I thought that was what

 3   the California Supreme Court relied on?

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I agree with Justice

 5   Stevens.    I thought that was the whole problem, the "or"

 6   and the "and" is the problem for you.

 7                MR. FRIEDLANDER:            The -- I'll read from JA

 8   14.   This is the special circumstance instruction that

 9   was -- was mistaken:       "The murder was committed while

10   the defendant was engaged in the commission or attempted

11   commission of a robbery, or the murder was committed in

12   order to carry out or advance the commission of the

13   crime of robbery, et cetera."

14                Now, that -- that finding alone we agree if

15   you -- if you -- if you just follow that finding, that

16   doesn't implicate the defendant.                But you have to read

17   at JA 13, the instruction, JA 13:                 "The defendant with

18   reckless indifference to human life and as a major

19   participant aided and abetted in the commission of a

20   robbery which resulted in the death of Flores."                 That's

21   at JA 13.

22                So there were multiple findings here.                 And

23   -- and the district court which -- this is at the bottom

24   of the first paragraph of JA 13.

25                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes, but isn't -- maybe I'm

 1   not getting it.    Help me out here.                One possibility

 2   under -- under the instruction at JA 13 is "or assisted

 3   in the crime of robbery."           And the other instructions

 4   because they are erroneous leave open the possibility of

 5   finding that he assisted in the crime of robbery only if

 6   he came in late.   And that's why it does not solve the

 7   original error.

 8               MR. FRIEDLANDER:             No.      The -- the problem

 9   with the, I think you're mixing up two things here.

10               JUSTICE SOUTER:             I may be doing that.

11               MR. FRIEDLANDER:             The felony murder

12   instructions did not speak to this question of

13   contemporaneity.   They left it open.                     That was error.

14   We acknowledge that that was error.                      Okay?   So they

15   arguably find felony murder, aiding and abetting felony

16   murder based on post- killing aiding and abetting.                         Now,

17   the jury has to get to the special circumstance finding,

18   right?

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Yes.

20               MR. FRIEDLANDER:             And now it has to decide,

21   among other things, as I -- as I read to you, "did he

22   aid and abet robbery with reckless indifference to human

23   life and as a major participant in the commission of a

24   robbery which resulted in the death of Flores?"                       That's

25   at JA 13.   So what we --

 1               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Where does it say that he

 2   must have assisted prior to --

 3               MR. FRIEDLANDER:            It doesn't.       It doesn't

 4   say that.

 5               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Then that doesn't cure the

 6   error.

 7               MR. FRIEDLANDER:            Yes, it does, and the

 8   reason that it does is because the harmless error test

 9   is not whether the jury actually made the finding that

10   it needed to make; rather, the harmless error test is do

11   we know from the evidence and from the findings that the

12   jury would have made the findings that it was required

13   to make had it been properly instructed?

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It seems to me that

15   you're arguing one of two things:                First, that there was

16   no error at all under Stromberg; or second, that if

17   there was error, it was harmless error.                 And I thought

18   the case was about whether or not the Ninth Circuit

19   erred in concluding that harmless error analysis didn't

20   apply to a Stromberg error.

21               MR. FRIEDLANDER:            Yes.       I'm not arguing the

22   first point.   I -- I concede there was error.                I just

23   wanted to make the point that Stromberg itself is an

24   incorrect rule of error.         But I can see that that's led

25   us down a path that I didn't need to go down.

 1                Now, we are certainly arguing harmless

 2   error.    As for the Ninth Circuit's opinion, we said --

 3   the Ninth Circuit said this is structural error.              We

 4   don't even start a harmless error analysis.

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The district court didn't

 6   say that.

 7                MR. FRIEDLANDER:            No, it did not.   And --

 8   and we said that's wrong.           This is trial error, not

 9   structural error.

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So if we were to say,

11   Ninth Circuit, you were wrong, but the district court

12   was right --

13                MR. FRIEDLANDER:            Well, the district court

14   was right to the extent that it found it to be trial

15   error.    It was wrong to the extent that it found it to

16   be prejudicial trial error.             But Respondent has agreed

17   with us that this is not structural error, that we need

18   to do a harmless error analysis, and what Respondent has

19   done is import into this harmless error analysis we are

20   saying the Stromberg rule; and it doesn't belong there.

21                The Stromberg rule is not a proper rule of

22   harmless error.    It's at most a rule of error.            I'd

23   like --

24                JUSTICE STEVENS:            But do you not agree that

25   the harmless error -- the -- the rationale of the

 1   California Supreme Court was incorrect?

 2                MR. FRIEDLANDER:              Was the rationale

 3   incorrect?    If --

 4                JUSTICE STEVENS:              In the harmless error

 5   analysis.    Actually, I'm agreeing with you that there

 6   should have been harmless error.                  Did it perform the

 7   proper --

 8                MR. FRIEDLANDER:              It's incorrect in the way

 9   that you're thinking it is incorrect, but it was also

10   incorrect in another way.             It was incorrect in a way

11   that it applied too strict a standard.                     It said has this

12   question been necessarily been resolved; and it said

13   yes, it has been necessarily resolved.                     Well, that's not

14   the question.   The harmless error question --

15                JUSTICE STEVENS:              The -- answer was

16   incorrect, too, wasn't it?             And that answer was

17   incorrect?

18                MR. FRIEDLANDER:              That answer was incorrect;

19   and as well as what you're thinking, it was incorrect,

20   in that they premised it on a factual basis that was not

21   in fact the case.      But I better reserve time for

22   rebuttal.

 1              ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 2                          AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 3                  SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 4              MR. SHAH:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 5   please the Court:

 6              I think the Chief Justice framed the main

 7   issue in this case properly.             Consistent with the last

 8   two decades of this Court's instructional error

 9   jurisprudence, the Court should hold that the type of

10   error at issue is not structural and is subject to

11   harmless error review.

12              The Ninth Circuit's contrary interpretation

13   of Stromberg creates the untenable result that adding an

14   invalid theory -- adding a valid theory to an invalid

15   one somehow makes the error worse.                  Even Respondent now

16   rejects that interpretation.             It follows that this Court

17   should reverse the Ninth Circuit and remand for

18   application of harmless error review under Brecht.

19              The main issue --

20              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               That's what the district

21   judge did, right?

22              MR. SHAH:        Yes, Your Honor.             The district

23   court did apply harmless error review under Brecht.                     The

24   court of appeals, of course, did not.

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               It could just review the

 1   district court's decision using the standards that the

 2   district court used?

 3                 MR. SHAH:     This Court could do that, but the

 4   longstanding and customary practice of this Court is

 5   that when the court of appeals does not address the

 6   harmless error question, that it remands to that court.

 7   It did that in Rose V. Clark, in Pope V. Illinois and

 8   California V. Roy, and more recently in Recuenco.

 9                 And in several of those cases the

10   intermediate court or the district court, in the habeas

11   context, did address it and the court of appeals didn't

12   in all of those cases that the Court did remand for

13   application of harmless error.

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I wasn't questioning

15   that.   The issue, is the United States position say

16   structural error was wrong, harmless error was right,

17   and then just have the Ninth Circuit review the district

18   court's decision that held that there was harmless error

19   the way it would ordinarily review a district court

20   decision?

21                 MR. SHAH:     Yes, Your Honor, but I would add

22   that this Court should also clarify the scope of that

23   harmless error inquiry.         I think there are two important

24   principles.    There is no logical reason to apply a

25   narrower form of harmless error review in this case than


                                        19

 1   the Court did in Neder.

 2                 So I think that this Court should clarify

 3   that the principles of harmlessness articulated in Neder

 4   should apply on remand to the Ninth Circuit.             I think

 5   those of those principles bear mention.

 6                 First, the question is not what the jury

 7   actually or necessarily found, but rather, it

 8   encompasses what a rationale jury would have found

 9   absent the error.

10                 And I think the second important point for

11   this Court to clarify is that harmlessness review is not

12   limited to cases, is not limited to cases where the

13   relevant elements are undisputed, but rather even when

14   disputed, a reviewing court should consider the entire

15   record and determine whether, in light of the jury

16   finding, there is sufficient evidence to support a

17   contrary verdict.    And then it should remand, Your

18   Honor, to the court of appeals to apply those

19   principles.

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Why do you say in light of

21   the jury finding when you have disavowed any necessity

22   that the jury had found this?

23                 MR. SHAH:     Well, Your Honor, we do --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I mean "in light of the

25   jury finding," why don't you just drop that.

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              MR. SHAH:         Well, Your Honor, we think it's

 2   important because there are certain jury findings that

 3   we know the jury made in this case.                       The jury returned a

 4   special circumstance verdict.               And we know based upon

 5   that verdict that at a minimum, the jury found that

 6   Respondent was a major participant in the crime -- just

 7   taking the facts of this case, the Respondent was a

 8   major participant in the robbery, that he exhibited a

 9   reckless disregard for human life.

10              And we also know that the jury rejected a

11   duress defense.     The jury was instructed on that

12   defense, and yet the jury came back guilty.

13              So I don't think that the -- that the

14   inquiry should take place in a vacuum, but, of course,

15   the reviewing court should have the benefit of the

16   limited jury findings that we do know were made, and

17   then apply the sufficiency inquiry in light of those

18   jury findings.    There is no reason to disregard the jury

19   findings that were made.

20              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Suppose it's not, in

21   the abstract anyway, necessarily true that this case

22   follows a fortiori, because here, at least you have a

23   valid theory.     That may make it a harder case, because

24   the jury had based its entire verdict on an invalid

25   theory.


                                         21
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 It may be more difficult than a situation

 2   where you've got a theory of the case that is invalid

 3   because a particular element is missing.                   And you can

 4   look and see whether or not that was harmless or not.

 5                 MR. SHAH:      I would disagree, Mr. Chief

 6   Justice.     I think there are two possibilities in a case

 7   with alternative theories.            One possibility is that the

 8   jury relies upon the defective instruction.                   For

 9   example, there is one element omitted just like the

10   instruction in Neder.        If that's what the jury had done,

11   then this case is no different than Neder, no better, no

12   worse, right.

13                 The other possibility, however, is that the

14   jury relies on the completely valid theory.                   If the jury

15   relied on the completely valid theory, then there is

16   even less of a problem than Neder.                   There is no problem

17   at all.

18                 So I don't see how the error in this

19   alternative valid theory and defense theory circumstance

20   could be any --

21                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            The difference is when you

22   only got one theory, you know what he relied on.                    When

23   you got alternatives, how do you know which one he

24   relied on?

25                 MR. SHAH:      Well, you don't -- you don't,


                                         22

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Your Honor.     And that's what the reviewing court has to

 2   decide.    But in either scenario, if it -- if you assume

 3   that the jury relied on the defective theory, then we

 4   are in the same box as in Neder, and the reviewing court

 5   would decide whether there was -- you know, they would

 6   apply the harmless error review to the missing element

 7   and decide whether there was sufficient evidence to

 8   render that error harmless; or the court could ask,

 9   well, is that uncontraverted or overwhelming evidence

10   that the defendant would have been found guilty under

11   the valid theory.

12                 And that would also be a permissible

13   inquiry.

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I guess,

15   though, the point is when you have invalid and valid

16   theories, it would be a little harder than Neder,

17   because they don't have to make any findings under the

18   valid theory.    You know, because you don't just have to

19   fill in a missing piece of the puzzle, as in Neder.                   You

20   have to -- they might have been working on an entirely

21   different puzzle.

22                 MR. SHAH:      Well, Your Honor, in almost all

23   conceivable cases there is going to be at least some

24   overlap between -- between the two theories.                   And what

25   the -- the reason why that's relevant is because you


                                         23
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   know that when the jury has returned a general verdict

 2   of guilt, they have necessarily found beyond a

 3   reasonable doubt that each of those elements has been

 4   satisfied.

 5                JUSTICE STEVENS:           No.      But in this case the

 6   question is whether the uncle did it or the nephew did

 7   it.   And if there is a lot of doubt about -- about -- if

 8   there is substantial reason to believe maybe it was the

 9   uncle, they might have taken the easy case out.                I think

10   this is vastly different from a single theory case.

11                MR. SHAH:     Well, Your honor, here's why --

12                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Because it's an -- there

13   is plenty of evidence that he might have been guilty

14   after the fact.   There is no doubt about that.              But

15   there is doubt about the former.

16                MR. SHAH:     Your Honor, here's why I think

17   the cases aren't that different, because, you know, at a

18   minimum from the general verdict of guilt if you take a

19   case like this, you know that the jury found that there

20   was an unlawful killing.         You know that the jury found

21   that there was a robbery.          You know that the jury found

22   that Respondent was involved in the robbery.               The only

23   element that we don't know --

24                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Perhaps after -- after the

25   death occurred.   That's all we really know.

 1              MR. SHAH:      It is possible that the jury

 2   would have found that, and that's the question that the

 3   reviewing court would perform in harmless error review,

 4   just like if there -- basically that is the exact same

 5   question the Court would form, would do under Neder if

 6   the timing element were omitted all together.                The

 7   reviewing court would look at the evidence and decide is

 8   there sufficient evidence to support an after-the-fact

 9   participation.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So what we are

11   talking about, in other words, is the application of

12   harmless error, which may or may not be harder in the

13   multiple theory case, and not the question of whether

14   harmless error analysis should be applied.

15              MR. SHAH:      Yes, Your Honor.             That's going to

16   be completely fact dependent whether it's harder or not.

17   But I think analytically it's exactly the same as in

18   Neder.

19              JUSTICE ALITO:          Aren't there going to be

20   cases in which there's enough evidence to support the

21   submission of a theory of liability to the jury, but so

22   little that the court is going to be able to say that

23   it's harmless under -- that the submission of the

24   invalid theory was harmless under Brecht?

25              MR. SHAH:      Yes.        I mean, you can image in a


                                      25

 1   case -- take Neder.       By this Neder instruction, the one

 2   omitting the materiality element, was submitted to the

 3   jury certainly enough evidence to support it, and then

 4   there was another valid theory --

 5                 JUSTICE ALITO:         There is difference.    An

 6   element of the defense has to be submitted to the jury.

 7   And it may be that that it's -- the element is

 8   undisputed, but a theory of liability isn't going to be

 9   submitted to the jury unless there is some evidence to

10   support it.

11                 MR. SHAH:     Well, Your Honor, if -- if there

12   is some evidence to support it, if we were in a direct

13   review context, that's the inquiry that Neder says.               So

14   on a clean slate it might be that if there is sufficient

15   evidence to support a contrary verdict, that that would

16   end the inquiry.

17                 But in many of these cases we are going to

18   know that the jury has made at least some findings, has

19   found some of the elements.             And that might inform the

20   harmless error inquiry, just like in this as we know

21   that the jury has found things like a respondent was a

22   major participant, exhibited a reckless disregard for

23   human life, discounted a significant portion of this --

24   of his statement by rejecting the duress defense.

25                 If there are no further questions, Your

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, Mr. Shah.

 4               ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. BRADLEY O'CONNELL

 5                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 6                 MR. O'CONNELL:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 7   it please the Court:

 8                 Unlike the Sarausad case argued earlier this

 9   morning, this is a case of conceded constitutional error

10   under the reasonable likelihood standard, the same

11   question that consumed so much of the Sarausad argument.

12                 We acknowledge that this is a trial error

13   and is subject to the Brecht prejudice standard.                      And as

14   I believe Justice Souter commented during the Sarausad

15   argument, in a Brecht situation, the defendant wins the

16   benefit of the doubt.       That is a lesson of this Court's

17   decision.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I agree with that.           And my

19   question is going to be -- at some point, both of you

20   seem to agree with that so -- pretty much, it's a

21   harmless error standard of review.                  I think a wrote a

22   case on that, which says that --

23                 MR. O'CONNELL:         Yes.       You wrote on O'Neal,

24   Your Honor.

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Right.           So why don't we

 1   just send it back and say apply the standard?

 2               MR. O'CONNELL:           Your Honor, although the

 3   Ninth Circuit admittedly used a structural defect

 4   nomenclature with which we don't agree, we believe that

 5   the Court can't -- that upon considering both the Ninth

 6   Circuit decision and the district court decision, this

 7   Court can affirm because the inquiry which the Ninth

 8   Circuit did conduct was actually a case-specific

 9   inquiry, not really a structural defect inquiry, and

10   when an examination of the evidence and the verdicts and

11   the instructions and anything else indicative of the

12   jury's thinking still leaves the court uncertain whether

13   the jurors relied on the valid or the invalid theory,

14   that's a substantial and injurious influence.                That is

15   grave doubt.   That is equipoise, in the language of Your

16   Honor's opinion.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:             You're saying that I should

18   have grave doubt myself and any judge would have to.                He

19   made an argument here I think that wasn't such a bad

20   one.   He said look at page 14 and you'll see the

21   mistake, you know, in the joint appendix.

22               MR. O'CONNELL:           Yes, Your Honor.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:             There it is.     And it's

24   absolutely wrong.    The basic instruction under the law

25   says you have to be engaged in the crime and you have to


                                        28
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   have a certain state of intent.              You have to have

 2   committed this murder in order to help the crime or at

 3   least in order to escape.

 4              MR. O'CONNELL:           Yes, Your Honor.

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:             And that's wrong.           Put them

 6   together, but then look at the instruction on page 13,

 7   which he actually gave, and the one on 13 really does

 8   seem to say that, or more so.             It says, you can only

 9   apply -- jury, you can only apply this special

10   instruction if two things are true:                     First, in lines 9

11   through 12 of that instruction, it seems to repeat that

12   you have to be engaged in the crime.                    And then just

13   before that, it says, and you have to have one of two

14   states of mind.   You have to either intend to kill the

15   person or at least be recklessly indifferent.                     And since

16   that's what we said on page 13, the fact we made a

17   mistake on page 14 doesn't matter that much.                     That's one

18   of his arguments that I'm sure they have a lot of

19   evidentiary ones and a bunch of other ones.

20              MR. O'CONNELL:           Your Honor, I think the

21   answer to that question is in the underlying trial

22   reporter's transcript at pages 1015 to 1016, the

23   district attorney's cross-examination of Mr. Pulido.

24   The district attorney developed the theme quite

25   effectively that, even under Mr. Pulido's own account,


                                       29
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   he exhibited reckless indifference because he saw the

 2   mortally wounded victim lying there, and the D.A. said,

 3   did you try to resuscitate him?                Have you ever had a CPR

 4   class?   I did once.      Well, did you do CPR on him?              No.

 5   Did you call 9-11?      You didn't care whether he lived or

 6   died, did you?

 7               So this entire line of cross-examination, to

 8   which the district attorney came back again, though

 9   somewhat less dramatically, at 1330 of the transcript

10   and again at 1337 to 1338, commenting that he -- that

11   Mr. Pulido did not go back in at some later point to

12   check on the victim's condition, that entire line of

13   cross-examination encouraged the theme that even under

14   Mr. Pulido's own account of the facts, he showed

15   reckless indifference.         And --

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   So the error wasn't

17   harmless.   And that's an argument you can make before

18   the Ninth Circuit on remand.

19               MR. O'CONNELL:            That certainly is an

20   argument that if the Court -- if the Court is convinced

21   that the Ninth Circuit's analysis in substance --

22   because I realize the nomenclature -- the nomenclature

23   was inconsistent with harmless error, and I'm not going

24   to defend that.   If the Court is convinced that the

25   substance of the Ninth Circuit's analysis was so far


                                         30

 1   removed from what harmless error analysis requires in

 2   this context, we agree that the usual course would be to

 3   send it back.

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, why don't we

 5   just take them at their word?            As you say, they are

 6   applying the wrong nomenclature.              It would be easy

 7   enough for them when they get it back to say, oh, we

 8   meant, you know, harmless error under Brecht.                 But that

 9   seems to me to be at least an open question.

10              MR. O'CONNELL:          Your Honor, I think I could

11   best answer that by offering my own critique of the

12   Ninth Circuit opinion and -- which may explain why it

13   may be unnecessary.     In my opinion, what the analysis

14   that the Ninth Circuit conducted was equivalent to a

15   sufficient analysis, equivalent to the point of

16   equipoise discussed in O'Neal.             That is to say, it

17   reviewed the evidence and said -- and the verdicts and

18   the instructions -- and said we're uncertain, we can't

19   tell which way the jury went.

20              My critique of the Ninth Circuit's -- at

21   least its per curiam opinion, as opposed to one of the

22   concurring opinions, is that in fact this is not just a

23   general verdict case.      We know a great deal about the

24   jurors' thinking in this case.             We know that by a vote

25   of either 8-4 or 4-8, the jurors rejected the


                                      31
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   prosecution's primary theory, which was that Pulido

 2   personally shot the victim and that, in the prosecutor's

 3   words, Aragon had nothing to do with this, Aragon wasn't

 4   there, Aragon isn't a murderer.

 5                 We also know -- and this will be another

 6   echo of the Sarausad case -- we also know that

 7   throughout their five days of deliberations, the jurors

 8   submitted question after question directed to what are

 9   now -- what are concededly defective erroneous

10   instructions, and moreover, those questions focused

11   right in on the defect in the instructions and in

12   particular the timing of Mr. Pulido's assistance.

13                 And I refer the Court in particular to the

14   jurors' handwritten diagrams of alternative conceptions

15   of felony-murder aiding and abetting liability, which

16   are at 36 to 38 of the joint appendix, and also the

17   jurors' question at page 41 of the joint appendix

18   whether -- this goes right -- this goes, as the district

19   court said, to the crux of the issue:                    Does the

20   defendant have to have knowledge before or during the

21   crime of the -- of the unlawful purpose of the

22   perpetrator?    And as to both of those questions the

23   judge said:    Go back and reread those same instructions,

24   which of course were erroneous.

25                 So my critique of the Ninth Circuit opinion,


                                        32

 1   which is again slightly different, I think, than the

 2   State's, would be that it neglected to mention that

 3   compelling evidence that in fact the jurors actually

 4   found a set of facts corresponding to the invalid late

 5   joiner theory, because in my view what -- the analysis

 6   the Ninth Circuit conducted gets us to a point of

 7   equipoise, and that's enough for Brecht.                The defect in

 8   the Ninth Circuit's analysis is they neglected to also

 9   factor in those juror queries, and in my view the juror

10   queries move us from a state of equipoise to a very high

11   probability that the jurors relied on the -- and adopted

12   a factual scenario corresponding to an invalid theory.

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Under Brecht, you

14   have the burden of showing a substantial injurious

15   effect.

16              MR. O'CONNELL:          Well, actually, Your Honor,

17   as understand O'Neal the Court specifically renounced

18   describing it as a burden, and in fact said that we are

19   not going to use the "burden" terminology, and rather

20   than talk about allocating burdens, we are going to

21   address it from the perspective of the judge and say, if

22   the judge is in equipoise, that is sufficient.

23              We also know that -- drawing upon the

24   relationship between the Brecht standard and others, we

25   know that a Strickland standard is deemed to -- that if


                                      33
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   you have Strickland prejudice, you don't have to go

 2   through a separate Brecht analysis.                      Because of

 3   Strickland, reasonable probability also satisfies

 4   Brecht's substantial and injurious influence.                         Well,

 5   this Court has said again and again, in construing

 6   Strickland, it does not require a more likely than not

 7   showing; it simply requires a showing sufficient to

 8   undermine confidence in the outcome.                      And --

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   So you think you win

10   under Brecht?

11              MR. O'CONNELL:            I think we will under

12   Brecht, Your Honor.

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   You think the Ninth

14   Circuit, although it didn't use that label, actually

15   applied the Brecht standard?

16              MR. O'CONNELL:            In substance, it did even

17   though, as I said, I will -- I can't -- I can't run from

18   the language the Ninth Circuit actually used.

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Sure.     Well, then it

20   seems to me you agree with your friend that the Brecht

21   standard -- and the government -- that the Brecht

22   standard applies.

23              MR. O'CONNELL:            Yes, we do, Your Honor.

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   And all the fight is

25   over is whether the Ninth Circuit applied that standard

 1   or not?

 2               MR. O'CONNELL:          Yes, Your Honor, whether it

 3   applied it in substance.

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Why don't we just

 5   send it back and ask them?          Say:       We can't tell.    The

 6   parties are having disagreement about what you did.

 7   What did you do?

 8               MR. O'CONNELL:          Your Honor, as I said a

 9   little earlier, if I fail to persuade the Court that the

10   substance of what the Ninth Circuit did was --

11   effectively satisfied Brecht as interpreted in O'Neal,

12   then I agree that's an appropriate course, and we

13   indicated that in the final section of our brief.                There

14   is not --

15               JUSTICE BREYER:            I'm sure that would be -- I

16   mean, what worries me is proliferating arguments among

17   judges.   Why not just say, you know, apply Brecht.               I'd

18   like it with the O'Neal clause because it seems to me

19   the O'Neal clause applies.

20               MR. O'CONNELL:          I agree, Your Honor.

21               JUSTICE BREYER:            Just go do it.      And then

22   they can say "we already did it," or they can say "we

23   didn't already do it, but we'll do it now."                Let them

 1   don't -- I don't strenuously object to that because, as

 2   I've mentioned if the court, if the court remains,

 3   remains of the view that what the Ninth Circuit did was

 4   simply incompatible with Brecht, then I agree it should

 5   be sent back and I -- and I understand why that might be

 6   the Court's inclination.           Let me offer another angle for

 7   why what the Ninth Circuit did is entirely compatible

 8   with Brecht.

 9               In civil cases, this Court routinely applies

10   the same sort of general verdict analysis which in

11   criminal cases has become to be known as the Stromberg

12   line.   In fact, it did it as recently this summer in the

13   Exxon Valdez case.      Now civil cases don't have Chapman,

14   they don't have structural defect; civil cases are

15   subject to a harmless error standard which ultimately

16   goes back to the identical statute which was construed

17   in Kotteakos.

18               And going back to the opinion of the Court

19   in O'Neal, in addressing the relationship between

20   Kotteakos/Brecht harmless error review and civil

21   harmless error review, the Court indicated he think

22   rather strongly that those standards are either

23   equivalent or to the extent that they differ, the

24   Brecht/ Kotteakos standard is less forgiving of error

25   because of the liberty interest at stake.                 Now that


                                         36

 1   means two things.    From a retrospective point of view of

 2   simply construing this Court's different lines of cases,

 3   I think it demonstrates that this general verdict

 4   analysis is entirely consistent with a Kotteakos type

 5   harmless error analysis, but it also has some

 6   perspective implications, because if this Court were to

 7   wholly disavow that type of analysis and say that has

 8   nothing to do with harmless error review, that's going

 9   to impact civil cases, too; and obviously in all this

10   Court's opinions, the Court is considering not only the

11   immediate case, but what is going to happen if we -- if

12   we rule one way or another.

13              So this case -- this case supports a finding

14   of prejudice under that O'Neal equipoise and as for the

15   Ninth Circuit did, that's not what it called it, it even

16   more strongly supports prejudice when one factors in the

17   rest of the record, notably the juror -- the juror

18   queries and another item which I think may be responsive

19   to some of Justice Alito's earlier questions, which is

20   the strength of the evidence on the various theories.

21              There were three theories and obviously

22   there was evidence in support of the prosecution's main

23   theory that Pulido shot the victim himself.              There was

24   evidence -- obviously there was substantial evidence in

25   the form of Pulido's own testimony in support of the


                                        37
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   invalid late-joiner theory.            Out of these the one theory

 2   that had least support in the record before the jury was

 3   the valid aiding and abetting theory, because no witness

 4   testified to a scenario in which Pulido assisted in some

 5   fashion or another prior to the shooting; nor did the

 6   prosecutor attempt to develop that type of scenario in

 7   argument because the prosecutor was very clear:

 8   Prosecutor said you're going to get aiding and abetting

 9   instructions just in case.          They only apply -- if --

10   they only come into play if you were to believe the

11   defendant's story which was a real whopper; but if you

12   believe the defendant's story the felony murder rule

13   applies.

14              But then the prosecutor immediately went

15   back, "but I don't think it applies at all, Aragon

16   wasn't there.   Aragon didn't do it.                    Pulido did it," and

17   prosecutor went back to his primary theory.

18              So the theory which the -- present in the

19   instructions was least before the jury, was the valid

20   aiding and abetting theory, yet defining this conceded

21   error harmless depends on the notion either that the

22   jury actually adopted a pre-shooting aiding or abetting

23   or that they necessarily would have adopted one if

24   properly instructed.

25              There is one final point I'd like to make,


                                       38

 1   which is there is a qualitative aspect to Brecht; and

 2   when one has an error under which the defense testimony

 3   even if believed renders the defendant guilty

 4   erroneously, that derails the entire defense.                   That it

 5   seems to me is the quintessential substantial and

 6   injurious influence; because it practically renders the

 7   trial nullity by erroneously telling the jury even if

 8   you find this set of facts, the defendant is guilty.

 9                So for these reasons and additionally for

10   the very thorough prejudice analysis found in the

11   district court opinion, we urge the Court to affirm,

12   despite the Ninth Circuit's inept nomenclature, but in

13   the event the Court is dissatisfied with that

14   explanation, we have acknowledged that the appropriate

15   course in that instance would be to send it back under

16   Brecht.

17               Unless the Court has any further questions,

18   I'm prepared to submit.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

20   Mr. O'Connell.

24             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMY FRIEDLANDER

25                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 1                 MR. FRIEDLANDER:           We agree that we need to

 2   do Brecht.    We disagree on what Brecht is.                 Respondent

 3   is telling you that Brecht is the error test, whether

 4   the jury relied on the valid or invalid theory.                   That's

 5   what he says Brecht is.         In Calderon v Coleman, this

 6   Court said there is a difference between the error test

 7   and the harmless error test.

 8                 All these questions that the jury asked went

 9   to the question of error.           Did the jury misapply the law

10   by failing to find a contemporaneity aspect of felony

11   murder?   They did not go to the harmless error question

12   of what the jury would have done had it been properly

13   instructed.

14                 We urge the Court in remanding the case to

15   make clear that the error analysis must be kept separate

16   from the harmless error analysis.                 This is a mistake

17   Judge Thomas made in his concurring opinion.                   We -- he

18   assumes -- he sees a mistake in an instruction; he

19   assumes that the mistake rises to the level of

20   constitutional error; and then he does a prejudice

21   analysis by deciding whether the mistake caused the jury

22   to misapply the law.       In other words, he -- he applies

23   an error analysis to decide prejudice.                   And what he does

24   is he includes all this evidence of the questions the

25   jury asked when those questions went only to the


                                        40

 1   misapplication of law that was the error, and did

 2   nothing to show the basis of the jury's special

 3   circumstance finding, which is the heart of the harmless

 4   error determination here.          If there are no further

 5   questions.

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

 7   Mr. Friedlander.   The case is submitted.
