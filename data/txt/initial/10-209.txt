 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Case 10-209, Lafler v. Cooper.

 5                 Mr. Bursch.


 6                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH


 7                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 8                MR. BURSCH:     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,


 9   and may it please the Court:


10                 There are three points that I would like to

11   press this morning regarding deficient plea advice.

12   First, this Court has consistently limited the effective

13   assistance right to ensuring the reliability of the

14   proceedings where a defendant is adjudicated guilty and

15   sentenced.   Mere outcome is not the Strickland prejudice

16   standard.

17                 Second, when asserting an ineffective

18   assistance claim, the defendant --

19                JUSTICE KAGAN:      Could I -- can I stop you on

20   the first?   You say mere outcome is not enough,

21   reliability of the proceedings.           How does that fit with

22   Kimmelman, where we said it, the right to effective

23   assistance, does attach to suppression hearings,

24   obviously where evidence would not make the proceedings

25   more reliable?


                                      3

                                 Official


 1              MR. BURSCH:    Justice Kagan, even in

 2   Kimmelman, the Court remanded back to the lower courts

 3   to determine whether there was prejudice, and the

 4   obvious implication was that if there was no prejudice

 5   on the fairness of the adjudicatory proceeding itself,

 6   there would be no Sixth Amendment violation.

 7               The second point that I wanted to press this

 8   morning was that when asserting an ineffective

 9   assistance claim, a defendant must show deprivation of a

10   substantive or procedural right, and this Court has

11   already held that a defendant has no right to a plea

12   bargain.

13               Third, every possible remedy for deficient

14   plea advice creates intractable problems

15   demonstrating the right --

16              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Counsel, isn't there a

17   right to make a critical decision on whether to accept

18   or reject a plea bargain, once offered?          There's no

19   right to demand one or to keep it, but isn't there a

20   right to make that kind of critical decision?

21              MR. BURSCH:    Justice Sotomayor, the -- the

22   not guilty plea is an assertion of the defendant's

23   constitutional rights.    It's invoking the right to trial

24   that the Sixth Amendment contemplates.          And so this

25   situation is really more like Fretwell.          It's not a


                                    4

 1   decision that you have, for example, whether to have a

 2   jury or not to have a jury, or whether to have this

 3   attorney appointed for your counsel or not, because in

 4   each of those cases you have an underlying substantive

 5   or procedural constitutional right; and you have no

 6   right to a plea.   And so this fork in the road is really

 7   an illusory one, because you have no right to choose the

 8   other side of the fork.

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:         Suppose this were a death

10   -- a death case, and roughly the same facts, failure --

11   failure to communicate.       And that leaves me just one

12   other question based on your opening remarks.           We can

13   think about adjudication as having a constitutional

14   violation, injury, and remedy.           Are you saying that

15   there was a violation in the abstract here but no

16   injury, or was there a violation and an injury but just

17   no remedy?

18                MR. BURSCH:    I'm saying --

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:         So if you could do all of

20   that, including the death penalty, I --

21                MR. BURSCH:    Yes, I'm saying that there's no

22   violation, because in order to prove a Sixth Amendment

23   violation, you have to demonstrate unreliability of the

24   adjudicatory process.      I'm also saying that there's no

25   reasonable remedy, and I'll talk about that in a minute.


                                      5

 1                  With respect to the death penalty in

 2   particular, I would refer this Court right back to the

 3   Fretwell decision, because there, too, defendant and his

 4   counsel had an opportunity to raise a Collins objection

 5   that would have changed the sentence to avoid the death

 6   penalty in that case.       Collins obviously was overruled

 7   before habeas process, and this Court held that the

 8   defendant could not use the vehicle of an ineffective

 9   assistance claim to regain that lost opportunity because

10   he had no constitutional right in it.              And so, really

11   the remedy -- I'm sorry.        The severity of the sentence

12   doesn't enter the analysis once you've established that

13   there has been no violation.

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           When you say no violation,

15   you don't mean that there was no ineffective assistance

16   of counsel?    I thought that was conceded, that there was

17   ineffective assistance.

18                 MR. BURSCH:    That's correct, Justice

19   Ginsburg.   We have conceded for purposes of argument

20   that there was ineffective assistance.              But Strickland

21   is a two-part test, and even after you get past the

22   deficiency prong, there's still the question of whether

23   this casts some doubt on the reliability of the

24   proceedings.

25                 JUSTICE KAGAN:      Well, I thought that the


                                       6

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   second part of the test asked about harm.          And here the

 2   person is sitting in prison for three times as long as

 3   he would have been sitting in prison had he had

 4   effective assistance of counsel at the plea bargaining

 5   stage.   So, why doesn't that just meet the requirements

 6   of Strickland, both deficiency and prejudice?

 7                MR. BURSCH:    Well, that's actually the best

 8   argument that the Respondent has in this case.          And the

 9   reason --

10                JUSTICE KAGAN:      Sounds like a good argument.

11                 (Laughter.)

12                 MR. BURSCH:     Well, the reason why it's wrong

13   is because this Court has been very careful to define

14   what that harm is.    Specifically, the word was "outcome"

15   in Cronic and Strickland.        If you --

16                JUSTICE KAGAN:      And outcome -- there is a

17   different outcome here.       He's sitting in prison for

18   three times as long.     That's a different outcome.

19                MR. BURSCH:    Yes, but the Court went on to

20   define "outcome" to mean reliability of the adjudicatory

21   process.    In fact, specifically, the language was

22   whether absent the deficiency, the defendant -- I'm

23   sorry.   Absent the deficiency, the factfinder would have

24   had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.          And what we

25   have here is a situation where everyone acknowledges --


                                      7

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1               JUSTICE KAGAN:      Well, take the sentencing

 2   cases.   The sentencing cases, the determination of guilt

 3   is over, and the question is, is this person sitting in

 4   jail for 1 day longer because his counsel was

 5   ineffective?   And if he is, we would find prejudice

 6   there.   So, why isn't the same thing true here?

 7               MR. BURSCH:    Well, I don't believe it's quite

 8   that simple.   If there was some legal error, you know,

 9   an error to which he had a constitutional right, then

10   certainly what you said is exactly true.          But if you're

11   talking about more or less days because of, for example,

12   a judge thinking that the -- the difference between

13   crack and cocaine sentences was not appropriate or other

14   things that are really up to the discretion of the trial

15   court judge, Strickland says absolutely those things are

16   not Sixth Amendment violations.

17               JUSTICE KAGAN:      Well, I guess I don't

18   understand that answer, because that answer seems to

19   suggest that the -- that the assistance being provided

20   was not ineffective.    But here, as Justice Ginsburg

21   notes, you've conceded that the assistance is

22   ineffective.   That assistance has led to a much, much,

23   much longer sentence.     You know, as opposed to some of

24   the sentencing cases suggest that 24 hours is enough,

25   this is 10 years or something.          And, you know, that


                                     8

 1   should be the end of the game, no?

 2                MR. BURSCH:    Well, let's try another

 3   sentencing hypothetical, where it's clear that there was

 4   deficient performance.      Say that there's a local trial

 5   court judge and everyone knows that he has a certain

 6   predilection that if you like the local sports team,

 7   he's going to give you a break.           If the attorney comes

 8   in and he does not press the argument that this

 9   convicted defendant likes the local sports team, he gets

10   a higher sentence, that's still not a Sixth Amendment

11   violation.

12                 Really, once you shift to sentencing, the

13   question is, were you legally entitled to the result?

14   And simply because he failed to appeal to the right

15   discretionary tendencies of the trial court doesn't

16   really make a difference.        Here we're talking,

17   obviously, about the guilt phase, and it's much easier

18   here because it says clearly in Strickland and Cronic

19   and Kimmelman and many, many other cases that that

20   outcome difference, the harm difference, has to be

21   reliability of the process itself.                It's a process --

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:       You acknowledge, though,

23   that it's ineffective assistance of counsel if you're --

24   well, no, I guess you haven't acknowledged.                Let me ask

25   you:   Have you provided ineffective assistance of


                                      9

 1   counsel if you are a lousy bargainer?             You're just no

 2   good at the -- you know, at -- I don't know -- the game

 3   of bargaining.   And so, you do a bad job in bargaining

 4   down the sentence, I mean a notoriously bad job.             Is

 5   that ineffective assistance of counsel?

 6                MR. BURSCH:    Under the Court's first prong of

 7   Strickland, you would have to look at whatever the

 8   standards of professional practice were, and depending

 9   how lousy the bargainer was, it could or could not be

10   deficient.   But the important thing is if it didn't have

11   any effect on the subsequent trial and sentencing, then

12   it would not be a Sixth Amendment violation.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Well, I don't even agree

14   with the first part.     I don't think our legal process

15   is -- is a bargaining game.           Shouldn't be.

16                MR. BURSCH:    Well, we could agree with that.

17   Bargaining is not what this is about, and that's why

18   this Court has held in Weatherford and other cases that

19   there is no right to the plea bargain itself.             And

20   that's really the second --

21                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          You can -- you can agree

22   with that when 95 percent of the criminal cases are

23   disposed of by way of bargaining?

24                MR. BURSCH:    Because in the 95 percent of

25   cases that are disposed of that way, this Court has


                                     10

 1   already held in Padilla and Hill that there is a

 2   constitutional right to have effective counsel when

 3   you're accepting that plea.            And the difference is when

 4   you're accepting a plea, you're being convicted.            That

 5   is the conviction.     And this Court frequently

 6   establishes different tests when you're waiving a right,

 7   for example the right to go to trial, versus invoking a

 8   right, going to trial.

 9                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          How can you talk about

10   the reliability of a process or its fairness when you

11   have an attorney who has fundamentally misgauged the

12   law?   How can a trial be fair when the attorney is going

13   into a trial thinking his client can't be convicted

14   because the shots fired hit below the waist?

15                 MR. BURSCH:    Because --

16                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          So, how can that kind of

17   trial ever be fair?

18                 MR. BURSCH:    Because there's no evidence

19   here, not even a contention, that his belief had any

20   impact whatsoever on the fairness of the trial

21   proceeding.    And this Court has drawn a bright-line rule

22   at trial.   You know, if you look at the preliminary

23   hearing, if there's attorney error there, deficiency --

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:         Well, but you skipped over

25   a step.   I think we do assume that the deficient advice


                                      11

 1   led to the -- the determination to plead not guilty.

 2                MR. BURSCH:     Right.         Again -- but that fork

 3   in the road is not one to which he has a substantive

 4   procedural right.

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:          Well, but that's the

 6   question -- that's the question we're confronting.               So,

 7   I think --

 8                 MR. BURSCH:      Well, I --

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- your answer was a

10   little too facile on that point.

11                MR. BURSCH:     I think --

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:          We have to assume there's

13   ineffective assistance of counsel in advising the client

14   the nature of the charge for the -- so that the client

15   can make up his mind whether to plead guilty or not

16   guilty.

17                MR. BURSCH:     Right.

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:          We have to assume that in

19   this case, correct?

20                MR. BURSCH:     Correct, we are assuming that.

21   But what I would submit respectfully is that the plea

22   stage isn't any different than a preliminary hearing or

23   a line-up or a suppression hearing, where if there was

24   some deficient attorney conduct, this Court would still

25   then look to see whether it had an adverse impact on the

 1   adjudication of guilt.

 2              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Suppose the defective

 3   advice causes the defendant to enter a plea that he

 4   would not have entered if he had been properly advised.

 5   Can he get relief?

 6               MR. BURSCH:       Absolutely.         Under Hill and

 7   Padilla, this Court has said when you give up your right

 8   to trial, that's a very different situation and that

 9   there is a remedy for that.           And --

10              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So, explain why defective

11   advice causing a plea, that qualifies, but defective

12   advice causing defendant to turn down a plea --

13              MR. BURSCH:      It's just --

14              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- does not?

15              MR. BURSCH:      It's just like the difference

16   between deciding to proceed with counsel, in which case

17   there's -- there's no barrier to entry, or deciding to

18   proceed without counsel, giving up the constitutional

19   right.

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:         No, the difference -- that's

21   not the difference at all.         It seems to me the

22   difference is when you plead guilty you deprive yourself

23   of the 24-karat test of fairness, which is trial by jury

24   before nine people who have to find you guilty beyond a

25   reasonable doubt.    When you plead guilty, you give up


                                     13

 1   that.

 2                When you don't plead guilty, you get what is

 3   the best thing in our legal system.              You can't do any

 4   better than that.

 5               MR. BURSCH:    Justice Scalia, you said it much

 6   more artfully, but that's exactly the point I was trying

 7   to make with Justice Ginsburg, that when you invoke your

 8   constitutional right, your right to have an attorney, to

 9   go to a trial, to have a jury, we don't set up barriers

10   to entry.   It's only when you give up those rights.

11               JUSTICE KAGAN:      I take it, then, Mr. Bursch,

12   you would have the same answer if the State had never

13   provided counsel at all.      So long as -- if the plea

14   negotiations were all done between the prosecutor and

15   the individual defendant, and the -- and the State

16   refused to provide the individual defendant with

17   counsel, but so long as the person in the end decided,

18   oh, I don't like this plea, I'll go to trial, then it's

19   all fine and dandy under the Sixth Amendment?

20               MR. BURSCH:    That would be our position,

21   because that's consistent with this Court's holding in

22   Coleman and Wade and Kimmelman, that --

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:         And that would also be your

24   position in a capital case?

25               MR. BURSCH:    Yes.         Under Fretwell, this Court


                                    14

 1   held definitively that so long as the reliability of the

 2   adjudicatory process and sentence were intact, that the

 3   deficient advice didn't affect it, that the severity of

 4   the punishment was not legally relevant.

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:         So, your position is you're

 6   entitled to effective assistance of counsel before you

 7   plead guilty, but you're not entitled to effective

 8   assistance of counsel in evaluating plea offers?

 9               MR. BURSCH:      I would say it slightly

10   different --

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:         All right.

12               MR. BURSCH:      -- that you are entitled to

13   effective counsel at every critical stage; however, it

14   is not a Sixth Amendment violation unless it casts doubt

15   on the reliability of the adjudication of guilt.

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           That gets back to my

17   question:   Is it a violation in the abstract then, of

18   damnum absque injuria?

19               MR. BURSCH:      I'm sorry.

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Damage without injury.

21               MR. BURSCH:      No, because under the Strickland

22   and Cronic cases, there is no damage, there's no Sixth

23   Amendment violation, unless you can prove the prejudice.

24                  JUSTICE ALITO:       I mean, all of this is

25   theoretically interesting, and it may be that capital

 1   cases are sui generis here.            But I thought the heart of

 2   your argument was that there just is no way to

 3   unscramble the eggs in this situation; there is no --

 4   and that was your third point, and I understood it.

 5                  MR. BURSCH:     Correct.

 6                  JUSTICE ALITO:       There is no remedy that can

 7   put the parties back into the position where they would

 8   have been had the error regarding the legal issue not

 9   occurred.

10               MR. BURSCH:      That's exactly right.          And let's

11   talk about the two remedies that are most frequently

12   bandied about in the circuit courts.               The first is to

13   order a new trial.     And to us, it makes no sense to

14   order a second trial after you've already had a first

15   error-free trial.

16                  In addition, you think about these habeas

17   cases; if you're issuing a habeas writ and vacating a

18   sentence 8 or 9 years after the fact, like you are here,

19   essentially you're releasing the defendant, because

20   witnesses will die, they'll move away, memories will be

21   sparse.   And so, that's the natural effect of that.

22                  And in Cooper's brief, he doesn't even

23   advocate for a second trial; he asks for specific

24   performance.    The problem with that is there you're

25   infringing on the prosecutor's discretion, which is


                                      16

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   sacred, to say what his plea offer is going to be.           And

 2   circumstances have changed once a trial has taken place.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          Well, "sacred" is a

 4   little strong, don't you think?           I mean, it is a -- to

 5   some extent, unfair to the prosecutor because he knows

 6   already he's got a guilty verdict in his pocket, and he

 7   has to go back.   But why is it so terribly difficult to

 8   tell the defendant he has a right to accept that offer

 9   if he wants, but then go through the normal process,

10   which is it has to be approved by a judge and all that

11   stuff?   I don't see what's terribly difficult about

12   that.

13                MR. BURSCH:    We contend it violates the

14   separation of powers.      But you bring up an important

15   point because circumstances have changed in two

16   respects.    The first is that you learn more information.

17   So, here, for example, the prosecutor learned that not

18   only did Mr. Cooper shoot Kali Mundy, but he did it

19   while she was screaming and running away from him.

20   That's a changed circumstance.           He might not give the

21   same plea.   Even more so in Frye, where they learned

22   that he was picked for another criminal violation after

23   the plea was given, and the prosecutor testified that he

24   would have taken the plea back when he knew that.

25                 But the bigger changed circumstance is the


                                     17

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   trial itself, because the prosecutor has now gone

 2   through the risk of having an acquittal.               He has also

 3   put, for example, the 8-year-old sexual abuse defendant

 4   on the stand, something he tried to avoid with the plea

 5   offer.   And it truly is an egg that cannot be

 6   unscrambled.

 7                  And unless there are further questions, I

 8   will reserve of the balance of my time.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Thank you, counsel.

14               MR. JAY:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

15   please the Court:

16                  Petitioner's convictions and sentence are

17   reliable because the proceedings that produced them were

18   reliable.   And to collaterally attack his convictions or

19   his sentence based on allegedly ineffective assistance

20   of counsel, he has to show that the ineffective

21   assistance of counsel prejudiced him.               As this Court's

22   Strickland cases have used that term, that means he has

23   to show that a reviewing court should lack confidence in

24   the proceeding that produced the convictions or the

25   sentence.

 1              JUSTICE BREYER:          Well, you --        first, there's

 2   nothing about this in the Sixth Amendment, is there?               I

 3   mean, the text of the Sixth Amendment talks about

 4   criminal prosecutions requiring the assistance of

 5   counsel for defense, period.

 6              MR. JAY:      The Sixth Amendment requires the

 7   assistance of --

 8              JUSTICE BREYER:          Okay.      So, there's nothing

 9   in the Sixth Amendment that has these qualifications.                 I

10   haven't seen anything in any case which was other than

11   case specific.   That is, this issue hasn't been decided

12   before, not to my knowledge.              The language can be taken

13   out of those cases, as you've very properly done.               And

14   so, there's nothing that I could find in the cases.

15   Nothing in the Sixth Amendment itself.             In 95 percent of

16   the cases, they do plead guilty.             And what's the problem

17   about ordering the prosecution to simply repeat the

18   offer he gave before?

19               Well, I mean, I don't really see if there --

20   and prejudice?   What if a person's been executed?              If he

21   had gotten the -- if he had gotten the plea offer, he

22   would have pled guilty for 50 years in jail, okay?

23   That's my imaginary case.         I can think of one where

24   there's prejudice.     He's dead.          All right?    So, what's

25   the answer in my imaginary case, if it's not in the

 1   amendment, not in -- not a holding, et cetera?


 2               MR. JAY:      Well, I think that -- let me


 3   address that capital hypothetical that has come up


 4   several times.    And I think that it's instructive,


 5   Justice Breyer, to look at this Court's Strickland cases

 6   and look at what remedy they order when there has been

 7   ineffective assistance that shakes the reviewing court's

 8   confidence in the proceeding that produced it.               They

 9   order a new proceeding.         They don't order a specific

10   sentence.   That's why the outcome has never been the --

11   the yardstick by which ineffective assistance of --

12               JUSTICE BREYER:          I don't want to -- I want to

13   stop you there because I don't understand it.               The

14   suggestion is -- I'm not taking this case; I'm making up

15   a hypothetical since we're discussing it really based on

16   the next case.    The defendant never heard the offer,

17   never heard it.    It is crystal clear that if he'd heard

18   it, he would have accepted it.             Okay?    I'm trying to

19   separate out difficulties of this case, which strikes me

20   as difficult because of the facts, from the principle.

21   And what I want you to do is to tell me why I shouldn't

22   accept the principle, and then we can worry about what's

23   a clear case.

24               MR. JAY:      But I think the principle,

25   Justice Breyer, is that you look at what the -- you look

 1   at what it is the Court's being asked to set aside.

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:          Death.         Let's say death.

 3               MR. JAY:      Right.        So, in this case, you look

 4   at the death sentence.        How was that death sentence

 5   produced?   If the defendant can show, for example, that

 6   he got bad advice about the plea --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:          He shows that never did he

 8   ever become aware, because his lawyer was sleeping and

 9   moved on vacation and never told him about the plea

10   offer.   That's my hypothetical.

11               MR. JAY:      I think that's actually an easier

12   hypothetical than the bad advice because you could show

13   that if the lawyer then gets -- stands up and does a

14   bang-up job at trial, right -- the defendant is

15   convicted of capital murder.               The defendant can't show

16   any prejudicial effect on the trial.                 That means that no

17   other lawyer doing a better job could have gotten the --

18   could even show a reasonable probability that a

19   different verdict would ensue.

20               JUSTICE ALITO:         No, the Court has said --

21               MR. JAY:      That defendant has a reliable

22   capital murder conviction.

23               JUSTICE ALITO:         The Court has said that death

24   is different.   And did you think it is inconceivable

25   that there could be a different rule for capital cases,


                                       21

 1   such as a rule requiring that, in a capital case, any

 2   offer of a noncapital sentence as part of a plea bargain

 3   actually be waived by the defendant in court so that

 4   this doesn't come up?       This is not a capital case.

 5              MR. JAY:      This is not a capital case, and I

 6   think that it certainly --

 7              JUSTICE BREYER:          All right.      If you don't

 8   want to do the capital case?              I'm still trying to get to

 9   the principle.

10              MR. JAY:      I'm happy to do the capital case,

11   Justice Breyer.

12              JUSTICE BREYER:          I'll change my hypothetical

13   and say all that happened was that this perfect trial,

14   because of mandatory sentencing rules, led him to prison

15   for 50 years, as compared with a plea bargain which

16   would have given him 2 years.             Now, he is in prison for

17   48 years more, and I consider that that's at least

18   harmful to him.   So, where the amendment doesn't speak

19   of it, where the misbehavior of the lawyer is crystal

20   clear, where it's 48 years more in prison, what is it

21   that bars what seems to me obvious that an inadequate

22   assistance of counsel, remedial through a specific

23   decree saying reinstitute the offer, led to enormous

24   unfairness and prejudice?

25              MR. JAY:      Two points, Justice Breyer.          I'm --

 1   and I want to make sure that I get out my answer to your

 2   capital hypothetical, because you don't look just at

 3   whether the sentence that resulted was worse than the

 4   sentence that could have resulted.                If that were the

 5   case, Fretwell would have come out the other way.

 6   That's death if -- with no objection made, life sentence

 7   if the objection had been made.           So, it's not an

 8   outcome -- it's not a narrow comparison of outcomes.

 9   What you look at is how the sentence was produced.                Is

10   this defendant entitled, had this -- to a lesser

11   sentence?

12                 Is this -- had this defendant had a better

13   lawyer at sentencing, is there even a reasonable

14   probability that the -- that that lawyer, through a

15   different strategy for identifying a legal error --

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Mr. Jay, you disagree with

17   the assertion that Justice Breyer made that this was

18   unfair.   This man deserved to get the sentence he got,

19   didn't he?   He had a full and fair trial.               A jury of 12

20   people, finding him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,

21   determined that he deserved that sentence.                How could it

22   be unfair to give him the sentence that he deserved?

23                MR. BURSCH:    Yes, that's correct.            In every

24   case --

25                JUSTICE BREYER:       The lists are legion where

 1   people don't get the sentence that they deserve because,

 2   for example, the lawyer was inadequate.               I mean --

 3                 MR. JAY:      And in those cases, Justice Breyer,

 4   you show that the lawyer had a bad strategy at

 5   sentencing.    That may well have been the same bad

 6   strategy that led the lawyer to recommend a not guilty

 7   plea.   Let's go to trial on my crazy strategy.              If he

 8   can show that and he can show that a better lawyer with

 9   a better strategy would produce a different result, then

10   the Sixth Amendment entitles that person to a new

11   proceeding.    The Sixth Amendment never entitles the

12   person to have a court order a particular sentence.

13                  And you can't use the prosecutor's offer

14   made at a different time as the benchmark and say, well,

15   the prosecutor was okay with it at this other time;

16   therefore, the prosecution must be forced to live with

17   it now.   And that's because a plea offer rests on a

18   number of considerations:            the need to obtain the

19   defendant's cooperation in other cases; the desire to

20   spare the witnesses and the victim the burdens of trial;

21   and, frankly, to avoid the risk of an acquittal.               And

22   the prosecution in this case and in cases like this one,

23   where there has been a reliable conviction and reliable

24   sentencing, the prosecution has already incurred all of

25   those burdens.    So, to look at the 51-month minimum

 6   that plea bargaining is a critical phase, entitling

 7   somebody to a lawyer and to an effective lawyer, do you?

 8              MR. BURSCH:    We don't -- we don't think --

 9   that's not part of our argument here.

10              JUSTICE KAGAN:      Yes, because we've said that

11   many times; isn't that right?

12              MR. BURSCH:    Well, the Court -- let me be

13   precise, Justice Kagan, because there are two things

14   that the Court can be talking about.              There's the --

15   there's the -- the interaction between the State and the

16   defendant, and that's where the Court has customarily

17   used language like "critical stage," a confrontation

18   between the defendant and the prosecution.

19               That's not what we have here.              This is about

20   private advice between the lawyer and the client, and

21   we're not contesting that he has a right to have that

22   advice be effective.

23              JUSTICE KAGAN:      What we have recognized,

24   right, is that plea bargaining is a critical phase

25   because about 98 percent of the action of the criminal


                                   25

 1   justice system occurs in plea bargaining.                And to


 2   deprive somebody of a lawyer at that stage of the


 3   process, where 98 percent of the action occurs, is


 4   inconsistent with the Sixth Amendment.                That's what


 5   we've said.    Isn't that right?

 6                 MR. BURSCH:       Well, I don't think the Court

 7   has faced up -- faced this particular situation, Justice

 8   Kagan.

 9                 JUSTICE KAGAN:         So, it's not a critical

10   phase.   It's only a critical phase depending on the

11   outcome of what happens at that phase?

12                 MR. JAY:      We are -- we are assuming that --

13   that Mr. Cooper in this case had a right to receive

14   effective advice about whether to enter this plea.                   But

15   we're -- our position is that he wasn't prejudiced

16   because what --

17                 JUSTICE KAGAN:         Has -- have you ever seen a

18   critical phase before in our Sixth Amendment

19   jurisprudence where the right to a lawyer depends upon

20   what has -- what happens during that critical phase,

21   where if one outcome results, there is no Sixth

22   Amendment right, but if another outcome results there

23   is?

24                 MR. JAY:      Well, again, we don't think this is

25   in any way crucial to deciding this case, but

 1   Scott v. Illinois, Justice Kagan, is an example of that.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Mr. Jay, couldn't --

 3   couldn't it be said that what our cases hold is that

 4   pleading guilty is a critical phase?                  Would that be

 5   enough to explain our cases?

 6                MR. JAY:      It certainly is correct that

 7   pleading -- that a guilty plea hearing, where the

 8   defendant --

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, it's correct, but is

10   it enough?   Do you want us to write an opinion that plea

11   negotiations are not a critical stage of the criminal

12   process unless at the end of the day a guilty plea

13   results?

14                MR. JAY:      That's not at all what we're

15   asking, Justice Kennedy.

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Okay.       So, we --

17                MR. JAY:      What we are asking -- I'm sorry.

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Justice Kagan and I want to

19   know what your test is.

20                MR. JAY:      Our test to resolve this case is to

21   look at what it is that the habeas petitioner is

22   challenging.   He's challenging conviction and his

23   sentence.    In the conviction, he was found guilty by a

24   jury.   He now says, page 14a of the red brief, that he

25   is guilty and he wishes he had pleaded guilty sooner.

 2              May I finish the thought on the sentence?


 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Sure.


 4              MR. JAY:      And -- on this sentence, he was


 5   sentenced in accordance with law.              He had effective

 6   representation at sentencing, and he got the sentence

 7   that corresponds to the counts of conviction.                What he

 8   wants is to reinstate a deal that was in the

 9   prosecution's discretion to offer once upon a time.

14                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

15              MS. NEWMAN:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

16   and may it please the Court:

17              It is uncontroverted here that Anthony Cooper

18   received incompetent advice from his counsel.                It is

19   uncontroverted here that, as a result of that

20   incompetent advice, Mr. Cooper is serving between 100

21   and 134 months of extra time of imprisonment.

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I think that's not -- that

23   he got ineffective assistance, yes, that's not

24   controverted.   But that he would have gotten the 51

25   months or 68 is certainly controverted because of two

 1   interventions.    The prosecutor can say:          No deal; I'm

 2   withdrawing it, even after an initial acceptance.            And

 3   the judge can say:    I think 51 to 68 is entirely

 4   improper for what this man did.

 5              MS. NEWMAN:      Those are both true, Justice

 6   Ginsburg -- Justice Ginsburg, but, however, the

 7   Strickland test requires a reasonable probability of a

 8   different result.    And on this record, we have no

 9   reasonable probability -- we have no reason to expect

10   that that's not exactly what would have happened.

11              JUSTICE ALITO:        The relief that you want is

12   specific performance of the plea bargain.

13              MS. NEWMAN:      Correct.

14              JUSTICE ALITO:        Isn't that correct?

15              What if it had come to light or come to the

16   prosecutor's attention during this intervening time that

17   your client had committed four or five other shootings?

18   Would you still be entitled to specific performance?

19              MS. NEWMAN:      Yes.         We evaluate the case, and

20   the Strickland analysis is an imperfect -- the

21   Strickland remedy is an imperfect remedy.            It has always

22   been an imperfect remedy.        It will always be an

23   imperfect remedy.

 2   whatever the metaphor is.       Does the judge have to

 3   prescind all knowledge of what he learned in the trial?

 4              MS. NEWMAN:     Well, this Court has stated

 5   numerous times that it presumes a conscientious

 6   decisionmaker, and a conscientious decisionmaker would

 7   put --

 8              JUSTICE KENNEDY:          Well, I'm asking what --

 9   I'm a conscientious decisionmaker, and I'm asking for

10   your advice on what I should do.

11              MS. NEWMAN:     That you would --

12              JUSTICE KENNEDY:          I know the details of this

13   crime, which were more horrific than I would have

14   expected, because I've heard them at the trial.         Do I

15   just somehow forget about that, prescind that?

16              MS. NEWMAN:     You would evaluate the case as

17   you would have evaluated it at the time of the

18   proceedings.

19              JUSTICE KENNEDY:          So, the answer is "yes."

21   trial.

23   you evaluate things at the point of the deficient

24   performance.   And at the point of the deficient

25   performance, the judge had a certain amount of

 2   amount of information before him, and the defense

 3   attorney had a certain amount of information before him.

 4                 JUSTICE ALITO:      I mean, that's pretty

 5   incredible.    It doesn't matter what the defendant has

 6   done in the -- has been discovered to have done in the

 7   interim?   Committed 5 murders, 10 murders?

 8                 MS. NEWMAN:    Well, in that case --

 9                 JUSTICE ALITO:      Wipe it out of your mind; you

10   get -- you get the plea bargain that was offered at an

11   early point in -- in the investigation of the case?

12                 MS. NEWMAN:    Yes, because what happens in

13   ineffective assistance of counsel claims is the State

14   has to bear the burden of the unconstitutionality.              And

15   so, that is a price that this Court has said the State

16   will bear when there is -- when there's a constitutional

17   violation, because there is no perfect --

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           How can the judge -- the

19   judge -- he knows what the plea -- let's say he knows

20   what the plea bargain was, but he also knows that for

21   one of the crimes, felon in possession, that alone, the

22   sentencing range is 81 to 135.             So, without any --

23   considering anything that happened at trial, the judge

24   knows that the plea bargain was for less than if the man

25   had been charged with -- only with a felon in

 1   possession.

 2                 MS. NEWMAN:    Yes, that's accurate.

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           So, it -- it seems most

 4   unlikely that a judge would have accepted the plea

 5   bargain for 51 to 68 for the crimes that were charged.

 6                 MS. NEWMAN:    No, I would disagree with that.

 7   This -- in this Court -- and I can represent to the

 8   Court, in my practice before this Court, which I have

 9   practiced before this Court for many, many years, this

10   plea bargain was an ordinary plea bargain.             This was not

11   anything extraordinary.        It was very run of the mill.

12   It was -- it was a run-of-the-mill case --

13                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           That may be, but is it not

14   true that the sentence range was 81 to 135 for a felon

15   in possession?

16                 MS. NEWMAN:    I did not -- typically, you only

17   score out the guidelines for the most serious offense.

18   So, the guidelines may have been high for the felon in

19   possession offense, but, however, the judge -- in

20   fashioning the remedy, you're not going to -- this Court

21   would not take discretion away from the judge.             So, in

22   fashioning the remedy, in adopting the remedy of the

23   Sixth Circuit if this Court were to do that, this case

24   would go back before this same judge if he's still on

25   the bench, and it would be -- would put people back --

 1   Mr. Cooper would accept the plea, but the judge retains

 2   sentencing discretion.

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:       It wouldn't be a problem.

 4   The problem with Justice Alito's hypothetical, I take

 5   it, is what the order would say is that the prosecution

 6   has to, for a reasonable time, extend the same offer.

 7   And then if it's accepted, you go to the judge.            The

 8   judge doesn't have to accept the plea.

 9               MS. NEWMAN:    Right.       You can't find --

10               JUSTICE BREYER:       You can't make him do that.

11   But I have a bigger problem with this case, which is --

12   which I may be the only one to have.             But as I've looked

13   at it, I don't see ineffective assistance of counsel

14   within the AEDPA meaning.       That is, you have two courts

15   in the State which have said this is not ineffective.

16   And as I look at it, it's somewhat ambiguous at best.

17   And we have the Sixth Circuit saying it is.            Well, I

18   know both sides agree, but I mean, both sides couldn't

19   make us decide a case by saying there's a murder when in

20   fact it's not.

21               I mean -- so, what am I supposed to do about

22   that?   I find this a tough case.          I've read the record,

23   and in my own opinion at this moment, perhaps no one

24   else's, there is no ineffective assistance of counsel

25   such that the Sixth Circuit could set that aside -- a

 1   contrary finding of the State court.

 2                What do I do?

 3                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            If Justice Breyer permits

 4   me to add an addendum to give the reasons why I might

 5   agree with him or a way of viewing this, as I read the

 6   lower court's decisions, they said there wasn't

 7   ineffectiveness because he was just trying to get a

 8   better deal.

 9                  And I think that, translating what he said,

10   the very reasonable view by the court was the prosecutor

11   may think of a lesser charge, because if this guy really

12   wanted to kill this woman, he would have hit her head or

13   her chest, but he aimed low.              So, he was really just

14   angry and shooting enough so that if he hit her, okay,

15   if she died, okay.     But he really didn't have that

16   heinous intent to execute, you know, a gunshot to the

17   brain.    And so, he was hoping to negotiate something

18   better.    If that's -- Justice Breyer is shaking his

19   head.    If that in fact -- if this is an AEDPA case, and

20   we have to give deference to the State courts, doesn't

21   that resolve this case?

22                  MS. NEWMAN:     No.

23                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           We have to give

24   deference to their finding.

25                  MS. NEWMAN:     You do have to give deference

 1   to their finding.    There's no question under AEDPA

 2   there's -- there's deference.            And there's actually no

 3   question there's sort of a doubly deferential review,

 4   given the Strickland analysis.            However, the State

 5   courts did not decide this case on Sixth Amendment

 6   grounds.   So, there is nothing to give deference to.

 7   The State courts decided this, and the trial court said

 8   Mr. Cooper made his own choices.            That's not an

 9   ineffective assistance of counsel analysis.

10                The court of appeals in Michigan also did

11   not engage in a Sixth Amendment analysis.            They adopted

12   the trial court and said that Mr. Cooper made his own

13   choices.   So, there is -- and this claim was raised

14   specifically on Sixth Amendment grounds from the very

15   beginning of the appeal until it reached this Court.

16   So, there is no AEDPA deference to give to the State

17   courts' decisions.    There is no question as well that it

18   was ineffective assistance, because the State court

19   record does not bear out that Mr. McClain was trying to

20   get a better deal.    The State court --

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           You said -- you said

 2   it, the bargain or the sentence?            It includes the

12   the trial, but in imposing the sentence or approving it?

24   option -- oh, I'm sorry.       For the judge --

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:         Yeah, the judge.     It goes

 1   back to the judge.     We agree with you, and we send it

 2   back to the judge.     We reinstate the offer, okay?          He

 3   accepts the offer.     It goes to the judge, and the judge

 4   says:    No, this is outrageous.          I'm not going to approve

 5   this plea bargain.

 6                  What happens then?

 7                 MS. NEWMAN:    Well, in that case, the case

 8   would proceed under Michigan law.             In that case, the

 9   judge would say --

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       We would have a new trial;

11   is that it?

12                 MS. NEWMAN:    No.       I don't -- I think it would

13   be perfectly acceptable to say a new trial is not -- not

14   an appropriate remedy in this case, because he had a

15   trial.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       Okay.     So, if the judge

17   turns it down, then the prior trial is valid; is that

18   right?

19                 MS. NEWMAN:    It would depend on the reasons

20   why the judge would turn it down.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       He turned it down because --

22                 MS. NEWMAN:    It would have to be a legitimate

23   reason under a State law; otherwise, there would --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA.       Yes.     Yes, then the prior

25   trial is okay?

 1               MS. NEWMAN:      It's not that it's okay, but I

 2   think under imperfect circumstances, it's the result

 3   that we're seeking.

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:         Well, why?     Why?   I mean,

 5   why wouldn't the remedy be, as -- judging what you said

 6   before, is an order saying to the prosecution

 7   re-institute the plea bargain and give him whatever, a

 8   week or whatever it is?        Now, we imagine the defendant

 9   says I accept.   So, then they go to the judge, just as

10   they would have before.

11               MS. NEWMAN:      Right.

12               JUSTICE BREYER:         And the judge has the

13   freedom to accept that or to reject it.

14               MS. NEWMAN:      Correct.

15               JUSTICE BREYER:         If he rejects it, there is

16   no plea agreement.     Now the defendant must plead.          He

17   can plead guilty or not guilty.            And whatever flows from

18   that, flows from it.

19               MS. NEWMAN:      That's a -- also a perfectly

20   acceptable remedy.     I think the purpose -- the reason --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Wait.     Both can't be

22   perfect.   Either he has another trial, although he's

23   just been found guilty by a jury of 12 with an entirely

24   fair proceeding, or else he doesn't have a new trial.

25   Which is it?

 1              JUSTICE BREYER:        He does.       He does.    His

 2   suggestion is perfect, but mine is more perfect.

 3              (Laughter.)

 4              MS. NEWMAN:     Okay.        The --

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:        You could do it.       You don't

 6   have to -- you would -- he's right, you would have to,

 7   under my suggestion, have a new trial, even though there

 8   was a trial that took place 2 years ago or whatever it

 9   is, correct?

10              MS. NEWMAN:     Correct.

11              JUSTICE BREYER:        But that isn't the end of

12   the argument.

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           So, if you're the

14   defense counsel, the best thing for you to do is not

15   communicate any plea offer you get, and then if your

16   client is found guilty, then you can go back and say,

17   oh, by the way, I didn't tell you about this, and he

18   gets a whole new trial.

19              MS. NEWMAN:     No.       The -- the bar on habeas --

20   well, the bar on Strickland, even not on habeas, is a

21   very high bar, as this Court said in Padilla.               And it's

22   not a bar that can often be met.           And so, you have to

23   show under a Strickland analysis deficient performance

24   and prejudice.   So --

25              JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, I don't know if that's

 1   going to be so --

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           A deficient


 3   performance --

 4                JUSTICE ALITO:      I don't know that that's


 5   going to be so hard to show.             Do you think it's feasible

 6   to draw a distinction between this case, where there was

 7   arguably inaccurate legal advice, and the case in which

 8   the defense attorney simply makes a terribly mistaken

 9   calculation about the chances of a favorable verdict at

10   trial?   A favorable plea bargain is offered, caps the

11   guy's possible sentence at, let's say, 3 years.                The

12   defense attorney says:      We've got a great shot at an

13   acquittal.   Let's go to trial.           I'm going to rip the

14   prosecution's witnesses apart.

15                 The trial turns out to be a disaster.

16   Convicted on all counts, 25 years.                Do you think that

17   it's impossible for the rule that you want us to adopt

18   here to be applied in that situation as well?

19                MS. NEWMAN:    I think it would be much more

20   difficult, because this Court on habeas review and State

21   courts on non-habeas review are very deferential to

22   strategic decisions.     Almost anything that qualifies --

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:         Well, you say that.       But,

24   as an administrative matter, I think we have to have

25   some concern that these plea negotiations and


                                     40

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   discussions are in myriad circumstances.             The defense

 2   attorney is by the water cooler; the prosecutor walks by

 3   and says I'm thinking of offering you a good bargain in

 4   the Jones case.    He knows he's going to have that

 5   prosecutor in court the next day and really beat him.

 6   He thinks he's going to soften him up.             So, he doesn't

 7   communicate it to the client, and the prosecutor later

 8   says withdrawn.

 9                  We're going to have inquiries post hoc on

10   all of these negotiations and discussions.             And it seems

11   to me that, absent some other rule, which I don't think

12   we have the authority to impose, that all plea offers

13   must be in writing and be stated with specificity, that

14   if -- what you're proposing is simply unworkable.

15              MS. NEWMAN:       I disagree, Your Honor.         We've

16   had Hill -- we've had Strickland and Hill jurisprudence

17   for three decades.     There's -- there was a floodgates

18   argument when Hill was decided, that we're going to have

19   all these people that the -- and we've had, since

20   McMann v. Richardson, this Court saying plea bargaining

21   is a critical stage, and --

22              JUSTICE KAGAN:         And most of the circuits

23   follow your rule; isn't that right?

24                  MS. NEWMAN:     Right.      We already have

25   unanimity --

 1                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       And the floodgates have not

 2   opened.

 3                 MS. NEWMAN:    I'm sorry.

 4                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Go ahead.

 5                  MS. NEWMAN:     Yes, we have unanimity in the

 6   Federal circuits, and we have -- almost every State that

 7   has addressed this issue has addressed it in the same

 8   manner.   And so --

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           What is the unanimity on

10   the remedy?    Here, the court said that the writ shall be

11   granted conditioned on the State taking action to offer

12   the 51-to-85-month plea.        So, that doesn't bind the

13   judge, but it does bind the prosecutor.

14                 MS. NEWMAN:    Correct.

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           And it removes the

16   possibility of the prosecutor saying, I would have

17   withdrawn that initial offer.

18                 MS. NEWMAN:    Correct.

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           So, the prosecutor -- the

20   remedy is -- is that the remedy that's uniform?                That

21   the prosecutor has no discretion, only the judge does?

22                 MS. NEWMAN:    Well, the remedies vary.           When I

23   said "unanimity," I didn't mean every -- every court in

24   every circuit does -- handles this exactly the same way.

25   Unanimity in the sense that every Federal circuit and


                                      42

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   almost every State that has addressed this issue, and


 2   they've addressed this issue for over 30 years, has


 3   found that there is an -- there is a cognizable Sixth


 4   Amendment violation that can be remedied on appeal.


 5               JUSTICE KAGAN:      And perhaps the lack of

 6   unanimity on the remedy question is appropriate.             I

 7   mean, people have been trying to suggest different

 8   remedies.   But perhaps one way to deal with the remedy

 9   question is to recognize that these cases present very

10   different factual circumstances, that there are a lot of

11   variation in them, and to give a substantial amount of

12   discretion to the lower courts to work out what the best

13   remedy is, consistent with that factual variation.

14               MS. NEWMAN:    Absolutely.           And it's the same

15   thing the courts have been doing, again, since

16   Strickland and Hill were decided.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:       Like what?        What factual

18   variation do you think justifies a categorically

19   different remedy?   I mean, it seems to me some of the

20   remedies are good and some are bad.

21               MS. NEWMAN:    Correct.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:       What factual -- I mean, give

23   me an example of the different remedies and how a

24   certain fact situation could make one okay and the other

25   not okay.

 1                 MS. NEWMAN:    Well, even in the two cases

 2   before the Court today -- I mean, in Mr. Frye's, case he

 3   accepted a plea, and the State court ordered a new trial

 4   as the remedy for the -- for the ineffective assistance

 5   of counsel violation.       In my case and Mr. Cooper's

 6   case --

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       Right.         And why was that

 8   okay there?

 9                 MS. NEWMAN:    -- rejected -- pardon?

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       Why was that okay there?

11   What -- what factual circumstances made that okay there?

12                 MS. NEWMAN:    Well, that just -- I don't know

13   that the factual circumstances make it okay, but it was

14   the remedy that the State -- I'm not sure I understand

15   your question.    It was a remedy that the State ordered,

16   and, in this case, it's just the remedy that was ordered

17   by the Federal court was the remedy --

18                 JUSTICE ALITO:      You have a situation where

19   the -- where the defendant turns down -- where a plea is

20   turned down and the defendant goes to trial.                Are there

21   any facts in -- any facts that would make any remedy

22   other than specific performance the correct remedy in

23   that situation?

24                 MS. NEWMAN:    These cases are so

 1   question about a hypothetical, but there's -- every case

 2   is so fact-specific that I think there's -- the

 3   possibility exists that a -- that the remedy would --

 4              JUSTICE ALITO:       You recommend -- you

 5   recommend specific performance as the remedy for your

 6   case, and I agree with you that is -- if there is to be

 7   a remedy, it's the only remedy that makes a -- any

 8   modicum of sense.   The remedy of giving a new trial when

 9   the person has already had a fair trial makes zero

10   sense.

11              MS. NEWMAN:     That's correct.

12              JUSTICE ALITO:       So, what I'm looking for is

13   any situation in which -- you said leave it to the

14   discretion of the trial judge.          But what is -- what

15   discretion is there?    What remedy in that situation

16   other than specific performance would be an

17   appropriate -- would remedy what you claim to have been

18   the violation?

19              MS. NEWMAN:     Well, in Mr. Cooper's case, I

20   think the -- the remedy in the Sixth Circuit is the only

21   appropriate remedy that -- that puts every -- that is

22   narrowly tailored to the Sixth Amendment violation, and

23   that's what this Court has said.

24               I mean, this Court has given direction to

25   the courts, to the lower courts, that you just narrowly


                                    45

 1   tailor the remedy to fit the situation, because there's

 2   so many factual discrepancies --

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:       Well, what's wrong -- let me

 4   go back because I'm now becoming convinced -- I'm trying

 5   out what Justice Scalia suggested.                Maybe that does work

 6   better.    What -- what you'd say is, first, throw the

 7   defendant out, unless you are convinced that not only is

 8   there ineffective assistance, but also it would have

 9   made a difference; he would have accepted the plea

10   bargain.

11                MS. NEWMAN:    Correct.

12                JUSTICE BREYER:       So, now they have to hold

13   the plea bargain open.      They then do it.           They then go

14   to the judge, like any plea bargain.               Ninety percent of

15   the time the judge will say fine, and that's the end of

16   it.

17                MS. NEWMAN:    Correct.

18                JUSTICE BREYER:       But should the judge decide

19   that this is a case where he would reject a plea bargain

20   for any one of a variety of reasons, then our assumption

21   was wrong, and we reinstate the previous trial.               Now,

22   the -- just say it's over?         You were tried, you were

23   convicted, that's the end of it.

24                 Now, what's wrong with that as a remedy?                I

25   mean, what's -- why is that -- why does that muck up the

 1   criminal justice system in some way?

 2                  That's, I think, pretty much what

 3   Justice Scalia suggested, and I -- and I am now trying

 4   that out, because the more I think about it, the more I

 5   think maybe that's okay.

 6                 MS. NEWMAN:    Well, I -- I believe it is what

 7   he suggested.    And I --

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       Don't -- don't blame it on

 9   me.   I don't --

10                 (Laughter.)

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       I don't -- it's your

12   suggestion that we set aside a perfectly fair

13   conviction.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:       Yes, but I --

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       This is just a hypothetical.

16   If you're going to set it aside --

 5              MS. NEWMAN:      Right.

 6              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            -- would have never

 7   sought.

 8              MS. NEWMAN:      Absolutely.

 9              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            All right?    But it goes

10   back to, I think it was Justice Alito or Chief -- or the

11   Chief Justice's question, on what basis can the judge

12   reject the plea?    You have said earlier that he has to

13   put aside any information he learned during the trial.

14   And that's really the nub of this case.             What are the

15   grounds that you're proposing the judge can use to

16   reject the plea?

17              MS. NEWMAN:      That -- any grounds that would

18   have existed in the original circumstances.             So, if the

19   judge -- in -- in Michigan, there's a variety of reasons

20   why a judge can say I -- I'm not going to accept this

21   sentencing recommendation.

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            So, how are you ever

23   going to know that the defendant would have accepted the

24   plea agreement?    Because by not accepting it, he's got a

25   chance of going scot-free.         He's going to have a fair

 1   trial, that's the assumption; and he may be acquitted.

 2                  So, how is a judge supposed to say -- I

 3   mean, presumably the defendant will always say, I would

 4   have taken that deal, because it's better.           Well, how is

 5   a judge supposed to go back and decide whether that's

 6   true or not?

 7              MS. NEWMAN:       Well, always -- in large part,

 8   it's not going to depend on the defendant; it's going to

 9   -- in larger part it's going to defend on -- depend on

10   defense counsel --

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Why?

12              MS. NEWMAN:       -- in making that determination,

13   because Strickland always looks at strategy.           I mean,

14   that -- that's the underlying --

15              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I think you can --

16              MS. NEWMAN:       -- value of Strickland.

17              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- answer the Chief

18   Justice's question.      The Chief Justice said how are you

19   going to know -- you have to show prejudice.

20              MS. NEWMAN:       Correct.

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:          And there's no prejudice

22   unless he would have accepted the deal.

23              MS. NEWMAN:       Right.

24              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            How are you going to know

25   that he would have?      Of course, he's always going to say

 1   he that would have, but how is the trial judge going to

 2   make a credibility determination on that -- on that

 3   issue?    I guess it's just a credibility determination.

 4   I don't know how he's going to do it.                I think you can

 5   answer the Chief Justice's question yes or no.

 6                MS. NEWMAN:     I don't think I can --

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           How is the judge --

 8                MS. NEWMAN:     -- answer it yes or no.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           How is the judge --

10   how is the judge ever going to know, be able to decide,

11   whether the defendant would have accepted the deal or

12   not?

13                MS. NEWMAN:     The same way that the trial

14   courts decide any question of fact.                In this case, we

15   had testimony from the trial attorney.                The trial

16   attorney told the judge, I told him not to accept the

17   plea because he legally could not be convicted of the

18   charge.    I mean, Mr. Cooper was --

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           It's the defendant's

20   choice; it's not the lawyer's choice.                It's the

21   defendant's choice.

22                MS. NEWMAN:     But he -- but he has a right to

23   the assistance -- to the effective assistance of counsel

24   in making that critical choice, and he didn't have the

25   effective assistance of counsel.             He wrote -- Mr. Cooper

 1   wrote letters to the judge --

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          That's the

 3   ineffectiveness question.         I understand that to be taken

 4   out of the case by the concessions on the other side.

 5   I'm talking about the prejudice question.


 6                 MS. NEWMAN:    Correct.


 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          How is a judge


 8   supposed to know?


 9                 MS. NEWMAN:    The judge looks at the record


10   before him.    So, in this case, we had Mr. Cooper's

11   testimony --

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          People have

13   different -- some people are willing to take the chance.

14   Okay?   Let's assume there's a 20 percent chance the

15   person will be found guilty.

16                  Some people will say, I'm willing to take

17   that chance because I just don't want the chance of

18   going to jail; I'm willing to roll the dice.               Other

19   people will say, no, that's too much.

20                  Now, whether you want to go to jail may cut

21   one way or the other, but how is a judge supposed to

22   decide?   Ask him, are you -- do you take chances?

23                 MS. NEWMAN:    No, by -- by looking at --

24   Mr. Chief Justice, by looking at the evidence in the

25   record before him.     In this case, Mr. Cooper wrote --

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          So, the judge should

 2   decide whether he would take the deal.

 3               MS. NEWMAN:    No --

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          Look at the evidence

 5   before him and say, boy, I'd take that deal.

 6               (Laughter.)

 7               MS. NEWMAN:    No, no, no, no.       Mr. -- Mr.

 8   Cooper wrote two letters to the judge saying, I want to

 9   accept a plea.   Mr. McClain, the trial attorney who

10   provided the incompetent advice, told the judge in a

11   postconviction hearing that Mr. Cooper wanted to take a

12   plea.   I mean, there -- there is no -- it is beyond

13   question in this case.

14               JUSTICE ALITO:      Do you think the length and

15   the complexity of the trial has any bearing on this?

16   This was a relatively short and simple trial.          But let's

17   say a prosecutor offers a plea deal in a case in which

18   the trial is going to take 6 months and it's going to

19   cost -- and it's going to cost a million dollars, and if

20   they try that case, there are going to be other cases

21   that they won't be able to try.          The plea is rejected,

22   the case is tried, and then afterwards the -- the remedy

23   is to -- to -- to reinstate this plea offer, which was

24   predicated on the relieving the prosecutor of the burden

25   of having to try that case.


                                    52

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1               MS. NEWMAN:      Well, every plea bargain is

 2   predicated on relieving the prosecution of having the

 3   burden of -- of trying a case.             I mean, the key here

 4   is -- let's get back to what Strickland stands for, and

 5   it's the unreliability or the unfairness of the


 6   proceedings.     It's not just an unreliability


 7   determination.


 8                  So, in this case, Mr. Cooper had two


 9   choices.   He could take a certain plea with almost a


10   certain sentence or he could have really what was a

11   charade of a trial because his attorney told him you --

12   you can't be convicted of this offense; you will not be

13   convicted of this offense following a trial.              You'll be

14   convicted of a lesser --

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You conceded -- you

16   conceded he had a fair trial.

17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Right.

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That's not in the case.

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Right.

20               MS. NEWMAN:      I didn't --

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             It can't be a charade and

22   still be fair.

23               MS. NEWMAN:      It's an unfairness of the entire

24   proceedings that were presented.             All right?   So,

25   there's no separate habeas claim with respect to the


                                      53

 1   trial, but the -- but reality is when you look at the

 2   criminal -- when you look at the Sixth Amendment, it

 3   talks about the criminal proceedings.

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:         You're saying it was unfair

 5   to have a fair trial?

 6                MS. NEWMAN:    I'm saying it's unfair to go to

 7   trial when your attorney tells you, you can't be

 8   convicted.

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:         You're saying it's unfair

10   to have a fair trial; isn't that correct?

11                MS. NEWMAN:    I'm --

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:         That has to be your

13   position.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Of course, it is.

15                MS. NEWMAN:    I'm saying it's unfair to say

16   that the trial erases the unfairness when there was no

17   possibility but for a conviction at the end of the road.

18   So, this was a certain guilty plea or this was a long

19   guilty plea under the math of a trial.

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          But you can never say

21   that there's no possibility of acquittal.           Juries can

22   decide not to convict no matter what the evidence.

23                MS. NEWMAN:    There was no defense.        I mean,

24   there was no possibility --

 2   definitely going to lose; so, let's not waste our time.

 3   Juries -- I don't want to say often, but it's not --

 4   it's certainly not inconceivable that a jury may decide

 5   for whatever reason we are not going to convict this

 6   guy.    Right?

 7                MS. NEWMAN:     That's true, but in this case,

 8   Mr. McClain told Mr. Cooper he would be convicted.                I

 9   mean, he assured him of conviction.                He said:   You will

10   be convicted at the end of the trial; you're just going

11   to be convicted of a lesser offense.                The guidelines --

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Counsel, what was the

13   defense at trial?

16   trial?

17                MS. NEWMAN:     There wasn't -- there was no

18   defense presented.     There was no real defense presented

19   at trial because --

20                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Did he deny having

 1   most of the cases in which motions of this kind are

 2   brought to trial, judges -- if there is a defense of

 3   mistaken identity or of "I didn't do it," that judges

 4   often find the defendant has not proven that they would

 5   have taken the plea?

 6                MS. NEWMAN:    Sorry.        I didn't hear the rest.

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          In most cases in which a

 8   trial is had, where the defendant is pleading

 9   misidentification or "I just didn't do this act," in

10   those cases, do most of the trial judges not permit or

11   don't find that the defendant has met their burden of

12   proving that he or she would have taken the plea?

13                MS. NEWMAN:    I don't know that the cases bear

14   out that if you have a valid defense, it would be

15   harder.    But I -- I would agree with that -- if that's a

16   hypothetical, that if you have a valid defense, it would

17   be a lot harder to be in this position of showing that

18   you would have taken the plea.

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          I thought in this case,

20   and you can correct me if I am wrong, that your client

21   told the attorney from the beginning:             I did it; I want

22   to plea.

23                MS. NEWMAN:    That's correct.         There was never

24   -- there was no question in this case at any step, at

25   any stage of the proceedings, and there was no -- never,

 1   never anything from the trial attorney other than

 2   incompetent advice.      He never --

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            Did you -- I mean --

 4               MS. NEWMAN -- went to trial for an acquittal.

 5   He went to trial because he believed legally his client

 6   would be convicted of a lesser offense that would put

 7   him in a better position than if he had accepted the

 8   plea.   That was the only reason.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            You said there's -- I

10   want to make sure I understand your point.                 You said

11   there was no defense.       Does that mean you didn't -- he

12   had a frivolous defense or that he literally didn't put

13   on a defense; just said, look, the State has to prove

14   the case and they haven't done it.

15               MS. NEWMAN:      Well, he held the State to its

16   burden, and that is a defense.            I mean, I...

21   defense, and I apologize if that's the way it came

22   across, but no cognizable defense.                 It wasn't mistaken

23   identification or we didn't intend to hit her.                 I mean,

24   never contested the basic facts of that case.

 1   jury could have accepted, right?             Even if it's not

 2   legally true that if you shoot him -- at the -- the

 3   person below the waist, that's not a defense, but I can

 4   see a reasonable juror saying he probably didn't intend

 5   to kill her.    He shot her, you know, below the waist.

 6   Maybe that is not such a bad strategy.

 7              MS. NEWMAN:       Except the defense counsel on

 8   this record specifically said that he -- that he was not

 9   running a strategy and hoping for that, that he told the

10   client legally that's the only thing that could happen

11   to him, so he was in a better position by going to

12   trial.

23   because a Strickland remedy is typically a new trial.

25   that I don't want a new trial.            That demonstrates that

 3   your suggestion that maybe you could have specific

 4   performance of the plea; and if it's rejected, then the

 5   trial result could simply be re-imposed.             And the

 6   question is:    Well, what's the problem with that?             And I

 7   can tick off at least five.

 8                  First, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, it

 9   takes away the prosecutor's ability to withdraw the

10   plea, which he or she undeniably would have had the

11   right.

12                  Second, as Justice Alito said, it ignores

13   that there's information that could be learned in the

14   interim.    Mr. Cooper shot three or four other people.

15                  Third, it ignores the fact that an

16   error-free trial has taken place.             The prosecutor has

17   taken the risk of putting that 8-year-old sexual abuse

18   victim on the stand, and you cannot take that risk away.

19                  Fourth, as I already mentioned, we've got

20   the separation of powers issue and prosecutorial

21   discretion.

22                  Fifth, we're going to have intractable

23   problems.   Say the offer was plead to A, we'll dismiss

24   B.   He rejects it based on deficient advice.            You go to

25   trial.   He is convicted on A and acquitted on B.              And


                                      59

 1   now we're going to try to enforce the plea on A?            I

 2   mean, that's almost a double jeopardy problem.            So,

 3   there's intractable problems.

 4               The second point I want to make is about the

 5   death situation.    And that's one we take very seriously.

 6   And, Justice Alito, it may be that in a death penalty

 7   situation, there could be a due process right or some

 8   other constitutional right that may mitigate in favor of

 9   requiring something to be put on the record.            But what's

10   clear is that, under this Court's existing precedent,

11   that is not a Strickland violation because the amount of

12   the sentence, whether it's death or 50 years, has

13   nothing to do with the reliability of the adjudicatory

14   proceeding and the sentence.

15               Finally, the last point that I want to make

16   is something else on which we can all agree.            Mr. Cooper

17   is guilty of shooting Kali Mundy.            He also got exactly

18   the sentence that the people prescribed for the crime

19   that committed.    There is very little unfair about

20   holding him to that sentence.            As Justice Kennedy said,

21   it's the position of Mr. Cooper that it is unfair to

22   have a fair trial.    And from our perspective, that is

23   really the beginning and the end of this inquiry.

24               And unless you have any further questions --

25              JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I have one, but it's more

 1   appropriate, I think, for the Government of the United

 2   States.   Under the Federal rules, Rule 11, there has to

 3   be a colloquy before a plea is entered.            Do you think

 4   the Federal rules and perhaps State rules should be

 5   amended so that judges, trial judges, before imposing a

 6   sentence inquire:    Have there been plea offers; have

 7   they all been communicated to the defendant?

 8                  Is that good practice?

 9                 MR. BURSCH:    It could be good practice, but

10   it wouldn't have solved the problem here, because even

11   if they had put the fact of the plea on the record, the

12   problem was the alleged deficient advice that the lawyer

13   gave to the client in private.            And so, that doesn't

14   solve the core problem.        The core problem is that

15   they're trying to claim that it was unfair to have a

16   fair trial.

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:         Well, if they had -- if

18   plea offer had come out -- well, I don't know how it

19   would work.    When you enter a not guilty plea, you enter

20   a not guilty plea.

21                 MR. BURSCH:    Right.       You know, the judge,

22   under your theory then, would have had to inquire:

23   Well, what advice did your attorney give you with

24   respect to that?    And then evaluate whether that advice

25   was good advice or bad advice.            And I would respectfully
