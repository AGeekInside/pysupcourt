 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We'll hear argument

 5   Home Concrete & Supply.

 6               Mr. Stewart.

 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. STEWART:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               The disputed question in this case concerns

12   the meaning of the phrase "omits from gross income an

13   amount properly includible therein" in 26

14   U.S.C. 6501(e)(1)(A).      More specifically, the question

15   is whether an omission from gross income occurs when a

16   taxpayer overstates his basis in sold property and

17   thereby understates the gain that results from the sale.

18               In December 2010, after notice-and-comment

19   rulemaking, the Treasury Department issued published

20   regulations that interpreted section 6501(e)(1)(A) to

21   apply in overstatement of basis cases.               Those

22   regulations reflect a reasonable interpretation of

23   ambiguous statutory language, and they are accordingly

24   entitled to deference under Chevron.

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, but only if


                                      3

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   your reading of the Colony decision is correct, right?

 2   If we think that Colony definitively resolved the

 3   question before you, the regulation can't overturn that.

 4                MR. STEWART:     If the Court in Colony had

 5   interpreted the statutory language to be unambiguous, or

 6   if the Court in Colony had issued an authoritative

 7   interpretation that Congress had then built upon, that

 8   would be correct.   But the Court in Colony stated that

 9   the language was, in its words, "not unambiguous."

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Yes, but once -- once we

11   resolve an ambiguity in a statute, that's the law, and

12   the agency cannot issue a -- a regulation that changes

13   the law just because, going in, the language was

14   ambiguous.

15                MR. STEWART:     I think -- I don't think that

16   the Court in Colony purported to give a definitive

17   definition of the phrase "omits from gross income an

18   amount properly includible therein" wherever it appears

19   in the United States Code.        And the Court in the first

20   paragraph of its opinion in Colony said the sole

21   question before us is whether the taxpayer is subject to

22   the extended assessment period under the 19 -- under the

23   Internal Revenue Code of 1939.

24                And as the D.C. Circuit, for instance,

25   pointed out in Intermountain, what we are interpreting


                                     4

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   now is the 1954 code.       It's true that, like the 1939

 2   code, it includes the phrase "omits from gross income an

 3   amount properly includible therein," but it also

 4   includes adjacent provisions that bear upon the meaning

 5   of that phrase.    I think --

 6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, if they use

 7   the exact same phrase, and it's a fairly detailed --

 8   it's not just a normal phrase they might use elsewhere,

 9   I think it's reasonable to assume that that phrase came

10   in with the baggage it -- it carried from the Colony

11   case; right?

12                  MR. STEWART:     I think it's important to

13   remember that the 1954 code was enacted in 1954, and the

14   Colony decision came in 1958.             And so, I would take your

15   point that if Congress had enacted the same language

16   after this Court's decision in Colony, then the adjacent

17   statutory provisions that we're relying on would be

18   pretty indirect means of an -- of expressing an intent

19   to change the law.

20                  But what Congress was reacting to in 1954

21   was not this Court's Colony decision; it was reacting to

22   a circuit conflict and trying to resolve that conflict.

23                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         Yes, but our job is not to

24   plumb Congress's psyche and decide what they had in

25   mind.   It's to interpret the statute.               And if, as you


                                       5

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   acknowledge, it's a pretty obscure way to change the law

 2   from what we said it was, the law that's written there,

 3   that's a very obscure way to change it.           I'm inclined to

 4   think that the law stays the way it was.

 5               MR. STEWART:       Well, let me point to the

 6   statutory provisions that I have in mind, to explain a

 7   little bit more fully why we think that the context in

 8   which the new provision or the 1954 provision appears

 9   bears on the -- the proper interpretation of the

10   disputed phrase.

11               It's at page 1a of the red brief, the

12   appendix to the Respondents' brief.

13               And the -- the general rule stated in

14   subsection (A) is:    "If the taxpayer omits from gross

15   income an amount properly includible therein which is in

16   excess of 25 percent of the amount of gross income

17   stated in the return," the assessment period is 6 years

18   rather than 3 years.

19               And it's important to recognize that, for

20   purposes of the Internal Revenue Code generally, the

21   term "gross income" is defined to include gains derived

22   from dealings in property.         And in that sense, it

23   might --

24               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           But that -- but that

25   argument hasn't changed between the predecessor statute


                                      6

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   and this statute.   You made the same argument under the

 2   Colony statute.   It lost.      So, you can't go back to that

 3   argument because it's already been rejected.

 4                So, what goes from that?

 5                MR. STEWART:     Well, if you look at

 6   subparagraph (i), Roman (i) -- or Roman (i) after the

 7   general rule, it says:     "In the case of a trade or

 8   business, the term 'gross income' means the total of the

 9   amounts received or accrued from the sale of goods or

10   services (if such amounts are required to be shown on

11   the return) prior to diminution by the cost of such" --

12   "of such sales or" --

13                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         My problem with your

14   argument as I read it in the brief, it's a bit

15   convoluted, as Justice Scalia observed.          But if Congress

16   intended to change Colony, it wouldn't just have created

17   this subdivision (i); it would have changed the main

18   statement.   So, why don't we read this as simply saying

19   we accept whatever Colony said, and the only thing we're

20   -- we're creating exceptions around are the following?

21   The exception argument.

22                MR. STEWART:     As I say, I would agree that

23   if Congress had passed this statute after the Court's

24   decision in Colony, that this would have been a fairly

25   oblique way to reflect an intent to change what the


                                     7

 1   Court had done.   But Congress was acting in 1954, before

 2   the Court's decision in Colony, and it was reacting to a

 3   circuit conflict.

 4                 And I think it's -- it's just as fair to say

 5   that --

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          So, this language would

 7   have one meaning if the very same language were adopted

 8   after our decision in -- in Colony and a different

 9   meaning if it were adopted, as it was, before our

10   decision in Colony.

11                 MR. STEWART:      Well, in our -- I think --

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          That's a very strange

13   approach to a -- to the meaning of a statute, it seems

14   to me.

15                 MR. STEWART:      It may be strange, but I think

16   in a sense it's the Respondents who are striving for

17   strangeness, in the following way --

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, but -- but you're

19   saying -- and I'm just trying to supplement

20   Justice Scalia's question so -- so you can continue to

21   answer it.

22                 You're saying that the split is somehow more

23   obscure or more imprecise in its formulation than what

24   Colony did.   You're saying that, oh, if Congress knew

25   about Colony, they would have done it differently, but


                                       8

 1   it was a split, this was close enough for government

 2   work.   That seems to be your argument.           And I --

 3                (Laughter.)

 4                MR. STEWART:      No, I -- I guess there are two

 5   things I'm saying.    The first thing I'm saying is, in

 6   order to construe the statute, we need to not put

 7   ourselves in -- attempt to put ourselves in the minds of

 8   Congress, but at least be aware of the state of the

 9   world at the time that Congress acted.

10                And in 1954, when Congress acted, there was

11   the circuit split.    And if Congress had wanted to

12   endorse the Colony rule going forward and apply it to

13   trades -- to non-trade and -business taxpayers as well

14   as trades and businesses, the most natural thing would

15   have been to change the word "amount" in the main rule

16   to "item," to make clear that the main rule would apply

17   only when an item of gross receipts had been left off

18   the return altogether.

19                It also would have been natural, if Congress

20   had wanted that rule to apply going forward, to change

21   the term "gross income" in the main rule to say "gross

22   receipts" because gross income --

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I still don't understand

24   why the world was different after Colony addressed the

25   split than before Colony addressed the split.            The issue


                                      9

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   is still the same.

 2                MR. STEWART:       I guess the way I would

 3   respond to your question, Justice Kennedy, is to say if

 4   you look at the statute in its current form, both the

 5   text of the main rule and the adjacent provisions that

 6   contextually bear on its meaning, then I think ours is

 7   by far the better interpretation.             And, really,

 8   what Respondents --

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, by far?   By a little

10   maybe, and I might agree with that, but -- but we're not

11   writing on a blank slate here.

12                MR. STEWART:       And what --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Indeed, I think Colony may

14   well have been wrong, but there it is.             It's -- it's the

15   law, and it said that that language meant a certain

16   thing.   And the issue is whether this is -- this change

17   is enough to change the meaning of the statute.              And --

18   and I'm dubious about that.

19                MR. STEWART:       I guess my main point is we

20   think our reading of the text is better, and what

21   Respondents have going for them is the argument that,

22   whether or not this is the way you would otherwise

23   construe the statute, once Colony has said what the

24   statute meant, the Court is bound by it.

25                And our point is that methodology doesn't

 1   really work with this provision, because the Court in

 2   Colony --

 3               JUSTICE KAGAN:        Mr. Stewart, don't you have

 4   two arguments?   One is that the statute changed, but the

 5   other is that even the statute remained the -- even if

 6   the statute remained the same, Colony itself was a

 7   decision that found ambiguity in the statute.              So, you

 8   have the power under Brand X to go back to that statute

 9   and reinterpret it, if you will.

10               MR. STEWART:      We do have the power under

11   Brand X, but we -- we don't think that the Court needs

12   to reach that question.      And when the Court in Colony

13   said that the --

14               JUSTICE KAGAN:        But if the Court thinks it

15   has to reach that question because it agrees more with

16   Justice Scalia than with you as to whether this statute

17   stays the same, then you have independent Brand X

18   arguments, don't you?

19               MR. STEWART:      Yes, we do.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, about that

21   argument, you rely very heavily on the fact that

22   Justice Harlan used the term "ambiguous," right?

23               MR. STEWART:      Yes.

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               But he was writing

25   very much in a pre-Chevron world.           I -- he was certainly


                                    11

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   not on notice that that was a term of art or would


 2   become a term of art.       And, of course, I didn't know


 3   him, but my sense is he was very gracious and polite.


 4   And you can see him saying, well, that's a good


 5   argument, but....   He's not the sort of person who would

 6   say this is it, this is it.

 7               I don't think you necessarily can take the

 8   use of the word "unambiguous" in his opinion to mean

 9   what it does today.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But he did say that

11   something was unambiguous, and that was the little (i)

12   that was added.   And he also said he wasn't taking any

13   position on the '54 code; isn't that so?

14               MR. STEWART:        That's correct.

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             He did.

16               MR. STEWART:        And the Court said that both

17   at the end of its opinion and it also said at the

18   beginning the only question before us is whether the

19   extended assessment period applies under the '39 code.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Is there -- is there

21   a case where we applied Chevron deference to a

22   pre-Chevron opinion?      In other words saying, well, the

23   Court looked at that, but the Court said it was

24   ambiguous; and so, we apply Chevron.

25               MR. STEWART:        I'm not aware of any case.

 1   Obviously, Brand X is a recent decision of this Court.

 2   And I would agree with you that it's perilous to kind of

 3   put a Chevron overlay on decisions that were issued

 4   before Chevron.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:           Even without Chevron -- I

 6   mean, even apply it, I would have thought the point of

 7   Brand X is you look at the language of the statute and

 8   you look at what Congress intended, and where they

 9   intended the agency to have power to interpret, you

10   follow the agency.    And you could do that after the

11   event if the basis for your decision is that it isn't

12   clear.

13               But that isn't Harlan's opinion at all.              He

14   goes and looks at what Congress meant, and what they

15   meant is treat basis like you treat a deduction.           And he

16   gathers that from the legislative history.           And so, I

17   don't see the basis for saying now the agency still has

18   power.

19               Now, forget that one.            I mean, that's one

20   point you might want to address, but I may be too unique

21   in that, in which case it's not worth your time.

22               MR. STEWART:       Let me give two -- let me --

23   let me give two responses to that, Justice Breyer.           I

24   think in effect what Justice Harlan did for the Court in

25   Colony was to construe the term, the reference to an


                                     13

 1   amount of gross income, as though it meant item of gross

 2   receipts.    That was the practical effect of the Court's

 3   decision.    And I think two of the -- two of the adjacent

 4   provisions of the current code make clear that that's

 5   not a --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:          No, I didn't think that was

 7   the basis.    I thought the basis is that there are two

 8   kinds of things:     One is you just don't put in some big

 9   category of stuff in your return, and the agency can

10   never figure that one out.          And the other is where you

11   don't state your deductions correctly.

12                 And now, the cost of goods sold and the

13   basis are difficult cases because of the way the -- the

14   code defined "gross income."              It defines it in terms of

15   gain.   But Harlan says they're like deductions for

16   purposes of this statute.         That's how I read it.

17                 But I have a different question.            You can

18   pursue this one if you want.              My -- what's really

19   bothering me about this case -- and I can't quite figure

20   out the answer to this -- is it seems to me when they

21   filed that tax return in April of 2000, it was a

22   terrible loophole, but these lawyers have the job of

23   creating loopholes or at least trying to take advantage

24   of them.    Okay?   And the IRS had told them this was

25   okay.   Indeed, they had informal advice to that effect.

 1                Now, there's a -- you don't put the date of

 2   the year 2000 reg, and I don't know if you're both

 3   talking about the same thing.           I was really surprised

 4   there was no date there.      Then what happens is, after

 5   you lose in every circuit -- not you personally -- they

 6   lose in every circuit; and then in the year 2009, they

 7   say, though we lost and though we told everybody this is

 8   okay at the time they filed the return, now we're going

 9   to pass a new reg and we're going to penalize them,

10   taking all back this money 9 years later.           That seems to

11   me pretty unfair.   So, I'd like to know just that

12   answer.

13                MR. STEWART:     Well, at the time that the

14   2009 regulation was promulgated first in temporary form,

15   we had lost cases in two courts of appeals.           One was

16   Bakersfield in the Ninth Circuit, but the court of

17   appeals in that case said that because the statutory

18   language was ambiguous, the agency might be able still

19   to promulgate a regulation that would get Chevron

20   deference.

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And what was -- and what

22   was the date of that, Bakersfield?

23                MR. STEWART:     That was in, I believe,

24   either -- I believe 2008 was the Ninth Circuit --

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Oh, okay.

 1                MR. STEWART:       -- decision in Bakersfield.

 2   It was -- at any rate, it was before the -- the issuance

 3   of the regulation in temporary form.               A couple of months

 4   before the regulation was promulgated, we had lost

 5   Salman Ranch in the Federal Circuit, but that was by a

 6   two-to-one vote.   At that time, we had won this issue in

 7   four trial courts --

 8                JUSTICE KAGAN:         But, Mr. Stewart, prior to

 9   this latest round of litigation, had the IRS ever said,

10   ever given any indication, that it viewed Colony as not

11   controlling any -- any -- any longer?

12                MR. STEWART:       Yes, I think probably the best

13   indication of our -- the position in the intervening

14   years -- and we agree that there's a surprising dearth

15   of law -- was the Fifth Circuit litigation in Phinney,

16   P-H-I-N-N-E-Y, which was decided in 1968.              Phinney

17   involved a situation in which the taxpayer accurately

18   reported the amount of gross receipts, approximately

19   $375,000, but misstated the nature of the receipts as

20   proceeds of a stock sale rather than of an installment

21   sale.   And the reason that that misstatement of the

22   nature of the receipt made a difference was that it

23   potentially affected the taxpayer's entitlement to take

24   a stepped-up basis.

25                And so, the court of appeals in Phinney said


                                      16

 1   that was subject to the extended assessment period, that

 2   the misstatement of the nature of the --

 3               JUSTICE KAGAN:          And as a result of this

 4   case, had the IRS suggested in any kind of guidance or

 5   rulings or anything else that it viewed Colony as an

 6   outdated decision?     Because, you know, I'm a taxpayer,

 7   and I'm reading Colony and I'm thinking the language of

 8   the statute is still the same; why wouldn't Colony

 9   control?

10               MR. STEWART:         Well, I -- I think one reason

11   you might think that is that if you were -- you -- the

12   opinion was not oblivious to the fact that the 1954 code

13   had been enacted in the meantime, and the Court went out

14   of its way to say:     We are discussing only the 1939

15   code, and we are not pronouncing on the meaning of the

16   1954 code, other than to note that our -- our conclusion

17   in this case is consistent with the unambiguous language

18   of new 6501(e)(1)(A).       And as the D.C. Circuit explained

19   in Intermountain, that is best read as a reference to

20   subparagraph (i), which says that for a trade or

21   business taxpayer, "gross income" will mean gross

22   receipts without an offset for the cost of acquiring

23   goods and services.      So --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:            If --

25               MR. STEWART:         -- I think, as a taxpayer, you


                                      17

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   would at least be on notice that there was uncertainty

 2   as to the proper meaning of the -- the code.             Judge

 3   Boudin had written for the First Circuit in a case

 4   called CC&F W. Operations in 2001 that it was at least

 5   doubtful whether the main holding of Colony carried over

 6   to the new -- the 1954 code.              That was certainly dictum,

 7   but it also flagged the fact that this was a subject of

 8   uncertainty.

 9                  And remember, the provision at issue here

10   doesn't bear on the legality of the taxpayer's

11   substantive returns.      The only question is whether the

12   IRS has 3 years or 6 years to make an extended

13   assessment.    So, as of 2003, when 3 years from the date

14   of the return had run for these taxpayers, I think the

15   -- what was out there gave them notice that there was at

16   least uncertainty whether Colony applied.

17                  JUSTICE BREYER:         You say in your brief on

18   page 4:   "In 2000, the IRS issued a notice informing

19   taxpayers that Son-of-BOSS transactions were invalid

20   under the tax law."      And you cite without a date.         So, I

21   was sort of curious whether that particular cite came

22   before or after they filed their return.

23                  MR. STEWART:     I don't know whether --

24                  JUSTICE BREYER:         And they say that -- and

25   I -- in July 2000, 3 months after they were filed, the

 1   Commissioner reiterated his view:              "It has long been

 2   held that the extended statute of limitations," da, da,

 3   da, "is limited to when specific receipts or accruals

 4   are left out of the" -- of gross income, which is

 5   basically the Colony statement.

 6                  MR. STEWART:     Well, the --

 7                  JUSTICE BREYER:         Are you talking about the

 8   same thing?

 9                  MR. STEWART:     No.       No, those were two

10   different documents.

11                  JUSTICE BREYER:         Okay.

12                  MR. STEWART:     The two --

13                  JUSTICE BREYER:         So, there are two different

14   documents.    So -- so, in July, they're telling the tax

15   bar this is okay.    And what you say is this document

16   here, which you refer to without a date, told them it

17   wasn't okay.

18                  MR. STEWART:     Well, first of all --

19                  JUSTICE BREYER:         I'd be rather curious if

20   you could sort that out.

21                  MR. STEWART:     Well, the 2000 notice that the

22   Respondents have cited -- I think the -- the most

23   important point to make about it is that it was the view

24   of a single -- of the district counsel for a single

25   district within the IRS.

 1                  JUSTICE BREYER:         I -- I know there are many

 2   ways of downplaying that, but I'm just curious as to

 3   what happened.    What about the one you cited?              When was

 4   that?

 5                  MR. STEWART:     I don't know the exact date in

 6   2000, but it has long been established that transactions

 7   lacking economic substance and transactions motivated

 8   purely for tax avoidance purposes may be disregarded

 9   from -- by the IRS.      That -- that was a pre-existing

10   proposition.

11                  When we issued the notice with respect to

12   Son-of-BOSS transactions in particular, that was simply

13   the IRS's way of informing taxpayers that we regard this

14   particular avoidance mechanism as encompassed by the

15   general principle that transactions lacking economic

16   substance --

17                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, yes, that's

18   the general principle.       But the point you made just a

19   few moments ago is -- I think is responsive to that,

20   which is:   We're not talking about the merits; we're

21   talking about a statute of limitations.                The whole point

22   of a statute of limitations is some things that are bad

23   are -- are -- are gone.

24                  MR. STEWART:     That's --

25                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              You can't go back to

 1   them.

 2                MR. STEWART:     That's correct, and that's the

 3   proposition that the Respondents are citing the

 4   different 2000 document for.            They are citing it as

 5   though it were a definitive statement of agency position

 6   as to the operation of the assessment period.              It -- it

 7   was not that.   It was a document issued by a single

 8   district counsel.   And in a sense, the -- the reference

 9   to Colony as continuing to -- as though it continued to

10   govern the -- the 1954 code was dictum because the

11   district counsel, even in that document, stated that it

12   would not be inappropriate to --

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              At what -- at what

14   level of the IRS bureaucracy can you feel comfortable

15   that the advice you're getting is correct?

16                MR. STEWART:     Well, this --

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              A single district

18   counsel -- you go to there and say, what do you think?

19   And it tells you, and you say, well, that's fine, but I

20   know you don't count; so, I want to talk to your

21   boss and boss --

22                (Laughter.)

23                MR. STEWART:     No, this is not advice to the

24   taxpayer.   That document was a memorandum from the

25   district counsel to another IRS official.              The other IRS


                                    21

 1   official was seeking guidance with regard to the

 2   question of whether we needed to get within the 3-year

 3   assessment period or whether it was appropriate to rely

 4   on the 6-year assessment period.           And although the

 5   district counsel cited Colony in a way that it suggested

 6   that it continued to control the operation of the 1954

 7   code, the district counsel stated on the facts of this

 8   case it would not be inappropriate to rely on the --

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              So -- so, what that

10   -- what happened here is that the taxpayer came to the

11   same conclusion as a district counsel of the IRS.

12                MR. STEWART:     That's correct, but not --

13   didn't come to the same conclusion as the IRS did in

14   litigating the case in Phinney, didn't come to the same

15   conclusion as the IRS did in --

16                JUSTICE BREYER:         What about the -- that's

17   the July.   What about this other, undated one?             Now, I

18   notice what you say about it.           You said that it

19   described "arrangements that unlawfully 'purport to

20   give'" them -- if I read that piece of paper, which I

21   might -- and you probably read it because you cited

22   it -- will I come away with the impression, uh-oh, these

23   loophole arrangements, Son of BOSS, which previously

24   seemed to be okay are now not okay?              Is that the

25   impression I'll have?

 1                MR. STEWART:       I -- first I would say --

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:           Is that the impression you

 3   had?

 4                MR. STEWART:       That notice would not say --

 5   tell you anything relevant to the computation of the

 6   assessment period.

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay.       All right.   That's

 8   what I suspect.   Then look at the unfairness of this.

 9   I'm not saying there aren't worse unfairnesses in the

10   world, but, nonetheless, people spent a lot of money.

11   The whole Bar has gone to an enormous effort.

12   Everything up through 2000 being -- seems to say you can

13   do this.   You have a case on point in the Supreme Court.

14   And then 9 years later, after continuous litigation, the

15   IRS promulgates a regulation which tries to reach back

16   and capture people who filed their return 9 years

17   before.

18                MR. STEWART:       Again, I'm not quite sure what

19   you mean by saying:      would seem to say that you could do

20   this.   I don't think that there were any affirmative IRS

21   statements that could lead people to believe that the

22   Son-of-BOSS mechanism was okay, but what --

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Can you clarify,

24   Mr. Stewart, two things that Justice Breyer brought up?

25   One, he said that the IRS had given people advice that


                                      23

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   Son of BOSS was okay; it would work -- this tax shelter,

 2   this tax scheme, would work.

 3                  And then he said -- he suggested that a

 4   basis is like deductions.         And you agree that

 5   overstatement of deductions don't get you the longer


 6   statute of limitations.        So, why -- why should an


 7   inflated basis get you to 6 years when inflated


 8   deductions don't?     That's one question.


 9                  And the other question is, is it so, that


10   agents told people that Son of BOSS would work?            Is --

11                  MR. STEWART:     No.       No, it's not true that

12   the IRS had advised people that Son-of-BOSS transactions

13   were okay.    It wasn't until 2000 that the IRS issued a

14   specific document that said, as a matter of agency

15   policy, they're not okay.         But, again, that document was

16   just a kind of case-specific application of the more

17   general -- of the more general proposition that

18   transactions lacking economic substance can be

19   disregarded.

20                  With respect to why the overstatement of

21   basis is treated differently from the overstated

22   deduction, that follows inexorably from the language of

23   the code.    That is, Congress defined the conduct that

24   would trigger the general rule as an omission from gross

25   income, and because of the way that gross income is


                                      24

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   defined, an overstatement of basis can lead to an

 2   understatement of gain, which in turn is taken into

 3   account in computing gross income.                A deduction may

 4   ultimately affect taxable income, but it doesn't affect

 5   gross income.   And so, there would be no way of reading

 6   the statute to encompass that.

 7                 Now, as to why Congress would have done

 8   this, I think a clue is furnished by subparagraph Roman

 9   (ii), which is at the bottom of page 1a, and it says:

10   "In determining the amount omitted from gross income,

11   there shall not be taken into account any amount which

12   is omitted from gross income stated in the return if

13   such amount is disclosed in the return, or in a

14   statement attached to the return, in a manner adequate

15   to apprise the Secretary of the nature and amount of

16   such item."

17                 And so, that provides a safe harbor that

18   says even if you fall within the general rule, even if

19   you understated your gross income by more than

20   25 percent, if, at some point in the return, you gave

21   the IRS adequate information to notice that the

22   misstatement had taken place, you will be off the hook

23   for the 6-year assessment period.

24                 And I think that is highly relevant in

25   responding to the policy concern that Justice Harlan


                                     25

 1   identified in Colony.     That is, Justice Harlan said the

 2   reason we think that Congress intended to restrict the

 3   statute to situations where an item is left off the

 4   return altogether is that those would be the most

 5   difficult for the IRS to catch; the IRS would be placed

 6   at a special disadvantage.

 7                Here in subparagraph (ii), Congress has

 8   accomplished the same intent but through a different

 9   mechanism.   That is, it's made the general rule sweep

10   more broadly but given taxpayers an out where the

11   disclosures are adequate.

12                If I could reserve the balance of my time.

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Just on that point -- and

14   we'll find out in a minute -- is the Respondent going to

15   say, well, it's always implicit that you have a basis;

16   everybody knows you have a basis?

17                MR. STEWART:     I don't think that --

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So, that's -- so, that's

19   necessarily what you're telling the government.

20                MR. STEWART:     I don't think he will say --

21   I don't want to speculate too much on what he will say,

22   but I think his position is an overstatement of basis

23   could never trigger the assessment period because the

24   item of gross receipts would have been adequately

25   disclosed.

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, counsel.

 2                Mr. Garre, is it implicit that you always

 3   have a basis?

 4                ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

 5                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 6                MR. GARRE:     Your Honor, our position is the

 7   one that the Court reached in Colony, which is that an

 8   overstatement of basis is not an omission from gross

 9   income.   What the Court held in Colony was that an

10   omission -- an omission from gross income is where you

11   leave out a specific taxable item or receipt.

12                We think the court of appeals got it right

13   when it concluded that the statute of limitations on the

14   statute -- on the tax assessments at issue expired in

15   2003 and rejected the IRS's extraordinary efforts to

16   avoid that result by discombobulating this Court's

17   decision in Colony and by seeking to retroactively

18   reopen and extend the statute of limitations.

19                What the Government relies on principally is

20   the addition of subparagraph (i) in the code, and that

21   was added in 1954, before the Court's decision in 1958.

22   And I'd like to make a few points about subparagraph (i)

23   because I think it's the crux of the Government's

24   position.

25                The first is just the anomaly of their


                                     27

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   argument, that by adding this subparagraph -- and it's

 2   on page 1a of the addendum to the red brief -- which

 3   explicates the definition of "gross income" in one

 4   specific context, the sale -- the cost of goods or

 5   services by a trade or business, Congress meant to

 6   change the general rule -- and that's what it called it,

 7   the "general rule" -- in subsection (A).

 8               JUSTICE KAGAN:         Well, why do you think they

 9   added that paragraph?      Because it seems clear that there

10   was a circuit split at that time about exactly this

11   question and that this paragraph was a response to that

12   circuit split.    So, what else could Congress have meant

13   by it?

14               MR. GARRE:      Well, Your Honor, I think that's

15   probably right.   It thought it was agreeing with the

16   taxpayer side of the circuit split.               There's legislative

17   history indicating that it also thought it was

18   addressing the computational rule of how to get gross

19   income, which factors into the 25 percent trigger.

20               I think what maybe is most important is that

21   this Court in Colony looked at the 1954 amendments at

22   the suggestion of the government and concluded that its

23   decision was consistent with the 1954 amendments.

24   That's in the last line of the decision.

25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Were most of the --

 1                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But that's got to mean --

 2   that's got to refer to (i).            It can't refer to the --

 3   Harlan said two things.        He said it's ambiguous;

 4   therefore, I'm going to look at the legislative history

 5   to find out what the predecessor section means.

 6                  And then he says:          I'm not going to

 7   speculate on what this new thing means, but I do want to

 8   point out that the result we reach in Colony is in

 9   harmony with the unambiguous language of 6501, et

10   cetera.   The only unambiguous language that he could be

11   referring to is in (i) because he has just -- he had

12   said the earlier language was ambiguous.

13                  MR. GARRE:    Well, I don't -- I don't think

14   so, Your Honor.    First of all, you're right, he referred

15   to the whole 6501(e)(1)(A), which includes both

16   subsections.    It's not clear that he was identifying

17   subparagraph (i).    He could have well been referring to

18   subparagraph (ii), along the lines of what my friend

19   just spelled out, because much of the Colony decision

20   was based on addressing the situation where the -- where

21   the IRS is at a special disadvantage because something's

22   been left out entirely.        And that really kind of gets to

23   the heart of subparagraph (ii).

24             But the anomaly of the Government's

25   construction here today is that Colony would come out


                                      29

 1   differently, because Colony doesn't involve a taxpayer

 2   involved in the sale of goods or service; it involved a

 3   taxpayer in the sale of real property.               So, even though

 4   this Court in Colony said --

 5                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           -- real estate developer

 6   in the business of buying and selling property.              So, I'm

 7   not sure that I buy your argument that it can't be goods

 8   and services, because that was the services of this

 9   particular company.

10                  MR. GARRE:    Your Honor, the sale of real

11   property, whether in parcels or otherwise, has always

12   been treated differently than the sale of -- costs of

13   goods or services, which really is a term of art.              And

14   if you go back at Colony, you can see that the Court

15   referred to basis, referred to property, and that's

16   precisely the way that the parties did in their brief.

17   The Solicitor General in its own brief framed the

18   question presented as overstatement of basis in the sale

19   of property.

20                  That's the situation that we have here

21   today.   The subparagraph (i) they're referring to is

22   addressed to the specific situation of a trade or

23   business involved in the sale of costs of goods or

24   services --

25                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And I --


                                      30

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1               MR. GARRE:     -- which is different.

 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I was going to ask in

 3   conjunction with Justice Kagan's discussion, were the

 4   pre-Colony cases that involved splits -- did most of

 5   those or any of those relate to the sales of goods and

 6   services or were they all real estate sales?           Do --

 7               MR. GARRE:     Your Honor, the Uptegrove case

 8   did, the Third Circuit case.           But they involved -- the

 9   fact is they involved both the sale of property and the

10   sale of goods and services.         And at that time, no one

11   was drawing this bright-line distinction.

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, but the Congress

13   drew it, as I think is implicit in Justice Kagan's

14   question, when it talks just about goods and services.

15               MR. GARRE:     It did do that.        There was one

16   reason for Congress to address that specific situation,

17   in that there was a regulation that had defined "gross

18   income" differently.   It's appended at the end of our

19   brief, and it was discussed in Uptegrove.           So, there was

20   a reason to single that out.           But I think the more --

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And the other reason, it

22   was goods and services.     There's always FIFO and LIFO.

23   I mean, there's -- you know, taxpayers who sell goods

24   have inventory cushions.     And so, the IRS is very, very

25   well aware that that kind of judgment is involved in all


                                   31

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   these statements.   It's not quite the same with basis.

 2                MR. GARRE:    Well, Your Honor, I think it's

 3   the opposite, if I understand your question, which is

 4   that taxpayers typically put more information which is

 5   going to put the IRS on notice when you're dealing with

 6   basis and the sale of property as opposed to the costs

 7   of goods and services, which involve many transactions

 8   and you're dealing with them in the aggregate.           When

 9   you're dealing with the sale of property, as in Colony

10   and here, you're dealing with specific disclosures as to

11   the basis.

12                Here, if you look on page 151 of the JA, it

13   lays out the adjustment in the basis.            And the same was

14   true in Colony.   And so, to the extent that there's a

15   distinction there, I think it cuts in favor of the

16   taxpayer.

17                The problem for the Government is all of the

18   amendments in 1954 were pro-taxpayer amendments as

19   relevant here; and yet, the Government's conclusion is

20   that by adding this subsection addressing the specific

21   situation, it meant to take away the general rule in a

22   way that hurt taxpayers.      It's inconsistent with what

23   this Court said in Colony because the Court --

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Well, why would they be

25   redundant?   I mean, if the statute without little (i)


                                    32

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   meant what you said it meant, then there would be no

 2   occasion to put this in, because "omission from gross

 3   income" would refer to items of income, period.              That's

 4   -- so, what work does (i) do, if it just -- if the main

 5   rule, the general rule, is as you say it is?

 6                MR. GARRE:    Your Honor, everyone agrees it's

 7   not redundant, even the Government, because what it does

 8   is, at a minimum, it has a computational effect of

 9   affecting the 25 percent trigger.           The amount to get to

10   the trigger has to be --

11                JUSTICE KAGAN:       But you agree that that's

12   not why Congress passed that provision?

13                MR. GARRE:    Well, it's not clear, Justice

14   Kagan.   The -- the Federal Circuit in the Salman Ranch

15   case cited legislative history that suggested it was

16   trying to achieve just that result.              But I think the

17   broader point I would make is it's not at all uncommon

18   for Congress to act to provide an answer to a specific

19   situation that had come up by explicating it.              And yet,

20   one doesn't conclude that, in doing that, it's intended

21   to overstate -- override the entire general rule that's

22   stated, particularly where it doesn't touch the language

23   that's the subject of the general rule.              Congress didn't

24   in any way touch the phrase interpreted in Colony,

25   "omission from gross income."

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1               And the anomaly gets even greater if you

 2   look at Congress's actions after Colony.          In 1965,

 3   Congress amended the heading.          Now, granted it's only a

 4   heading, but it amended it, the heading to the

 5   subsection, to mean "Substantial omission of items,"


 6   which is perfectly consistent with Colony's


 7   interpretation, directly contrary to the Government's


 8   interpretation.


 9               In 1982, Congress re-enacted the same


10   language, "omission from gross income," found in the

11   provision at issue in Colony in 26 U.S.C. 6229, which is

12   the provision for partnerships.          And yet, it omitted the

13   subparagraph (i) that the Government relies upon as the

14   transformative provision narrowing the general rule.

15   And so, why on earth would -- would Congress omit that

16   subparagraph if it did the transformative work that the

17   Government suggests?

18               The Government doesn't have a response

19   except to say that they have to be interpreted the same

20   way, which makes no sense given the emphasis it's

21   placing on subparagraph (i).           I think the answer is, is

22   subparagraph (i) just doesn't have and was never

23   intended to have the transformative effect that the

24   Government suggests.

25               Whatever -- we can talk about what the Court


                                   34

 1   meant in Colony, but I do think that it's critically

 2   important that Colony is entitled to full stare decisis

 3   effect.    In fact, it's stare decisis coupled with

 4   Congressional re-enactment.           The Government describes

 5   the world after Colony, but the fact is, if you go back

 6   and look, no one thought that Colony was just a ship

 7   passing the night that had only retrospective

 8   significance.    Everybody, including the IRS, appreciated

 9   that Colony was a landmark decision.

10                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, Mr. Garre, where do

11   you find evidence of that?         Because you cite some cases

12   in your brief that end up not really supporting your

13   position.    And as far as I can see, there's only one

14   case after Colony that deals with the question of

15   whether Colony continues to govern after the 1954

16   amendments.    And that case, which is Phinney, seems to

17   cut in the opposite direction.           So, am I missing

18   something?    Are there cases that -- that favor you that

19   say that, yes, Colony continued to control?

20                 MR. GARRE:    I think what my response would

21   be first as to Phinney, the Fifth Circuit has clarified

22   that the Government's construction of Phinney is just

23   wrong.    Phinney was consistent with the Colony rule.           It

24   dealt with a particular application of it.

25                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, whatever the Fifth

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   Circuit said about Phinney, when I read Phinney, it

 2   seems to me to cut in the Government's direction if not

 3   to be entirely on all fours.           But I asked, are there any

 4   other cases that you have that suggest that the courts

 5   did think that Colony was continuing to be the governing

 6   rule?

 7               MR. GARRE:    If I could make one point on

 8   Phinney, and then I'll address the other cases.             I would

 9   ask you to look at the Solicitor General's opposition

10   brief in Phinney, which recognized that Colony was the

11   governing principle.   One would think that the

12   Government thought that Colony was just a shot in time,

13   had no ongoing significance, they would have said that

14   in the opposition brief in Phinney.             The Solicitor

15   General accepted Colony as the governing rule, as

16   everyone did.

17               As to the cases, I think it's fair to say

18   that, no, we can't point to a case in the 1950s, '60s,

19   or '70s where they specifically confronted the question

20   before the Court today.     But what I -- what I -- what I

21   can say is look at the cases that we cite in our brief,

22   and all of those cases discuss this Court's opinion in

23   Colony as if it continues to have lasting effect on the

24   interpretation of the "omits from gross income."             And

25   yet, in the Government's -- the IRS's own internal


                                   36

 1   documents -- we cite two, 1976 and 2000 -- where the IRS

 2   internally is treating Colony as a landmark decision

 3   which controls on a current going-forward basis.

 4                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Because what I was thinking,

 5   Mr. Garre -- and tell me what you think the consequence

 6   of this would be -- is that if I were a tax lawyer and

 7   somebody came to me and said is Colony still the rule, I

 8   would have said:    Well, I can't tell you 100 percent.               I

 9   think you're good 70 to 80 percent.                You know, it's the

10   same language, and there's Colony out there, and -- and

11   -- and nothing the IRS hasn't said that Colony doesn't

12   control, but I can't -- so, I'm giving a 70 percent.

13                  Do you win if that's the state of the world

14   as I see it?

15                  MR. GARRE:    Well, I don't know how you would

16   put a percentage on -- on, in effect, whether Colony was

17   a "step one" case or not.         I mean --

18                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, in terms of what a

19   taxpayer thinks, whether Colony continues to govern.

20                  MR. GARRE:    I think so.           I mean, I think,

21   you know, the IRS's actions here really put taxpayers in

22   an extraordinary situation.            I mean, they're taking a

23   decision of this Court that says an overstatement of

24   basis -- no, that's not an omission of gross income.

25   They're relying on the 1954 amendments to get around

 1   that.   Look at the Colony decision.              The Colony decision

 2   says the 1954 amendments -- no, this decision is

 3   perfectly consistent with those.

 4                 And here comes the Government --

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But it also said before

 6   that, Mr. Garre, and without doing more than noting the

 7   speculative debate between the parties as to whether

 8   Congress manifested an intention to clarify or --

 9   clarify or change the 1939 code.            So, not taking a

10   position on whether the new section changes the code.

11   And the part that is in harmony -- I can't see how that

12   could be read to mean anything other than the (i), which

13   is unambiguous and certainly in harmony with the result

14   in Colony.

15                 MR. GARRE:    Justice Ginsburg, the government

16   in Colony argued that the 1954 amendments compelled its

17   interpretation, which was the one that the Court

18   rejected.    If -- if this Court -- this Court must have

19   considered that argument in reaching the opposite

20   conclusion.   I think -- I think you're right, that it's

21   fair to describe that language as dictum.              But this

22   Court has many times said that even if something is

23   dictum, if it explicates the Court -- Court's holding,

24   the lower courts and this Court would give it great

25   weight in its --

 1                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But as I read it, it

 2   isn't saying and Colony controls; it's saying we're not

 3   going to take a position on what the 1954 code does,

 4   whether it clarifies or changes.

 5                  MR. GARRE:    I think that the prefatory

 6   language there -- I think -- I think you're right.

 7   That's a fair characterization.            But, ultimately, what

 8   the Court said was its holding was in harmony with the

 9   new statute.    And you can't reach that conclusion if you

10   agree with the Government's interpretation.

11                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But he says "unambiguous

12   language," and he can't mean the general rule because

13   he's already said that is ambiguous.                He's got to mean

14   the new provision, which is certainly unambiguous.

15                  MR. GARRE:    I don't think it has to be (i),

16   Your Honor.    I think it could be subsection (ii).                We

17   don't know which one he was referring to.                And the

18   reason why it could be subsection (ii) is because a

19   great deal of the Court's analysis dealt with the -- the

20   question whether the Commissioner was at a disadvantage.

21                  I would like to address the rationale in

22   Colony.   My friend has referred --

23                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Before -- if I could

24   just interrupt you, before you do so, to follow up on

25   Justice Kagan's question.

 1                  Under our current regime, can you ever give

 2   more than a 70 percent chance?            Because you have, in the

 3   absence of a definitive Supreme Court ruling, the IRS

 4   can reach a different result and it can do that

 5   retroactively.    So, I mean, you don't disagree with

 6   that, right?    I mean, if we determine that Colony was

 7   ambiguous, the IRS can change the rule in Colony, and it

 8   can apply that rule, new rule, retroactively.               That's

 9   what our cases say, right?

10                  MR. GARRE:    Well, we do disagree with it --

11   I mean, I certainly accept the Brand X part of that.

12   What we disagree with is that (a) the IRS has the

13   authority to retroactively apply an interpretation of a

14   statute, which gets to the meaning of 7805(b)(1); and

15   (b) whether or not the regulation in this case on its

16   face applies it retroactively.            But I accept --

17                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Well, they can't -- they

18   can't change the interpretation of the statute, but they

19   are the agency with expertise to define a term within a

20   statute.   Why don't they have the expertise to define

21   either what the words "gross income" mean or don't mean?

22                  MR. GARRE:    Well, they don't have any leeway

23   to overturn this Court's decision if that decision

24   specifically addressed the question.               And that's the

25   language of Chevron, and as it turns --

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:          No, and if it is --

 2   according to Brand X, if it specifically addressed the

 3   question and said that there was no ambiguity.           But

 4   according to Brand X, if there's ambiguity, despite a

 5   holding of this Court, the agency can effectively

 6   overrule a holding by a regulation, right?          Isn't that

 7   what Brand X says?

 8                MR. GARRE:     Brand X says that --

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:          So, the only question here

10   is, as the Chief Justice put it, whether -- whether

11   indeed Colony meant by "ambiguous" ambiguous.

12                MR. GARRE:     I --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:          It depends on what the

14   meaning of "ambiguous" is, right?

15                (Laughter.)

16                MR. GARRE:     I don't think so, for this

17   reason:   Because Colony -- at the beginning of the

18   Court's decision, Justice Harlan in a gracious way, as

19   the Chief suggested, pointed out that there could be

20   some ambiguity in the text.           But then he went on to

21   apply the traditional tools of statutory construction.

22                JUSTICE ALITO:        But I can hardly even think

23   of a statutory interpretation question that we've gotten

24   that doesn't involve some degree of ambiguity, if we're

25   honest about it.   We take a case where there's a


                                     41

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   conflict in the courts of appeals.               And so, there was at

 2   least enough ambiguity in those cases for one or more

 3   courts of appeals to come to an interpretation that's

 4   contrary to the one that we ultimately reach.              So, what

 5   degree of ambiguity is Brand X referring to?

 6                MR. GARRE:    Well, I would -- I would think

 7   that Brand X refers back to Chevron and looks to the

 8   first step of Chevron.     Brand -- what Brand X is looking

 9   to is whether or not -- it's really a step one or step

10   two case.   And on step one, Chevron looks to whether

11   Congress has addressed the specific question presented.

12   And if you look at the Court's decision in Colony, what

13   Justice Harlan said was Congress was addressing itself

14   to the specific situation where a taxpayer actually

15   omitted some income receipt or accrual in his

16   computation of gross income, and not --

17                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, that was the specific

18   situation, but then the question was, how clearly did

19   Congress speak to that specific situation?              And in order

20   to get his result, Justice Harlan says first that the

21   statute is -- that the statutory text is ambiguous, goes

22   to a bunch of legislative history, and none of that

23   legislative history actually speaks to the exact

24   question before the Court, only by implication.

25                So, if you look at the whole of -- of the


                                    42

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Colony opinion, it sure seems as though there's a lot of

 2   extrapolation going on and essentially a lot of

 3   ambiguity.

 4                MR. GARRE:      Well, I would disagree with

 5   that, respectfully, Your Honor.            I think the -- the

 6   holding of the Court -- and, again, it's entitled to

 7   stare decisis effect even if this Court might approach

 8   it differently today under different modes of statutory

 9   construction or otherwise.          The holding of the Court was

10   that Congress addressed the specific situation of

11   whether an overstatement of basis was an omission from

12   gross income, and the Court said no.

13                JUSTICE KAGAN:         Well, in the end, there has

14   to be a resolution.      But the question is, what does it

15   look like before you get to that resolution?            And -- and

16   Justice Harlan is doing a lot of tap dancing there, you

17   know, going to this Senate report, going to that House

18   report, going to this colloquy, before he can come up

19   with an answer.

20                MR. GARRE:      He was employing the traditional

21   tools of statutory construction, not just legislative

22   history.   He talked about the structure and purpose and

23   the patent tax incongruities created by the government's

24   position that an overstatement --

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But he did say -- he did


                                      43

 1   say he was looking to --       he said the text isn't clear;

 2   therefore, I look to the legislative history.

 3                 MR. GARRE:    And that's a tool of statutory

 4   construction.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:         I agree with you on that.

 6   The -- and I agree with Justice Scalia, actually.           There

 7   are many different kinds of ambiguity, and the question

 8   is, is this of the kind where the agency later would

 9   come and use its expertise?           And you're saying here it

10   was up to the Congress and looking at what they had in

11   mind.

12                 All right.    Maybe that's the base -- best

13   ground, but suppose it turns out a majority think you're

14   not right on that.    Okay?      Now, here's my question:

15   Assuming you're wrong on that, which I'm not sure you

16   are, but assuming you're wrong, now we get to this

17   regulation.   Here is my problem:           One -- I have no doubt

18   at some level it seems rather unfair, but that instinct

19   is not enough.   The question is what -- what's the law?

20                 (A) You can say the word "open" doesn't

21   include this case.    But we run into the problem that an

22   agency has great authority to construe its own

23   regulation.

24                 (B) You could say that, well, there's this

25   statute out there that says don't apply it, and there


                                     44

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   are two routes there.     One is something to do with

 2   language, which I think you can think of, which seems to

 3   cut very much against you if read naturally, but you can

 4   strain it to read it in your favor.              And the other has

 5   to do with a parenthetical where, once again, although

 6   they left it out of their brief and they put in

 7   ellipses, I can see why they left it out because when

 8   you read it it's again ambiguous.           We run into the same

 9   problem.

10                Then you could say:           Well, they're not

11   supposed to do these things retroactively, either on

12   common law administrative law grounds or something like

13   that; they shouldn't do it; it's unfair.

14                And they'll say:           But, you see, it wasn't

15   that unfair; a child of 2 would have known this was a

16   loophole.   That's how they would have characterized it.

17   And the IRS never said anything, except for one district

18   director in a different district that really encouraged

19   or underwrote this kind of thing.           So, it's not nearly

20   as unfair as you think.      If you live by loopholes,

21   you'll die by regulation.       You know, something like

22   that.

23                So, looking at those four possible grounds

24   -- and I can't think of a fifth -- you take your choice.

25   Which is the strongest, and how do you apply to the --

 1   reply to the objection?

 2               MR. GARRE:     Well, I think you would first

 3   look at the language of the regulation and see whether

 4   or not --

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:          "Open," that's the term.

 6               MR. GARRE:     -- by its terms, it applies

 7   retroactively.   This Court has made clear, it made clear

 8   in the Bowen case, that it's not retroactively unless

 9   there's a clear -- not retroactive unless there's a

10   clear statement of retroactivity.           And our position is,

11   whatever else is true, that what the effective date

12   provision says and the preamble says, it's just unclear

13   about whether it's retroactive or not.

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:          I never thought that a

15   revision of a statute of limitation was retroactive

16   legislation, just as I've never thought that a provision

17   altering rules of evidence for a crime, even for crimes

18   that were committed before that alteration, is

19   retroactive legislation.

20               MR. GARRE:     Well, I --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:          You know, the crucial date

22   is the date -- at least it's not -- well, you can extend

23   the statute of limitations.

24               MR. GARRE:     I think it's retroactive in the

25   worst way, for this reason:          It at a minimum

 1   extinguishes an affirmative defense, the statute of

 2   limitations.    This Court recognized that --

 3                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         No, I --

 4                  MR. GARRE:    -- in the Hughes Aircraft case.

 5                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         So, say it's unfair, but

 6   I'm not sure that the rule against -- presumption

 7   against retroactivity technically applies.

 8                  MR. GARRE:    Well, again, I mean, I think if

 9   you look at Landgraf and the cases talking about what is

10   retroactive, this regulation here if it is applied

11   retroactivity -- retroactively has the consequence this

12   Court points to as the worst kind of retroactivity,

13   which is extinguishing a valid defense in litigation and

14   imposing new consequences for past actions.           Hughes

15   Aircraft recognizes that, as do the many courts of

16   appeals that we've cited in our brief.

17                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Presumptively because

18   you're saying that this is a new interpretation.              But

19   the IRS is taking the position that the meaning hasn't

20   changed --

21                  MR. GARRE:    Well --

22                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- that it's just

23   clarifying some ambiguity that the courts have had; not

24   that it's had.

25                  MR. GARRE:    And with all due respect, the

 1   law in 2003 when the statute of limitations expired was

 2   Colony.   Even if the Court -- the agency had leeway to

 3   reinterpret it, it's changing the law.            And the reason

 4   why it's doing that is it's doing it retrospectively.

 5                If you look at cases like Brand X, the

 6   theory is you have one interpretation, and then the

 7   agency going forward can have another one.            In Brand X,

 8   the agency sought to apply its -- its new interpretation

 9   prospectively.   Here, it's doing retrospectively, and

10   when it does that, it changes the law.            Maybe the

11   concrete example of that is --

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           There's too many

13   presumptions in your answer.            The first is that Colony

14   controlled --

15                MR. GARRE:    No, no --

16                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           -- what to me itself

17   says it's not -- it's not interpreting the new

18   statute --

19                MR. GARRE:    My point on that --

20                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           -- whatever its footnote

21   meant.

22                MR. GARRE:    No, my point on that was not

23   that Colony controlled as a step one matter; it's that

24   even if the Government is right that Colony just said

25   this is one permissible reading, it was the law as the


                                    48

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   -- it was the permissible reading and the law until the

 2   government changed it.      And the government didn't change

 3   it, try to change it, until 2009.            The statute of

 4   limitations in this case expired in 2003.

 5                 And so, if the government can adopt a new

 6   interpretation going forward, the question is, can it

 7   apply that interpretation retrospectively during the

 8   time frame in this case?       And our position on that is

 9   that they certainly haven't done so unambiguously.              And

10   that -- as this Court said in St. Cyr, ambiguity means

11   unambiguous prospectivity.         And the Court also

12   rejected --

13                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Do you -- do you understand

14   the preamble as part of the regulation?            Because if I

15   look at the preamble, the preamble seems pretty clear to

16   me.   It seems to me that your view that the government

17   did not do this clearly enough must rest on looking at

18   the regulation without the preamble.

19                 MR. GARRE:    No.       No.   I mean, the Court

20   could -- I mean, certainly, we think you'd go first to

21   the regulation.   And it says "was open."           The preamble

22   says, quote, this is "not retroactive."            It says it does

23   not apply to open tax -- it only applies to open tax

24   years, and not to reopen closed tax years.            That's on 75

25   Federal Register 78,898.       The government -- the way that


                                     49

                                 Official


 1   the government gets there is to say that, well, even


 2   though we've passed the regulation long after the


 3   statute of limitations expired, because this case is


 4   pending, we can apply the new interpretation in


 5   determining whether the period closed long before we


 6   passed this regulation.


 7               At a minimum, that's -- that's a highly


 8   strained, if not convoluted, way to get around


 9   retroactivity.


10               The way that the regulation's effective date

11   and the preamble speaks about whether this is

12   retroactive or not is really kind of nonsensical.     And I

13   think, at a minimum, the taxpayer ought to get the

14   benefit of that, and this Court should say that if the

15   government really wants to do -- take the extraordinary

16   step that it's taken here to retroactively reopen a

17   statute of limitations, it ought to do so in clear terms

18   and not the convoluted way it's done here.

19               We also think that the -- the IRS just

20   lacked the authority to -- to legislate, to -- to pass a

21   new interpretation on a statute retroactively.     That

22   gets to the meaning of 7805 and whether -- which says

23   regulations relating to a statutory provision enacted

24   after the '96 legislation which purported to strip the

25   IRS of authority to act retroactively, whether the


                                   50

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   "enacted after" clause modifies "regulation" or


 2   "statute."    And we think, in context, it must modify


 3   "regulation" because there's two types of IRS


 4   regulations:     regulations relating to statutes and


 5   regulations relating to IRS internal practices.


 6                  And what Congress said is internal


 7   practices -- sure, you can operate retroactively when


 8   appropriate.     With respect to new interpretations of


 9   statutes, not retroactive.          That was landmark


10   legislation as part of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights.

11                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       I take your point about the

12   purpose, but you would have to ignore every rule of

13   grammar that there is in order to read it your way,

14   don't -- wouldn't you?

15                  MR. GARRE:    Not if you read "regulations

16   which relate to statutory provisions" as -- as one

17   thing.   Regulations which relate to statutory provisions

18   as opposed to regulations which relate to IRS

19   provisions.     And if you look at the legislative history,

20   it's clear Congress was thinking about that distinction.

21   If you do read that as one unit, then the "enacted on or

22   after" obviously modifies that.

23                  I think you have to look at it in context

24   and in light of the purpose of it, to get to that

25   conclusion.     But courts have adopted that conclusion.

 1   The American Council on -- American College of Tax

 2   Counsel lays out those cases.

 3               We think Judge Wilkinson got it right when

 4   he referred to the IRS's position in this case as "an

 5   inversion of the universe" and concluded that accepting

 6   IRS's position would stretch accepted administrative

 7   deference principles beyond their logical and

 8   constitutional limit.

 9               The IRS has the tools of its -- at its

10   disposal to identify tax deficiency and to take

11   appropriate action timely.        Congress acted in 2004 to

12   respond to the precise situation precipitating this case

13   with Son-of-BOSS transactions.          It amended 6501 not by

14   changing the meaning of what's an omission from gross

15   income, but by adopting a new provision which requires

16   taxpayers involved in listed transactions like Son of

17   BOSS to report many additional things, and saying that

18   the statute of limitations did not apply at all if they

19   didn't make those reporting requirements.

20               So, going forward, the only impact of the

21   Court's decision in this case is going to apply to

22   everyday regular taxpayers who simply erroneously

23   misstate or overstate the basis in the sale of a home or

24   other assets.   There's no reason to take the

25   extraordinary steps that the IRS takes -- asks you to


                                    52

 1   take in this case to reach that conclusion.

 2                We would ask the Court to affirm the

 3   judgment of the court of appeals, to reject the IRS's

 4   aggressive position on administrative power, and put an

 5   end to a case that the taxpayer should have never had to

 6   file in the first place.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

 8                MR. GARRE:    Thank you, Your Honor.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Mr. Stewart, you

10   have 3 minutes remaining.

11             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

12                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13                MR. STEWART:     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

14                I'd like to make three quick points.

15                First, Mr. Garre refers to the amended

16   heading of section -- subsection 6501(e), which now

17   states "Substantial omission of items," but I think the

18   heading simply points up the fact that some provisions

19   within subsection (e) refer to amounts and some to

20   items.   Subsection (e)(2), which deals with estate and

21   gift taxes, refers to omission of items.

22                And the legislative history makes clear that

23   Congress chose that term precisely to make clear that

24   the understatement -- or the overstatement or

25   understatement of an item that was reported will not


                                    53

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   give rise to the extended period.

 2                The second thing is that, at bottom,

 3   Respondents argue that the -- that the phrase "amount of

 4   gross income" should be construed to mean item of gross

 5   receipts.   And they don't offer any real textual

 6   argument as to why that would be a sound reading.

 7   Really, they rely exclusively on Colony.              But the Court

 8   in Colony said, at the beginning of its opinion, that it

 9   was pronouncing only on the 1939 code.              It said at the

10   end of its opinion that it was not generally trying to

11   construe the 1954 code.

12                And it stated that the relevant -- the most

13   relevant language was not unambiguous.              And I think the

14   recognition of ambiguity is relevant in part because it

15   sets up our Brand X argument, but it's also relevant

16   because saying that a particular snippet of language is

17   ambiguous is to recognize that its meaning may vary

18   depending on context.     And the --

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Mr. Stewart, I know

20   you've got a -- your third point, and I want to let you

21   get it out, but you mentioned Brand X.              Have we ever

22   applied Brand X to one of our decisions?              Have we ever

23   said an agency by regulation can alter and change one --

24   a Supreme Court decision?

25                MR. STEWART:     No.       I mean, Brand X was the


                                    54

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   first case that announced the Brand X principle, and the

 2   Court has not applied it since.

 3               Justice Stevens --

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, but that was

 5   applying it to a court of appeals decision.

 6               MR. STEWART:     That was applying it to a

 7   court of appeals decision.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Right.   We've never

 9   said an agency can change what we've said the law means.

10               MR. STEWART:     No.       Justice Stevens wrote a

11   separate opinion in Brand X, suggesting that it might

12   not apply to decisions of this Court, but the Court as a

13   whole did not pronounce on that.

14               And then the third point I would want to

15   make is that Mr. Garre referred to cases and one IRS

16   General Counsel opinion that were issued during the

17   period between 1958 and 2000 that applied Colony to the

18   current statute, but they did so in a very specific way.

19   That is, they relied on the aspects of Colony that

20   talked about Congress's purpose to reserve the extended

21   assessment period for cases in which the IRS was at a

22   special disadvantage due to inadequate disclosure.              And

23   those cases applied that language in elucidating current

24   subparagraph (ii), which provides a safe harbor in cases

25   of adequate disclosure.

 1                 Respondents' position goes much further,

 2   though.    Respondent is attempting to rely on Colony for

 3   the proposition that even if its disclosures were

 4   inadequate, the extended period still can't be applied

 5   to it.

 6                 And none of the decisions on which

 7   Respondents rely establish that proposition.

 8                 Thank you.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel,
