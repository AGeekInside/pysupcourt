 3          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               We'll hear argument next

 4   in Case 06-7517, Irizarry versus United States.

 5   Mr. Madden.

 6                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR J. MADDEN, III

 7                       ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 8                  MR. MADDEN:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10                  This is a sentencing process case.             The

11   first step of the sentencing process described by the

12   Court in Rita, as noticed, broke down in this case.                 The

13   Petitioner first learned that the district court

14   contemplated a non-Guideline sentence when it was

15   pronounced.    The grounds for that statutory maximum

16   sentence were not noticed and the issues were,

17   therefore, not litigated.

18                  The government here agrees that the lack of

19   notice was error and advocates notices for all sentences

20   outside the Guidelines.          This is the correct result.

21   Because it's only through notice can the sentencing

22   court subject a defendant's sentence to the thorough

23   adversarial testing contemplated by Federal sentencing

24   procedure.

25                  That quote comes from Rita and relies upon


                                          3

 1   rules 32(f), (h), (i), and a decision of this Court in

 2   United States versus Burns.              That law controls the

 3   decision in this case.

 4                The position of the Amicus --

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You may not have had

 6   notice of the issue of whether or not an alternative

 7   procedure and medication audit would help, but you

 8   certainly knew that future dangerousness was going to be

 9   on the table.    And if you had a response to that, which

10   is, well, if he took his medication, it wouldn't be a

11   problem, I assume you would have prepared for that.

12                MR. MADDEN:        The -- the -- the notice that

13   suggested -- the Guidelines departure which is suggested

14   in the last paragraph of the pre-sentence report, is

15   very specific.   It is directed toward the 4A1.3

16   departure.   The concerns raised by that are completely

17   different than the grounds on which the court departed.

18   So, no, that wasn't adequate notice.

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, yeah, I -- but

20   in terms of what issues might suggest themselves to a

21   judge sentencing this particularly defendant, I would

22   have thought future dangerousness.                  I mean, you have an

23   individual who has leveled particular threats with some

24   degree of certainty that he intends to pursue them, I

25   would have thought that would have been one of the first


                                         4

 1   things a sentencing judge would look at.

 2               MR. MADDEN:        Well, it was looked at in the

 3   context of the sixth level enhancement for intent to

 4   carry out the threat, and it did come up in the context

 5   of acceptance of responsibility.               But both look at

 6   different issues than the ground that the sentence was

 7   ultimately -- the -- the upward non-Guideline sentence

 8   was ultimately imposed on.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, you know this -- this

10   provision 32(h), really doesn't -- does simply not work

11   with post-Booker guidelines.            You either have to say it

12   was designed for a different regime, and therefore, has

13   no effect now after Booker, or else you have to expand

14   it beyond what it says, because may depart from the

15   applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified,

16   under the mandatory guidelines, they were identified

17   grounds for departure.

18               And you had some -- the court could look at

19   those and say, gee, am I going to pick one of these, if

20   so I'll let him know.      But you can depart now simply on

21   the ground that you don't agree with the -- with what

22   the Guidelines say as -- is that what you would call a

23   ground of departure?

24               It's simply a ground of disagreement, I

25   would suppose.   Why shouldn't we hold 32(h) simply.

 1   Simply has no -- no application under the new system?

 2   Or at least hold that all it applies to are departures

 3   within the meaning of the old mandatory guidelines

 4   system?   Which is a much narrower category of

 5   departures.

 6                 MR. MADDEN:        Yes, sir.           I think first it

 7   would seem to make -- it would not make sense to demand

 8   notice for a finite range of factors, but no notice for

 9   a potentially broader one.            That seems

10   counter-intuitive.      But --

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             I don't think it is

12   counter-intuitive to provide -- to -- to require notice

13   when the number of grounds is finite.                     But if the number

14   of grounds is infinite, I'm much less inclined to read

15   it as even applicable to the situation.

16                 MR. MADDEN:        But the -- the decision of --

17   in Burns, I think, answers the question because unless

18   there's -- if a party is not focused -- and generally

19   the parties' papers and the PSR will focus the issues.

20   But in the few cases where -- where an extraneous

21   sentencing consideration that's important enough to

22   drive the sentence up or down is raised, in order to

23   have adversarial testing of that important issue, there

24   has to be some kind of notice.                And it's not -- variance

25   is not what we're calling a variance, a non-Guidelines


                                          6

 1   sentence is not a pure exercise in policy even in


 2   Kimbrough.


 3                 That was a policy disagreement but it was


 4   driven by facts, and the defendant in that case, the


 5   appellant, gave notice that they were going to be

 6   challenging it, and -- and there was a factual

 7   presentation.    So the record was in the right shape to

 8   make the policy determination.

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Post-Booker the guidelines

10   are advisory, and the district judge has discretion as

11   to the sentence.

12                 Now, in the bad old days, when the statute

13   said 20 to 40, and the judge decided to give you 40, he

14   didn't have to give you notice of why he was giving you

15   the highest sentence.

16                 And now that we've returned to a system that

17   is closer to that, why should we interpret 32(h) as

18   imposing a very difficult to comply with requirement

19   that didn't exist under the -- under the pre-pre-Booker

20   system?

21                 MR. MADDEN:       I remember that system.

22                 I think the -- the answer is that -- that

23   it -- it's important -- the requirement is essential for

24   purposes of advocacy on the issues.                      Burns -- Burns

25   reflects the Court's understanding again of what


                                         7

 1   Congress intended in the Sentencing Reform Act.               They

 2   said Congress intended notice and litigation.

 3                 Now, this Court had to make some excisions

 4   on Sixth Amendment grounds in what Congress -- what

 5   Congress could do, but their intent hasn't changed.

 6                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Suppose the district court

 7   in this case had said I'm considering an

 8   above-Guidelines sentence based on facts that are in the

 9   record in the pre-sentence report to protect the public

10   from further crimes of the defendant.

11                 Would that be adequate notice?


12                 MR. MADDEN:       No.      Not on the grounds here.


13   It's close.    It's closer.


14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What would have been?


15                 MR. MADDEN:       I think -- I think --

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And how much time -- this


17   is two questions; time question and the content

18   question.

19                 What would she have had to say to comply

20   with the rule as you read it?

21                 MR. MADDEN:       Yes, Your Honor.         Reading it

22   backward from what the comment -- the explanation of the

23   sentence at the end backwards to what the grounds were

24   and the notice should have been, her finding was that --

25   that he would continue to be a threat regardless of the


                                         8

 1   supervision we are under.            That was the key.

 2                  To say if there is nothing other than

 3   maximum incapacitation which will prevent him from being

 4   a danger in the future, if that was the issue, if the

 5   question is:    Is there any lesser sentence than maximum

 6   extra incapacitation, then everyone could have

 7   litigated, that would have been the issue that was on

 8   the table.

 9                  JUSTICE ALITO:         You seem to be requiring a

10   very specific kind of notice, almost as if the district

11   court has to say this is the sentence that I'm

12   considering, and these are the exact reasons that I'm

13   considering; now what do you have to say about that.

14                  MR. MADDEN:       Yes.       And I think that goes

15   with the Justice's second question.

16                  JUSTICE ALITO:         Is that what you're asking?

17                  MR. MADDEN:       -- content -- it needs to be

18   specific -- it needs to be specific enough so that the

19   facts that get litigated are the ones that are

20   ultimately recited by the court for the reason for the

21   non-Guidelines sentence.

22                  JUSTICE ALITO:         But why would the --

23                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            That's a complex answer.

24   And I -- this seems to me to be a clear case of what was

25   in the judge's mind.        She said I have a record here of


                                          9

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   repeated e-mails to this woman, threatening to kill her,

 2   threatening to kill her new husband, threatening to kill

 3   her mother.     He did it again and again and again.

 4                  I have seen this person, he appeared before

 5   me.     It is my educated prediction that he will do it


 6   again.     So I'm going to put him away for as long as I


 7   can.


 8                  That's -- her reasoning process is not at


 9   all mysterious.


10                  What notice is the defendant lacking?

11                  MR. MADDEN:       I think if -- if she would have

12   said something to the effect that -- and this sometimes

13   happens during the course of a sentencing, that's a

14   different issue -- but here's what's on my mind.          I'm

15   concerned that only extra prison time, incapacitation

16   for as long as I can give him, will do the job of

17   protecting society.       What do you have to say about that?

18                  If that was the -- now isn't the written,

19   formal, this is during the context of the sentencing --

20   the way it comes out, then the response would be

21   something like, "Judge, there's -- there is psychiatric

22   evidence or psychological evidence that's developed that

23   I'd like to put on bearing on that issue in light of the

24   report from Buttner, the new report that just came into

25   the record right before the sentencing, that goes

 1   directly to the issue of amenability to treatment; and

 2   you're concerned that only maximum incapacitation will

 3   address the issue.

 4               I think that's how that -- that's how it

 5   should have played out.

 6               JUSTICE SOUTER:               Why -- why isn't that an

 7   equally response to what Justice Ginsburg just gave as a

 8   recitation of what the what the judge had said.

 9               MR. MADDEN:          The --

10               JUSTICE SOUTER:               She quoted and summarized

11   the judge saying he's going to do it again.

12               MR. MADDEN:          Yes.

13               JUSTICE SOUTER:               Anybody knows that what the

14   judge is getting at is I'm going to put him away as long

15   as I can put him away.         Isn't that just as much notice

16   or just as much a -- a stimulus to the response that you

17   want to give, as your reformulation of the -- of the

18   issue?

19               MR. MADDEN:          Yes, and that goes to the

20   timing question.   When she said that, the next -- in the

21   same paragraph, was -- and, and therefore, it's a

22   60-month sentence.

23               That -- that discussion didn't occur -- the

24   notice didn't --

25               JUSTICE SOUTER:               So it's not the question of


                                         11

 1   notice; it's the question of time to respond.

 2                 MR. MADDEN:       At that point it was

 3   explanation, it explanation of what she was doing, not

 4   notice of what she was going to do at a time when

 5   it would have made a difference.

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            What is she supposed to do?

 7   Usually there -- there's just one sentencing hearing,

 8   right?

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            And there's --

10                 MR. MADDEN:       Usually.

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- a pre-sentence report

12   which both parties have.          And sometimes there are

13   witnesses who come in.        Sometimes the injured parties or

14   the relatives of the deceased party come in; and -- and

15   usually the sentence is imposed at the end of that

16   proceeding.

17                 Now when is -- when is the judge supposed to

18   be so precise as to what particular matters induce her

19   to -- to raise this sentence here?

20                 MR. MADDEN:       I --

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Are you going to have a

22   recess?   Or maybe reschedule the sentencing for -- for a

23   week later so that the judge can decide in detail what

24   particular factors motivate her?

 1   majority of cases, and the government concedes this in

 2   the brief or acknowledges it, that while there are

 3   infinite number of variables that lurk in every case,

 4   practically, there are not that many that are actually

 5   there.   Those are usually identified in the pre-sentence

 6   report which you have way in advance or in advance.

 7                  There are -- the parties have a duty to

 8   identify the issues that are going to be litigated; and

 9   that's done.

10                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Now if it is in the

11   pre-sentence report, is that enough notice?

12                  MR. MADDEN:       Yes.       And that's typically --

13                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            So long as it is in the

14   pre-sentence notice the judge doesn't have to say I plan

15   to rely on this aspect of the pre-sentence report?

16                  MR. MADDEN:       No.

17                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay.

18                  MR. MADDEN:       No, because in the vast

19   majority of cases that's what occurs.                     And then the

20   parties have a duty to interject issues that they think

21   ought to drive the Guidelines or non-guidelines either

22   way.

23                  And the bar is actually getting better at

24   that than when this occurred in picking up on 3553(a)

25   factors, and I think the problem is actually going to

 1   become lesser over time.

 2                  So only in the extraordinary cases -- and

 3   Burns was an extraordinary case -- where an issue that

 4   is important to the judge isn't flagged in the papers --

 5   does the duty arise to let -- let the parties know what

 6   considerations they should focus their attention on, so

 7   that they can be litigated.

 8                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Does the defendant

 9   have an obligation to give notice, both to the

10   government and I suppose to the judge, saying at the --

11   at the sentencing hearing, we're going to say this?                  So

12   the judge can get ready for it?                Or the government can

13   get ready for it?

14                  MR. MADDEN:       Usually, the interests, of

15   course, are different.

16                  The -- the interests of the defendant in --

17   in a lower sentence, I think, is different than

18   defending against a higher -- a higher sentence; but

19   yes, I think it is appropriate.

20                  And the rule says -- rule 32(h) only speaks

21   to the judge.    But I think the parties in their

22   positions are required by the local rule in the Southern

23   District of Alabama and the Federal rule generally to

24   put their -- their positions in writing in advance of

25   the hearing.    I think our rule, I believe, is seven

 1   days.

 2                 So that when the judge, before getting ready

 3   to sentence, looks at the issues, the people with the

 4   heightened interest in them have already identified what

 5   they are.

 6                 So the only -- it's only the residual issues

 7   that are picked up by rule 32.                It occurs very

 8   infrequently in practice.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What about the point

10   made by Chief Judge Boudin in his recent opinion, is

11   that now that we look more carefully at the 3553

12   factors, counsel has to come in prepared to address all

13   of those?

14                 MR. MADDEN:        It is -- you know, as a

15   practical matter, it is extremely wasteful.                  It does not

16   promote focused advocacy.            The sentences that are going

17   to come out of that kind of system won't be on a

18   developed record.     The sentences in the aggregate will

19   be less reliable for purpose of evolution of the

20   guidelines.

21                 There's -- there are -- the reasons for

22   notice I think are in -- notice is important not only

23   for the individual defendant but there's institutional

24   interests as well.

25                 It's a -- it's a fairly rarely occurring

 1   phenomenon where rule 32(h) comes into play.                       The rule

 2   as written doesn't demand any changes.                       It is a matter

 3   of interpretation.      And the Sentencing Commission itself

 4   defines a departure as any non-Guidelines sentence.

 5                  That fits within the literal language of

 6   rule 32(h).    This Court doesn't have to decide this

 7   case.

 8                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            It's not what it meant when

 9   32(h) was promulgated.

10                  MR. MADDEN:       Well, the Court in Rita, which

11   was after Booker, discussed in fact, the sentencing

12   court, applying the Guidelines in individual cases, may

13   depart either pursuant to the Guidelines or since Booker

14   by imposing a non-Guidelines sentence.                       The word

15   departure --

16                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            You could apply departure

17   to post-Booker; but at the time this rule was adopted,

18   departure did not consist of that; it consisted of

19   something much more narrow.

20                  MR. MADDEN:       It -- it had a narrower meaning

21   but -- but the rule 32(h) was to implement the structure

22   of rule 32, that's what Burns said.                       And --

23                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Why should we put into

24   rule 32(h), as Justice Scalia suggests, the 3553(a)

25   factors, when we know that the rule makers did make a

 1   change in 2007?    That is they put 3553(a) into

 2   32(d)(2)(F); so they made a change there and they said

 3   the judge could ask to have these things included in the

 4   pre-sentence report; but they left (H) looking like it's

 5   dealing just with the guidelines.                  Why couldn't the

 6   Court say well, we didn't put 3553 in (h), and so it's

 7   not there?

 8                 MR. MADDEN:        Well, I don't think that that

 9   answers the question, because under the prior structure

10   of the rule, the pre-sentencing was supposed to set out

11   all of the factors and (h) was just -- just a stopgap.

12                 The provision that came in in December of

13   '07 that says that the court can request other factors,

14   I think is just that an authorization to the probation

15   officer to look at -- to look at other factors and to

16   think more broadly.

17                 But I don't think that should be read as

18   limiting the scope of 32(h) simply to what would be

19   traditional guideline departures.

20                 If I could, I'd reserve the balance of my

21   time.

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, Counsel.

24                ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

25                     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 1               MR. ROBERTS:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 2   please the Court:

 3               Rule 32 requires the district court to

 4   provide notice before any departure from the Guidelines

 5   range based on a ground not previously identified by the

 6   PSR of the parties, including a departure based on the

 7   factors in section 3553(a).              Non-Guideline sentences

 8   under section 3553(a) fall squarely within the term

 9   departure, both as defined in the dictionary and as

10   defined in the Guidelines.

11               JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, why shouldn't this

12   rule be dealt with by further rulemaking?                   It is very

13   clear that when 32(h) was adopted, departure had a

14   specific meaning under the Guidelines.                   And what we're

15   talking about now was not contemplated at all by the

16   rulemakers at that time.

17               Now, applying 3553(a) in this situation

18   raises different problems, and there are issues

19   regarding the specificity of the notice that's required

20   and the timing of the notice.              Why shouldn't this be

21   dealt with by further rulemaking when those -- where

22   those things can be handled in a comprehensive way

23   rather than by the haphazard development of case law by

24   the courts of appeals if we agree with your position.

25               MR. ROBERTS:          First of all, as enacted rule

 1   32(h) requires notice of all deviations from the

 2   Guidelines range, and by its plain terms it continues to

 3   do that.    But --

 4                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Are you saying --

 5                 MR. ROBERTS:         Either way --

 6                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Are you saying that if they

 7   had in mind at the time that Booker might be coming down

 8   the road.

 9                 MR. ROBERTS:         No.

10                 JUSTICE ALITO:          There would be

11   non-Guidelines variances from the Sentencing Guidelines.

12                 MR. ROBERTS:         No.      They were focused on

13   Guidelines authorized departures because those were the

14   only ones that were legally authorized at the time.                   But

15   the fact is that they required notice of all -- that --

16   that -- that they were requiring notice of all

17   deviations that were available.                Now they should require

18   notice -- at a minimum, rule 32(h) is still there and it

19   continues to apply to traditional departures.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 The rules advisory

21   committee is currently considering whether or not to

22   change this, right?

23                 MR. ROBERTS:         Yes.       It --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Nobody in that

25   process has suggested, well, it's too bad you've already


                                         19

 1   decided this in 32(h)?

 2               MR. ROBERTS:          Well, yes.             One of the -- they

 3   have, Your Honor.

 4               One of the things that the advisory

 5   committee stated that it was going to consider was --

 6   was lower court decisions on the question -- on the

 7   question of whether notice -- the current text of rule

 8   32(h) requires notice to be given.

 9               So that might have been one of the reasons

10   that some people in the conference were reluctant to

11   adopt an amendment.      Another reason was that they knew

12   that the courts were considering the question, and many

13   people expressed concern that an amendment was

14   premature, that the -- that the conference should await

15   further guidance from the courts and from this Court.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  A lot of judges

17   objected to the idea they would adopt the position

18   you're urging here.

19               MR. ROBERTS:          That's true.            Some judges did

20   object to that.   But others -- as I said, there were

21   other -- some judges expressed support for that

22   interpretation, and there were varying reasons that were

23   motivating different people in the conference to take

24   the position that the conference should wait.

25               The fact is -- and so the Court shouldn't

 1   construe from the failure to enact an amendment just

 2   like the Court is reluctant to construe from the failure

 3   to amend a statute that the current provision doesn't

 4   require notice.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  It's not inferring

 6   from the failure to act.          It is just a recognition that

 7   these things are looked at very carefully by the rules

 8   committees and they look at it in a broad way and take

 9   in all the information.         We know they're doing that now.

10   And we would be kind of jumping the gun and short

11   circuiting that process.

12               MR. ROBERTS:          I don't think so, because

13   they've -- they've referred it back to the subcommittee

14   and said they want to wait and see what -- what this

15   Court does and what the courts to.

16               So, they're waiting for you.                  Doesn't seem

17   like in that circumstance it makes sense for you to wait

18   for them.

19               But however you interpret the current

20   rule -- and the question before you is what the current

21   rule requires.    However you interpret that it doesn't

22   circumvent the rulemaking process --

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             May I ask you this

24   question about the rule:          It says before the court may

25   depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground


                                        21

 1   not identified for departure.               Can a pre-sentence report

 2   say possible grounds for departure are as follows, and

 3   then list them?   Or does this, in your view, mean that

 4   "identified for departure" means as recommended by the

 5   pre-sentencing report?

 6                MR. ROBERTS:          No.      I think that the

 7   pre-sentence report doesn't actually have to recommend

 8   it.   The pre-sentence report -- and they generally have

 9   a section that does this although, although often they

10   don't identify --

11                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, could the

12   pre-sentencing report just list a series of -- a whole

13   series of factors saying these are possible grounds for

14   departure?   Would that comply with the rule?

15                MR. ROBERTS:          I mean, at a certain point it

16   wouldn't, but if it listed more than one as a possible

17   ones and they were identified with sufficient

18   specificity to enable --

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Would future

20   dangerousness -- future dangerousness be something that

21   could be put in the report and that would cover these --

22                MR. ROBERTS:          Yes.       It -- it -- it certainly

23   could, Your Honor.      And the PSR here includes --

24                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             That's the latest thing

25   we're talking about very much.

 1                  MR. ROBERTS:          That's required.

 2                  No.    But what -- what it does show is that

 3   this is a possibility that an out of Guidelines sentence

 4   is a possibility and this is the ground on which it is a

 5   possibility.

 6                  JUSTICE SCALIA?              What if the ground is I

 7   just simply believe that the Guidelines' recommendation

 8   for arson when there are people in the building is

 9   simply too low?       Okay?      You give notice of that.           What

10   good is giving notice of that going to do?                    Is too low.

11   Isn't too low.       Is too low.            Isn't too low.     I mean --

12                  MR. ROBERTS:          The parties can --

13                  JUSTICE SCALIA:              It's almost, you know, a

14   determination of the judge's gut feeling of what is

15   condign punishment for a particular --

16                  MR. ROBERTS:          The parties -- the parties

17   would be able to focus on that and try to inform the

18   judge's decision on that.              But that's not the only kind

19   of -- that's not the only kind of ground on which a

20   court might vary, and that may not be one for which

21   advance notice would be particularly helpful, but there

22   are many on which it is.

23                  If I can give an example of a case we

24   recently confronted, for example?                    We had a case in

25   which a judge imposed probation on a defendant who was


                                           23

 1   convicted of soliciting child pornography because the

 2   judge was under the belief that prison couldn't provide

 3   the necessary treatment.

 4               We hadn't presented any evidence on

 5   available treatment programs, but we certainly would

 6   have done that if we had had notice that the court was

 7   contemplating varying on that ground.                     And because we

 8   didn't do that, there was no adversary presentation of

 9   that.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Couldn't you have asked

11   at the hearing, couldn't you ask the judge:                     Judge,

12   please have a continuance here because you have taken us

13   by surprise and we'd like to offer some evidence that

14   you -- that might influence you?

15               MR. ROBERTS:           You could -- we could

16   certainly do that.      But that's an after the -- you know,

17   that would be an after-the-fact situation.                     What -- what

18   rule 32 is trying to do is set up a procedure so that in

19   every case, in every case you get the adversarial

20   presentation on the grounds --

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               When?         I asked Mr. Madden

22   and didn't get a precise answer:                 When does this notice

23   have to be given?     We're told that the court itself did

24   not get the full sentencing packet until seven days

25   before the hearing.

 1                So when must this notice be given and how


 2   much does it have to say?


 3                MR. ROBERTS:        Well, it's -- it's a


 4   context-specific question.          The question is, is the


 5   notice reasonable, which means it has to give the

 6   parties enough time to present the adversarial process

 7   on the question.

 8                Now, in the vast majority, all but the most

 9   unusual cases notice a day or two in advance would be

10   specific.   And in many cases, notice that the hearing

11   itself would be sufficient.

12                I think in this case, for example, notice

13   that the hearing itself would certainly have been

14   sufficient; but -- but the --

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                How can that be?

16   They're talking about an expert and all that.                He's not

17   going to be hanging around the courthouse.

18                MR. ROBERTS:        Well, several reasons; for all

19   the reasons, Your Honor, that we said that the -- that

20   it's failure to give notice of a variance here was

21   harmless.   First of all, the PSR had already identified

22   a possible departure on a very similar ground.

23                Second of all, the Petitioner's future

24   dangerousness was central to the victim impact testimony

25   of his wife who had notice was going to testify.                He


                                       25

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   knew from the PSR what she was going to say.

 2               In addition, it was central to dispute --

 3   potential adjustment to the Guidelines' range.               So, his

 4   future dangerousness was --

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, that all goes

 6   -- that all goes to the harmless error question.               Is

 7   that the only time in which notice at the sentencing

 8   hearing is going to be adequate?

 9               MR. ROBERTS:        No, Your Honor.         But I think

10   in this circumstance, for example, there would be --

11   another example would be often if the victim impact

12   testimony -- there hadn't been identified as a potential

13   ground for departure on it, but the judge heard victim

14   impact testimony, but the defendant knew the victim was

15   going to testify, had the general sense it and the judge

16   when it heard -- when she heard it decided, wow, you

17   know, this really makes me think I should take it out of

18   the sentence, I think that because the -- because the

19   defendant knew that the testimony was going to be there,

20   knew the gist of it and was prepared to respond to it,

21   would probably be sufficient to give notice at that time

22   then.

23               For instance, if the judge relied on remorse

24   in allocution -- lack of remorse in allocution that's

25   another example where I think, you know, notice at the


                                      26

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   hearing would pretty much --

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            In a lot of cases, though,

 3   it will be impossible for judges to make their

 4   determination the night before, take home the

 5   pre-sentence report, and, you know, stuff from the trial

 6   and focus on the next morning's sentencing hearing.

 7                 MR. ROBERTS:        Well, judges --

 8                 JUDGE SCALIA:         -- decide it a week in

 9   advance.    Do judges do that, decide a week in advance?

10   I doubt it.

11                 MR. ROBERTS:        The judges are reviewing the

12   material.    I don't think they are doing it a week in

13   advance.    They're getting the material a week in

14   advance.    They are reviewing it before the sentencing

15   hearings.    And the notice requirement has not been

16   unduly burdensome for traditional departures --

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But you're really

18   asking them to sentence first and hearing afterward.

19                 MR. ROBERTS:        No, they don't --

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Maybe the whole

21   purpose of the hearing is to find out what factors are

22   pertinent and all that.         You're asking the judge to come

23   to that determination before the hearing.

24                 MR. ROBERTS:        That -- it is true that they

25   go into the hearing with an open mind, but it's also


                                        27

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   true that before the hearing, they're going to have some

 2   sense based on the written materials that they've

 3   reviewed and based on the parties' identifications of

 4   what they think the appropriate sentence is.                    As

 5   Petitioner's counsel explained, in the vast majority of

 6   cases, the PSR, the parties are already going to

 7   identify the potential grounds for a variance, and so

 8   it's very few cases that there's going to be a ground

 9   that's going to come out --

10                  JUSTICE ALITO:         How specific does the notice

11   have to be?    I take it it's not enough just to recite

12   one of the 3553(a) factors.

13                  MR. ROBERTS:        Well, at a minimum, the court

14   would have to identify the relevant 3553(a) factor.                    I

15   think then what more is required depends a little bit on

16   the particular factor, the record in the case.                    Again,

17   the test is to ensure that they focus adversarial

18   presentation.    If it's a really an open-ended factor,

19   like the nature and circumstances of the offense and the

20   defendant's characteristics, obviously more is going to

21   be required.

22                  JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, what was required

23   here?

24                  MR. ROBERTS:        Here I think it would have

25   been sufficient for the judge to say.                     I'm contemplating


                                         28

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   a variance under section 3553(a)(2)(C), based on the

 2   fact that Petitioner's conduct indicates that he is

 3   likely to commit future crimes.

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So you disagree with

 5   the Petitioner on the specificity of notice required?

 6                 MR. ROBERTS:        Yes.       We don't think that

 7   notice of the specific fact on which the court is going

 8   to rely is required.       That would start to make the

 9   notice requirement unworkable, but I don't think that's

10   how it's been interpreted, to require the very specific

11   facts in the departure context.

12                 The same situation, the parallel thing

13   applies here.   As I was going to say before on the

14   burdensomeness, it hasn't been burdensome, unduly

15   burdensome, to require notice for traditional, and there

16   really isn't any reason to think that it would be

17   different for here.

18                 And to get back to something earlier as well

19   that we're were talking about, the key fact is rule

20   32(h) does indisputably require notice for traditional

21   departures.   And a notice requirement for variances is

22   essential to prevent evisceration of that notice

23   requirement because a court can always impose the

24   same -- use a variance to impose the same sentence that

25   it could have imposed as a Guidelines departure.


                                        29

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               So that notice requirement, which is still

 2   in the rule, is going to basically become meaningless

 3   unless the word "departure" is given it full scope and

 4   construed to include variances.

 5               And notices of variances is also necessary

 6   for the focused adversarial testing that rule 32

 7   requires for the reason the Court said in Burns.           If the

 8   parties don't know what the potential grounds for a

 9   non-Guidelines sentence are, then what they're likely to

10   do is either address the possibility of an

11   above-Guidelines sentence in a random and wasteful way

12   by trying to conceive of every possible grounds or

13   they're just not going to address it at all, like in the

14   example that I gave before when we just didn't address

15   the potential variance based on prison not providing --

16   being able to provide the appropriate treatment.

17               And it's still important, even after Booker,

18   to have adversarial testing of that issue.

19               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Could we go back to the

20   example for just a minute?          I want to be sure I fully

21   understand it.   Why couldn't that issue have been

22   adequately discussed at a hearing in which there was no

23   particular notice, but at the end of the hearing the

24   judge said, this is what I'm planning to do because I'm

25   worried that they won't get treatment in prison and so


                                       30

 1   forth?    Well, wouldn't the government have had an

 2   opportunity to then say, Judge, you overlooked this

 3   fact?    And wouldn't all involved in the hearing?

 4                 MR. ROBERTS:        Well, what we would have liked

 5   to do is bring in people to explain to the judge these

 6   are the programs that are available.                     This is --

 7                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Couldn't the lawyer have

 8   done that?

 9                 MR. ROBERTS:        That's how it works.                Well, I

10   think the lawyer probably could have said we have -- we

11   have treatments and they work.               But then the judge said

12   --

13                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            But wouldn't --

14                 MR. ROBERTS:        -- well, based on this --

15                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Well, that solves the

16   problem because the judge apparently was operating under

17   a misunderstanding of facts.

18                 MR. ROBERTS:        Well, I think that what the

19   judge thought was that there were no available

20   treatments that would work.              And it --

21                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            And the lawyer could say

22   you're wrong.

23                 MR. ROBERTS:        That -- you know, it might

24   have dissuaded the judge there, but it didn't give us

25   the opportunity to bring in somebody who --


                                        31

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               JUSTICE STEVENS:           No, I understand.

 2               MR. ROBERTS:        -- who knows how it -- you

 3   know, who knows what the programs are, to explain it.

 4   Whatever the judge said, yes, I know you have these

 5   programs, but the programs that you can do in prison --

 6   you know, I just don't think that those are effective.

 7   And --

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, if you think

 9   you have a particularly good case that they are, again

10   you make that point to the judge.

11               MR. ROBERTS:        But --

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                If you can see what

13   the last report about these programs was like, you

14   wouldn't think that.     And I think a reasonably competent

15   judge is not going to say, I don't want to see it.               Or

16   maybe he will based on his own experience in dealing

17   with those types of --

18               MR. ROBERTS:        The judge is -- you know,

19   counsel can make the argument.             But in certain cases,

20   the ability to present actual evidence on it is going to

21   be an important -- is going to be an important factor.

22   There's, you know, other examples:                For instance, if the

23   judge varies on grounds that there's no treatment

24   available for other things or that people have been

25   permanently psychologically scarred, and the other side


                                      32

 1   wants to bring forward counter-evidence and -testimony.

 2   There are numerous ones.        That's the -- that's the

 3   essence of what the requirement --

 4               JUSTICE STEVENS:           In your --

 5               MR. ROBERTS:        -- and the rules get at.

 6               JUSTICE STEVENS:           In your experience, do

 7   judges often bring in experts on this kind of stuff?

 8               MR. ROBERTS:        Judges -- do judges bring in

 9   experts?

10               JUSTICE STEVENS:           Well, not judges -- do

11   judges say, "Oh, this is very interesting; I'm going to

12   have a new hearing"?     I mean, how long do these hearings

13   go on?

14               MR. ROBERTS:        We would have -- if -- I think

15   that we would -- could bring in someone and testify

16   about -- to present evidence on that for sure, if the

17   judge was thinking of imposing probation because there

18   was no treatment program.         It wouldn't have to go on for

19   very long, but we could have someone come in for a few

20   minutes and -- and do that.

21               JUSTICE STEVENS:           But you're saying that,

22   routinely in sentencing matters, you have expert who

23   come in and advise the judge of programs and so forth?

24               MR. ROBERTS:        Not routinely, but, you know,

25   generally that's not an issue.             That's why we didn't do


                                      33

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   it in this -- in this particular sentencing hearing.

 2   The point is that, you know, we're not going to do that.

 3   And so a judge that's operating under that and it's

 4   going to vary on that ground isn't going to get that

 5   information because we're -- as you say -- we're not

 6   going to just want to delay all the hearings for that

 7   reason.

 8               And so that -- it's really the reason that

 9   the requirement in the existing rule is there, and the

10   reasons behind that apply with equal force in the

11   variance context.

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But you think that this

13   case is a poor example because you're urging us to apply

14   the harmless error rule and say this case would have

15   come out the same way --

16               MR. ROBERTS:           Yes -- I mean, it's not the

17   best -- it's not the best example to illustrate to the

18   Court why notice is required because here we do think

19   that the error was harmless for various reasons.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               If we -- if we grant the

21   review so we can resolve the question, does the judge

22   have to give notice or not?               And if she has to give

23   notice, what time?      What content?

24               But now you're urging us to say -- to do

25   something that ordinarily this Court doesn't do, that


                                         34

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   trial judges do, to deal with harmless error, which

 2   would be spending our time on this very particular case

 3   setting no law for any other case?

 4               MR. ROBERTS:        Well, we think the Court

 5   should, you know, first obviously address the rule 32

 6   question on which it granted certain certiorari, but

 7   after doing that, we think the Court should address the

 8   harmless error question because that will provide useful

 9   guidance to the lower courts.            There are likely to be a

10   lot of harmless error cases because half of the circuits

11   have erroneously concluded that the rule doesn't require

12   notice, and they could benefit from an illustration of

13   how to apply it in this particular context --

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I suppose we'll have

15   --

16               MR. ROBERTS:        -- involving variance.

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I suppose we'll have

18   a lot of appeals about the adequacy of the notice.                You

19   and the Petitioner disagree on that, and appellate

20   courts will have to address that as well.

21               MR. ROBERTS:        Well, I think this is an easy

22   case for an appellate court to address because --

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Yes.   This may be --

 1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm sorry.    This may

 2   be an easy case, but you can imagine others that aren't

 3   going to be.

 4                  MR. ROBERTS:        Yes, but the questions about

 5   adequacy of notice are really no different in kind than

 6   the same questions that come up for the traditional

 7   departure rule.    It's still going to be there, however

 8   this Court resolves the case for the notice of

 9   Guidelines departures.

10                  So I don't think that you're opening a --

11   whole new questions about adequacy, just as like you're

12   not opening up a whole set of new questions about

13   timing.   Those questions are there, and the courts are

14   going to have to confront them.

15                  But in discussing the harmlessness issue

16   here, you could shed some light on those questions that

17   can provide some guidance for the lower courts that will

18   be useful to them in the future.                 And we would urge you

19   to do that.

20                  Turning to the harmlessness, in addition to

21   the fact that the PSR gave notice -- do you want me to

22   continue?

23                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Continue.    Finish.

24                  MR. ROBERTS:        Sure.       In addition to the fact

25   that future dangerousness was central to sentencing,

 1   it's also true that the evidence that Petitioner now

 2   says he wouldn't have presented wouldn't have made a

 3   difference because his counsel essentially made the same

 4   argument to the district court, and he could have used

 5   the expert testimony to support that argument, but he

 6   chose not to.

 7               The District Court had already rejected the

 8   defense of expert diagnosis the Petitioner was

 9   delusional and could be treated with anti-psychotic

10   drugs and adopted the government expert's diagnosis that

11   Petitioner had a personality disorder that was

12   longstanding and unlikely to change.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, counsel.

15                   ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER B. RUTLEDGE

16                                 FOR AMICUS CURIAE,

17                    IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW

18               MR. RUTLEDGE:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19   please the Court:

20               The Court has before it today two

21   alternative grounds to affirm the judgment below.                  The

22   first is suggested by Justice Ginsburg and Chief Justice

23   Roberts that paragraph 78 of the presentence report put

24   the parties on adequate notice that they could engage in

25   a full adversarial testing outweighing the defendant's


                                        37

 1   future dangerousness against his amenability to

 2   alternative methods of treatment.

 3                The alternative ground for affirming the

 4   judgment below is that suggested by Justice Scalia and

 5   Justice Alito, namely:       That Federal Rule of Criminal

 6   Procedure 32(h) was drafted for a different era, an era

 7   of mandatory guidelines.         And there is no reason,

 8   particularly in light of the right rulemaking process,

 9   to extend rule 32 to an advisory guideline era.

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But then it would be easy

11   for a district judge to escape any obligation to give

12   32(h) notice because he could simply say:               Oh, yeah,

13   before I would have ranked this as a Sentencing

14   Guidelines matter, but now I'm treating it as a 3553(a)

15   factor, so I don't have to bother with 32(h) anymore.

16                MR. RUTLEDGE:         Justice Ginsburg, I

17   understand your concern about the possibility that

18   district judges might, I guess in theory, attempt to do

19   an end run around rule 32(h) by recasting a departure

20   decision as a variance decision.

21                And, admittedly, there are certain

22   circumstances in which the ground for a departure on

23   rule 32(h) has some overlap with the ground for a

24   variance under 3553(a), but I would offer several

25   responses.   My first response is that I feel the Court


                                       38

 1   crossed that bridge a little bit in the Booker remedial

 2   opinion when it created an advisory guidelines system.

 3   The whole premise of the advisory guidelines system was

 4   to enhance the discretion of the district judge.

 5                  My second answer would be that district

 6   judges still have a reason to engage in the departure

 7   calculation.    As this Court made clear in Rita, district

 8   judges must begin by consulting the guidelines.           And the

 9   Second, Third, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Tenth Courts of

10   Appeal all have interpreted that obligation to consult

11   the Guidelines to include consideration of possible

12   grounds for departure.

13                  Of course, this Court's decision in

14   Kimbrough made clear that even if those two grounds

15   don't provide the judge adequate incentive to engage in

16   a departure calculation, that there is yet another

17   reason; and that is because it may affect the

18   scrutiny-of-reasonableness review.

19                  As the Court explained in Kimbrough, when a

20   district judge departs from the Guidelines, the district

21   judge's determination may be entitled to greater respect

22   when the judge makes the determination that a case

23   takes -- that a circumstance takes the case outside of

24   the heartland.

25                  JUSTICE ALITO:         But didn't the decision that


                                         39

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the Guidelines are not mandatory make what used to be

 2   known as Guidelines departures completely irrelevant?          A

 3   case that would qualify for a Guidelines departure

 4   would, by definition, be a case in which the 3553(a)

 5   factors justified a sentence other than a Guidelines

 6   sentence?   So I don't understand why there's any need to

 7   go through the departure analysis any longer at all.

 8                 MR. RUTLEDGE:         Justice Alito, I don't

 9   believe that this Court's Booker and post-Booker

10   jurisprudence has made the departure determination

11   irrelevant.

12                 Indeed, just this last Friday, the

13   Sentencing Commission posted on its website additional

14   proposed amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines that

15   would inject new grounds for departures including fraud

16   for emergency assistance and violations of Federal food

17   and drug laws that entail a risk of serious bodily

18   injury.

19                 Departures remain relevant to the guidelines

20   because they are the basis upon which the Commission can

21   continue to fulfill its mandate to provide for the type

22   of uniform sentencing that still is possible.

23                 JUSTICE ALITO:         I just don't understand

24   that.   You're not -- a court -- a sentencing court,

25   after concluding that there is no ground for a departure


                                        40

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   under Booker and the later cases, then has to consider

 2   the 3553(a) question.

 3                 So the decision about the departures is

 4   irrelevant.   It is not dispositive; and, if the court

 5   finds that the case qualified for a Guidelines

 6   departure, as I said before, by definition, that is

 7   going to be a case where the 3553(a) factors warranted a

 8   non-Guidelines sentence anyway.               So it seems like a

 9   useless appendage at this point.

10                 MR. RUTLEDGE:         Well, it may well be the

11   case, Justice Alito, that as this Court's Booker

12   jurisprudence unfolds, that the concept of a departure

13   declines in importance, in addition with respect to the

14   32(h) obligation for notice.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, why is the 32(h)

16   obligation relevant?       That is, looking through the

17   history of it, I see that in 32(i)(C) it says that the

18   government has to allow the parties' attorneys to

19   comment on the determination of the probation officer

20   and other matters relating to an appropriate sentence.

21                 Then, in a case called Burns v. United

22   States, this Court says that that right to comment

23   includes a right to notice.

24                 And so all that 32(h) did was to take what

25   was already the law and make specific that it includes a


                                        41

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   right to notice.   I take it that was what they were up

 2   to.

 3                But even if you didn't have 32(h), you would

 4   have precisely the same right once you got 32(i)(C)

 5   together with the case of Burns.

 6                So I don't know where that leaves me, except

 7   thinking it doesn't matter, because the defendant has

 8   precisely the same right either way.                    And I guess it's

 9   easier just to say "departure" means generally all kinds

10   of departures including not applying it.

11                That's not a stretch of the language.                   It is

12   quite right it is not consistent with what they thought

13   they were up to, but not -- it is -- maybe before -- if

14   they had passed this before Hawaii became a State, you

15   could say:   Well, they didn't think it would apply in

16   Hawaii.

17                So what?     I mean would you decrease that,

18   General?

19                MR. RUTLEDGE:         Certainly, Justice Breyer.

20   If we were to put 32(h) to one side and consider the

21   effect of rule 32(i)(1)(C), then the Court confronts the

22   question whether the basic ideas that animated its

23   decision in Burns should be extended in an

24   advisory-guidelines era.         And Burns, at bottom, rested

25   on two distinct strands of reasoning.


                                       42

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               One was the question of unfair surprise.


 2   And we think, with that respect, that the post-Booker


 3   era is different from the pre-Booker era.                And the


 4   reason why, Justice Breyer, is because pre-Booker the


 5   parties came to the sentencing hearing with an

 6   expectation of a within-Guidelines sentence.

 7               And post-Booker, particularly in light of

 8   this Court's decision in Rita, the parties cannot come

 9   to the sentencing hearing with that expectation because

10   the district judge may not presume the reasonableness of

11   the within-Guidelines sentence.

12               And so to the extent that Burns rested on

13   concerns of unfair surprise, the rationale has dropped

14   out after Booker.

15               Now, there is a second strand of reasoning

16   to Burns which Justice Ginsburg alluded to, which is

17   this question of full adversarial testing.                And I agree

18   with you, Chief Justice Roberts, that Chief Judge

19   Boudin's decision in the Vega-Santiago case provides the

20   pathway here.

21               Judges engage in this kind of discretionary

22   act all the time.    Parties come to the hearing with a

23   theory, a theory of how the judge should exercise her

24   sentencing discretion within a known range, and knowing

25   the applicable legal criteria, and have an opportunity


                                        43

 1   to be heard.

 2                  And we believe that, particularly in light

 3   of the recent amendment to section 32(d)(2)(F), that's

 4   going to include the possibility of the 3553 factors --

 5   3553, a factor in the presentence report, that the

 6   parties are going to have the opportunity to come to the

 7   hearing with the ability to engage in full adversarial

 8   testing.

 9                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Do you accept Chief

10   Judge Boudean's safety valve as well?                     In other words,

11   if the basis for the variance is going to be a matter of

12   surprise, then notice is required?

13                  MR. RUTLEDGE:         I accept the first part of

14   that premise, Chief Justice Roberts:                      That they are may

15   be rare cases of truly unfair surprise.

16                  What I don't necessarily accept is that

17   notice has to be the straitjacketed remedy for District

18   Judges in all of those instances.

19                  There may be other mechanisms such as if

20   the -- if the fact is, if you will, sprung on the

21   parties in the midst of the hearing, a motion for a

22   continuance, as the government indicates on page 44 of

23   its brief, may be a mechanism to control against those

24   cases of truly unfair surprise.                And then a court of

25   appeals under this Court's decision in Pickett,


                                         44

 1   reviewing the appropriateness of granting or denying the

 2   continuance, can base its appellate review on whether or

 3   not unfair surprise --

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           That is an abuse of

 5   discretion standardized?

 6                MR. RUTLEDGE:         That is an abuse of

 7   discretion --

 8                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Unworkable or is there

 9   just as many impracticalities as the rule.

10                MR. RUTLEDGE:         I -- I don't think that it

11   presents a concern of impracticability, Justice Kennedy,

12   for one simple reason; and that is by relying on a

13   mechanism such as the continuance, the parties are given

14   the opportunity to identify for the court whether or not

15   there's a concern of unfair surprise; and if there is,

16   the district judge is in the position to decide whether

17   or not she believes that the continuance is necessary.

18                If the notice claim only arises at the time

19   that the sentence is entered, there's relatively little

20   opportunity at that point for the district judge to go

21   back and reconsider the record on the basis of unfair

22   surprise.   And that sort of takes me to the basic point

23   that Justices Souter, Alito and Justice Ginsburg all

24   talk, about which is the fundamental unworkability of

25   the notice rule and advisory guidelines system.

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               As the judges -- the district judges


 2   explained to us in the recent rulemaking proceeding


 3   contemplating a amendment to rule 32(h), they're


 4   concerned that extending this rule to variances will


 5   make it quite difficult.

 6               We know that district judges often receive

 7   these packets of sentencing information only seven days

 8   before the sentencing hearing.             Several courts of

 9   appeals have held that giving notice at the sentencing

10   hearing is not timely.      And even if the timeliness

11   concern can be overcome, there are serious problems in

12   workability as to the adequacy of the notice.

13               The best that the Petitioner and the

14   government the instruct this Court on, in terms of how

15   the adequacy standard is going to work, is that it has

16   to be context-specific; and if we put ourselves in the

17   shoes of a district judge that now has to engage in a

18   discretionary act to decide whether or not the notice

19   that I've given is adequate turns on the context,

20   doesn't provide a great deal of guidance to the district

21   judge.

22               We know, for example --

23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Why isn't it just

24   whatever is the reason that the judge is considering is

25   going outside the advisory Guidelines, whatever that


                                      46

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   reason is, just say it.         So the judge says -- could say

 2   here, "I'm contemplating going outside because I don't

 3   think that this man is going to stop these threats."

 4   Period.   That's all.

 5                MR. RUTLEDGE:          I -- certainly,

 6   Justice Ginsburg.    And I've wrestled with that own

 7   question in -- in my mind.           If this judge were to have

 8   said I'm thinking of sentencing outside the Guidelines

 9   because I'm dealing with an individual who has a

10   demonstrated ability to stalk and threaten his ex-wife,

11   would that have been adequate?               And interestingly, I

12   think pages 23 and 126 of the Petitioner's reply brief

13   illustrate that either the answer to that question is

14   going to be "not necessarily," or otherwise appellate

15   judges are going to be strung up having to unpack

16   whether or not notice is adequate, because it is

17   Petitioner's petition in this case that even if the

18   defendant had been put on notice as to the future

19   dangerousness, that that did not, quote, "put the

20   defendant on notice" that the district judge supposed

21   the futility of treatment might justify an

22   outside-the-Guidelines sentencing.

23                Here's the essential workability problem.

24   We know from this court's decision in Rita that the

25   basic vision in the post-Booker world is to encourage


                                        47

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   judges to provide reasoned sentencing decisions, where a

 2   degree of reasoning may depend a little bit upon whether

 3   the judge is engaging an inside-the-advisory-Guidelines

 4   sentence, or an outside-the-advisory-Guidelines

 5   sentence.

 6               In the event that a district judge engaging

 7   in an outside-the-Guidelines sentence, she is now

 8   walking into a trap.     Because if she imposes it based on

 9   a determination about the defendant's future

10   dangerousness, and then in an attempt to provide a full

11   explication of her reasoning makes a statement about the

12   amenability or non-amenability of the defendant to

13   alternative forms of treatment, the aggrieved party will

14   seize on that extra statement and bring it back to the

15   pre-sentencing report and the parties' pleadings and

16   said we may have had notice as to ground one to the

17   variance but we didn't have notice as to ground two.    Or

18   we may have had notice as to ground one and two, but we

19   didn't have any as to ground three.

20               This is the essentially workability concern

21   that we believe that the district judges raised when

22   they expressed their discomfort with the proposed

23   amendments to rule 32(h); and precisely why we think the

24   more prudent course is to affirm the judgment below,

 1   the Chief Justice's question suggested, or alternatively

 2   on the broader grounds suggested by Justice Scalia's

 3   questions, that the resume that emerged at the time of

 4   mandatory Guidelines should not be extended to the time

 5   of advisory Guidelines.

 6                 And if I could make one last observation,

 7   and then I'll complete my argument unless the Court has

 8   further questions.

 9                 In December of 2007, the Advisory Committee

10   on Criminal Rules formed a subcommittee to study this

11   problem.   If the Court consults the minutes of that

12   meeting, they didn't form that subcommittee because they

13   were awaiting this Court's decision in Irizarry.          They

14   formed that -- cert hadn't been granted in Irizarry.

15                 They formed that subcommittee for two

16   reasons.   The first reason was whether in light of this

17   Court's decisions in Gall and Kimbrough a notice

18   requirement was still necessary; and second was the

19   consideration that in light of the breadth of the

20   3553(a) factors a notice requirement should be removed

21   altogether.   The more prudent course either for the

22   narrow grounds suggested by Chief Justice Roberts or the

23   broader grounds suggested by Justice Scalia is to affirm

24   the judgment below.

25                 If the Court has no further questions I

 1   would be happy to yield back the balance of my time.

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, Counsel.

 3                 Mr. Madden, you have two minutes remaining.

 4             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR J. MADDEN, III

 5                        ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 6                 MR. MADDEN:       Thank you.

 7                 I think Justice Breyer is correct that rule

 8   32(e) is -- requires that the parties have an

 9   opportunity to comment on matters appropriate to the

10   sentencing.    That opportunity extends to not only

11   Guidelines departures but also what has been called

12   variances.    There are two reasons why it's important

13   that that -- that right comes with a notice requirement.

14   The first is that fairness for the individual defendant,

15   the ability to litigate the issues that are going to

16   make a difference in his sentencing.

17                 The other is that it permits as an

18   institutional issue effective appellate review, if

19   there's a developed record and evolution of the

20   Guidelines by looking at the aggregate of cases.                  If the

21   Court's decision is that we're going to exempt from

22   notice requirement the cases that are going -- the

23   sentences that are going to be driven towards the

24   margin, high or low, the goal of uniformity that

25   Congress sought in the Sentencing Reform Act would be


                                        50

 1   lost.

 2                 And I submit that that's an independent

 3   reason why the Court ought to require notice is because

 4   otherwise, it's inviting the sentencing disparities

 5   which the architecture of the Sentencing Reform Act is

 6   designed to eliminate.

 7                 As far as workability, it is extremely rare

 8   that the issues aren't flagged in the papers.                 It is not

 9   going to come up frequently.             Rule 32(h) issues don't

10   come up terribly frequently, at least in my practice in

11   the appellate cases.

12                 Five circuits below have -- saw no

13   workability problem with extending the notice

14   requirement of rule 32(h) to variances as well.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, Counsel.

16                 MR. MADDEN:       Thank you.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Mr. Rutledge, you

18   briefed and argued the case as amicus curiae in support

19   of the judgment below upon appointment by this Court,

20   and we thank you for undertaking and discharging that

21   assignment.
