 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 We'll hear argument

 6            ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH D. SCHLEIMER

 7                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                 MR. SCHLEIMER:          Thank you, Mr. Chief

 9   Justice, and may it please the Court:

10                 It's been a little less than two years since

11   this Court handed down the decision in Buckeye Check

12   Cashing Service v. Cardegna.              Within nine months after

13   Buckeye was decided, the California Court of Appeal

14   issued its decision in this case excising the issue of

15   validity or legality of a contract from an entire

16   category of arbitrations, declaring it off limits to

17   arbitration.

18                 The contract in this case couldn't be more

19   clear.     It states quite specifically that the validity

20   or legality of the contract shall be arbitrated.                  So

21   there was no consideration given to the intent of the

22   parties.

23                 The Federal Arbitration Act, of course,

24   applies in this case.        There was never really a dispute

25   about that, because it'S a contract between the citizens


                                          3

 1   of two States and it was never disputed that the Federal

 2   Arbitration Act would apply.

 3              If left standing, the decision in this case

 4   could result in a multiplicity of State law decisions

 5   and statutes eliminating arbitration in entire classes

 6   of cases through the mere expediency of having it go to

 7   an administrative agency.

 8              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, It wouldn't

 9   eliminate it.   Your friend on the other side says it the

10   simply delays it, because you get to arbitrate de novo

11   after the commissioner's decision.

12              MR. SCHLEIMER:           Well, the assertion that we

13   get to arbitrate de novo is new in this Court.                 In the

14   courts below the parties agreed, and both sides briefed,

15   the fact that the de novo would be heard by the superior

16   court, not by the arbitrator.             I don't know what -- by

17   what magical process the Respondent would think that we

18   would get to arbitrate the de novo, because the statute

19   on which the court of appeal based its jurisdictional

20   holding, Labor Code Section 1700.44, that's where the

21   labor commissioner gets jurisdiction from the same

22   statute and says the superior court hears the de novo.

23              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, I guess I

24   could let him answer, but I suppose he would say you go

25   to that court, and you get a motion to compel


                                        4

 1   arbitration.

 2              MR. SCHLEIMER:             Well, we have brought a

 3   motion to compel arbitration, which was denied based on

 4   1700.44.

 5              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               I couldn't find the order

 6   that the court -- in the record it says that the order

 7   would be -- the court granted a preliminary injunction,

 8   the superior court, and then it said, according to an

 9   order to be entered by the clerk.                  How long was the

10   arbitration stayed for?          There was an enjoined -- there

11   was an injunction.      What was the term of the injunction?

12   Just until further order of the court?

13              MR. SCHLEIMER:             The injunction states -- and

14   I'm implying this, because it doesn't actually state how

15   long it lasts -- the injunction was requested and it was

16   granted with just the word "grant."                       So I interpret it

17   as meaning that what was granted was what was requested,

18   and what was requested was an injunction that would last

19   until the Labor Commissioner determined that she doesn't

20   have jurisdiction.      Now, since the Labor Commissioner

21   had already determined that she does have jurisdiction,

22   it's effectively permanent or, as you say,

23   Justice Kennedy, until the court vacates it.

24              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Did the Respondent at any

25   point indicate that after the Labor Commission, Labor


                                          5

 1   Commissioner, made a determination that they would not

 2   go to superior court for de novo review?

 3               MR. SCHLEIMER:          Well, they actually had in a

 4   sense an opportunity to do exactly that and chose not

 5   to.   The motion for reconsideration was brought before

 6   the Labor -- before the arbitrator one day before the

 7   injunction hearing.     The arbitrator said:               Well, it's

 8   inefficient to have parallel proceedings and maybe I can

 9   benefit from the Labor Commissioner's advice in this.

10   So while retaining his jurisdiction, he said:                  I'm going

11   to stay the arbitration until the Labor Commissioner

12   rules.

13               Now, at that point the Respondent could have

14   simply withdrawn the injunction and said, fine, we'll do

15   it the way the arbitrator says; what the arbitrator

16   wants, the arbitrator shall get.               Instead, the next day

17   the arbitrator's decision became moot.                  Now, I think the

18   arbitrator, acting with an injunction looming the next

19   day, was proposing in a sense a kind of compromise:                  You

20   can both have a little bit of what you want.                  It's not

21   unusual in arbitrations for that to happen.

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, you may have a

23   right to go to arbitration under this context, to

24   proceed at once to arbitration.              But could you stop a

25   parallel proceeding from going on before the Labor


                                        6

 1   Commission?    In other words, your adversary says under

 2   the arbitration contract I'm stuck, I have to arbitrate

 3   at once, but I can go to the Labor Commission; there's

 4   nothing in the Federal Arbitration Act that says I can't

 5   do that.

 6                 MR. SCHLEIMER:         Justice Ginsburg, I think

 7   that if the motion to compel arbitration had been

 8   granted -- remember there were two motions pending, my

 9   motion to compel arbitration and the Respondent's motion

10   for an injunction to stop the arbitration.

11                 If the motion to compel arbitration had been

12   granted, I think that would have been in effect a

13   mandamus to Judge Ferrer that he had to arbitrate and

14   not proceed.

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I would have thought you

16   would -- you would say that when you have a contract

17   which says that any disputes under this shall be

18   arbitrated pursuant to the rules of the AAA or whatever,

19   that that does automatically exclude a parallel

20   proceeding.    Otherwise, provisions like that make no

21   sense at all; they achieve nothing.

22                 MR. SCHLEIMER:         Justice Scalia, I would

23   certainly agree that it's a breach of the contract to

24   file a parallel proceeding.              The question, of course, is

25   specific performance.

 1              JUSTICE SOUTER:             What do you -- what do you

 2   make, in answering Justice Scalia's question, what do

 3   you make of the fact that this contract included, I

 4   guess, a choice of law provision to the effect that

 5   California law applies, and if California law comes in

 6   so does the jurisdiction of the Labor Commissioner?            So

 7   that in effect you have implicitly agreed to take the

 8   Labor Commissioner as well as agreeing to arbitrate, and

 9   the argument is the Labor Commissioner comes first.

10              MR. SCHLEIMER:          Well, Justice Souter, I have

11   two responses to that.      My first is that, since there's

12   an express agreement to arbitrate validity or legality,

13   that there is certainly no basis for saying that there's

14   some implied intent to contradict the express agreement.

15              The second is that, assuming for a moment

16   that we have incorporated California law wholesale, and

17   California has a lot of law, one of the laws that

18   California has, as set forth in the case I cited,

19   Qualcomm v. Nokia, a Federal Circuit decision in 2006

20   under California law, California law has a rule that if

21   you incorporate the AAA rules into your agreement, you

22   meet the First Option standard that you have agreed to

23   arbitrate arbitrability.

24              Now, if we have incorporated California law,

25   we have incorporated the law that says the arbitrator's


                                       8

 1   decision, his initial decision saying I've got

 2   jurisdiction, let's hear some evidence, then that's

 3   incorporated in California law --

 4               JUSTICE SOUTER:               Do you agree that the

 5   question of implicit option of California law is at

 6   issue in the case as it gets to us?

 7               MR. SCHLEIMER:            I don't believe that Volt is

 8   properly in the case.        If you look at the court of

 9   appeals decision, the decision is based on jurisdiction,

10   it's not based on intent of the parties.                  Volt is all

11   about the intent of the parties that you imply from a

12   choice of law clause.        And if the intent of the parties

13   is so clearly expressed that we're going to arbitrate a

14   particular issue, I don't think you even get to an

15   implied intention.

16               JUSTICE ALITO:            Why isn't that an issue in

17   the case, unless you're waiving the issue?                  Wouldn't it

18   be a question of contract interpretation as to the

19   meaning of the choice of law provision that should be

20   decided by the arbitrator?            Unless you want to waive

21   that argument.

22               MR. SCHLEIMER:            I that that Volt should be

23   rejected.   But in the alternative, I think under First

24   Options it should be remanded to the arbitrator.                  If

25   they want to make an argument that we didn't intend to

 1   arbitrate arbitrability, even though California law is

 2   per se on that point in our favor, then you have the

 3   option of remanding that question to the arbitrator.

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, I have to

 5   confess I've never understood these choice of alaw

 6   provisions.    You incorporate California law.                I assume

 7   California law is interpreted consistent with Federal

 8   law.   If Federal law preempts California law, that's

 9   what you're incorporating.           It always struck me as kind

10   of circular.

11                 MR. SCHLEIMER:         Well, I think lawyers do it

12   reflexively because out of fear that somehow the law in

13   some other State that they don't know is going to wind

14   up being the conflict of law --

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                When you say

16   California law applies, you don't mean to the exclusion

17   of Federal law?

18                 MR. SCHLEIMER:         Of course not.         I mean, if

19   one incorporates California law, one doesn't incorporate

20   pre-empted California law.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Nor do you mean that

22   California applies even when it contradicts the express

23   provisions of your agreement?              I mean, the specific

24   governs of the general?

25                 MR. SCHLEIMER:         Absolutely.         The Federal

 1   Arbitration Act is all about effectuating the intent of

 2   the parties to expeditiously and privately decide the

 3   issue.

 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I must say that the Volt

 5   case is written in rather sweeping language that's not

 6   particularly helpful to you.            On its facts, I think it's

 7   different because there were other parties, independent

 8   parties in the litigation.          Don't you think that's the

 9   best way to distinguish Volt in your case?

10               MR. SCHLEIMER:          Certainly.          To that I would

11   add the observation that under Volt, since there were

12   parties that were not bound by arbitration, you are

13   going to have all the expense of the other lawsuits,

14   anyway.   So, you have in terms of the efficiency of the

15   proceeding, in Volt you were going to have a

16   multiplication of litigation no matter what you did.

17   Here that's not true.      The only reason we had a

18   multiplication of litigation is because Judge Ferrer

19   filed a Labor Commissioner petition and then a Superior

20   Court lawsuit.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel, would you

22   have any problem with a California law that said you can

23   arbitrate but the arbitrator must allow the Labor

24   Commissioner to file an amicus brief?

25               MR. SCHLEIMER:          I don't know the Labor

 1   Commissioner has ever attempted that.                   I wouldn't be

 2   concerned about it.     I know --

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What if it goes on

 4   and says, and you must allow the Labor Commissioner to

 5   appear at the arbitration?

 6               MR. SCHLEIMER:          Well, that is what 1700.45

 7   says for talent agents.        In 20 years I've never heard of

 8   the Labor Commissioner doing that.                 But I can't imagine

 9   anyone is going to be awfully concerned about it.                   I

10   certainly wouldn't be.       If the Labor Commissioner wanted

11   to attend, they would be welcome.                I don't think that's

12   based on a legal right because my client's a personal

13   manager and isn't regulated by the talent agency --

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So, what if it says

15   you've got to wait for 30 days to allow the Labor

16   Commissioner to consider whether or not to intervene?

17               MR. SCHLEIMER:          I'm not sure -- I

18   certainly -- personally, in this case no problem with

19   that.   I don't think that's how it works.                 The statute

20   simply requires notice and an opportunity to attend; and

21   there's no issue in this case as to whether the Labor

22   Commissioner was deprived of that, because we never got

23   to that point.

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Does the Labor

25   Commissioner have authority to commence proceedings on

 3   complicated.

 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, I'm sorry that I

 5   asked already.

 6               MR. SCHLEIMER:            I have an answer for you.

 7   The Labor Commissioner is considered a peace officer

 8   under California law.        They actually have the power to

 9   arrest.   At one point many years ago, there was an

10   arrest of a manager for soliciting and procuring.                 He

11   got Jane Wyman a job on a TV show called "Falcon Crest,"

12   and there was an arrest and there was a criminal statute

13   at that time.    And the legislature responded to this

14   incident by repealing the criminal statute.

15               So the only action the legislature has had

16   since deregulating the managers and taking them out of

17   the statute entirely was removing the criminal

18   enforcement power.      In terms of the Labor Commissioner's

19   civil enforcement powers, there are statutes.                 The first

20   hundred sections in the labor code do give the Labor

21   Commissioner certain intervention powers.                 But, reading

22   those statutes, they would seem to apply in wage cases

23   and confiscation of tools, that sort of thing.                 They

24   don't really mention -- now would the Labor

25   Commissioner -- if the Labor Commissioner wanted to


                                         13

 1   intervene, I think that if you take the penumbra of all

 2   these statutes probably the Labor Commissioner could.

 3              I think, even though there's not in my 20

 4   years handling these cases been a situation where the

 5   Labor Commissioner filed any kind of a civil proceeding,

 6   everybody assumes the Labor Commissioner could seek an

 7   injunction if they wanted to.            It just doesn't occur

 8   because they're busy doing things like collecting wages.

 9              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Could the arbitrator

10   decide, I know I'm not required to do this but the Labor

11   Commissioner is the expert and I'd rather wait until the

12   Labor Commissioner acted before I proceed with the

13   arbitration?

14              MR. SCHLEIMER:          Well, in a sense, under the

15   gun of the injunction hearing the next day, that's what

16   the arbitrator did.

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Take out the exception.

18   The arbitrator just thinks that it would be good to have

19   the advice of the Labor Commissioner because the

20   arbitrator is not so familiar with these talent agency

21   arrangements.

22              MR. SCHLEIMER:          I would certainly protest,

23   but the arbitrator undoubtedly has the power to wait for

24   the Labor Commissioner to render an advisory decision.

25   In a sense that's what the arbitrator did.             In a moment

 1   of I think irrational exuberance he talked about the

 2   expertise of the Labor Commissioner.

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   How was the

 4   arbitrator chosen?      Does he or she have any particular

 5   expertise in this area?

 6               MR. SCHLEIMER:            Yes.       Mr. Bosch has 32 years

 7   as an entertainment lawyer.              He knows the Talent Agency

 8   Act considerable better than any of the civil service

 9   lawyers at the Labor Commissioner.                   That's why I

10   referred to it as irrational exuberance, because the

11   Labor Commissioner -- some of them get pretty good and

12   then they move on to other jobs, and you wind up with

13   people who hear wage claims.

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              If you go to the superior

15   court for de novo review, can you ask the superior court

16   for an order enforcing its decision?

17               MR. SCHLEIMER:            Enforcing the Labor

18   Commissioner's decision?

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, you get de novo

20   review.   So do you ask the court for an order -- a

21   declaratory order, declaring that the person is a talent

22   agent or is not a talent agent?

23               MR. SCHLEIMER:            Well, that is what Judge

24   Ferrer asked the superior court to do, was first send

25   this to the Labor Commissioner.                Then specifically the


                                         15

 1   complaint by Judge Ferrer sought declaratory relief,

 2   that the arbitration is void, the guy is an illegal

 3   talent agent, so he should never be allowed to

 4   arbitrate.   That was the declaratory relief that was

 5   sought.

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So do you think it would

 7   be within the authority of the superior court to say

 8   this is a judgment binding on the parties and the

 9   arbitration will not proceed, or must proceed

10   consistently with my order?

11                MR. SCHLEIMER:         Well, absent -- our position

12   is that that's preemptive, of course.                   Absent the

13   arbitration agreement, it would be the superior court

14   that would decide it.

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.       Well, but if the

16   Respondent prevails, don't you think that the superior

17   court has that authority?

18                MR. SCHLEIMER:         If the Respondent prevails

19   in the Labor Commissioner?

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           If Respondent prevails in

21   this case, don't you think that the superior court can

22   then say that its declaration is final and the

23   arbitration shall not proceed?

24                MR. SCHLEIMER:         The position I've taken from

25   the beginning, including in my briefs to the court of

 1   appeals was yes, that if the decision is correct, if

 2   this Court affirms the court of appeals, that the

 3   de novo would go to the superior court.                     Now, it is a

 4   true de novo; in other words, it's not deferential to

 5   the Labor Commissioner.          It's simply a complete

 6   rehearing from scratch of the whole case.

 7                 But it has always been my position and it

 8   was until we got to this Court the Respondent's position

 9   that the de novo would go to the superior court.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:            What is it -- I should know

11   this, but I don't.      Imagine that Jones and Smith, civil

12   engineers, builders, enter into a contract.                     They have

13   an arbitration provision suspiciously like this one.                        It

14   says we promise to arbitrate everything, any dispute,

15   including a dispute about whether this agreement is

16   legal or not itself.        They have that.               They go to the

17   arbitrator.

18                 Jones says:        You know, Mr. Arbitrator, you

19   don't know that much about civil engineering, but

20   there's a judge here who does.                So I think what I'm

21   going to do tomorrow is file a lawsuit in the superior

22   court in California making the same claims I'm making

23   here and maybe that judge will decide it first and then

24   you'll be really helped.           Now what stops him from doing

25   that in the law?

 1              MR. SCHLEIMER:           Well, the Federal

 2   Arbitration Act and the California Arbitration --

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:             The Federal -- the Federal

 4   Arbitration Act says what that makes it clear he can't

 5   do that?

 6              MR. SCHLEIMER:           Well --

 7              JUSTICE BREYER:             I mean, I grant you if he

 8   can do it you might as well tear up the Federal

 9   Arbitration Act and throw it out the window.            But I just

10   want to know what is it in the law specifically that

11   stops him from doing that.

12              MR. SCHLEIMER:           Well, I think in Section 3

13   would -- there should be a stay of the judicial

14   proceedings so that the arbitration can proceed.

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:             But that's not positive

16   Federal law.   What stops him from doing it is the

17   contractual agreement, isn't it, between the parties?

18   The FAA just says that the State will not set aside that

19   contractual agreement.

20              MR. SCHLEIMER:           Yes, Justice Scalia.    The

21   obligation comes from the contract.

22              JUSTICE BREYER:             So even though it's not --

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:             When we say we'll arbitrate

24   all disputes under this contract, it means we'll

25   arbitrate all disputes under this contract; neither one

 1   of us will go to court.

 2              MR. SCHLEIMER:          I think that's doubly so if

 3   you incorporate the rules of the American Arbitration

 4   Association, which provides you with the maximum

 5   breadth.

 6              JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, but that -- that's

 7   what I'm driving at, and I think that's interesting,

 8   that there's an implicit -- because it doesn't say it

 9   explicitly -- there's an implicit promise not to

10   undermine this contract by running off to court.

11              MR. SCHLEIMER:          I think it's a covenant of

12   good faith and fair dealing.           If you agree to do it you

13   should do it.

14              JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.       And so you

15   can't -- no case comes to your mind where anybody has

16   tried that little end run?         And --

17              MR. SCHLEIMER:          I think there are a couple

18   --

19              JUSTICE BREYER:            I agree, I don't see how

20   they could, but I just want to get to the bottom of it.

21              MR. SCHLEIMER:          I think this entire area of

22   jurisprudence involves pre-dispute arbitration

23   agreements and then some party decides it's not to my

24   advantage and they run to court.              That's almost every

25   case.

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I used to teach contract

 3   law, and I am sure that when you say you'll arbitrate,

 4   it means you won't litigate.            And even if I didn't ever

 5   teach contract law, it would still be the law.

 6                (Laughter.)

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I thought Buckeye was --

 8   was such a case, going to court despite the arbitration

 9   agreement.

10                MR. SCHLEIMER:         At -- at the time we were in

11   the superior court, Buckeye had not yet been decided.

12   We were -- in December of 2005 was the injunction

13   hearing, and Buckeye I believe was published in February

14   of 2006.

15                I relied on the California case, the

16   Erickson case, which made Prima Paint the law of

17   California, and it wasn't persuasive.                   Then Buckeye was

18   handed down while we were on appeal.                    But I certainly,

19   when I read Buckeye, I said that's my price, because

20   Prima Paint was about fraud in the inducement.                    We were

21   in a situation where we were dealing with an attack on

22   the legality of the entire contract and I read Buckeye

23   and said, that's my case.

24                Mr. Chief Justice, if there's no further

25   questions, I'd like to reserve my time.

 3              ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.

 4                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 5                MR. BRUNSTAD:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 6   please the Court:

 7                The California Talent Agencies Act does not

 8   invalidate the arbitration agreement between Mr. Preston

 9   and Judge Ferrer.    At most, it merely postpones

10   arbitration --

11                JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, the question is

12   obvious.    The question just follows from what I said.

13   You were there nodding your head when everybody seems

14   seemed to agree that the Jones versus Smith, they can't

15   go run off to court.       So you're just about to address

16   this, and I hope you'll include the answer to the

17   question, which is if they can't run off to the

18   Federal -- to the State court judge, the superior court

19   judge, to get his opinion on the matter, why can they

20   run off to this man, namely the talent agency expert --

21                MR. BRUNSTAD:          The Labor Commissioner --

22                JUSTICE BREYER:            -- who happens to be an

23   administrative agency?        Why does it matter?

24                MR. BRUNSTAD:          I think to answer your

25   question, Justice Breyer, it's helpful just to delineate

 1   the procedure of how it's supposed to work.                You're

 2   supposed to go to the California Labor Commissioner

 3   first if there's any controversy arising under the

 4   California Talent Agencies Act.                That is an exhaustion

 5   of administrative remedies concept that the California

 6   Supreme Court articulated in Styne v Stevens.                After the

 7   California Talent Agencies Act has been administered by

 8   the Labor Commissioner, either party has as of right the

 9   ability to take an appeal to the California Superior

10   Court, at which point all of the California arbitration

11   rules apply, and a motion to compel arbitration could be

12   made at that point and arbitration could happen.               And

13   now it's a de novo hearing from the Labor Commissioner's

14   proceeding, which means under California law, the

15   Waisbren case and the Buchwald case, that it's as though

16   the Labor Commissioner proceeding had not happened at

17   all.     The --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Did you take a position

19   below?     Your friend says that this is brand new up here.

20                 MR. BRUNSTAD:          It's not brand new,

21   Justice Scalia.     We never got that far.

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Did you take that position

23   below, was the question.

24                 MR. BRUNSTAD:          We never took that position

25   below because we never got that far, Justice Kennedy.

 1   We only got to the point whether we should have a

 2   preliminary injunction so that the Labor Commissioner

 3   could go first.    Once the Labor Commissioner --

 4                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            The arbitrator already

 5   agreed to do that.      You didn't need the injunction for

 6   that purpose.

 7                 MR. BRUNSTAD:          Well, the            motion for the

 8   injunction was filed because the arbitrator initially

 9   denied a stay of arbitration.               The arbitrator himself

10   then reconsidered his ruling a day before the hearing on

11   the injunction, and the arbitrator said I'd like to hear

12   from the Labor Commissioner because the Labor

13   Commissioner is expert.

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well -- but if your

15   position is that we have to preserve the integrity of

16   the State system, the Labor expert and so forth and the

17   State builds in to that procedure, de novo review

18   Superior Court, it seems to me rather difficult for you

19   to now just say oh, well, the Superior Court doesn't

20   make any difference.

21                 MR. BRUNSTAD:          Well, Justice Kennedy, I

22   think that it is important -- this goes back to

23   Justice Breyer's question.            Why is it a de novo

24   proceeding?    Well, in the Sinnamon case, which we cite

25   in our brief, there are constitutional reasons under the


                                         23

 1   California's constitution.           The Labor Commissioner

 2   doesn't exercise any judicial authority and does not

 3   have the power to finally decide this controversy.                     The

 4   Labor Commissioner is merely exercising her

 5   administrative power over this dispute because this is

 6   part of a comprehensive regulatory scheme.

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Why would you want this to

 8   happen?    Why -- who would imagine such a system in which

 9   you bring it to the Labor Commissioner and you prevent

10   the matter from being resolved immediately with an

11   arbitrator.    I don't know how long does it take for the

12   Labor Commissioner?      I don't know.

13                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         On average 8 months, Justice

14   Scalia.

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Eight months.       But then

16   when he's done --

17                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         She, Your Honor.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           She.      No matter what

19   happens, you go back to the arbitrator.                  Who in his

20   right mind would set up such a system?

21                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         Well, there are valid

22   reasons.   There are very compelling reasons why

23   California set up this system.               California law says if

24   you're going to act like a talent agent, you're going to

25   procure employment -- that's the touchstone -- you're


                                        24

 1   acting as a talent agency, you're supposed to submit

 2   your contracts in advance for pre-approval from the

 3   Labor Commissioner.      You're supposed to bring your

 4   disputes there.    That's how the Labor Commissioner

 5   learns of disputes.      The Labor Commissioner is supposed

 6   to develop this body of law by interpreting it.                   All --

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           This person is not a talent

 8   agent.

 9                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         The is person is a talent

10   agent, Justice Scalia.        He was operating to procure

11   employment.    And the statute says anyone who even

12   attempts to procure employment is a talent agent, and

13   that is all that Mr. Preston did.

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Normally we say that

15   those types of disputes are for the arbitrator to

16   decide.   The theory is that the arbitrator can apply the

17   existing law as well as a court, and if that's the

18   theory, couldn't the arbitrator apply the existing law

19   as well as an agency?

20                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         Chief Justice Roberts, there

21   are other things that the Labor Commissioner is invested

22   with jurisdiction to do.          The Labor Commissioner has to

23   find out about these disputes.               How does she find out?

24   Because parties bring these petitions.                   This is a great

25   deterrent for people from violating the California

 1   Talent Agencies Act.        It works because the dispute has

 2   to come before her.       She knows who the bad apples are.

 3   She knows she can go to get injunctive relief if she

 4   needs to.   Her expertise is advanced.                     She gets to

 5   decide the controversy initially.                  And it merely

 6   postpones arbitration.         And critically, this is --

 7               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Well, that may be great as

 8   a means of informing the Labor Commissioner, but it

 9   virtually destroys the value of arbitration --

10               MR. BRUNSTAD:            No, but the --

11               JUSTICE SOUTER:              -- because the

12   expeditiousness of arbitration is gone once you start

13   down the California procedural road.                      They don't want to

14   go to arbitration 8 to 12 months later.                      They want it

15   now.

16               MR. BRUNSTAD:            No, Justice Souter, it's

17   actually enhanced.      It's enhanced for all the reasons

18   that, when exert brings his or her expertise to bear,

19   you can get a settlement; you get expedited resolution

20   the issues get refind.         Most parties don't go to

21   arbitration after this because --

22               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Then they probably

23   shouldn't have agreed to arbitrate, but they did agree

24   to arbitrate, and they want to arbitrate now.                      And one

25   of the points of arbitration is to get the ball rolling

 1   fast, and that cannot be done under the system you are

 2   arguing for.

 3               MR. BRUNSTAD:          But, Justice Souter, this is

 4   what they bargained for.         They bargained for the

 5   application of California law under the --

 6               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Did you make that argument

 7   below, that implicitly they have imported the California

 8   labor scheme in as a -- in effect, as a condition

 9   precedent to the arbitration?

10               MR. BRUNSTAD:          Yes, Justice Souter, we cited

11   the Volt case before the California court of appeal.

12   Now, the other side did not raise --

13               JUSTICE BREYER:            It sounds as if you made

14   the argument -- well, you say we cited a case.

15               MR. BRUNSTAD:          But, Justice Breyer, they did

16   not raise the pre-emption argument at all.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay.       The answer to

18   Justice Souter's question is no, we didn't raise it

19   below.   Is that right?

20               MR. BRUNSTAD:          We did by responding to their

21   argument.   We did cite Volt.           The only other --

22               JUSTICE SOUTER:            But you didn't go further

23   than to decide that case.          Is that correct?

24               MR. BRUNSTAD:          We did not go further than to

25   cite Volt, but let me --

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Volt involves a third

 2   party who is not party to the arbitration agreement.

 3   You have a party who is bound nonetheless invoking the

 4   Labor Commission to avoid going immediately to

 5   arbitration.     Volt is very clear.               It involves a third

 6   party, litigation involving a third party who is not

 7   bound by the arbitration agreement.                       Here you have only

 8   two parties.     They are both bound by the arbitration

 9   agreement.     I don't see how you can invoke Volt.

10                MR. BRUNSTAD:           Because Volt simply was about

11   -- a case about postponing arbitration in favor of

12   litigation going forward, which has actually had a

13   greater impact --

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Litigation involving a

15   person who couldn't be brought into the arbitration.

16                MR. BRUNSTAD:           True, but --

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              It makes sense to say

18   that piece of it involving a party who can't be before

19   the arbitrator should be -- should be -- go first.                      But

20   here you don't have anybody who isn't bound to go before

21   the arbitrator.     You have no third party.

22                MR. BRUNSTAD:           Except the Labor Commissioner

23   herself who is supposed to do these administrative

24   procedures for all kinds of validate and compelling

25   State court -- State law reasons.

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Judgment involved would

 2   have been binding --

 3                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         Yes.

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- on the third parties.

 5   You don't -- and you assert that the judgment here

 6   wouldn't be binding at all.             It's just because the Labor

 7   Commissioner, he or she, is such an expert on this --

 8   your opponent says she's not at all --

 9                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         She is, Your Honor.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, I imagine that's

11   highly debatable.

12                 It's a different case where you say you have

13   to wait for a court decision which will be conclusive as

14   to many of the people in the case.

15                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         But, Justice Scalia, in Volt,

16   the State court litigation went forward, the related

17   litigation.    It could have res judicata/collateral

18   estoppel effects on the arbitration.                     It has even more

19   of an impact on arbitration --

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            You said something about

21   that in your brief, and I think that you got it wrong.

22   You said something about -- that the outcome of the

23   litigation can have preclusive effect in the

24   arbitration.    But that would be so only if the result

25   favored the non-party to the litigation, because the

 1   non-party to the litigation cannot be bound by a

 2   judgment that would adversely affect that party's

 3   interest.     That party wasn't in the proceeding.                It

 4   isn't bound by it.      The parties to the litigation are

 5   bound by it, not the non-parties to the litigation.

 6                 MR. BRUNSTAD:          True, Justice Ginsburg, but

 7   at least it can bind one of the parties and therefore

 8   tie the hands of the arbitrator in the subsequent

 9   proceeding.     Here this is not possible.                The parties

10   bargained for this in their agreement when they

11   bargained for the application of California law.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Could California law do

13   this?     I mean could they say, you know, we have a

14   problem.     By the way, this is just a hypothetical.                   We

15   think that our judges in the Superior Court don't know

16   very much about building disputes.

17                 Now, I say it is a hypothetical because, in

18   fact, Superior Court judges in California are excellent

19   judges.     But California thinks, no, they don't know

20   enough about it.     So here's what we do.                We say when

21   Jones and Smith enter into an arbitration agreement, if

22   it happens to concern a building dispute, they have to

23   go to Federal -- they can go to the Superior Court.                      In

24   fact, if they want to, if one of them wants to, the

25   other one doesn't.      And everything is delayed while the

 1   Superior Court judge decides all the issues in the case.

 2   And then after they can go back to arbitration, if of

 3   course they still want to.           Could California do that?

 4                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         Well, if that's what parties

 5   bargained for, that was their agreement.                 It would be --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I've read the agreement,

 7   and I don't quite find their -- here --

 8                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         But I understand your

 9   hypothetical --

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:           In my mind is what they do

11   is they have the same standard arbitration clause.                   So

12   I'm asking not about the parties; I'm asking about

13   California.

14                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         No, Justice Breyer.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           No.     The answer is no.     I

16   thought so.    And so now you explain to me how this is

17   any different than what I just said, other than

18   substituting the words "Labor Commissioner" for

19   "California Superior Court" and substituting the words

20   "talent dispute" for the words "building dispute."

21                 MR. BRUNSTAD:         Because here what the Labor

22   Commissioner does is not what a court does.                "Labor

23   Commissioner" is not synonymous with "the court" and

24   cannot be under California's constitution.                Here you

25   have a complete, again, arbitration postponing rule and

 1   nothing more.    The arbitrator's hands are not tied in

 2   any way; whereas the arbitrator's hands would be tied if

 3   in fact you had court litigation that was conclusive

 4   between the --

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:            No.     His hypothetical was

 6   that the court decision would just be advisory and the

 7   arbitrator could ignore it.

 8                MR. BRUNSTAD:          Well, that would be --

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Just get, you know, a

10   knowledgeable person's input.

11                MR. BRUNSTAD:          But, Justice Scalia, that

12   would be inconsistent with the arbitration clause

13   itself.    Here, however, it is not.                Here the parties

14   bargained for the application of California law.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:            This contract said the same

16   thing.    This contract will be governed by California

17   law.

18                MR. BRUNSTAD:          Right.

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Would it suck up this

20   provision that says you have to go to the Superior

21   Court?

22                MR. BRUNSTAD:          No.

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:            No.     I don't think so

24   either.

 1   because California law requires you to go to the Labor

 2   Commissioner first, not to --

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, I guess that would be

 4   a question for the arbitrator.

 5              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I just want to understand

 6   your position.   In this case, does the California

 7   provision for de novo review in the Superior Court apply

 8   to stay the arbitration while that aspect of the

 9   proceeding is completed?

10              MR. BRUNSTAD:           Under California law -- it is

11   California law -- you must go to the labor commissioner

12   first before you go either to court or the arbitrator.

13   You must go to the arbitrator second.

14              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             My question was:    You go

15   to the labor commissioner.          You also have a de novo

16   right to go to the superior court.

17              MR. BRUNSTAD:           That is correct.

18              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Suppose the labor

19   commissioner said something absolutely silly.               Wouldn't

20   you think you would have the right to go to the Superior

21   Court?

22              MR. BRUNSTAD:           Either side -- either side

23   can go to the superior court.

24              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And it would make no sense

25   to do that and -- and not to also stay the arbitration.

 1                 MR. BRUNSTAD:          Justice Kennedy, I think the

 2   problem I'm having with your question is that I think

 3   you are assuming that there's an arbitration in place

 4   while the labor commissioner is going forward.

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            No.      Now, we have this

 6   case.     We have an arbitration clause.

 7                 MR. BRUNSTAD:          We do.

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            The arbitrator is waiting.

 9   You go to the labor commissioner, you go to the superior

10   court to say enjoin the arbitration while I go to the

11   labor commissioner.

12                 MR. BRUNSTAD:          Correct.

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            The labor commissioner

14   does something silly.        Can you not then go to superior

15   court and get de novo review of that wrong decision of

16   the labor commissioner before the arbitration starts?

17                 MR. BRUNSTAD:          No, Justice Kennedy, because

18   once --

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Have you taken that

20   position consistently in this litigation?

22   Kennedy.    We never got to the --

 1   superior court should stay the arbitration because you

 2   have to exhaust the administrative remedies first; and,

 3   consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, Section 2,

 4   there might be grounds for invalidating this Arbitration

 5   Act.

 6                JUSTICE ALITO:          Is there any California case

 7   that says that this works this way?                      That after the

 8   proceeding is finished before the labor commissioner,

 9   the parties have a right to go to arbitration before

10   there's de novo review in the superior court?

11                MR. BRUNSTAD:          Specifically, Justice Alito,

12   no.    What the California courts have decided is that

13   there is a de novo right, and --

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             A de novo right in

15   Superior Court?

16                MR. BRUNSTAD:          Yes.      But the California

17   Supreme Court has also said, in construing its own

18   arbitration act, which is Section 1281, which is

19   basically the same as Section 2 of the FAA -- said,

20   look, when we have a right to go to court if you have an

21   arbitration proceeding, the -- a motion to compel

22   arbitration must be granted unless, for example, the

23   arbitration clause is invalid for some reason.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Right, you at least

25   have that additional step.           It is -- particularly since

 1   you only have 10 days to appeal from the labor

 2   commissioner, someone who wants to arbitrate has to

 3   appeal, has to go to superior court and get a motion to

 4   compel.

 5              You can't even wait to see if your opponent

 6   goes to superior court and -- well, if he has won, he

 7   wouldn't go into court.        But you have to go to the court

 8   to get a motion to compel?          You can't just go ahead and

 9   proceed with arbitration.

10              MR. BRUNSTAD:           Well, the parties could

11   voluntarily do that.      But, yes, if you don't do the de

12   novo proceeding, then the labor commissioner's decision

13   becomes binding.

14              So you must take the step of doing the

15   notice of appeal and then do a motion to compel.

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Excuse me.       You say -- I

17   thought you said it doesn't become binding.                 That it is

18   just advice to the arbitrator.              Once you -- once you get

19   the remand to the arbitrator, it is not binding.

20              MR. BRUNSTAD:           No, Justice Scalia.         If I

21   made that impression, I'm sorry.               I was mistaken.    What

22   I am saying is that if -- if -- you have a right to take

23   an appeal to the California Superior Court.

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Right.

25              MR. BRUNSTAD:           And once you get to the

 1   California Superior Court, then, under Section 1281, you

 2   have a right to move to compel for arbitration, just as

 3   under the Federal Arbitration Act.

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But --

 5                 MR. BRUNSTAD:          If do you not do those

 6   things, if you do not take the appeal, then the labor

 7   commissioner's -- by default, her ruling becomes

 8   binding.     So you have to do the appellate process, and

 9   you must file a motion.

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And if you -- and if

11   you are successful and get from the superior court an

12   order to compel arbitration, your opponent can then

13   appeal it, I assume.

14                 MR. BRUNSTAD:          Your opponent can appeal the

15   decision compelling the arbitration if it were

16   improperly granted, yes.

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Are you telling us that

18   under no circumstance, if you prevail in this case,

19   would you go to the superior court for de novo review

20   and -- and, as part of that, stay the arbitration?

21                 MR. BRUNSTAD:          Justice Kennedy, if the

22   arbitration clause is valid and applicable, we will go

23   to arbitration.    That validity and applicability has not

24   been tested by any court below.                For example, are there

25   grounds --

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            All right.           Let's assume

 2   the arbitration clause is valid.

 3               MR. BRUNSTAD:          Yes, we will go to

 4   arbitration.

 5               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Even though in this case

 6   you have assumed that that arbitration has to be stayed

 7   for the labor commissioner.            So the case does not have

 8   to be stayed, and you would not ask for it to be stayed,

 9   in the superior court?

10               MR. BRUNSTAD:          Labor commissioner goes

11   first.   Then, we go to arbitration.                    If this Court rules

12   that the labor commissioner's jurisdiction is preempted,

13   then we go back to the -- to the lower court.                     If the

14   arbitration clause is valid and applicable, we will go

15   to arbitration.   That is correct.               Chief Justice

16   Roberts, you asked a question about the --

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Brunstad, I'm looking

18   at the point in which you said this in your brief.                     You

19   said you go to the labor commission, and then you go to

20   the Superior Court.     This is page 13 of your brief.

21               The court is required to grant a motion

22   compelling arbitration if the parties have executed a

23   valid and applicable arbitration agreement.

24               Well, who determines if the parties have

25   executed a valid and applicable arbitration agreement?


                                       38
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              MR. BRUNSTAD:           Under First Options here,

 2   were it not unmistakably clear that the parties said

 3   that the arbitrator should decide arbitrability, that

 4   would be for the court to decide.

 5              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Well, we know -- this is

 6   not a mystery in this contract.              It says it in the

 7   contract, and it says it under the AAA rules.              But you

 8   phrased this in your brief in a way that says, well, if

 9   the parties have executed a valid and applicable

10   arbitration agreement, that's what the superior court is

11   going to decide.   So it won't grant a motion to compel

12   unless it determines that the parties have executed the

13   valid and applicable arbitration agreement.

14              MR. BRUNSTAD:           And what I meant in that

15   language, Justice Ginsburg, is simply this:             For

16   example, if the arbitration clause were invalid because

17   the arbitration clause, itself, were, say, fraudulent

18   or -- for something, then it would not be validate and

19   applicable; or if the scope of the arbitration clause

20   were limited in some way, then the scope issue, the

21   arbitrability issue, is for the court to decide as this

22   Court decided in First Options.

23              Here we do not have the unmistakably clear

24   language that the parties intended that the question of

25   arbitrability, itself, to be to the arbitrator.               So the


                                       39
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   court would decide if, in fact, the --

 2              JUSTICE BREYER:            Right, this is -- this is

 3   -- actually now we are getting to the bottom of

 4   something here, I think.

 5              Now, I am beginning to understand where you

 6   are coming from; and Volt does offer you considerable

 7   support, as I -- as I agreed.

 8              MR. BRUNSTAD:          Yes, Justice Breyer.

 9              JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.              Now, Volt,

10   however, is a case, I take it, in which the stay that

11   was entered was a stay staying the arbitration pending

12   the resolution of a judicial dispute that was not

13   subject to arbitrability.

14              MR. BRUNSTAD:          Correct.

15              JUSTICE BREYER:            Therefore, it seems to me

16   that the question here concerns the meaning of this

17   contract, and that's where we started.

18              MR. BRUNSTAD:          Yes.

19              JUSTICE BREYER:            Does this contract mean

20   that the parties who entered have promised, one, not

21   themselves to go to court?         Answer:             Yes.

22              MR. BRUNSTAD:          Yes.

23              JUSTICE BREYER:            Two, not themselves to

24   bring a proceeding before this administrative agency?

25   And that's where he says yes, and you say no.

 1               MR. BRUNSTAD:          No.

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:            And then is the proper

 3   resolution of that to say:          Well, you can raise that,

 4   too, before the arbitrator?

 5               MR. BRUNSTAD:          No, Justice Breyer.

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:            Why not?

 7               MR. BRUNSTAD:          And this goes to the Chief

 8   Justice's initial question which I have been trying to

 9   get to.   And that is when the parties incorporated

10   California law, what did they incorporate?

11               Well, in Volt this Court answered:           When

12   they incorporated California law, it was California law;

13   not California law with a gloss of Federal law, but

14   California law.   And the California Supreme Court in the

15   Chronus case that we cite says exactly the same thing.

16               JUSTICE ALITO:          Isn't that a question of

17   contract interpretation --

18               MR. BRUNSTAD:          Yes.

19               JUSTICE ALITO:          -- for the arbitrator?

20               MR. BRUNSTAD:          No.

21               JUSTICE ALITO:          Why not?

22               MR. BRUNSTAD:          Because that goes -- because

23   I think that this Court held that it to be no in Volt.

24   It said, look, where the -- because that goes to the

25   applicability, the validity, of the arbitration clause,


                                       41

 1   itself.

 2                Here we don't have arbitrability, itself.

 3   The First Options standard is not satisfied under this

 4   case.

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, I don't understand --

 6   so you incorporate California law.                  I interpret that to

 7   mean substantive law of California.

 8                You say also incorporates -- and this is

 9   what I find peculiar.       California law gives you a

10   procedural right to go to the labor commission.                 But it

11   also gives you a procedural right to go to superior

12   court.    And, yet, you acknowledge that the arbitration

13   agreement, when you say we will arbitrate, forecloses

14   your using the superior court.

15                Why doesn't it foreclose your using the

16   labor commissioner?      I don't understand how you slice

17   the bologna that thin.        To me, if it excludes California

18   procedures, it excludes both the labor commissioner and

19   the superior court.

20                MR. BRUNSTAD:          Two reasons, Justice Scalia:

21                First, in the Buckeye case, for example, the

22   parties specifically selected as their choice of law the

23   Federal Arbitration Act.          Here the parties selected

24   California law.    This is no different than in Volt.

25                The second reason, Justice Scalia --


                                        42
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Let me -- I want to

 2   understand that answer.          California law includes the

 3   Superior Court as much as it includes the labor

 4   commissioner.

 5                MR. BRUNSTAD:           In Volt, Your Honor, the

 6   specific law that was -- the Court said was selected was

 7   Section 1281 of the California Code of Civil Procedure,

 8   which applies in a California court favoring a court

 9   proceeding because California has this rule that says if

10   you have arbitration and related litigation, you can

11   stay --

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Related litigation with

13   someone other than the parties that you bound yourself

14   to arbitrate with.      That involved Stanford and two

15   companies, Stanford suing two companies or -- in

16   litigation with two companies with whom it had no

17   arbitration agreement.

18                MR. BRUNSTAD:           Yes, Justice Ginsburg.     But

19   here I think the Court has drawn the proper distinction

20   between, on the one hand, Volt and, on the other hand,

21   Doctor's Associates, Mastrobuono, Perry, Allied-Bruce,

22   all of those cases where the Court has said if it is an

23   arbitration negating rule, you don't incorporate it,

24   because that's fundamentally at war with the decision to

25   arbitrate.

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               But where it's merely an arbitration

 2   postponing rule, which was the procedural issue in Volt

 3   and the procedural issue here, then we respect that and

 4   say that's not pre-empted, because it's not necessary to

 5   pre-empt.

 6               JUSTICE ALITO:          How can we decide this case

 7   on the assumption that this is simply an arbitration

 8   postponing rule when there's no California case that

 9   says that, do you acknowledge?

10               And a party resisting arbitration could well

11   argue that the California Code means that you go first

12   to the Labor Commissioner and then, as the statute says

13   explicitly, the parties are entitled to a de novo review

14   before the Superior Court without making any provision

15   for arbitration.   Do you think it is inconceivable the

16   California courts could interpret the statute to mean

17   that, that there's no room for arbitration in the -- in

18   this scheme?

19               MR. BRUNSTAD:          It is inconceivable,

20   Justice Alito, that the California court would say that

21   arbitration is not permissible in this case.               The

22   California Supreme Court has reconciled previously in

23   the Aguilar case, which is 32 Cal. 4th 974.             You had two

24   different provisions of law.            One said you had

25   nonbinding arbitration for fee disputes between


                                       44
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   attorneys, and the second was the California Arbitration

 2   Act.

 3              And the California Supreme Court said, as

 4   this Court said, that it will indulge every intent to

 5   give effect to such proceedings, the arbitration

 6   proceedings, in Section 1281.            It will harmonize the

 7   statutes and say if you if you have a right to

 8   arbitrate, we will respect that and we will harmonize

 9   the laws so we respect that.

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:            So the California Supreme

11   Court would construct a system in which you get the

12   advice of this expert, the Labor Commissioner.           One of

13   the parties thinks that this expert's advice is

14   ridiculous, just absolutely wrong.

15              Now, California law generally considers the

16   Superior Court smarter than the Labor Commissioner,

17   which is why you get de novo review before the Superior

18   Court.

19              MR. BRUNSTAD:          No, Justice Scalia.

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:            No?

21              MR. BRUNSTAD:          No.

22              JUSTICE SCALIA:            It is stupider than the

23   Labor Commissioner.

24              (Laughter.)

25              MR. BRUNSTAD:          No, Justice Scalia.    It is

 1   the California constitutional provision.                 Under

 2   California's constitution, for better or worse, you

 3   cannot have the Labor Commissioner --

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:            All right.       I will amend

 5   it.   The California Superior Court is ex officio smarter

 6   than the Labor Commissioner, okay?                 And yet, one of the

 7   parties who thinks the Labor Commissioner is dead wrong

 8   doesn't get a chance to have this advice corrected the

 9   way the California constitution envisions, by the ex

10   officio smarter Superior Court.

11               MR. BRUNSTAD:          Justice Scalia --

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:            And that is the scheme that

13   the California Supreme Court is going to embed in

14   California law?

15               MR. BRUNSTAD:          Justice Scalia, bankruptcy

16   courts cannot enter final decisions, yet we know that

17   they're expert in bankruptcy law, even though they're

18   subject to de novo review in the district court.

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            In this case, the Court of

20   Appeals, the majority said the fact that the losing

21   party will have a right to de novo hearing, involving

22   additional time and money, does not excuse the Defendant

23   from the legal requirement to exhaust his remedy.                And I

24   think you're preserving the option to go to the Superior

25   Court, at least the contestability of the arbitration

 1   clause.

 2              MR. BRUNSTAD:            But that's the case in every

 3   Federal Arbitration Act case, Justice Kennedy.

 4              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              So that, it seems to me,

 5   makes incorrect your statement in your brief that, oh,

 6   this is just for eight months, so that there's very

 7   little additional time involved because of the de novo

 8   hearing.

 9              MR. BRUNSTAD:            No, Justice Kennedy.

10              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Don't you think that your

11   statement at page 34 of the brief has to be qualified in

12   that respect?

13              MR. BRUNSTAD:            Justice Kennedy, if we get to

14   the Superior Court -- the Labor Commissioner does her

15   work, and if the parties are not satisfied with it,

16   either of them has the right to go to the Superior Court

17   for a de novo hearing and file a motion to compel

18   arbitration.    This would be no different than any other

19   Arbitration Act case where, when you get to the --

20              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But you also have the

21   right to challenge what -- the accuracy of the Labor

22   Department's finding.       That's what both -- all the

23   judges on the California court agreed with that.             So I'm

24   asking, doesn't that make -- require qualification of

25   your statement at page 34 that these procedures are

 1   expeditious and informal and do not entail additional

 2   expense or delay?    All of --

 3                MR. BRUNSTAD:          Yes, Justice Kennedy.           Yes.

 4   That is --

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            That does require some

 6   qualification there.

 7                MR. BRUNSTAD:          Yes, Justice Kennedy, that

 8   is -- that is factually accurate.                 That is a factually

 9   accurate addition to what we said in our brief.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel, do you --

11                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            All right.       Does it also

12   require some qualification in you brief where, at page

13   12, you say Preston clearly and repeatedly sought to

14   procure employment for Ferrer in the television

15   industry?    Our rules say that you cannot raise matters

16   for the first time in this Court.                 And you have no

17   evidence on that point.

18                MR. BRUNSTAD:          Justice Kennedy, we never got

19   to an evidentiary hearing in this case.

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I know you didn't, and

21   that's why I'm questioning why you put it in your brief.

22   Doesn't that require some qualification?

23                MR. BRUNSTAD:          It is not in the record,

24   Justice Kennedy, because there is no factual record in

25   this case --

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Therefore, don't make

 2   factual averments here for the first time.

 3               MR. BRUNSTAD:            It's not for the first time,

 4   Justice Kennedy.     It was made all the way through the

 5   proceedings below.      We never got to an evidentiary

 6   hearing.   This case is still at the preliminary stages.

 7               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Do you think, in the

 8   briefs to this Court, you can make factual statements

 9   that are not in the record?

10               MR. BRUNSTAD:            Well, Justice Kennedy, that

11   would mean we could make no factual statements to give

12   the Court any background at all.                 I think it is

13   undisputed; it isn't challenged by the other side.

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I think they do say that

15   it is disputed.    They do dispute that he clearly and

16   repeatedly sought to procure employment for Ferrer.

17   That's the whole issue in the case.

18               MR. BRUNSTAD:            It's undisputed, that Mr.

19   Preston went and arranged the meeting with Judge Ferrer

20   initially with the folks at ABC.

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But they said it is --

22   they dispute that it is to procure employment.

23               MR. BRUNSTAD:            I think, Justice Kennedy, I

24   will concede that it is not a matter of evidence, so

25   that qualification -- I will accept that

 1   qualification --

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            In that light, on page

 3   43, you say in this case, it is undisputed that Preston

 4   was an unlicensed talent agent and that the contract he

 5   drafted did not meet the requirements of Section 1700.

 6                I thought it is very much disputed whether

 7   he was a talent agent at all.             I thought the position

 8   was -- that your opponent is taking is that he was not a

 9   talent agent, that he didn't come under the statute.

10                MR. BRUNSTAD:         It is undisputed,

11   Justice Ginsburg, that Mr. Preston never had a license.

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But that's not what you

13   said here.   You say it is undisputed that Preston was an

14   unlicensed talent agent.         That's your statement.

15                MR. BRUNSTAD:         Our argument,

16   Justice Ginsburg, is that he was unlicensed but he was

17   operating as a talent agent under section -- under the

18   California Talent Agencies Act.

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:           The latter is disputed.

20   The latter is vigorously disputed.

21                MR. BRUNSTAD:         That is disputed, Justice

22   Scalia.   And they have disputed that.                  But it is -- let

23   me qualify that then, Justice Ginsburg.                   It's undisputed

24   that he never had a license.

25                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Could I ask one question


                                       50

 1   that I just want to be sure I understand your position?

 2   If we had not granted cert, if you had gone to the

 3   administrative agency and the agent had ruled against

 4   you, what would you have next done?

 5              MR. BRUNSTAD:           Ruled against us?       We would

 6   have filed an appeal to the --

 7              JUSTICE STEVENS:             To the court?

 8              MR. BRUNSTAD:           To the court, correct.       And

 9   then there would have been a motion to compel for

10   arbitration.   That --

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             That seems to me

12   completely inconsistent with your argument that

13   additional time was minimal.            And if you have repeated

14   statements in your brief that require qualifications, if

15   in your former argument in Marshal, the Court is

16   concerned with the accuracy of one of your citations,

17   shouldn't we view with some skepticism what you tell us?

18              MR. BRUNSTAD:           No, Justice Kennedy.       I think

19   that all of our citations to the record and all of our

20   statements about the facts are, in fact, true.

21              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              What I just read you,

22   this one, you said it isn't.            You say it is undisputed

23   that Preston was an unlicensed talent agent.               And you

24   just admitted that that is disputed.

25              MR. BRUNSTAD:           I'm sorry, forgive me,

 1   Justice Ginsburg.    It's undisputed that Mr. Preston

 2   never had a license.

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But that's not what you

 4   represented.

 5               MR. BRUNSTAD:           It is disputed whether he was

 6   acting as a talent agent or not.                I wish to clarify

 7   that.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Mr. Schleimer, you

 9   have nine minutes remaining.

10           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH D. SCHLEIMER

11                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12              MR. SCHLEIMER:            Thank you, Mr. Chief

13   Justice.

14              I would disagree that there wasn't an

15   evidentiary hearing.       I don't think the evidence is

16   considered, but in addition to Mr. Preston's

17   declaration, I made an offer of proof which is in the

18   appellant's appendix at page 219.                 I offered to prove

19   that the Judge Alex television program is solicited and

20   procured by an agent of the William Morris Agency.                  I

21   had made two attempts to depose Judge Ferrer to prove

22   that, and I never got the chance.                 He didn't want to be

23   deposed.

24              So, there was a full evidentiary hearing.

25   The evidence just wasn't considered because the legal

 1   standard that was applied was there's a colorable claim

 2   under the Talent Agencies Act, so you can't arbitrate

 3   until it's resolved.

 4                 Now I saw this as being a long trek through

 5   the courts.    I don't know when the arbitrator gets to

 6   make his decision.      If -- if the Labor Commissioner

 7   rules that the contract is void and then we have a de

 8   novo and the Superior Court does that, and the court of

 9   appeal does it, and then the California Supreme Court

10   rules the contract is void, does the arbitrator get to

11   overrule that.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Regardless of the -- I now

13   understand better than I did what I take as a pretty

14   strong argument.    I'm not saying convincing, but strong.

15                 And that would be this:                     If you go look at

16   Volt, and in Volt the Court said that the California

17   Code meant that the individual who'd entered into the

18   arbitration contract could go and can ask a superior

19   court to stay an arbitration while some unrelated --

20   some unrelated -- I mean directly related but not the

21   same parties -- litigation took place.

22                 The Court didn't in Volt say that that

23   question of interpreting this contract is for the

24   arbitrator.    I don't know why it didn't.                     But it didn't.

25                 Now here he's making a parallel argument.


                                         53

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   He's saying that the California Code says that people

 2   should first go to that Labor Commissioner and that you

 3   can stay arbitration while that goes on.

 4              Now -- and I say well, why don't you go to

 5   the arbitrator?     He says I don't want to go to the

 6   arbitrator on that one, but he points to Volt.

 7              And so the puzzle is this:                     if the Court in

 8   Volt didn't say this is a matter for the arbitrator,

 9   whether the contract really means that you promise not

10   to go into court and make a motion to stay, why here is

11   it a matter for the arbitrator whether you implicitly

12   promised not to go into court and asked him to stay

13   pending the outcome of this administrative proceeding?

14              What do you think about that?

15              MR. SCHLEIMER:             I certainly think that the

16   arbitrator had jurisdiction to arbitrate arbitrability.

17              And the reason for that is the Qualcomm case

18   and the Dream Theater case is a California case cited in

19   Qualcomm, and that the arbitrator should have decided

20   all these issues.

21              I would make this observation.                    If we -- if

22   we had gone to the arbitrator and Judge Ferrer had said

23   look, this contract is illegal, said you don't have

24   jurisdiction, and I want you to rule you don't have

25   jurisdiction, the same illegality issue would be a

 1   defense on the merits.

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, I -- I accept that.

 3   I see a lot of common sense on your side of it.              But

 4   imagine I'm writing an opinion in your favor and now I

 5   come to the following paragraph which I have to write:

 6   "Your opponent says that Volt controls here; but that is

 7   wrong because" -- and now fill in the blank for me.

 8                 MR. SCHLEIMER:          Assuming Volt --

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Now, I'm just saying I have

10   to write.     I see all the common sense of your position.

11   I -- absolutely.     But to get -- you only need one really

12   good argument.     And he's saying whatever the other ones

13   are, here Breyer or somebody is going to have to write

14   the words, and Volt is different because -- so I would

15   like some help on that one.

16                 MR. SCHLEIMER:          Because in Volt the contract

17   was silent, and the Federal Arbitration Act was silent

18   on the issue that was presented, and State law supplied

19   the answer.     The California Arbitration Act has a number

20   of --

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But that's always the

22   case.   It's always the case that the arbitration is

23   quiet on this.     It is -- the Respondent's position is

24   that it is absolutely quiet, but it is also absolutely

25   clear that it is State law.

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                MR. SCHLEIMER:         The contract here, I would

 2   submit, Justice Kennedy, is not quiet because it says

 3   that validity or legality shall be arbitrated.                 And

 4   that's what we are talking about.                So you don't have a

 5   silent contract.   You have a contract that speaks to

 6   that question.

 7                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I'm not sure that Volt

 8   would have been different.          Volt is -- Volt is written

 9   very broadly, it seems to me, in favor of the

10   Respondent's position.

11                MR. SCHLEIMER:         Volt was written under the

12   California Arbitration Act, and speaking as a California

13   practitioner that had had a lot of cases, you might

14   notice that the same section in Volt was the basis for

15   my motion to compel arbitration.               See codicil procedure

16   CC P 1281.2.   CC P 1281 is almost identical to Section 2

17   of the Federal Arbitration Act, but the California

18   Arbitration Act has a number of provisions where the

19   Federal Arbitration Act is silent.                 One of those is

20   dealing with multi-party litigation where parties are

21   not bound.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:           You think Volt would have

23   come out the same way if -- if in fact, all of the

24   parties in this other litigation had agreed to

25   arbitration?   You have any doubt --

 1              MR. SCHLEIMER:            I think it would have come

 2   out the other way, yes.

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Yeah.       I do, too.

 4              MR. SCHLEIMER:            That's what Volt was all

 5   about, was the fact that --

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Writing broadly is known as

 7   dictum, isn't it?

 8              (Laughter.)

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I suppose if we write the

10   case your way, we have to talk about what happens if

11   this Labor Commissioner had enforcement powers, that

12   they had the sua sponte right to invoke, and that they

13   did?

14              MR. SCHLEIMER:            I think the Labor

15   Commissioner probably does.             I think it has to do with

16   the adjudicatory versus prosecutorial function of an

17   administrative agency.

18              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But this is not a

19   proceeding brought by the administrative agency.

20              MR. SCHLEIMER:            No.

21              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               An agency like the EEOC

22   Waffle House.

23              MR. SCHLEIMER:            This is -- this is an --

24   this is an administrative agency providing an

25   adjudicatory forum.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             This is somebody who's

 2   bound by arbitration invoking whatever authority the

 3   Labor Commissioner has, quite different from the Labor

 4   Commissioner commencing a proceeding.

 5               MR. SCHLEIMER:          Waffle House was all about

 6   the prosecutorial or administrative power.                 This

 7   is about the adjudicatory --

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, your friend

 9   says that this agency has exactly that power, and the

10   reason you required these things to go before her, is

11   that she knows what's going on in the area and, if

12   appropriate, can take the supervisory authority or

13   whatever the equivalent of prosecutorial action is.

14               MR. SCHLEIMER:          I think I pointed out in my

15   papers that nothing stops Judge Ferrer from putting a

16   dime in the phone, calling the Labor Commissioner and

17   complaining, saying there's been illegality here.                  They

18   may request some evidence at that point.                But the point

19   is that the prosecutorial discretion will be exercised

20   by the Labor Commissioner acting in an essentially

22               Here in our case, all they did was supply a

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, Counsel.

 8   The case is submitted.

10   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
