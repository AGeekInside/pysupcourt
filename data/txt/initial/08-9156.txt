 5              Mr. Scanlon.

 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF KERRY A. SCANLON

 7                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8              MR. SCANLON:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10              Holly Wood was sentenced to death after his

11   lawyers failed to investigate or present to the jury

12   evidence of his undisputed mental deficiencies.                    That

13   evidence was readily available to any reasonably

14   competent attorney, and it offered powerful mitigation

15   which had a reasonable probability of changing the

16   sentence from death to life without parole.

17              No one on the sentencing jury had any idea

18   that Mr. Wood had any mental deficiency, much less that

19   he had an IQ between 59 and 64, which means he ranks in

20   the lowest one percent of the total population.

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Of course, if they had

22   introduced that evidence on behalf of the defendant,

23   there would have come in the report they had gotten

24   from -- who was it, Dr. Kirkland?                  Was that his name?

25              MR. SCANLON:           That's correct, Justice

 1   Scalia.

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Which said that, although

 3   he -- he indeed was in the lower range of mental

 4   agility, this did not affect his ability to discern

 5   right from wrong.

 6              MR. SCANLON:           Well --

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:               He was not -- the Kirkland

 8   report was not a favorable report for the defendant.

 9              MR. SCANLON:           Well, the Kirkland report was

10   not -- first of all, was only about his mental

11   competency and whether he had a mental disease or defect

12   that prevented him from knowing right from wrong.                   It

13   was an incompetency and insanity report.

14              This Court has made it clear in Atkins and

15   other cases that mentally retarded persons often know

16   the difference between right and wrong and are competent

17   to stand trial.   What that report did have is a very

18   strong lead that he had a borderline intellectual

19   functioning.   That is different from whether or not he

20   is able to go to trial or whether he --

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Well, but it didn't just

22   say borderline intellectual function.                    It went on to say

23   that did not affect his ability to perceive that he

24   was -- he was doing something wrong here.

25              MR. SCANLON:           Each of the statements --

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           You know, if it had not

 2   added that I would have said, oh, yeah, let's -- let's

 3   pursue this further.      But they -- it seems to me they

 4   made an intelligent decision There was nothing here that

 5   was going to help them and there might be stuff that

 6   would hurt them.

 7                 MR. SCANLON:       Justice Scalia, everything in

 8   the Kirkland report that talked about his ability was

 9   his ability to go to trial, that he was competent and

10   that he knew the difference between right and wrong.

11   Those findings in the Kirkland report that talk about

12   that relate only to that issue.               It's an entirely

13   different issue, which the courts have made clear,

14   whether someone has significant mental deficiencies that

15   will -- will -- is the kind of evidence that garners

16   sympathy from the jury.

17                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Why is this question

18   properly before us in this case?                The argument that you

19   seem to be making, and it's an argument to which you

20   devote a lot of your brief, seems to be that the -- the

21   State courts unreasonably applied Strickland to the

22   performance of the attorneys at the penalty phase.

23                 Now, that is a, a (d)(1) argument,

24   2254(d)(1).    But the two questions on which cert were

25   granted have to do with findings of fact.                So they have


                                        5

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to do with (d)(2) and (e)(1) and not (d)(1) at all.

 2               MR. SCANLON:        Justice Alito, our primary

 3   argument is a (d)(2) argument, and that is that there

 4   was no strategic decision here, that in fact it was a

 5   failure to investigate in violation of this Court.

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Was (d)(2) raised in

 7   your habeas petition?

 8               MR. SCANLON:        Yes.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Could you give me a

10   citation for that, where in the habeas petition you made

11   a (d)(2) claim as opposed to a (d)(1) claim?

12               MR. SCANLON:        Well, our habeas -- I -- I can

13   get a cite for that, but our habeas petition was all

14   about failing to do an investigation in the State

15   court's findings that there had been a reasonable

16   investigation.   The State court finding, Mr. Chief

17   Justice, is at page 201a and 202a of the petition

18   appendix.

19               And at that point the State courts talk

20   about eight historical facts and they conclude that

21   there was a reasonable investigation of the facts.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That factual

23   determination that you say is unreasonable under (d)(2),

24   that went to deficient performance?

25               MR. SCANLON:        That went to deficient


                                       6

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   performance, of course.

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Did the -- did the

 3   State court make a ruling on prejudice under Strickland?

 4              MR. SCANLON:        The State court did make a

 5   ruling on prejudice.     And it made it on two grounds:                  It

 6   found that he was not mentally retarded, which, of

 7   course, is -- is -- is clearly unreasonable, because you

 8   don't have to be mentally retarded to have it be

 9   valuable evidence to present to the jury.

10              Secondly, they -- they found that the crime

11   was brutal in its nature, even though the trial court

12   had -- had -- had declined to give the instruction that

13   it was cruel and heinous.

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Do you agree that we

15   have to find that it was an unreasonable determination

16   both with respect to performance and with respect to

17   prejudice to get you through the (d)(2) hurdle?

18              MR. SCANLON:        Yes, of course, and I think we

19   can do that, and for the same reason, Mr. Chief Justice,

20   that it was not reasonable in the first place for

21   counsel to decide to stop their investigation.                  That's

22   because the evidence is so powerful.                  This is the most

23   powerful kind of mitigating evidence you can have in

24   this type of case.

25              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Could I take you back to


                                      7

 1   Justice Alito's question?          As I read the lower court

 2   decision, it was saying counsel made a strategic choice

 3   not to pursue any further investigation with respect to

 4   mental health, correct?

 5                 MR. SCANLON:       Correct.

 6                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            All right.   And they

 7   made it on the basis of a number of factors, including

 8   the fact that there was testimony that the two senior

 9   attorneys said:    It's not going to help us if we do or

10   not.   You may disagree with whether or not a strategic

11   decision was made or not, but if one can view the

12   evidence in any way as the attorney having made the

13   decision, isn't your argument that that decision was

14   unreasonable?

15                 MR. SCANLON:       Of course.

16                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            But isn't that what

17   Justice Alito asked you?         That's not a dispute with the

18   factual finding that it was a strategic decision.

19   That's a dispute with the legal -- the legal -- whether

20   that strategic decision met the legal standard of

21   Strickland.

22                 MR. SCANLON:       That's correct.

23                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            All right.   So we're

24   back to Justice Alito's question, which is, isn't that a

25   (d)(1) instead of a (d)(2) argument, and we -- the


                                        8

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   question presented only addressed the strategic

 2   decision.    It didn't address or present the question of

 3   the Strickland question of whether that would have been

 4   a reasonable strategic decision.

 5                MR. SCANLON:        Your Honor, that is our

 6   alternative argument.       Our -- our main argument is a

 7   (d)(2) argument.

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             It might be your

 9   alternative argument, but it's not the question

10   presented.

11                MR. SCANLON:        No, I'm saying the fact

12   question is our primary argument.                 That is how we lost

13   in the Eleventh Circuit.         The Eleventh Circuit made a

14   determination that it was not unreasonable to find that

15   there had been an adequate investigation by these

16   lawyers of a mental health defense.                     That's what the

17   Eleventh Circuit found.

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            When did that come up?          I

19   thought that the facts as the Eleventh Circuit presented

20   them is that the senior lawyer first said:                     We want

21   Dr. Kirkland's report not simply on the question of

22   insanity and incompetence to stand trial, but also to

23   give us leads to mitigating evidence.

24                So mitigation is in his mind about looking

25   into this mental question.           He reads Kirkland's report


                                        9

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   and, for whatever reason, decides this isn't worth

 2   pursuing; this is not going to help us.

 3                 I thought that that's what the Eleventh

 4   Circuit said was the picture, that whether it was an

 5   incompetent, ineffective decision is a separate

 6   question, but as to what happened, why did the

 7   investigation stop, because the senior lawyer said:

 8   Yes, it's relevant to mitigation, but I looked at the

 9   report and I think it's not wise for us to pursue

10   mitigation.

11                 MR. SCANLON:        Justice Ginsburg, that is what

12   the State argues.     That is not what the Eleventh Circuit

13   found.   On pages 56 and 57a of the petition appendix,

14   the Eleventh Circuit clearly makes a finding that there

15   had been a reasonable investigation done of this.

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Where is that?   56?

17                 MR. SCANLON:        Page 56a and page 57a of the

18   petition appendix, which is the Eleventh Circuit

19   decision.     And if you look at page 56a, for example, the

20   Eleventh Circuit framed the issue correctly.                They say:

21   Here the issue becomes, did counsel, before deciding not

22   to present evidence of Wood's borderline intellectual

23   function make reasonable investigation or a reasonable

24   decision that made particular investigations

25   unnecessary?


                                        10

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              And they go on right after that on page 56

 2   and 57 to say that they did a reasonable investigation.

 3   They cite eight historical facts about that

 4   investigation.   Those facts are objectively --

 5              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I'm sorry that I don't

 6   have that appendix with me now, but as I recall the

 7   Eleventh Circuit was not making any independent

 8   determination of its own, but it was reporting what the

 9   senior lawyer -- his view of it.               They were not making a

10   fact-finding as a tribunal.

11              MR. SCANLON:         With all due respect, Justice

12   Ginsburg, if you look at the Eleventh Circuit decision

13   at this critical point, there is no reference to Mr.

14   Dozier, who is the senior lawyer.                What the reference is

15   to are the State court findings, which they say at 57a

16   are amply supported by the record.                Those findings were

17   that they did an investigation, that it was adequate,

18   and in fact, the State has now abandoned that position.

19              The State no longer claims that these

20   lawyers did any investigation at all.                  They claim that

21   they looked at the Kirkland report and made a decision

22   then and there to terminate any investigation, and that

23   -- that of course would be a violation under (d)(1).

24   But you first have to get to the fact issue, whether

25   they did an investigation in the first place.

 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You don't have the cite

 2   for 542 F.3d, that part of the opinion?                It's in

 3   542 F.3d, 1281, but I don't have the particular page.

 4   Okay.

 5                MR. SCANLON:       I'm sorry, I don't have the

 6   F.2d cite.

 7                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Could you clarify one --

 8   could you clarify one thing for me?

 9                I understand that you can understand the

10   record as indicating that they made a reasonable

11   strategic decision not to let that report come in or

12   make these arguments at the guilt stage, but the

13   separate question is whether, did they also decide, make

14   the same decision with respect to the penalty phase?

15   And if they did, were they assuming that the Kirkland

16   report would become a part of the record at the penalty

17   stage as it would have at the guilt stage if it came in?

18                MR. SCANLON:       Well, I think your question is

19   -- is right on point, because what Mr. Dozier was

20   thinking about when he said it didn't merit further

21   inquiry was the guilt phase.

22                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Right.

23                MR. SCANLON:       That's what he was focused on.

24   He -- he designated to Mr. Trotter, the junior lawyer,

25   the penalty phase, and therefore the fact that they

 1   didn't make that decision is clear, because two months

 2   later Mr. Dozier himself is going to the trial court

 3   with Mr. Trotter and asking for psychological

 4   evaluations and other reports.

 5                 Mr. Trotter, before the trial, says:              Your

 6   Honor, we have not investigated this; it needs further

 7   assessment.    So clearly --

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            That, what you said so

 9   far, leaves out one thing; that is, I thought that

10   Dozier had said:    We need, we have to get this Kirkland

11   report, and it's of interest to us for three purposes,

12   the two that were relevant to the guilt phase and the

13   one, mitigation, that was relevant to the penalty phase.

14                 That suggests that in his mind, in Dozier's

15   mind from the start, was both phases, the guilt phase

16   and with respect to mitigation.                And then he looked in

17   the report and, having said, we should see if there's

18   any leads to mitigation, then he next says, we're not

19   going forward with this.

20                 MR. SCANLON:        Well, Justice Ginsburg, the --

21   what Mr. Dozier said at that time was in response to a

22   leading question:      Did you have the penalty phase in

23   mind?   And he said:      Of course.

24                 Now, what he actually did when he requested

25   the Kirkland report was to limit it specifically to


                                        13

 1   competency and insanity, and so -- but even if Mr.

 2   Dozier had that in mind, which I don't think the record

 3   supports -- let's assume that he had that in mind.                When

 4   he got the Kirkland report, it's obvious the State

 5   agrees with it.   This Court's precedents show that

 6   what's in the Kirkland report is an extremely strong

 7   lead.   He has borderline mental functioning.               And

 8   counsel were not able to simply not follow that lead.

 9   Reasonable counsel would have seen that as a green

10   light, not a red light.

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Now this case, for me at

12   least, is terribly confusing, because I thought, reading

13   the cert position, that the Court granted cert to deal

14   with a legal question that has confused the lower

15   courts, that is, what is the relationship between (d)(2)

16   and (e)(1) of AEDPA?

17               MR. SCANLON:        Right.

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Now I read your brief and

19   I hear what you're saying so far.                It seems to be that

20   you have a solid case under (d)(1); that is, that these

21   counsel were ineffective because they did not pursue

22   mental state mitigation.

23               But that would be a much different -- that

24   would be a fact-bound case tied to this record, as apart

25   from the legal question:        What does unreasonable -- the


                                      14
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   (d)(2) unreasonableness, how does it relate to the

 2   (e)(1) presumed correct, clear and convincing evidence?

 3   I thought that that legal question was why we granted

 4   cert.

 5              MR. SCANLON:         And that is very central to

 6   this case, and the reason it's central is because the

 7   Eleventh Circuit got it wrong when they focused on

 8   individual fact-findings, many of which were immaterial

 9   to the claim, instead of looking at the entire State

10   court record, and so we --

11              JUSTICE ALITO:          But that's an entirely

12   different question.      I think that's the question.       Did

13   the validity of the -- the conclusion made by the State

14   courts that there was a strategic decision not to

15   present this evidence until the -- the final judge stage

16   of the -- of the proceeding, and not whether there was a

17   reasonable investigation or whether they -- there was

18   reasonable performance overall at the penalty phase.

19              It's purely this question of the validity of

20   a finding of historical fact and how that is to be

21   evaluated under -- under (d), under (d)(2) and (e)(1).

22              MR. SCANLON:         Right, and, if you look at

23   Eleventh Circuit's opinion, the majority opinion in this

24   case, what they did is, rather than look at the entire

25   record for reasonableness to see if the Petitioner had


                                      15
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   shown that it was not reasonable, what they did was they

 2   looked at individual fact-findings.

 3                 And -- and they said that those are not

 4   rebutted by clear and convincing evidence; therefore,

 5   it's reasonable.    And that's the mistake.

 6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But let's just talk

 7   about the -- the finding of -- by the district court

 8   that there was no strategic reason and the -- and the

 9   disagreement with that in the Federal circuit, and let's

10   talk about it just under (d)(1) -- just under (d)(1).

11                 MR. SCANLON:       Okay.

12                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Would you say that the

13   test is whether or not the -- that finding was clearly

14   erroneous?

15                 MR. SCANLON:       No.

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Is that -- is that another

17   way?

18                 MR. SCANLON:       No.      I think the standard is

19   much more difficult than that.              I think the standard --

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Why -- why is

21   "unreasonable application" different from "clearly

22   erroneous"?

23                 MR. SCANLON:       I think it's -- I think

24   something could be incorrect, but it wouldn't be

25   unreasonable.    I think something could be erroneous, but


                                       16
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   it wouldn't be unreasonable.

 2              I think that Congress made it clear that

 3   (d)(2) was a deferential standard.               It has teeth in it.

 4              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, I'm -- I'm talking

 5   about (d)(1).

 6              MR. SCANLON:        Okay.        Under (d)(1) --

 7              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I-- I beg your -- (d)( 2),

 8   unreasonable determination of facts.

 9              MR. SCANLON:        Right.

10              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Yes.

11              MR. SCANLON:        Right.         And that is that

12   Congress said that a Petitioner has to show, before they

13   can go anywhere in their case, that that is objectively

14   unreasonable.

15              In the prior version of this statute, it was

16   much easier --

17              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So you -- you think there

18   can be findings that are clearly erroneous, but not an

19   unreasonable determination of facts?

20              MR. SCANLON:        I think that this Court,

21   certainly, in the context of (d)(1) has said, in

22   Miller-El, that there is a difference between something

23   being erroneous and something being unreasonable.

24              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I'm talking about (d)(2).

25              MR. SCANLON:        I think it would -- I think it


                                     17
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   would apply there, too.        I think --

 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Because the problem, as

 3   Justice Ginsburg indicated, is that the courts of

 4   appeals are looking for guidance as -- as to when we can

 5   go into -- into these findings and set them aside.

 6               MR. SCANLON:         Right.         Right.

 7               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And it really is very

 8   difficult for me to wear a "clearly erroneous" hat or an

 9   "unreasonable determination of fact."                   I -- I just can't

10   sense any difference there.

11               MR. SCANLON:         I -- I think the key

12   difference is this, Justice Kennedy, and that is that

13   when you have a "clearly erroneous" test -- or under --

14   under (e)(1), you're not looking at the entire factual

15   record.   You're looking at independent fact-findings.

16   And that's where the Court got it wrong in this case.

17   And what this Court needs to do is clarify several

18   things.   One, that (e)(1) does not mean and (d)(2) does

19   not mean that you have to show unreasonableness by clear

20   and convincing evidence.         That's what the Court did in

21   this case, and the Eleventh Circuit has done that in

22   other cases.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:            Do I have it right, in your

24   opinion, so far?   I'm just interested in the

25   relationship between (d) and (e), and as I read it, just


                                       18
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to look at the language, it seems to me, in the (d)

 2   case, we're talking about something that was decided on

 3   a record in a State court.

 4                 And you -- you're the lawyer, trying to get

 5   the Federal judge to say, that's all wrong.                     You're

 6   going to say their facts are wrong, their fact-finding.

 7   So you say:    Judge, that was unreasonable, you know, in

 8   light of the record.      That's what you do under (d)(2)?

 9                 MR. SCANLON:       Correct.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Now, (e) is a different

11   situation.    (E) is a situation where, for some reason or

12   other -- and there are a few -- you are having a new

13   hearing in the Federal court.

14                 One reason for having such a hearing could

15   be that there was a factual predicate that couldn't have

16   been discovered and it's very important.                     So you're get

17   into that Federal court hearing.                And now, when you're

18   in the Federal court hearing it turns out that in the

19   earlier State court hearing there was a fact-finding

20   that has something to do with this.                     It may be not so

21   important, but it's over there and you want to get the

22   judge to ignore it.

23                 So there you have to show what (d)(2) says.

24   You have the burden of saying that that was an

25   unreasonable fact-finding.           That's what it says.            Those


                                       19

                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   different words make -- seem sensible to me because the

 2   proceeding is different, and the way we talk about the

 3   proceedings is a little bit different.                But as a

 4   practical reality, I guess they come to about the same

 5   thing.

 6              All right.       Now, forgetting my last comment,

 7   have I got the first part right as you understand it?

 8              MR. SCANLON:        I think that's right.             If

 9   there's different evidence that's extrinsic to the State

10   court record, that is looked at in the Federal

11   evidentiary proceeding under --

12              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And that's -- that's what

13   the Ninth Circuit position developed by Judge Kozinski.

14              MR. SCANLON:        That --

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The only problem with

16   that, it would shrink the province of (e)(1) very

17   considerably, because overwhelmingly Federal habeas

18   petitioners do not get evidentiary hearings in Federal

19   court.

20              So, if we accept the Ninth Circuit's view of

21   it, then (e) -- (e)(1) applies to a rather small

22   category of cases; i.e., cases in which there is an

23   evidentiary hearing in the Federal habeas proceeding.

24              MR. SCANLON:        But, Justice Ginsburg, (d)(2)

25   requires just as much deference, we believe, because of


                                     20
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the -- the need to show that it's objectively

 2   unreasonable, so --

 3              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               I'm -- I'm not talking

 4   about (d)(2) now.     We're talking about two provisions,

 5   trying to make sense how do they relate to each other.

 6              MR. SCANLON:           Right.

 7              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               And one very

 8   well-presented position is the Ninth Circuit's in Judge

 9   Kozinski's opinion.      My only question is am I right to

10   say that his view, which is your view, would leave very

11   little work for (e)(1) to do if (e)(1) applies only when

12   there's new evidence coming in; it's not just the -- the

13   record that was made in the State court, but new

14   evidence coming in in the Federal habeas.

15              MR. SCANLON:           There's --

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               There are not -- not many

17   cases.

18              MR. SCANLON:           There's less -- there's less

19   work to do, of course.         It's ten percent of the cases or

20   so, but no deference is lost because (e)(1) does not

21   apply to the other 90 percent of the cases, because

22   (d)(2), that standard itself --

23              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               What you're saying is

24   (d)(2) is a vigorous standard, but, yes, your

25   description, unlike the opposing description of the


                                        21
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   relationship between these two --

 2              MR. SCANLON:        Right.

 3              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- does leave for (e)(1)

 4   this maybe 10 percent of the cases, not more.

 5              MR. SCANLON:        And --

 6              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Can I go back to --

 7   just to -- so that we're on the same page in my own

 8   mind, what constitutes the State record?              Because one of

 9   the State amici posited situations in which the record

10   before the State court on the issue that it made its

11   determination would be one subset of evidence, and that,

12   perhaps as the State process developed on another issue

13   there was another record developed, and you're pointing

14   to that evidence in your argument of unreasonableness as

15   a reason for the lower court's decision being wrong.

16              So your use of that other evidence, does

17   that go under (d)(2) or (d)(1)?

18              MR. SCANLON:        The other evidence -- if it --

19   if it's intrinsic to the State court record, then it

20   would be looked at under (d)(2), and the Petitioner

21   would have to show that, looking at all of that

22   evidence, the determination of fact was objectively

23   unreasonable only if the evidence is outside of that.

24   And -- and I think we agree, it's about ten percent of

25   the cases, but that's not insignificant for the role


                                     22
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that (e)(1) plays.

 2               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Does that seem -- does

 3   that seem reasonable, meaning the State court is making

 4   a decision based on what's before it.                   Can't -- it can't

 5   foretell unknown evidence and bring it into its

 6   equation.   So one has to presume that its finding based

 7   on the evidence before it is correct.

 8               If there's additional evidence, whether it's

 9   part of a record that's developed elsewhere, not part of

10   what it based its decision on, and if you look at the

11   language of (d)(2), it talks about the record on the

12   fact determined.   It doesn't talk about on the --

13               MR. SCANLON:         Yes.       And any new evidence

14   would be looked at under the clear and convincing

15   standard, whether that --

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              So you're changing your

17   earlier answer to me?       You're going closer to what the

18   amici were suggesting, which is that record has to be

19   defined narrowly, it has to be the facts before the

20   court?

21               MR. SCANLON:         No.      I -- I understood your

22   question to mean that the facts were part of a State

23   court determination.      It just wasn't the first one.

24   There were two different determinations, but they were

25   both in the State court proceeding.

 1              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                I'm not sure I

 2   understand that, meaning often a trial court is

 3   presented with evidence that determines something.                         This

 4   was a strategic choice.         It may be that later the State

 5   court has a hearing on that question, but it may be that

 6   it has a hearing on a different question altogether.

 7              MR. SCANLON:           Right, but --

 8              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                And you're using the

 9   evidence on the other question.

10              MR. SCANLON:           And if it's within the State

11   court record, it is looked at under (d)(2).

12              And if I may reserve the remainder of my

13   time?

14              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Could I ask a question?

15   Maybe you need a little extra time.                      I want to be sure I

16   understand one thing.        What is your view of what the

17   unreasonable determination of facts was in this case,

18   either the decision not to go forward with further

19   investigation or that the results of the investigation

20   would not have been -- would have been -- would have

21   been prejudicial?

22              MR. SCANLON:           Well, those are both

23   unreasonable determinations of fact.                      The first one,

24   that they did an investigation, is what the Eleventh

25   Circuit ruled.   The State in this Court on the merits

 1   brief changed its position and no longer argues that

 2   they did an investigation, but they now say:                      We made a

 3   decision because Kirkland report was a red light, we

 4   made a decision not to go forward.                  That is also

 5   unreasonable.

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

 8               ORAL ARGUMENT OF COREY L. MAZE

 9                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

10              MR. MAZE:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11   please the Court:

12              Based on the Court's questioning so far, I

13   believe that I, as did every amicus, believe the

14   questions presented in this case are the actual

15   questions listed in the petition.                  So unless this Court

16   has an objection, I'm going to focus on the (d)(2)

17   question and how it interplays with (e)(1).                      And I would

18   like to start with Justice Ginsburg's point about why

19   the Ninth Circuit opinion is wrong.                      And other than the

20   plain language, which was what we've discussed in the

21   brief --

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               I -- I didn't --

23              MR. MAZE:         I --

24              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               I just want -- I just

25   described the Ninth Circuit decision.                      I didn't say it


                                        25

 1   was wrong.

 2                MR. MAZE:      I apologize.                You're correct.   I

 3   would say it's wrong.

 4                (Laughter.)

 5                MR. MAZE:      Because not only does it ignore

 6   the plain language and, the point you made that it would

 7   be 90 to 99 percent of the time it would cut it out, the

 8   problem is is that position misses the bigger picture.

 9   (E)(1) doesn't only apply when we're looking at (d)(2)

10   claims.   In fact, (d)(2) claims are a very, very small

11   percentage of what the States deal with in habeas work.

12   Typically what we're dealing with are (d)(1) claims or

13   claims that weren't even adjudicated on the merits in

14   the State court.   Let's say it was procedurally barred

15   in the State court and we're looking at the procedural

16   default rule.

17                If you're looking at applying the rule that

18   Judge Kozinski has forwarded in the Ninth Circuit, they

19   would say that (e)(1) is completely eviscerated if there

20   is no extrinsic evidence, even if we're looking at a

21   (d)(1) claim and even if we're looking at a procedurally

22   barred claim.   So --

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, isn't it --

24   isn't it the case that under (d)(1) or (d)(2) that's a

25   threshold determination, and once you get over that


                                       26

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   (e)(1) would have work to do in determining whether

 2   there was a violation of the Constitution or laws in the

 3   first place?

 4                 MR. MAZE:      Yes, (e)(1) is always going to

 5   have an application.       We would say that it has an

 6   application at the moment the petition is filed.                     That

 7   is, every single subsidiary finding of fact is presumed

 8   to be true.    Let's take a (d)(1) example, Terry Williams

 9   v. Taylor.     This Court said that you could overcome the

10   (d)(1) bar in Terry Williams because they had applied

11   the wrong law, they had applied Lockhart to Strickland's

12   prejudice inquiry.     So you jumped over the (d)(1) bar.

13                 At that point you look at the claim de novo.

14   But (e)(1) still has application.                  Its application is --

15   is every finding of fact that the State court made that

16   goes towards the prejudice determination is presumed to

17   be correct.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That's under --

19   you've given yourself an easier case because you're

20   going -- you're getting over the threshold under (d)(1).

21                 MR. MAZE:      Correct.

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                The problem is

23   (d)(2) refers to determination of facts --

24                 MR. MAZE:      Yes.

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- and asks whether


                                        27

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   it's unreasonable.     (E)(1) talks about facts and has a

 2   whole different test, and I -- I guess the difficulty

 3   I've had is -- is reconciling the two.                      To the extent

 4   you can articulate their differences, why would you do

 5   both?

 6               MR. MAZE:        And that is the difficulty.

 7   Again, (d)(2) is very limited, the times we use it.                         But

 8   yes, it is tough because you see both a "clear and

 9   convincing" and an "objectively unreasonable" standard.

10   But the way to fix the problem is not to cut (e)(1) out

11   altogether for every type of claim.                      It's to try to find

12   a way to be able to work (e)(1) and the (d)(2) standard

13   together.

14               JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, what's an example?

15               MR. MAZE:        Let's take this case --

16               JUSTICE BREYER:             I can't think of any --

17   give me an example --

18               MR. MAZE:        Yes.

19               JUSTICE BREYER:             -- where you're trying to

20   proceed under (d)(2), and (e)(1) is somehow relevant.

21   Couldn't think of one.

22               MR. MAZE:        Let's take -- let's take this

23   case, for example.     Let's switch the facts just a little

24   bit and let's say that the State court had made four

25   findings of fact.     The first one is all three counsel


                                        28

                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   read the Kirkland report.

 2              JUSTICE BREYER:           Uh-huh.

 3              MR. MAZE:      The second fact is that all three

 4   counsel talk to each other for 4 days about the Kirkland

 5   report.

 6              JUSTICE BREYER:           Uh-huh.

 7              MR. MAZE:      The third fact is Carey Dozier,

 8   lead counsel, made the decision not to seek another

 9   evaluation; and the fourth fact is is that Carey Dozier,

10   lead counsel, decided not to present the Kirkland report

11   or similar evidence to the jury.              Those are your four

12   facts that are presumed correct under (e)(1).

13              JUSTICE BREYER:           No.      You just look at them,

14   and you look under (d)(2), and you say this is an

15   unreasonable determination of fact, period.              There's no

16   reason to go into (e)(1).        I mean, if it is an

17   unreasonable determination of fact, he wins.

18              MR. MAZE:      The reason --

19              JUSTICE BREYER:           And if it isn't, you win.

20              MR. MAZE:      The reason that you go under

21   (e)(1) is because Congress has said that you have to.

22              JUSTICE BREYER:           It didn't say that.      What

23   it says in (e)(1) is (e)(1) is talking about in a

24   proceeding instituted by an application by a person in

25   custody, the factual issue is presumed correct.              But if


                                     29
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   you fail to develop -- - you know, in a proceeding, it's

 2   presumed correct.

 3                 You're right it doesn't say it literally.

 4   But I can't figure out an application for it unless

 5   they're talking about where there is a new hearing.

 6   Otherwise there is just no need for it, it is just

 7   repetitive and it gets people mixed up, and (d)(2) does

 8   all the work.

 9                 MR. MAZE:      Again, the problem is, is because

10   we're looking at an (e)(1)-(d)(2) situation, but that's

11   not the only situation.

12                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, let me give you an

13   example involving exactly those two provisions and facts

14   very similar to the facts here.                The State court finds

15   that a strategic decision was made, and that raises a

16   question under (d)(2):         Was the State court's rejection

17   of the Strickland claim the result of a decision that

18   was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts

19   in light of the evidence presented in the State court

20   proceeding?

21                 There are also a host of subsidiary findings

22   of historical fact because the attorneys testify and

23   documents are produced, and there are conflicts in the

24   testimony.    And so there's a question of did -- did

25   Dozier and Ralph talk about this on a particular day?


                                        30
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Did Trotter write a letter to so-and-so?                And so forth.

 2   So you've got all these subsidiary -- all these findings

 3   of historical fact, and they are to be reviewed under

 4   (e)(1), under the plain language of (e)(1).

 5                 MR. MAZE:     Right.

 6                 JUSTICE ALITO:         And then after they're

 7   reviewed under the plain language of (e)(1), you turn to

 8   the question under (d)(2), which is whether the decision

 9   about whether there was a strategic decision was based

10   on -- based on an unreasonable determination of facts.

11                 MR. MAZE:     Correct.          And Justice --

12                 JUSTICE ALITO:         So there's no conflict.

13                 MR. MAZE:     No.      And Justice Alito, if -- the

14   way you said it is exactly where I was going with my

15   hypothetical.    But --

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:          I see that, I see that.

17                 MR. MAZE:     The fourth --

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:          That's a possible way to

19   look at it.

20                 MR. MAZE:     Yes.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:          And the problem I see with

22   that -- now I see why it's controverted, but the problem

23   with these standards of review, it just -- it mixes

24   people up, and it sounds as if you're bringing in a

25   hammer after you've brought in a saw, and the hammer


                                       31
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   looks a little tougher than the saw, and -- but why get

 2   into all this business?

 3               MR. MAZE:      Because I would come back with

 4   the saying that this is almost like having, because

 5   (d)(2) is so limited in what we do, you have a toe ache

 6   but you're asking us to cut the leg completely off.              I

 7   mean, there's a much broader use of (e)(1) --

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I don't understand that.

 9   I thought that your -- your position in this case or at

10   least one of your positions is there was no unreasonable

11   determination of fact.       Period.

12               MR. MAZE:      Correct.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            If you're right about

14   that then you win, and there's no reason in the world to

15   go on to (e)(1), that this case in your view should be

16   totally governed by (d)(2), that is, the determinations

17   of fact were reasonable.        End of case.

18               MR. MAZE:      That is not the position we took.

19   That position is what the Court ended up doing in Rice

20   v.   Collins, saying that even if we don't answer the

21   question, the State wins.         And you could do the same

22   thing here, too, that the strategic decision, finding of

23   fact is not unreasonable.         But we're trying to help the

24   Court find a way to make (e)(1) and (d)(2) work

25   together.

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, we have one here, and

 2   my real objection, I guess -- and it's interesting, I

 3   now see the conflict, with Justice Alito's clear

 4   explanation of it.    And I -- I suppose the -- the thing

 5   I would ask you then is, look, my objection to it,

 6   hypothetically, is it's too complicated.                  Lawyers have

 7   enough trouble trying to figure this out.

 8               MR. MAZE:      I agree.

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:           Is there any reason we need

10   to interpret it that way?         The language doesn't have to

11   be.   Why not have just a simple, clear thing?                If -- if

12   they're unreasonable, the State loses, and if they're

13   not unreasonable, the State wins.                Da-da.   That's too

14   simple.   But why not use it?

15               MR. MAZE:      If the Court would come back and

16   say that (e)(1) applies when the petition is filed and

17   that if you're outside the (d)(2) claim -- (e)(1) is not

18   tethered to the introduction of extrinsic evidence, it

19   simply applies.

20               But then you came back and said in the

21   limited circumstances in which we have a (d)(2) claim --

22   not a (d)(1) or a procedurally barred claim, but a

23   (d)(2) claim -- if the Court came back and said we're

24   going to treat objectionably unreasonable as the

25   equivalent of clear and convincing evidence -- that


                                      33
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   means if you can prove that something is objectively

 2   unreasonable, it also proves by clear and convincing

 3   evidence it's wrong -- then that would not be a problem.

 4              But again, what we're saying to the Court

 5   is, is if you say that, you need to also say that (e)(1)

 6   is still not tethered to extrinsic evidence --

 7   evidentiary hearings, because (e)(1) applies in a much

 8   broader scope that just the (d)(2) question.

 9              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Counsel, you don't

10   really want us to say that, because unreasonable, as

11   we've defined it in (d)(1), means it could be wrong, but

12   still not unreasonable.

13              MR. MAZE:       Correct.

14              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              So if we say that proof

15   of a -- by clear and convincing evidence that a decision

16   by the State court was incorrect, you can't equate --

17   you don't really want us equating that with (d)(2), do

18   you?

19              MR. MAZE:       No.      Let me -- let me be clear.

20   I was asking Justice Breyer's question about how he

21   could write it.   I agree that our --

22              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              That's why he -- that's

23   why he starting --

24              MR. MAZE:       -- right.

25              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              -- from, I think what


                                      34

 1   he's saying is, what your adversary responded to Justice

 2   Ginsburg, unreasonable really is much broader than clear

 3   and convincing --

 4               MR. MAZE:        Correct.

 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               -- evidence on

 6   correctness.    You don't need it because whether the

 7   decision is right or wrong is not the issue.                    Even if

 8   it's wrong, it could still be reasonably wrong.

 9               MR. MAZE:        Yes.

10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I mean, one could

11   quarrel with that proposition, but that's the state of

12   the law.   So, why do you need (e)(1)?                   That's -- that's

13   Justice Breyer's question, as I understand it.

14               MR. MAZE:        I agree.          And, again, my position

15   is just what Justice Alito had said earlier, that's the

16   step-by-step way that we would approach it.                    That is the

17   way --

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               But work it out in

19   theory, okay?

20               MR. MAZE:        Work it out in theory.

21               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Work it out in theory.

22   There are -- you see, the difficulty with this case

23   is --

24               MR. MAZE:        I did.

25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               -- one factual matter,

 1   was a strategic decision made?

 2               MR. MAZE:      Right.

 3               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             There are a bunch of

 4   subsidiary facts that -- that were made.

 5               MR. MAZE:      Right.

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             If you're applying

 7   (d)(2), the Court would look at all the subsidiary facts

 8   and decide not whether they were correct or not, but

 9   whether they were unreasonably incorrect, okay?                  If they

10   weren't unreasonably incorrect?              So you don't have to

11   get to the correctness question by clear and convincing

12   evidence.   If they're -- if they're not unreasonably

13   incorrect, the four subsidiary facts would then support

14   the fifth general question, correct?

15               MR. MAZE:      Correct.

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Either we agree it does

17   or it doesn't, but -- I -- I -- I don't understand why

18   you need (e)(1) because you never need to get to the

19   correctness of the finding.

20               MR. MAZE:      If I could finish the

21   hypothetical earlier, I think I can show how (e)(1) and

22   (d)(2) can both have effect in the same case.

23               Again, we talked about the four facts that

24   might lead to the strategic decision.                  Let's say that

25   the State court record proves by clear and convincing


                                      36
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   evidence that the three counsel never spoke to each

 2   other at all about the Kirkland report, and that has

 3   been proved wrong by clear and convincing evidence, but

 4   you have the other three subsidiary findings of fact.

 5              Then you go to (d)(2).                You ask is an

 6   objectionably unreasonable determination of the facts,

 7   facts plural, which is how (d)(2) works, to say that a

 8   strategic decision was made?           Well, the answer would be,

 9   no, it's not objectionably unreasonable, because we

10   still know it's presumed correct that Mr. Dozier read

11   the report and he made the decision.                  So --

12              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Let me just interrupt

13   because I am trying to follow this here.                  The four facts

14   you have described would -- would support a conclusion

15   that it was not unreasonable to make a strategic

16   decision not to use the report at the guilt phase trial.

17   But what if one believes that it would have been

18   unreasonable not to pursue the investigation and --

19   and -- and to find out more facts for the penalty phase

20   trial, and the -- the -- the State court said, no, those

21   facts have answered the case.

22              Would the unreasonable use of the reasonable

23   facts violate the statute?

24              MR. MAZE:      That would be (d)(1).               If you --

25              JUSTICE STEVENS:            That's exactly right.


                                     37
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                MR. MAZE:      Correct.

 2                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Would that violate (d)(1)

 3   if even -- even if every one of the subsidiary facts was

 4   correctly filed and the conclusion drawn by the court

 5   was also correct, that it was a reasonable strategic

 6   decision at the guilt phase but unreasonable at the

 7   penalty phase?    How did -- what is the answer there?

 8                MR. MAZE:      The answer would than under 2254

 9   (d)(1) you could overcome the habeas bar for penalty

10   phase because you have shown an unreasonable application

11   of Strickland to the facts that we have shown to be

12   correct.    Again, we don't believe that's the question

13   presented, but the (d)(2) question is whether a

14   strategic decision was factually made.                  And if I may --

15                JUSTICE STEVENS:            It also has to involve

16   what the strategic decision was?

17                MR. MAZE:      Yes.       And -- and in this case,

18   the factual finding, the strategic decision was twofold.

19   The strategic decision was not to seek a further mental

20   health evaluation after reading and conferring about the

21   Kirkland report and not to introduce the Kirkland report

22   or similar evidence to the penalty phase jury.                  That's

23   the question of historical fact that you're making under

24   (d)(2).    And that determination of historical fact we

25   can show by the record is not objectively unreasonable.

 1                And if I may, I would like to move to

 2   Justice Ginsburg's questions earlier about what in the

 3   record or her point about what in the record shows that

 4   Mr. Dozier was actually thinking about the penalty phase

 5   when he made the decision.          And there are four parts of

 6   the record that show he specifically had the penalty

 7   phase in mind when he made the decision.

 8                The first is what Justice Ginsburg had

 9   pointed out, is that when he sought the penalty phase

10   about the -- the competency report, the Kirkland report,

11   on page 150 of the Joint Appendix he testified that one

12   reason was the fact he wanted mitigating evidence.

13                The second piece of evidence --

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Somebody said it was put

15   in his mouth, the question was on cross-examination.

16                MR. MAZE:     Well, point two was not put in

17   his mouth.   Point two is page 140 of the Joint Appendix.

18   He was specifically asked, do you -- did you call any

19   witnesses in mitigation?        And his answer was, I don't

20   recall.   I know that we talked a lot to psychologists

21   and so forth.

22                The specific question was, do you remember

23   talking to any witnesses for mitigation purposes.            And

24   the first thing that Mr. Dozier remembered was we did

25   talk to psychologists for mitigation purposes.


                                      39
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              The clearest piece of evidence is page 283

 2   of the Joint Appendix, and that is quote where Trotter

 3   is asked about the Kilby -- I mean the Taylor Harden

 4   report from Dr. Kirkland, and the part we keep quoting

 5   is the fact he said that Cary Dozier came and told me

 6   that we didn't need a further evaluation.

 7              But what we haven't put in the brief and

 8   brought up until now is the rest of the quote.                Again,

 9   it's on page 283 of the Joint Appendix.                And he starts

10   off right after the dash saying he, meaning Cary Dozier,

11   determined that we didn't need any further evaluators

12   and no further recall because in the course of my

13   preparation, "my" being Trotter, in course of my

14   preparation for the penalty phase I would read things

15   about different psychological evaluations and had raised

16   that to him.   And again he looked at the report and

17   thought that that wouldn't be needed.

18              So at the moment Cary Dozier made the

19   decision and told to it Trotter, it was specifically

20   because Trotter had come to him and said, I am getting

21   ready for the penalty phase, just as I was told.               I have

22   been reading things about having mental health

23   evaluations.

24              On the page before, 282, he has just said

25   that, I could see issues, but because I was the young


                                      40

 1   attorney, I relied on the senior attorneys to resolve

 2   them.

 3              So he goes to Cary Dozier and says I have

 4   read all of these things about mental health evaluations

 5   for the penalty phase, should we do another one?        And

 6   Cary Dozier, lead counsel of 22 years, criminal

 7   experience on both sides, says, I have read the Kirkland

 8   report, we do not need a further evaluation.

 9              It was the very next month that counsel

10   filed a motion to exclude all psychological evidence,

11   and the reason was, as Mr. Trotter told the trial court

12   in the trial court record on pages 2 -- of 72 and 73, we

13   don't want the State to introduce evidence that he is

14   prone to violent behavior, prone to violent behavior

15   being the quote.   And the trial court asked Mr. Trotter

16   what evidence do you have that the State will do that?

17   He said the report that was done at Taylor Harden, that

18   being Dr. Kirkland's report.

19              So, here we are six weeks before trial they

20   are fighting to exclude evidence that he is prone to

21   violent behavior and specifically referring to the

22   Kirkland report.   Again, because the very month before

23   Cary Dozier had told Trotter we will not have another

24   evaluation done because I have read the Kirkland report

25   and we are not going to do it any further.

 1                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Can I stop you just for

 2   a factual clarification?

 3                 MR. MAZE:      Yeah.

 4                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Did the defendant's

 5   prior history with his other girlfriend come into the

 6   penalty stage of the trial?

 7                 MR. MAZE:      No, at the trial it did not.            And

 8   in fact, the State --

 9                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So this was a wise

10   strategic decision, perhaps, with respect to the penalty

11   phase?

12                 MR. MAZE:      Absolutely.

13                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             It did come in at the

14   trial -- at the sentencing phase, correct?

15                 MR. MAZE:      Are you talking about in front of

16   the judge?

17                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             In front of the jury.

18                 MR. MAZE:      No, the jury never found out

19   about it, because Trotter and Dozier fought to keep it

20   out.     And, in fact, had the Kirkland report been

21   admitted or had counsel followed --

22                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             We're not arguing about

23   the penalty phase.     The issue is if the trial judge at

24   sentencing did hear about the prior assaulted behavior

25   anyway, what would have been the strategic decision not


                                        42
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to pursue further evaluations because they -- there's no

 2   likelihood in my mind that similar assaultive behavior

 3   was ever going to be kept out of the sentencing phase.

 4   That's true, isn't it?      That's one of the strongest

 5   aggravating factors that you could prove, correct?

 6              MR. MAZE:      Right.        I think your point is, is

 7   that there was no way they were could prevent the jury

 8   from hearing about the other sort of violent behavior he

 9   had except for keeping out the mental health.

10              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             The sentencing --

11              MR. MAZE:      Jury.        The penalty phase jury --

12              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             -- jury.    Not the

13   penalty phase?

14              MR. MAZE:      Correct.

15              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So that's really -- I

16   think that was Justice Stevens' question, which was,

17   what was the strategic basis of a decision not to pursue

18   mental health information when everything you wanted to

19   keep out of the penalty phase would be coming at the

20   sentencing phase anyway?

21              MR. MAZE:      Let me see if I'm understanding

22   the question correctly.      You're saying that let's assume

23   that it was strategic not to allow the jury that gives

24   the advisory verdict that can turn into a mitigating

25   circumstance the ability to find out about the previous


                                     43
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   assault and all of his other prior assaults, but not to

 2   seek a further evaluation in time for the judge, who

 3   makes the ultimate sentence, that's your question?

 4              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               That's the question.

 5              MR. MAZE:        All right.            Under Alabama law,

 6   you have one trial.      You have the expert witnesses

 7   testify in front of the jury.             The time gap between the

 8   judge hearing it and the jury making their initial

 9   penalty phase advisory verdict is simply so a

10   presentence investigation report can be made.

11              In this case, the presentence investigation

12   report was made.   The two prior psychological

13   evaluations were attached to it by our Rule 26.3.

14   It's -- let me be honest.          It is an open question under

15   Alabama law whether you can present new witnesses and

16   new evidence in front of the sentencing judge.

17              The Alabama courts, in a case called Boyd v.

18   State, and I will give you the cite, it's 746 So.2nd

19   364, and the pinpoint is 398, had said counsel cannot be

20   ineffective for failing to put on new witnesses and new

21   experts in front of the sentencing judge because our

22   statute doesn't give you the opportunity, doesn't allow

23   for it.

24              All that the sentencing hearing in front of

25   the judge is for is for the judge to allow counsel to


                                       44
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   give a final argument after the presentence

 2   investigation report has come in and counsel has ensured

 3   that it's correct.

 4               We have had a Federal district court say

 5   that, I believe that's unconstitutional, I don't think

 6   you should be allowed to prevent counsel from presenting

 7   new evidence in front of the judge, in the way you're

 8   suggesting; but, again, that's open -- it's an open

 9   question.

10               The point here is, though, that's not the

11   claim that was adjudicated in front of the state court,

12   and, again, this is AEDPA 2254(d).                The only merits

13   determination made by the State court and, thus, the

14   only thing this court can hold the State court in error

15   for, is whether or not there was a strategic decision to

16   withhold it from the jury and whether that question is

17   prejudicial because what you would have to do --

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            That -- that brings us to

19   the point of beginning.       And could you give me, in

20   summary form, your best interpretation of both (d) and

21   (e), (d)(1), (d)(2), (e)(1), in light of the deference

22   that the Federal courts should pay to State

23   determinations?

24               It seems to me that, if you use -- if you

25   reserve (e)(1) for cases in which there's a hearing in


                                      45
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the District Court, then it's somewhat counterintuitive

 2   because the strongest standard applies to the accused.

 3   He has the greatest burden, when the State hearing was

 4   the least effective.

 5              On the other hand, if they overlap, there --

 6   then (d)(2) is often superfluous, so I have a choice of

 7   something that is counterintuitive or superfluous, and I

 8   don't know which one to take.

 9              MR. MAZE:      I agree.          If --

10              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And -- and -- but maybe

11   there is -- is some more general theory that you can

12   give me.

13              MR. MAZE:      There is.

14              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Res judicata doesn't work.

15              MR. MAZE:      Right.

16              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Although I think Congress

17   might have had something like that in mind.

18              MR. MAZE:      If I may, let me give you the way

19   we see (e)(1) working on a broader scope.             And we ran

20   into the problem that Mr. Chief Justice had mentioned

21   earlier, about how (e)(1) applies to (d)(2).

22              Here's how we believe (e)(1) works

23   altogether under AEDPA:      A petition is filed.         At the

24   moment that petition is filed, all subsidiary findings

25   of fact are presumed correct under (e)(1).             The next

 1   question you should answer should be will extrinsic

 2   evidence come in, either under Rule 7 through

 3   affidavits, et cetera, under Rule 8 in evidentiary

 4   hearing.

 5               If the answer to the question is, yes, we

 6   will accept extrinsic evidence, then you accept the

 7   extrinsic evidence, and you have the question this Court

 8   couldn't answer last year in Bell v. Kelly.            How does

 9   2254(d) work after that?

10               Now, let's say that you answer the question,

11   no, you will not have extrinsic evidence, which is the

12   case you have here, and you move over the 2251(d) bars.

13   If they're only arguing (d)(1), you don't have a problem

14   because you simply look at the application.

15               The problem runs in when you have a (d)(2)

16   claim with new extrinsic evidence -- with no extrinsic

17   evidence.   Excuse me.     The way I think that it should

18   work and the way it will work all the way down the line,

19   no matter how the Court comes to it, is to say that the

20   smaller subsidiary findings of fact are presumed correct

21   until, in this case, the record evidence shows that

22   they're clear and convincingly wrong.

23               An example of that would be Miller-El 2.              In

24   Miller-El 2, you found that the state record evidence

25   proved that defining that there was sexual abuse in


                                      47
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the -- in the State court records was proved wrong by

 2   clear and convincing evidence.

 3               At that point, you can say, well, it's also

 4   a (d)(2) violation because it's objectively

 5   unreasonable.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Can I -- can I suggest --

 7   it doesn't seem to me there's any -- any contradiction

 8   between the two.   (E)(1) addresses a factual finding.

 9   (D)(2), on the other hand, addresses the decision of the

10   Court, which was based on, sometimes, just one factual

11   finding, but, sometimes, many.

12               So you -- you proceed, first, with (e)(1),

13   and you -- you ask whether each factual finding on which

14   the decision was based was shown by the defendant,

15   either in the record, or if -- if you have an additional

16   hearings, by new evidence, to be incorrect by clear and

17   convincing evidence.      You do that fact-by-fact.

18               Having found, let's say, two of the five

19   facts.   To fail that test, you then go up to (d)(2) and

20   say, okay, in light of the fact that two of the facts --

21   in light of the fact -- since two of the facts that the

22   court relied on were false, was the decision vitiated by

23   that reason, or was it nonetheless a reasonable

24   determination?

25               I mean, once you focus on the fact that


                                       48
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   (e)(1) applies to facts and (d)(2) applies to the

 2   decision, it's whether the decision was -- was based on

 3   an unreasonable determination of the facts.

 4              MR. MAZE:       I think that, in two minutes,

 5   you've said it better than I did --

 6              JUSTICE BREYER:            If that's so, why would we

 7   not soon have what I call the habeas corpus

 8   jurisprudence of what is a subsidiary and what is a

 9   major fact and what is a finding?

10              And what's wonderful about that is no habeas

11   corpus proceeding will ever end because, throughout the

12   country, people will make mistakes about what is the --

13   what is the subsidiary and the subsidiary to the

14   subsidiary, and then what is the more general, and

15   pretty soon, we'll have all -- everybody will be arguing

16   about that, and there will only be four professors in

17   the country who understand which is which, and they will

18   each say different things.

19              MR. MAZE:       I -- I would disagree.        I think

20   the district courts can handle that question.            I

21   don't -- I don't -- I mean, they've been handling it

22   since AEDPA came out in '96.

23              I see that my time is almost through.              I

24   want to make --

25              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, I don't think


                                      49
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   they've been handling it.         I think there's a tremendous

 2   confusion, and I -- I find it very difficult to write an

 3   opinion to give them guidance as to when they can set

 4   aside hearings, to what extent they have to review the

 5   entire record.

 6               To me, I think many courts of appeals and

 7   district of -- and district courts think that it's just

 8   like a clearly erroneous standard.                It's very hard to --

 9   to use these standards to give you any concrete guidance

10   in this specific case.

11               MR. MAZE:      I agree.          It's difficult, but

12   again, that's why we're saying just use the plain

13   language.   Look at the smaller subsidiary findings of

14   fact, to see whether or not you can rebut the

15   presumption, and, as Justice Scalia said, you look at

16   the overall decision and see if it was based on a

17   determination of facts, a larger bundle of facts, to see

18   whether or not it was unreasonable.

19               Again, my time is about to run out.               I want

20   to make one final point.        Mr. Scanlon has said that

21   prejudice also has a 2254(d) bar in it in this case, and

22   we agree with that because there was a merits

23   adjudication on prejudice.

24               I would simply might like to make the point,

25   regardless of how the Court comes out on the (d)(2)


                                      50
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   question on deficient performance, it cannot overcome

 2   the 2250(d) bar for prejudice here because, again,

 3   simply knowing that someone had the low IQ and had a low

 4   grammar school kind of education level, we are in the

 5   unique position where the sentencer actually knew that.

 6               So we have a very large insight into what

 7   the sentencer would have done.            There's no -- it's not

 8   objectively unreasonable to believe the sentencer would

 9   have done, again, what he had done the first time had he

10   heard similar facts.

11               So, if the Court has no further questions, I

12   will cede my time to the Court.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, General.

14               MR. MAZE:     Thank you.

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Mr. Scanlon, you

16   have three minutes remaining, but I'll give you more,

17   since I would like to start with a question.               My first

18   question was whether your petition was under (d)(2), and

19   during the argument, I went back and looked at the

20   petition.

21               And I see the exact language of (d)(1)

22   quoted in paragraphs 45, 52, 58, 63, 71, 76, 82, 90, 94,

23   97, and 104, (d)(1), and, unless I'm missing it, nowhere

24   do I see the language of (d)(2).              I see the language of

25   (d)(2) in your cert petition questions.


                                     51
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                Now, I think there's a huge difference

 2   between (d)(1) and (d)(2).           We've been talking about

 3   (d)(2) in a case that was only brought under (d)(1).

 4               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KERRY A. SCANLON

 5                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 6                MR. SCANLON:        Well, it was brought -- with

 7   all due respect, Mr. Chief Justice, under (d)(2), as

 8   well, because the central focus was the factual

 9   allegation, the factual findings made by the State

10   court.   That's what the petition was based on, and

11   that's --

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Is the language --

13   but then I -- you knew to quote the language of (d)(1).

14   You did it -- I think it's more than a dozen times.                 You

15   never quoted the language of (d)(2).

16                Now, going back, you can say, well, we talk

17   about these facts or those facts, but that is also

18   relevant to the application question under (d)(1).

19                MR. SCANLON:        But there were -- there was

20   language about unreasonable application -- unreasonable

21   determination of the fact.           That was always part of the

22   petition.    That's what was focused on.

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, yes, I find it

24   hard for you to -- to understand how you can say it was

25   focused on when you quote (d)(1) twelve times and never


                                       52
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   quote (d)(2).     It would seem to me that the focus was on

 2   (d)(1).

 3                 MR. SCANLON:        Well, I think the focus was on

 4   both.     And these cases, they're inextricably linked

 5   together as well, because these determinations of

 6   whether something is strategic is not only a factual

 7   determination, but it's a determination that has legal

 8   principles under Strickland and Wiggins and Williams.

 9                 But another thing I would like to say, in

10   answer to Justice Kennedy's question, is (d)(2) should

11   never be made superfluous in this, because that is the

12   primary provision in this statute.                  It calls for looking

13   at the entire State record.             It's a very strong

14   deference standard.      (E)(1) has its application, but it

15   would be incredibly complicated for this Court to tell

16   lower courts to apply (e)(1) on top of (e)(2).

17                 And Justice Alito, in your example, the

18   problem in this case was that they looked at subsidiary

19   facts; half of them were immaterial to the claim

20   completely.    And then the State court jumped from the

21   fact that those were not rebutted by clear and

22   convincing evidence to deciding immediately that

23   everything was therefore reasonable.

24                 And that's why the courts have had a hard

25   time with this standard, is AEDPA is hard enough to


                                        53

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   understand as it is, but if they are asked to put in a

 2   correctness standard on top of a reasonableness

 3   standard, and then you've got the difficulty of defining

 4   what's a subsidiary finding, and Justice Scalia, the

 5   points you made, it's actually very difficult, because

 6   (e)(1) focuses on the determination of a factual issue.

 7   (D)(2) focuses on the determination of the facts.                 It's

 8   not a decision in (d)(2); it's the determination of the

 9   facts.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          No, no, no.       It resulted in

11   a decision that was based on an unreasonable

12   determination of facts.

13                 MR. SCANLON:       Right, and what the Court --

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          It focuses on the decision,

15   whether the decision could have been reached --

16                 MR. SCANLON:       Right.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          -- without the use of any

18   facts that had been found to be false.

19                 MR. SCANLON:       Right, but in every (d)(2)

20   case this Court has considered from the lower courts,

21   what they focus on is whether it's an unreasonable

22   determination, as opposed to focusing on the word

23   "decision."    And I think --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Do you think there's

25   a difference between a (d)(1) case and a (d)(2) case?

 1                 MR. SCANLON:       Yes, there is.          But in this

 2   case, I want to make it clear that whatever the standard

 3   the Court adopts in this case, the Petitioner has

 4   clearly made its case, because there was evidence.                 They

 5   never did any investigation when they had this strong

 6   lead.   And Strickland and Wiggins, if they mean

 7   anything, means that you have to make an informed

 8   decision after an investigation.                And in this case there

 9   was no investigation.

10                 They now concede that, and there was no

11   reasonable decision made that the investigation should

12   be limited.    And the Eleventh Circuit got that right.

13   They simply found the wrong facts.

14                 Thank you.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, Counsel.

16   The case is submitted.

17                 (Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the

18   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
