 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Case 12-123, Horne v. Department

 5   of Agriculture.

 6                  Mr. McConnell?

 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9                  MR. McCONNELL:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may

10   it please the Court:

11                  There's a surprising number of difficult

12   merits questions lurking in this case, mostly involving

13   whether there was a taking, and if so, how it should be

14   conceptualized and valued.

15                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Could I -- could I just

16   stop you on a factual matter -

17                  MR. McCONNELL:            Certainly.

18                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               -- because it has

19   confused me.     As I look at the captions of the cases,

20   there appear to be two different partnerships:                       One

21   partnership, known as Raisin -- doing business as Raisin

22   Valley Farms, has Mr. Horne and his wife as the

23   partners.

24                  Larsen Valley, the producer -- not the

25   producer, the handler -- has four other, the Hornes,

                                         3

 1   plus two other people.          So who owns the raisins?                Isn't

 2   that the first partnership of the husband and wife?                        And

 3   isn't the handler a second partnership that does the

 4   business of handling?

 5               MR. McCONNELL:               The other two partners in

 6   Lassen were Laura Horne's parents, now deceased.

 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  But the estates have

 8   been substituted.

 9               MR. McCONNELL:               Substituted.          That's right.

10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  So isn't it two legal

11   entities, one who owns and one who handles?                       One

12   partnership produces, one partnership handles?

13               MR. McCONNELL:               The Department of

14   Agriculture did not distinguish among them.

15               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  Well, I don't care if

16   they did or they didn't.            I mean, we should know.              Are

17   they two separate legal entities?                        One who produces -

18               MR. McCONNELL:               They are separate -- they

19   are separate legal entities, all effectively controlled

20   by the same family.

21               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  Well, that's -- you

22   know, in the cat -- you get some limited liability by

23   creating separate entities, so the creature who owns is

24   one partnership, and the -- and the entity that

25   produces, that handles, is a second one.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I assume this is one of

 2   those difficult merits questions you were alluding to,

 3   it doesn't go to whether there's jurisdiction, but to

 4   whether the claim of a taking can be asserted by the

 5   partnership in question, isn't it?

 6                MR. McCONNELL:            That's right,

 7   Justice Scalia.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't -- I don't see how

 9   it goes to jurisdiction, which is the only question

10   before us.

11                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, it does to my mind

12   because what is the claim, assuming that the producer

13   owns -- the producer entity owns the raisins.                What

14   exactly is being taken from the handlers?                Is it the

15   percentage -- it can't be the raisins because they don't

16   own them.

17                MR. McCONNELL:            Well, Justice Sotomayor,

18   I'm -- I'm delighted to preview our -- our argument on

19   the merits on that.

20                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               What -- what do they

21   own?

22                MR. McCONNELL:            So the -- so the -

23                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               What is it that's being

24   taken from the handler entity?

25                MR. McCONNELL:            The order in this case was

                                       5

 1   issued against the -- the Hornes in their capacity as a

 2   handler only, so the entire fine was paid by them.                      None

 3   of the fine is attributable to anyone in their capacity

 4   as a producer.

 5                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               All right.       So go back.

 6   What is the -- what was taken from them -- you're saying

 7   it's just the fine, that the fine is a taking or -- what

 8   was the interest that they're claiming was taken by the

 9   government?    They didn't own the raisins, so they get

10   paid a fee for handling.

11                 MR. McCONNELL:            So -- so this is -- this is

12   our position, Justice Sotomayor.                   I think we have to

13   look at what is it that the Department of Agriculture

14   attempted to take.     So, in the demand letter from the

15   Department of Agriculture addressed to the Hornes,

16   they -- they asked the Hornes to deliver California

17   raisins, or the dollar equivalent.                      So that's the fact

18   upon which all of this case is -- is built.

19                 Now, what is the legal significance of that,

20   California raisins or the dollar equivalent?                      It is our

21   legal position, or it will be our legal position on the

22   merits that when the government seeks a specific

23   physical property, a res, or its monetary equivalent,

24   that that is a taking of the res itself.                      And there's -

25   and there's support for that in the -- for precedent

 1   from this Court.     The closest case is Village of

 2   Norwood v. Baker.

 3                  In this case, the -- the city condemned a

 4   strip of land for the purpose of building a road.                    They

 5   tried to get out of paying any compensation by claiming

 6   that the abutting landowner would gain value.                    That was

 7   rejected.     They were assessed $2,000 compensation for

 8   the taking.

 9                  And then the city turned around and issued a

10   special assessment against the landowner for precisely

11   that $2,000.     The landowner came back up to this Court,

12   and this Court held that it was a taking -- a taking of

13   the land.

14                  And in a subsequent case just a couple of

15   years later, the Court described this as a, quote

16   "actual confiscation of private property to public use."

17                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But you -- you began by

18   saying that these are merits defenses, but you wanted to

19   focus first on -- on the jurisdictional question that's

20   before us.

21                  MR. McCONNELL:            That's right.       I hope it

22   helps to inform the jurisdictional question.                    But the

23   jurisdictional question is this:                    The Ninth Circuit held

24   that my clients could not even raise their takings claim

25   on the merits until they had first gone to the Court of

 1   Claims.

 2               I think there are three things wrong with

 3   that.

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Am I right in thinking

 5   that there is no dispute on that point, that the -- the

 6   takings claim could have been asserted by the Hornes, as

 7   producers, in the Court of Federal Claims?

 8               MR. McCONNELL:             I think that the government

 9   no longer disputes, although you should ask them to

10   be -- to be clear -- I think that they no longer dispute

11   that this is not a jurisdictional client, even though

12   they prevailed after the petition for rehearing was

13   filed in the Court of Appeals -

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Well, jurisdictional -

15               MR. McCONNELL: -- on the ground that it was

16   jurisdictional.

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               -- jurisdictional or not,

18   as a practical matter, producers who are not subject to

19   fine as handlers, but the producers of the raisins whose

20   raisins are being segregated, could they go to the Court

21   of Federal Claims and say my raisins have been taken?

22               MR. McCONNELL:             The -- whether the claim is

23   being brought in the capacity of producer or handler I

24   think is not relevant to one of our arguments, and it is

25   relevant to the other argument.

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But I'd just like a

 2   straight answer to that question.                       You -- you are

 3   representing producers, and they just produce.

 4                 MR. McCONNELL:            No, no.           No, we're

 5   representing people who are both producers and handlers.

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I'm saying

 7   hypothetically -- hypothetically.                       Is the Court of

 8   Federal Claims the proper forum for a producer?

 9                 MR. McCONNELL:            It depends upon whether the

10   taking has been from them or not.                       In the ordinary case,

11   the ordinary relationship between a producer and a

12   handler, the producer is not paid for the reserve

13   raisins and therefore any payment that would come, any

14   lawsuit on behalf of those raisins would go to the

15   producer, and that would go I think to the Court of

16   Claims.

17                 In this case, though, the business model is

18   quite different from that and the producers in this case

19   were paid everything.        They received full value -

20   market value for their raisins.                  The only people who are

21   out any money in this case are the Hornes in their

22   capacity as handler.       So that's why they are the

23   only ones -

24                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               But the problem is that

25   they weren't entitled to that money.                       Meaning they had

                                        9

 1   to pay it over to the producer.                   The producer was going

 2   to pay them a handling fee, but that money didn't belong

 3   to them.     It belonged to the producers who supplied them

 4   with the raisins and expected payment for them -

 5                  MR. McCONNELL:            I'm not sure what -

 6                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               -- if they were sold in

 7   the ordinary course.

 8                  MR. McCONNELL:            I'm not sure which

 9   money you're -- they have not asserted any claim on any

10   money.     The producers have been completely paid off.                It

11   is the handlers who have been held responsible.                   And the

12   reason they were held responsible was the following

13   logic, and you see this on -- on -- on page 78 of the

14   judicial officer's opinion.

15                  They were held responsible because in

16   their -- in their processing capacity, when they were

17   doing the stemming, the seeding, the fumigating, the

18   packing, that this was regarded by the Department of

19   Agriculture as possession -- physical possession of the

20   raisins and acquisition of the raisins, even though they

21   never had title to the raisins.

22                  It's the Department of Agriculture that has

23   attached to them a possessory interest in the raisins

24   and then assessed them the full monetary equivalent of

25   those raisins, full market value, $484,000 for the

                                        10

 1   market value because it's -- because under this very

 2   unusual regulatory scheme the government regards them as

 3   having possessed the raisins even though that -- that is

 4   not -

 5                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. McConnell, I'm sorry.

 6   Could I -- along the lines of what Justice Ginsburg was

 7   saying, suppose that the Hornes had given over all the

 8   raisins, right, but that they thought that this was

 9   improper, that this marketing order was -- it was a

10   violation of the takings clause.                  Could they have gone

11   to the Court of Claims, via the Tucker Act, and said, we

12   want our money back?

13                They gave -- they gave over the raisins,

14   they say we're entitled to compensation.                  Could they

15   have gone through the Court of Claims?

16                MR. McCONNELL:            If they had -- if they had

17   not been paid for the raisins, they had taken raisins to

18   a handler, received no money for them, I think that they

19   could go to the Court of Claims.

20                JUSTICE KAGAN:            In other words, the Hornes

21   did what the marketing order suggested they should do.

22   They gave over the raisins.             But they said this is just

23   improper.   You're saying they could go to the Court of

24   Claims?

25                MR. McCONNELL:            Yes.

 1               JUSTICE KAGAN:            Okay.           So if -- if that's

 2   the case, I guess then the question is, why didn't they

 3   have to go that route?

 4               MR. McCONNELL:            They didn't -- they didn't

 5   go that route, and the question I think is what are the

 6   -- what are the legal consequences of that -

 7               JUSTICE KAGAN:            Right.

 8               MR. McCONNELL:            -- because what they -- what

 9   they knew was that they were not going to be compensated

10   for the raisins, and therefore they came up with a -

11   with a plan, a business plan that they believed made -

12   eliminated any handler and made it unnecessary for any

13   of the independent producers, on whose behalf they're

14   operating, to turn over raisins to the government.

15               The plan was ultimately rejected and we

16   haven't brought a -- a cert petition on it, but the plan

17   actually complies with the -- with the language of

18   the -- of the regulation because they believe that in

19   their capacity as handler, as processor, that they never

20   acquired the raisins.      "Acquisition" is the key term for

21   becoming a handler under the rule.

22               And they believe that since they were simply

23   providing a service for -- for $12 a ton to their

24   neighbors, that they never acquired the raisins, they

25   never possessed the raisins, and therefore no one had to

                                     12

 1   comply the regulation.

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, some of the raisins

 3   were their own.    Some of the raisins were their own.

 4                 MR. McCONNELL:            That's correct.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            At least as to that, that

 6   wouldn't be true, right?

 7                 MR. McCONNELL:            That's -- that's correct.          I

 8   think that's correct.

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, to get you back to

10   the -- the jurisdiction point, let's -- let's just

11   assume a hypothetical case where a regulated entity has

12   to pay an exaction which it deems to be a penalty.                   And

13   let's assume it can go to the Court of Claims, but it

14   doesn't.

15                 It waits until the penalty's assessed and

16   then when the penalty's assessed it says, this is a

17   taking.    That -- is that the case that you want to

18   discuss with us today.

19                 MR. McCONNELL:            That's right.     When the

20   underlying order would be a taking and they have been

21   assessed money because they didn't comply with the

22   taking, we believe they can challenge that as a taking.

23   And both under the AMAA procedures, which are exclusive,

24   I think that they have to go through the -- through the

25   Department of Agriculture and then to the district

                                       13

 1   court, but I also think under the principles of the -

 2   announced by this Court in of the Apfel decision that

 3   they are entitled to a remedy in the district court.

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Mr. McConnell, would you

 5   explain the -- if they were just handlers and weren't

 6   producing any raisins, if they were just handlers, do

 7   they have a claim and where?               And if they were just

 8   producers -- I take it from the question I asked and the

 9   question Justice Kagan asked that if they were just

10   producers, the raisins got set aside, they were paid for

11   only the ones that went to market, they could go to the

12   Court of Claims.

13                But now they're just handlers, as this

14   entity is for most of the raisins that are involved,

15   some 80 percent, right?          It's only about 20 percent is

16   their own.   So could this work for someone who was just

17   a handler, doesn't produce any raisins?

18                MR. McCONNELL:             So if they are just a

19   handler -

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Yes.

21                MR. McCONNELL:             -- as the Department of

22   Agriculture treated them, as far as the Department of

23   Agriculture is concerned they are only a handler.                  They

24   are required to raise -- exhaust their claims before the

25   Department of Agriculture and then challenge the order

                                       14

 1   in the district court.

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:               What I'm -- I'm trying to

 3   understand is this scheme.              Apparently it wasn't enough

 4   just to be a handler or just to be a producer.                 The

 5   claim that you're making turns on the coincidence of

 6   being both the producer and a handler.

 7                MR. McCONNELL:             I don't think that that's

 8   so.   I think that we -- that the Hornes ought to prevail

 9   on either -- in either of their capacities.

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:               So any handler, any

11   handler could be making the same claim?

12                MR. McCONNELL:             Any handler who has a

13   business model that is similar to this.                 But most

14   handlers -

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But what do you mean

16   by -- what's the business model that's similar to this?

17                MR. McCONNELL:             So most handlers, if they're

18   in compliance with the order, they take all the raisins

19   from the producers, they only pay for -- for the free

20   pool of raisins.   They don't pay for the reserve raisins

21   and they never have any interest in the reserve raisins.

22   In this case, the Hornes did not operate that way.

23   The -- the producers received full value for all of

24   their raisins.

25                So the producers are -- are not in the case.

                                       15

 1   They have no standing.       They have no pocketbook injury.

 2   The -- the entire pocketbook injury in this case is

 3   borne by the Hornes in their capacity as a handler.

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               I'm sorry.

 5               MR. McCONNELL:            In response to -

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               In the Horne model, the

 7   handlers buy -- buy the free raisins and then pay the

 8   producers, is that what it -

 9               MR. McCONNELL:            That's correct.

10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Oh, so that's the

11   difference in this model, they don't take title to the

12   raisins is what you're saying?

13               MR. McCONNELL:            Exactly.        And the Hornes

14   believed that this would mean that they were not

15   handlers.

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               All right.     Let me -

17   let me -

18               MR. McCONNELL:            And that -- and they were

19   found to be handlers anyway.

20               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               What is -- what is the

21   value in permitting a party who doesn't own property to

22   raise a taking claim on behalf of other people?

23   Meaning, doesn't the system have an interest in ensuring

24   that people comply with their legal obligations, and to

25   the extent that you choose to violate the law the way

                                     16

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   they have here, that the fine is punitive and not

 2   compensatory.

 3                Meaning, you don't own the raisins, but you

 4   were obligated to put raisins aside for someone else.

 5   You were their agent and you failed to meet a government

 6   obligation that was independently on you.

 7                MR. McCONNELL:             No.

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                So I go back to my

 9   question:   What was the taking?                 Since you didn't own

10   the raisins, the taking is the fine is what you want to

11   call the taking.

12                MR. McCONNELL:             The taking is what the

13   government demanded, which was either give me your house

14   or give me your money, give me your raisins or give us

15   the monetary equivalent.

16                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                But they're not your

17   raisins.

18                MR. McCONNELL:             By the time -- by the time

19   this order was enforced, the raisins were gone and so as

20   a practical matter, only one of those two alternatives

21   was left as a matter of timing.

22                JUSTICE ALITO:             Well, but in answer to

23   Justice Ginsburg's question that -- you said the

24   producers could go to the -- the Court of Federal Claims

25   to contest the taking of -- producers could go to

                                       17

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   contest the taking of raisins.

 2                MR. McCONNELL:             If they had not been paid

 3   for the raisins.

 4                JUSTICE ALITO:             If they had not been paid

 5   for it.

 6                MR. McCONNELL:             Right.

 7                JUSTICE ALITO:             But are you -- does that

 8   mean you do not think that the AMAA withdraws Tucker Act

 9   jurisdiction?

10                MR. McCONNELL:             It withdraws Tucker Act

11   jurisdiction only for handlers.                  So if we're talking

12   about pure producers -

13                JUSTICE ALITO:             Only for handlers.

14                MR. McCONNELL:             -- pure producers do not go

15   to the -- don't have to go through the AMAA process.

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why?           Why -- why does it

17   withdraw for the one and not the other?

18                MR. McCONNELL:             These New Deal-era programs,

19   Justice Scalia, are somewhat -- the purpose is somewhat

20   obscure -

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:             No, I don't mean the

22   policy.   I don't mean the policy reason.                      What in the

23   law leads you to that conclusion?

24                MR. McCONNELL:             Oh, well, this is

25   straightforwardly set forth in the -- in the -- in

                                       18

 1   Sections 14(a) and 15(a) of the AMAA.                        I don't think

 2   that's in dispute.      So only producers are -- are

 3   regulated by this program.               Only producers have a right

 4   to go through their remedies in the Department of

 5   Agriculture.

 6                  Only producers have to do that.                     It's -

 7   it's a -- it's completely a producer -

 8                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              You said -

 9                  MR. McCONNELL:            I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10   Excuse me.     Each of those was -- please substitute the

11   word "handler" for each of those.                        It's only the

12   handlers that are regulated under this -- under this

13   program.

14                  So -- and -- and my clients were treated as

15   handlers.    They believed that they were not.                      But it is

16   the Department of Agriculture that has attached this -

17   this status to them.        And it's -- it's I think quite a

18   Catch 22 for the government to come along and say,

19   although we are fining you $700,000 in your capacity as

20   a handler, you're not a handler for purposes of

21   challenging the legality of that order.

22                  JUSTICE BREYER:            I'm just trying to get to

23   what you're arguing about.               And I might be off base by

24   now.   I feel like handlers, purchasers, raisins, like an

25   old Abbott and Costello movie.                  I just want to see if

                                        19

 1   I'm right.     Tell me.     Just say you're wrong and I don't

 2   go into it further.

 3                  There -- there are some people, they've been

 4   -- they are either -- they have some raisins, all right.

 5   And these particular people, whom the Department has

 6   said have acquired the raisins, it said they acquired

 7   the raisins.     And so they're there with some raisins,

 8   and then the government says, do this thing with your

 9   raisins.     And they don't want to do it, so they don't.

10   They don't do it even though the law says do it.

11                  And then they say the law is

12   unconstitutional and, moreover, you fined us a huge

13   amount of money and we don't want to pay it because the

14   law is unconstitutional, and we consider that money to

15   be paid.     Call it a fine, call it what you want.            We

16   consider we shouldn't have paid it and now we want it

17   back and we want compensation and we think it's a taking

18   and where do we go.       Can't we make that argument in the

19   Ninth Circuit?     It's something like that; isn't that

20   what we're arguing about?

21                  MR. McCONNELL:            That's almost exactly right.

22                  JUSTICE BREYER:            But not quite.

23                  (Laughter.)

24                  MR. McCONNELL:            With -- with one detail

25   different -

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:              Yes?

 2                MR. McCONNELL:              -- which is that this is the

 3   proceeding here that decides whether they have to pay.

 4   They have not yet paid the fine.

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:              Okay, okay.      So we

 6   shouldn't have to pay because this is all

 7   unconstitutional.     And -- and now what's your argument?

 8                MR. McCONNELL:              So -- so they're raising a

 9   defense.   It isn't that they are -- it isn't that

10   they're getting -- trying to get it back.

11                JUSTICE BREYER:              And then the Ninth Circuit

12   says go to the Court of Claims.                   And you say no, we

13   don't have to go to the Court of Claims.

14                MR. McCONNELL:              But that detail actually is

15   quite important because, remember, you can't even go to

16   the Court of Claims unless you are seeking damages for

17   an actual violation that has already taken place.                      We

18   could not go to the court -- the Hornes could not go to

19   the Court of Claims right now.                  What the government says

20   is that they should pay the $700,000 fine first and then

21   go to the Court of Claims to get it back.                   And that is

22   exactly what this Court said in Apfel, is a, quote,

23   "pointless set of activities that Congress could not

24   possibly have" -

25                JUSTICE KAGAN:              That's true -

 1               MR. McCONNELL:            -- "have contemplated."

 2               JUSTICE KAGAN:            I think that's true, Mr.

 3   McConnell, as to part of the fine, that part of the fine

 4   falls under Apfel, but not the other part.                As to the

 5   compensation part, it seems to me you have a pretty

 6   decent Apfel argument.       But as to the penalty part, I

 7   don't really understand how the Apfel argument would go.

 8               It seems to me that as to the penalty part,

 9   the key thing is that if they had handed over the

10   raisins, they could have gone to the Court of Federal

11   Claims and had the compensation done there.                And the

12   fact that the government is penalizing them for not

13   complying with the marketing order does not fall within

14   the rationale of Apfel.

15               MR. McCONNELL:            Well, the most pertinent

16   case for that part of the fine, for the penalty part, is

17   Missouri Pacific Railroad v. Nebraska.                So this is the

18   case where the railroad was told by the State to do

19   some -- some expensive work, the railroad says no, that

20   would be a taking if we were required to do that.                There

21   is no compensation available and so they don't do it.

22   They're fined $500.

23               That gets up to this Court and an opinion by

24   Mr. -- Justice Holmes, the Court holds that that is a

25   taking and that the railroad is entitled to challenge

                                     22

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the taking in the form of the fine.                   So for -- for the

 2   penalty portion, the punishment portion of the fine,

 3   Missouri Pacific Railroad is actually the more pertinent

 4   decision.

 5               Which comes back -- I don't think I fully

 6   answered all the variants of Justice Sotomayor's

 7   question.

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:            All I was trying to do was

 9   to get you on the basic argument, which you started

11   wrong when they said they had no jurisdiction to hear

12   this, that rather, they had to go -- you had to go to

14               MR. McCONNELL:            May I tick off the three

15   reasons?

16               JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.

17               MR. McCONNELL:            One is it has nothing to do

18   with jurisdiction.

19               Second, the Tucker Act does not apply to

20   cases where -- where there is a defense being lodged to

21   a monetary exaction.       That's Apfel, as supplemented by

22   Missouri Pacific Railroad.

23               And third, even if that were not so, the

24   AMAA displaces the Tucker Act and they were required to

25   exhaust their remedies before the Department of

                                     23

 2   which they are residing.

 3                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            What was the first?    I

 4   forgot the first already.             What was the first?

 5                  MR. McCONNELL:            The first is that it isn't

 6   jurisdictional and therefore it should not have been

 7   raised -

 8                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            What -- what isn't

 9   jurisdictional?

10                  MR. McCONNELL:            The -- the requirement to go

11   to the Court of Claims when you -- when you need to is

12   not jurisdictional, that that's a matter of remedy, that

13   is, it's -- it's the equitable principle that you may

14   not pursue your case for an injunctive relief when

15   there's an adequate remedy at law.

16                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Mr. McConnell, in -

17   in -- if the producers had decided to challenge this as

18   a Tucker Act violation, they would have had to hand over

19   the raisins?     Or could they have just held on to the

20   raisins and said, I'm not handing it over until I get

21   just compensation?

22                  MR. McCONNELL:            So had they held on to their

23   own raisins and sold them, I assume, you don't -- not

24   just left them rot, if they had sold them, then the

25   Department of Agriculture would have called them a

 1   handler because anyone who sells raisins is called a

 2   handler, and then they would be fined in their capacity

 3   as a handler and it would be a somewhat similar case to

 4   this one.

 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               All right.

 6               MR. McCONNELL:            Maybe an easier one than

 7   this one.

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, the point is that

 9   under a normal takings claim, you have to hand over your

10   property, you've lost the value, and you want the

11   government to pay it back to you, correct?

12               MR. McCONNELL:            Not necessarily correct.

13   There are a whole string of cases in which property

14   owners raise takings as a defense rather than turning

15   over the property.     Kaiser Aetna is perhaps the most -

16   best known recent case, but out of an administrative

17   context, there's the Florida Power & Light case.                       Penn

18   Central was -- was like this.              Loretto v. Teleprompter

19   is like this.

20               There's a whole string of cases.                     The

21   government themselves cite six such cases, most of them

22   fairly old, for this proposition.                     So there's nothing

23   unusual about bringing a -- a defensive takings claim.

24               Mr. Chief Justice, unless -

 1   want to encroach on your rebuttal time, but one

 2   mysterious thing.      The first time around, the Ninth

 3   Circuit decided this case on the merits.                        So if you're

 4   right, I take it, we remand and then they adjudicate the

 5   merits of the takings claim.                 But they already did that.

 6                MR. McCONNELL:               Yes, Justice Ginsburg.            And

 7   they did that on a ground that we think is manifestly

 8   inconsistent with this Court's precedents.                        We were

 9   prepared to -- we were trying to get an en banc review

10   and were prepared to come to this Court from the merits

11   determination.

12                We were blocked from that because the

13   government, after the petition for rehearing was filed,

14   came up with -- calling this a jurisdictional argument,

15   raised this objection for the first time; and the Ninth

16   Circuit panel accepted their view, issued a new opinion,

17   stripping out the entire merits, and substituting this

18   jurisdictional holding that is producing so much

19   enjoyment for us this morning.

20                (Laughter.)

 1                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. PALMORE

 2                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 3                 MR. PALMORE:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 4   and may it please the Court:

 5                 I'd like to start where Justice Sotomayor

 6   started with Petitioner's counsel because any takings

 7   analysis needs to begin with a careful identification of

 8   what property was allegedly taken.                      Petitioners in this

 9   case have actually advanced two different theories about

10   what property of theirs was taken.                      What taking is at

11   issue here?    Raisins and money.

12                 We think both takings claims fail for

13   threshold reasons, but they're different threshold

14   reasons that call for different analysis.

15                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Palmore, before you do

16   that then, haven't you conceded the point that this is

17   not jurisdictional?

18                 MR. PALMORE:         We agree that the failure to

19   go to the Court of Claims is not properly viewed as a

20   jurisdictional defect.         We did invoke Ninth Circuit

21   precedent below stating that it was jurisdictional.                         And

22   some of this cases -- this Court's cases put it in

23   ripeness terms, which is an Article III concept.                      So

24   there has been confusion -

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    When did you first

                                       27

 1   raise the argument that it was jurisdictional?

 2                MR. PALMORE:         In our opposition to the

 3   rehearing petition.

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    And now you are -

 5   now you are changing back again and saying it's not?

 6                MR. PALMORE:         There was Ninth Circuit

 7   precedent holding that it was jurisdictional, and we

 8   relied on that and there is certainly language from this

 9   Court -

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    You relied on that

11   when you got to rehearing.             You didn't rely on that

12   before you went before the Ninth Circuit, right?

13                MR. PALMORE:         That's correct.

14                We think -- we think this is properly viewed

15   as a substantive defect in the claim, so in a sense the

16   Ninth Circuit, in its initial panel decision, ruled for

17   the government on a substantive defect one, there's no

18   taking.   And what it did on rehearing in our view,

19   although it attached the wrong label to it, it

20   substantively was correct in concluding that there was

21   substantive defect number two -

22                JUSTICE KAGAN:            But Mr. Palmore, if you are

23   conceding now that this is not jurisdictional, it seems

24   to me that your Tucker Act argument as a substantive

25   argument, I mean, has been waived.                     You didn't raise

                                      28

 1   that argument until the rehearing petition.

 2                 MR. PALMORE:         That would certainly be

 3   something that -- that the Ninth Circuit could consider

 4   in the event there were a remand here.                  But the Ninth

 5   Circuit did decide it.         The substance of its bottom line

 6   conclusion was correct and all of its analysis was

 7   correct.    It simply used the wrong words, so we think it

 8   is here.

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I'm really -- I'm really

10   confused.    You are saying there ought to be a remand

11   here because the question is not jurisdictional, which

12   is just what your friend says, right?

13                 MR. PALMORE:         Well, the Ninth Circuit -

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            So the two of you are in

15   agreement it ought to go back to the Ninth Circuit, they

16   should do it on the merits, and -- and if that's wrong,

17   we can review that.

18                 MR. PALMORE:         Look, if that happens, of

19   course, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, the consequence

20   for us is they reinstate the prior panel opinion, in

21   which we win, also -

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That may well be, but -

23                 MR. PALMORE:         I'm not going to resist too

24   strenuously that kind of remand, but they did decide it.

25   And moreover, they decided something separate, which is

                                       29

 1   at JA-305 they said something different, which is the

 2   kind of threshold defect in the takings claim turning on

 3   raisins, which is there is a capacity problem.

 4                  So there are two problems with the raisin

 5   claims, a capacity problem and a just compensation

 6   problem.     The capacity problem is this:                  In 2002, after

 7   having been strictly raisin producers since 1969,

 8   entering into a market where there was a reserve

 9   requirement from the beginning, they knew what they were

10   getting into, they decided to adopt a new business

11   model, as Petitioner's counsel says.                     But, as was found

12   below, they adopted a business model that was an

13   intentional, willful attempt to evade regulatory

14   requirements in order to secure an unfair competitive

15   advantage.

16                  But what they did was they took on the

17   obligations of a handler.             They became raisin handlers

18   in 2002.     And what came with that status were a series

19   of regulatory obligations that apply only to handlers

20   and under the AMAA can apply only to handlers:                     The

21   requirement to have raisins inspected, the requirement

22   to file truthful reports, the requirement to make

23   records available, and the requirement to separate out

24   raisins into what's called free tonnage and reserve

25   tonnage, any raisins processed, it doesn't matter who

                                        30

 1   owns them.

 2                Those are handler-specific regulatory

 3   obligations that were imposed upon them, and they

 4   violated every single one of them, willfully and

 5   intentionally, in order to secure an unfair competitive

 6   advantage.

 7                And what the USDA did was impose penalties

 8   on them for the violation of law that -- that attached

 9   to them only as raisin handlers.                  And then they invoked

10   the judicial review proceedings in Section 14 that

11   provides a judicial review mechanism only for handlers.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yes, but part of -- part of

13   that penalty was -- you know, your raisins or your life,

14   right?   I mean, it was -

15                (Laughter.)

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- you don't have to pay

17   the penalty if you give us the raisins.

18                MR. PALMORE:         That's not correct,

19   Justice Scalia.   They have to give the raisins.

20   Mr. McConnell referred to demand letters -

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:            You mean they -- Is that

22   right, they have to give the raisins?

23                MR. PALMORE:         They are under a regulatory

24   obligation to provide the raisins.                     If they violate that

25   regulatory obligation, they are subject to sanctions.

 1                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay.          So -

 2                  MR. PALMORE:         One component of -

 3                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- that amounts to the same

 4   thing, your raisins or the penalty, right?

 5                  MR. PALMORE:         No, but it's not a choice.

 6   And I think that's very important to point out.                         There

 7   were actually two different demand letters.

 8   Mr. McConnell referred to a demand letter saying your

 9   raisins or your money.          There was an initial demand

10   letter saying:     You are a handler; you have to comply;

11   we're going to come get the raisins.                      The second demand

12   letter said, we showed up -- literally it says, we

13   showed up with our truck, you didn't provide the

14   raisins, so now you have got to provide the cash

15   equivalent.

16                  And there were also going to be, as there

17   were, separate regulatory proceedings brought against

18   them for violating those -- those obligations.                         Not just

19   the failure to reserve, but all these handler-specific

20   obligations.     They filed false reports.                      They didn't

21   make raisins available for inspection.

22                  There were a whole host of regulatory

23   violations that were at issue here, and when they

24   invoked the handler review action in the district court

25   they could assert defenses as a handler.                         But, for

                                        32

 1   instance, another producer -- producers can't invoke

 2   these -- these judicial review schemes.                  Another

 3   producer couldn't have intervened in that action to

 4   assert its producer claim.

 5               JUSTICE ALITO:              As this case stands when -

 6   as it comes before us, is there a claim that they -

 7   that money -- the government is trying to take money

 8   from them without just compensation?

 9               MR. PALMORE:           That was certainly not how we

10   understood the claim to be litigated below.                  That's not

11   how the Ninth Circuit thought -- understood the claim.

12   We have been talking about the claim involving the

13   raisins, which fails for a to capacity reason and a just

14   compensation reason.

15               JUSTICE ALITO:              Is that an issue -- is that

16   an issue we should decide or is that an issue that the

17   Ninth Circuit should decide, whether there is a takings

18   claim for money?

19               MR. PALMORE:           That was certainly not decided

20   below, so a remand -- to the extent that this was

21   preserved, a remand would be possible outcome there.                  We

22   think, though, that that claim suffers from separate -

23   separate procedural threshold defects.

24               JUSTICE ALITO:              All right.      If we assume for

25   the sake of argument that there is such a claim, why

 1   does that not fall within Apfel?

 2               MR. PALMORE:           Well, we think that -- for

 3   several reasons.    First of all, the Apfel opinion that's

 4   referred to is just a plurality.                   It's not been adopted

 5   by the Court.   Second of all, the Apfel analysis relied

 6   on this one-for-one, dollar-for-dollar concept.                   That

 7   was a critical part of the plurality's discussion there,

 8   and it thought that it would simply be a pointless

 9   exercise for Eastern Enterprises to be required to pay

10   the premium and then to go to the Court of Federal

11   Claims and get the exact same amount of money back.

12               JUSTICE ALITO:              Don't they claim that -

13               MR. PALMORE:           We suggested that there are a

14   whole host of reasons -

15               JUSTICE ALITO:              Before you leave that, don't

16   they claim that the entire amount that is assessed

17   against them is a taking?            Now, maybe they are wrong.

18   That the entire amount assessed against them is a taking

19   without just compensation?              Maybe they are wrong, but

20   isn't that a merits question?

21               MR. PALMORE:           That's -- that's -- they are

22   clearly wrong about that, and I -- but I think -

23   however you characterize that defect, it defeats this

24   dollar-for-dollar pointless exercise point that

25   Apfel plurality -

 1                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, why is that a

 2   necessary part of Apfel?            Why didn't Apfel just mean

 3   when we are dealing with cash you don't have to go to

 4   the Court of Claims?        So even if -- you know, you can

 5   have a discussion in the district court about whether

 6   it's not dollar-for-dollar and it should be discounted

 7   in some way.

 8                  But why should the fact that its

 9   dollar-for-dollar mean -- why is that a requirement, as

10   opposed to just it's cash and so the question of,

11   like -- you know, handing some -- handing it all over

12   and getting some back, that can be done in the district

13   court rather than making somebody file a separate suit?

14                  MR. PALMORE:         Well, I think there were two

15   things going on in Apfel and there were really two

16   distinct reasons why the plurality in Apfel thought that

17   there was no requirement to go to the Tucker Act there.

18   One was that it thought that in a statute like that,

19   that simply allocated benefits and burdens among private

20   entities, Congress would not have intended there to be

21   compensation available in the -- in the event that there

22   were a taking.

23                  And that was actually the government's

24   position in that case and the Apfel plurality cited to

25   that portion of the government's brief.                  And it cited

                                        35

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   cases in its discussion that weren't dollar-for-dollar

 2   or even cash transfer cases in which the Court had gone

 3   to the merit of takings claims without consideration of

 4   a Tucker Act remedy.

 5                Then there is the second idea, which is the

 6   cash transfer idea.     And we think that the

 7   dollar-for-dollar aspect of that was important to the

 8   plurality's analysis because it viewed that as evidence

 9   that Congress would not have intended the Tucker Act to

10   be deployed because it would have been a pointless

11   exercise.   So it really went to what Congress's intent

12   was.

13                Here, of course, for myriad reasons, that

14   dollar-for-dollar analysis breaks down.

15                JUSTICE BREYER:            No, no, but there's a

16   similar -- I mean, it seemed to me, again simplifying,

17   that underlying this their clients think this whole

18   raisin program is unconstitutional.                    What it does is it

19   takes raisins that we grow, in effect throws them in the

20   river.   And in the thirties, that was done to raise

21   raisin prices.

22                And they think as a matter of policy that

23   just hurts people by raising prices, and as a matter of

24   constitutional law it takes raisins from some people

25   that belong to them and uses them for this bad purpose.

                                      36

 1   Okay, that's their view of it, something like that,

 2   isn't it?

 3               MR. PALMORE:          Yes.

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:             Fine.          So they're making

 5   that kind of constitutional claim.                     Now, I would think

 6   if all you told me was that and I knew nothing about all

 7   these statutes, I would say that's the kind of claim

 8   that should be made in a Federal district court, period,

 9   not the Court of Claims.          Because their government isn't

10   going to compensate them for anything.                     That's against

11   the whole point of the program.

12               Either this program is valid or it isn't.

13   And if it isn't, some authoritative set of courts should

14   tell us that.   So I have a feeling this is somehow not a

15   right fit with the Court of Claims.

16               Now, you explain to me why that purely

17   instinctive feeling at this point is completely wrong.

18               MR. PALMORE:          Sure.         Justice Breyer, we've

19   now shifted back to the -- the first theory about the

20   property, which is the raisins.                 What they could have

21   done in 2002, would they have been a producer of

22   raisins, solely a producer of raisins for decades, at

23   any point during -- between 1969 and 2002, they could

24   have gone to the Court of Claims and said, this reserve

25   requirement, the taking of my raisins, I want my just

                                      37

 1   compensation.

 2                 That is not just a remedy, as Mr. McConnell

 3   suggests, it is a constitutional condition on the taking

 4   of private property for public use.                        As long as there's

 5   just compensation, there simply is no violation.                          So

 6   that's why -

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             That couldn't be what the

 8   statute meant.     I think that's what Justice Breyer says.

 9   Did -- did Congress create a statute in which we're

10   going to take your raisins and then you can go to the

11   Court of Claims and get your money back.                        I mean,

12   that -- that surely is not what Congress contemplated.

13   The -- the whole notion of the program is you can't get

14   your money back in the Court of Claims.

15                 Now, if you're raising a constitutional

16   objection, that's something else.                        That should be done

17   in district court.      But to say that Congress

18   contemplated -- you know, we'll take your raisins and

19   then you sue in the Court of Claims, they give you your

20   money back.     That's a weird statute.

21                 MR. PALMORE:          Justice Scalia, I have two -

22   two responses to that.          First of all, these claims have

23   been litigated in the Court of Claims; the Evans case,

24   the Cal-Almond case, both of which we cite in our brief.

25   Raisin producers, or in the Cal-Almond case it was an

 1   almond producer, went to the Court of Claims and said

 2   this reserve requirement is a taking, I want my money.

 3   And they lost; the Court of Claims -- correctly, in our

 4   view -- held that there was no taking.

 5                  That said, we do agree that it is actually a

 6   close question whether Congress would have intended

 7   compensation to be provided in a situation like this

 8   one, in the event the raisin reserve program were found

 9   to be a taking.     We've said -- we've said in our brief,

10   we do view that as a close question, although on

11   balance, we think that the proper answer is that there

12   is a remedy -- or, sorry, there is just compensation

13   available in the Court of Claims.

14                  But there are cases, Justice -

15                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            And you -- you think that's

16   a close question?     You think that the way the statute is

17   supposed to operate, once it is held that this is an

18   unconstitutional taking, is that every year, the

19   government takes the raisins and every year, the grower

20   goes to the Court of Claims and gets the money back for

21   the raisins.     Is that the program that Congress

22   anticipated?

23                  MR. PALMORE:         Well, we do agree that it's a

24   close question for the -

25                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't think it's close at

 1   all.   That's a crazy statute.              Every year we're going to

 2   take raisins and every year we're going to pay you in

 3   the Court of Claims.       What's the purpose of that?

 4                MR. PALMORE:         Well, of course, Congress

 5   didn't think this was a taking.                 And it -- and it built

 6   considerable administrative flexibility into the

 7   statute, and at the end of the day, that's what

 8   convinces us that Congress would not have intended to

 9   preclude compensation in the Court of Claims and to -

10   to opt for an injunction instead because the Secretary

11   of Agriculture has wide latitude to adjust.

12                So the compensation wouldn't be paid year

13   after year, as your hypothetical suggested.                 The program

14   could be adjusted.     A reserve requirement is only one

15   way of complying with the kind of supply control

16   provisions of the statute.             There are any number of

17   options available.

18                But I'd also point out that in this Court's

19   precedence in Monsanto and Regional Rail, those were

20   both statutory schemes which had their own compensation

21   mechanism, as does this one, this reserve raisins that

22   producers do get paid sometimes for them in a smaller

23   amount.   Those were cases in which the statutes did have

24   compensation mechanisms, and this Court held that the

25   Tucker Act was available as kind of a supplementary

                                      40

 1   compensation in the event -

 2                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Palmore, am I

 3   incorrect in thinking that the government is saying,

 4   handlers cannot raise the constitutionality of the

 5   Raisin Marketing Order?           You've told us that the

 6   producers can go to the Court of Claims.                  What about the

 7   handlers?     They're at least being fined for violating

 8   the Act, and it's their position that the whole thing is

 9   unconstitutional.

10                  Can they raise the constitutionality of the

11   whole arrangement defensively, or they simply can't

12   raise the constitutionality of the Act?

13                  MR. PALMORE:         Justice Ginsburg, I think this

14   goes back again to the property question.                  If the claim

15   is that it's unconstitutional because it takes

16   producers' property, they can't raise that in this

17   proceeding.     If the property is the raisins, they can't

18   raise that in this proceeding.                  They need to -- to

19   comply and go to the Court of Claims for compensation,

20   which means there has been no -- in the event there's a

21   taking, it's a constitutional taking because just

22   compensation is provided.

23                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But it would be -

24                  MR. PALMORE:         If the claim -- if the claim

25   is that the money that was taken from me, the fine, that

                                        41

 1   itself is a taking, then we think that claim can and

 2   must be brought in the context of the AMAA proceeding.

 3   That was not how the Court of Appeals understood the

 4   claim here to be, and there's no precedent for the idea

 5   that a fine for violation of law can be articulated as a

 6   taking of the lawbreaker's property without just

 7   compensation.     I haven't seen any case that -- that

 8   stands for that proposition and that would be quite

 9   remarkable.

10                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But then you just -- but

11   then you just lose on the merits.                        What the Ninth

12   Circuit says, they can't even argue this.

13                  MR. PALMORE:         Well, Justice Kennedy -

14                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I -- I thought that what

15   we were going to decide was whether or not, assuming you

16   can go to the Court of Claims, you must go to the Court

17   of Claims, can you prefer to wait, have a penalty

18   assessed against you and say this is unconstitutional,

19   it's a taking.     Your position is you can't say that.                   I

20   don't understand why.         Other than, if you want to talk

21   about Williamson and so forth, we can get into that.

22                  MR. PALMORE:         But, Justice Kennedy, the -

23   the Ninth Circuit didn't understand the taking claim to

24   be that the fine for my violation of law is a taking of

25   my money.     That's not how the Ninth Circuit understood

                                        42

 1   the claim, so they didn't analyze it in that way.

 2                 They understood the claim to be that the

 3   taking of producers' raisins is a taking, and we

 4   lawfully resisted it because it was an unconstitutional

 5   taking.   The Ninth Circuit correctly rejected that

 6   because there was nothing unconstitutional about it

 7   because it was not without just compensation.

 8                 The Tucker Act is the just compensation.

 9   This Court has held -

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:            The just compensation, I

11   take it, in the program is supposed to come from the

12   fact that raisin prices go up.                 So the poor children

13   with their noses pressed to the glass because they can't

14   pay the raisins, their parents are the ones who are

15   paying the compensation.           And certainly not the

16   taxpayer, he's not going to pay it, and maybe the other

17   producers will pay, some who get gypped or something, I

18   don't know.    But I can't believe that Congress wanted

19   the taxpayers to pay for a program that's going to mean

20   they have to pay higher prices as consumers.

21                 MR. PALMORE:         Justice Breyer, and that goes

22   to the -- to the merits of the case.

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:            No, no.        No, it doesn't go

24   to the merits.    It goes to whether or not it makes sense

25   to think that the Court of Claims has something to say

 1   about this.     And suppose we did this.                 Suppose we said,

 2   given the fact that you filed your thing, whatever it

 3   was -- you know, late, and the -- and the light of this

 4   very enlightening discussion which has been helpful, we

 5   think that this is the kind of program and challenge to

 6   the program where there isn't going to be a remedy

 7   really in the Court of Claims and they ought to go ahead

 8   in the Ninth Circuit, and in light of all these

 9   enlightening things that we'll write, you just decide

10   the merits of -- is that -- now, I'm sure you're going

11   to say that's absolutely terrible, it won't work at all.

12   So tell me why not.

13                 MR. PALMORE:          Well, Your Honor, of course,

14   the consequence of that is they reinstate our prior

15   victory in the prior panel opinion -

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:             No, no, we'd say -- we'll

17   say given the way that we've talked about the program,

18   perhaps it's best to consider this matter fully.

19                 MR. PALMORE:          Well, they did consider the

20   matter fully.     In the initial opinion, they said there's

21   no taking here.

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:             Yes.

23                 MR. PALMORE:          So all of the discussion we're

24   having here is about -- is predicated on the idea that

 1   in the first place.

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 Excuse me.   Can I -

 3                MR. PALMORE:           We agree there's no taking.

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 All right.   It almost

 5   seems to me, and I'll ask Mr. McConnell when he gets up

 6   at rebuttal, that there is some sort of due process

 7   challenge going on here that's been created by the

 8   labels they did in this new situation -- in this new

 9   business venture.     In the normal situation, the handler,

10   I'm being told, would actually have title to the

11   raisins, and they would pay the producers for the

12   raisins.   So there would be property taking.

13                In that situation, where the handlers

14   actually own the property, would they be able to raise a

15   taking defense?

16                MR. PALMORE:           No, because of the way that

17   the statute and the regulatory program works.                   If the

18   handler is actually buying raisins from the producer,

19   the handler never takes title to the reserve raisins.

20   And he doesn't pay for the reserve raisins.                   He takes

21   title to the free-tonnage raisins and the title to the

22   reserve raisins passes, as a matter of law, from the

23   producer to the Raisin Administrative Committee.                   The

24   handler never owns those raisins.

25                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 So they are missing a

 1   business opportunity because they can't take title to

 2   those raisins.   And yet you're asking -

 3                MR. PALMORE:           They would never pay for

 4   those -- they would never pay for those raisins because

 5   they can't take title.          They can't lawfully take title

 6   to those raisins.     Now -

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 This really does sound

 8   to me -- and I think that both Justice Scalia and Breyer

 9   now are being more and more convinced -- there has to be

10   a place to challenge this scheme.

11                MR. PALMORE:           And there absolutely is.

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 Whether it's a taking -

13   whether there's a takings claim for the handler because

14   the handler is being asked to do things -

15                MR. PALMORE:           But the handler's property is

16   not being taken, and that's critical.                    There are

17   separate takings claims that handlers have advanced

18   that -- that could be asserted through this process.

19   For instance, there was a case called Lion Raisins from

20   the Federal Circuit that we cite in our brief, in which

21   the issue was that the handler provided bins to store

22   the raisins, and he didn't get his bins back.                    Okay?

23                That was a handler takings claim, and that

24   had to be asserted in the context of this handler review

25   scheme.   But the handler doesn't own the raisins under

                                        46

 1   this scheme.

 2                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's -- that's a merits

 3   question again.     I mean, it's not a question of whether

 4   you -- you can resist on the basis of a takings claim.

 5   It's a question of whether you are going to win.

 6                  MR. PALMORE:         No, Justice Scalia, I think it

 7   goes to the scope, the capacity question that we were

 8   talking about before because the statute is quite clear

 9   in section 608c(13)(B) that this scheme does not

10   regulate producers in their capacity as producers.                 And

11   if someone wants to take on both roles, they will be

12   regulated only as a handler.

13                  So the regulatory obligations that applied

14   to Petitioners when they adopted this business model

15   were handler-only regulatory obligations, and then this

16   is a handler judicial review proceeding.                 That's a very

17   narrow means of decision here that avoids some of these

18   kind of conceptual questions about the nature of the -

19   the Takings Clause, which is that this claim simply

20   doesn't belong in this proceeding.

21                  But there's no unfairness or no due process

22   issue here at all because they -- in 2002, when -- when

23   Petitioners decided to engage in this, these regulatory

24   violations in order to secure an unfair advantage over

25   their competitors, as was found by the ALJ at JA41, at

                                        47

 1   that point they could have sought compensation for the

 2   past 6 years of raisins that they had provided.                     They

 3   didn't do it.

 4                I don't understand why they didn't do it.

 5   They left that claim on the table.                     And to the extent

 6   they wanted to claim going forward, they could have

 7   continued to use compliant handlers and sued every month

 8   for compensation in the Court of Claims.

 9                JUSTICE ALITO:            Did I understand you to say

10   a couple minutes ago that if the case were remanded, you

11   would be entitled to win on the reasoning of the panel

12   opinion?

13                MR. PALMORE:         The prior panel opinion,

14   Justice.   If -- if there was a remand on the basis that

15   the Ninth Circuit misunderstood this as a jurisdictional

16   Article III defect, and then the Ninth Circuit were to

17   find waiver, what the Ninth Circuit presumably would do

18   would be to reinstate its first panel decision, which we

19   think was also correct and held that there was no taking

20   here.   There are two -

21                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Palmore, what would be

22   wrong -- would anything be wrong -- with a -- with a

23   disposition of this Court that went something like this:

24   Everybody agrees that this is not a jurisdictional

25   issue, including the government, so they got that wrong.

 1                Now, as to this whole business about the

 2   Tucker Act and whether the Tucker Act provides a remedy,

 3   the government only started talking about that in a

 4   petition for rehearing en banc, and the government can't

 5   do that.   You know, it can't introduce an argument like

 6   this in a petition for rehearing en banc.              So that's

 7   waived.

 8                And now, the Ninth Circuit can go and try to

 9   figure out whether this marketing order is a taking or

10   it's just the world's most outdated law.

11                (Laughter.)

12                MR. PALMORE:         That would certainly be an

13   available option, or the Ninth Circuit could decide for

14   itself whether there had been a waiver.

15                But there's a separate issue in that there's

16   this capacity issue, which is a separate point that the

17   Ninth Circuit made at JA305, when it pointed out that

18   this was a producer claim, and that's something that -

19   that was strictly a producer claim and wasn't -- wasn't

20   a fit for this handler review action, and that's

21   something that could also be considered on remand.

22                But the consequence of this -- of that would

23   be for the -- the Court to impose its -- if it found a

24   waiver, to rule for us for separate merits reasons.

25                We do view the Tucker Act -- the failure to

                                      49

 1   seek just compensation -- as a merits defect in the

 2   Petitioners' claim here.            So even putting this capacity

 3   problem aside, there is simply -- there's no defense.

 4   Mr. McConnell says this can be raised as a defense.                     But

 5   there is no defense if all you show is that there has

 6   been a taking of private property for public use, full

 7   stop.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:             What does the word

 9   "acquire" mean.    There is some opinion here which says

10   these handlers acquired the raisins.                     What is -- what's

11   that about?

12                 MR. PALMORE:          "Acquire" is a defined term,

13   and it includes to possess.               So they took to -

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:             Like lessees or something,

15   bailees?

16                 MR. PALMORE:          There was no question under

17   the regulatory scheme here that Petitioners were

18   handlers.     And in fact, there's a surprising -

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:             I -- no, no.        I just wanted

20   to know what the word "acquire" -

21                 MR. PALMORE:          "Acquire" -- "acquire" is

22   defined to include a number of things, including to

23   possess.    And a handler is anyone who sells raisins.

24   There was no mystery about this.

25                 And, in fact, at pages 8 through 11 of our

 1   brief, we cite communication after communication where

 2   USDA told them -

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:             Now, can an acquirer of my

 4   car, for example -- I don't know.                       Forget that.

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:             A bailee?

 6                (Laughter.)

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:               Can they -- can they

 8   assert a takings claim attaches to the car?                       It sounds

 9   like a standing question.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Yes, I suppose a bailee

11   could, a bailee of the car.

12                MR. PALMORE:          No, I don't think a bailee

13   could.   I think the owner would have to assert that

14   claim, right.

15                But "acquire" is a defined term, and as this

16   case comes to this Court it's accepted.                       The Petitioner

17   has not sought cert on the underlying regulatory

18   findings.   In fact, their arguments -- they were told

19   ahead of time that they were completely wrong over and

20   over and over again, and then they lost that claim at

21   every level, twice within the Department of Agriculture,

22   in the district court, in the court of appeals.                        They

23   lost on that regulatory claim.

24                This wasn't a good faith misunderstanding.

25   If you look at JA41, the ALJ found that this was a

 1   willful and intentional, knowing violation of regulatory

 2   requirements because they were able to undercut their

 3   competitors by not playing by the rules.                  So this

 4   doesn't present any kind of due process -

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:            No, no. But still, it might

 6   if they're acquirers -- but they are acquirers, okay?

 7   They think this program is unconstitutional because it

 8   takes some other people's property, right?                  So those

 9   other people are in a very special relation to them.

10   Those other people are really close.

11                And it may be they have standing to assert

12   those other people's claims.              And if they do have

13   standing to assert those other people's claims, why

14   can't they make the argument that way?

15                MR. PALMORE:         I -- I disagree that they have

16   standing to make those other people's claims.                  And also,

17   Petitioners haven't argued, haven't made any third-party

18   standing argument here.

19                But -- this Court's requirements are quite

20   strict for third-party standing.                  You have to have a

21   close -- a close relationship, and I don't think a mere

22   arm's-length commercial relationship would count.

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Suppose they did have

 2               MR. PALMORE:          Well, they have -- they

 3   certainly have standing as producers to raise the claim.

 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Let's assume they have

 5   standing.   Could they raise the claim -

 6               MR. PALMORE:          Yes, that -

 7               JUSTICE KENNEDY -- that this is an

 8   unconstitutional taking?

 9               MR. PALMORE:          In the Court of Claims,

10   absolutely, as producers.

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              No, no.         In the

12   administrative proceeding where they are charged with -

13   where a penalty is being assessed against them.

14               MR. PALMORE:          I think that they would have

15   standing, but it's still a claim that's beyond the scope

16   of this narrow specific judicial review proceeding.                     I

17   think its' a -- it's a different problem.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     I have to say -- I

19   think it comes with less than good grace for you to

20   criticize the other side for not having raised a

21   particular argument.      But I do want to clarify that you

22   have no objection at this point for reversing the Ninth

23   Circuit on the ground that they erred in saying that

24   this -- they should have dismissed on jurisdictional

25   grounds.

 1               MR. PALMORE:            Well, I'm not going to resist

 2   that too strenuously, -- but I think if they did decide

 3   the question, they decided it correctly.                     It was a

 4   threshold defect.     Their analysis was all correct.                     So I

 5   think that's before the Court.

 6               But yes, we -- we frankly acknowledge and we

 7   acknowledged in our brief that we did not -- we did

 8   suggest below that this was a jurisdictional defect.

 9   Ninth Circuit authority said that it was and we relied

10   on that.

11               We now believe that it's best understood not

12   as a jurisdictional defect, but as a substantive defect

13   in the claims, not simply a choice of remedies issue, as

14   Petitioners suggests because choice of remedy suggests

15   that there has been a constitutional wrong and that we

16   need to decide what remedy is going to be available, an

17   injunction or damages.

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  The short answer is,

19   yes, reach the merits only if I win.                     That -- that's

20   really what you want us to do.

21               MR. PALMORE:            Well, we -- we think you could

22   reach some of the merits.             We think that the narrow

23   disposition here is actually the capacity -

24               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  No, no, no.     I need to

 1   the merits if we're going to have you lose?                       You got to

 2   want one or the other.

 3                  Do you want us to reach the merits, period,

 4   is really the question?

 5                  MR. PALMORE:         Yes.        Our position is that

 6   we're not acquiescing in a -- in a remand.                       We think you

 7   can affirm, and you should affirm.                       However, I do

 8   recognize -

 9                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Do you think we should

10   reach the merits, which is a very different question?

11                  MR. PALMORE:         Well, it depends on what you

12   mean by "merits."

13                  (Laughter.)

14                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Only if you win, right?

15                  MR. PALMORE:         There is the taking -- no.

16   There is the underlying kind of takings claim, that

17   there was -- was there a taking here at all.                          And that's

18   not before the Court.         I don't think anyone suggests

19   that that's before the Court.

20                  But we do -- we do think that there are a

21   series of other threshold defects in the claim that this

 1              ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL

 2                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 3                MR. McCONNELL:              I'd like to make two quick

 4   points.   One is that I believe that the government has

 5   essentially conceded here in this argument and in their

 6   brief that the Tucker Act does not apply.                  They have

 7   told us that the Tucker Act does not apply on page 50

 8   and repeated here when Congress could not have

 9   contemplated a compensation.                Now, in addition -- and

10   their only answer to that is to say, first, that

11   Congress didn't think it would be a taking, which in

12   Regional Rail, this Court said is not the question.

13                And secondly, that if -- if there's one -

14   we should get paid once, compensation once and then the

15   administrator's going to cancel the program, which is no

16   answer at all.     Either the statute contemplates

17   compensation for everybody or it contemplates it for

18   nobody.

19                I think they have effectively conceded that

20   the Tucker Act does not apply.

21                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 Well, they've conceded

22   that it doesn't apply to handlers.

23                MR. McCONNELL:              To handlers.     And -

24                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 Yes, and so they've

25   conceded there is no -

 1                  MR. McCONNELL:            And the second issue I

 2   wanted to talk about so is this capacity issue.

 3   Certainly, we have standing.                When -- it's not

 4   third-party standing.         All of the money comes out of our

 5   pocket, yes, we have standing.                  And secondly, we

 6   certainly -- and then that is in our capacity as

 7   handler.

 8                  Essentially, the Department of Agriculture's

 9   view is that during those couple of days when the

10   raisins are going through our packing plant, that we

11   acquired them and possessed them during those couple of

12   days and that we should have given them their -- their

13   share.     That's raisins, that's not money.                    But by the

14   time they get around to enforcing that and so forth, the

15   raisins are gone and now the money stands in -- stands

16   in for the raisins.       But that is a taking claim.

17                  We think it's a -- it's a straightforward

18   taking claim under -- under Norwood and Missouri Pacific

19   Railroad, that's a merits question.                       But in any event,

20   it is not a problem of capacity.                    Whatever might be,

21   that taking, that taking is in the capacity as a

22   handler.

23                  Those are my two points.

24                  Thank you.

25                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

                                        57
