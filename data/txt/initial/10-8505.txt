3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 We'll hear argument

4    next in Case 10-8505, Williams v. Illinois.

5                Mr. Carroll.

6                ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN W. CARROLL

7                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8                MR. CARROLL:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9    please the Court:

10               In this case, Sandra Lambatos testified that

11   Mr. Williams' DNA matched a DNA profile that, according

12   to assertions made by analysts from the Cellmark labs,

13   was the genetic description of the purported offender.

14               Because no one from Cellmark appeared at Mr.

15   Williams' trial, Lambatos' testimony conveying the

16   testimonial statements from Cellmark violated Mr.

17   Williams' rights under the Confrontation Clause.                For

18   these reasons, the Illinois Supreme Court's decision

19   should be reversed.

20               Now, Ms. Williams' -- or Ms. Lambatos'

21   testimony on direct examination clearly conveyed

22   Cellmark's statements.       She testified that the vaginal

23   swab and blood sample from the victim were sent from --

24   to Cellmark for DNA analysis.             She later was asked, was

25   there a computer match generated from the male DNA


                                       3

1    profile found in the semen from the vaginal swabs of the

2    victim and the male DNA profile that had been identified

3    as having originated from Mr. Williams?

4                   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Counsel, it hasn't been

5    the focus of the briefing, but you've just made it the

6    focus here.     I know that you've been claiming that her

7    statements about what constituted the Cellmark lab

8    results are a statement that violates the Confrontation

9    Clause.     But are you taking the position that her

10   statements and the admission of the documents, mailing

11   the lab sample to the laboratory, and them getting it

12   back, that all of those business records were improperly

13   admitted?

14                 MR. CARROLL:      As --

15                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Because she testified

16   that in her records she sees that her lab -- and she

17   says -- I think those records were produced; I could be

18   wrong -- that --

19                 MR. CARROLL:      Yes, the shipping records were

20   produced.

21                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          They were produced and

22   admitted into evidence.        That the lab sample taken from

23   the victim, L.J., was mailed to the laboratory and that

24   it came back.

25                 Are you taking the position that those


                                       4

1    shipping documents were not business records?             Are you

2    taking the position that those were improperly admitted?

3                 MR. CARROLL:      No, Your Honor, at this stage,

4    we are not challenging the admission of the shipping

5    records.

6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, that would just show

7    that the material went to and came back from the lab.

8    It wouldn't show what the lab results were.             It was the

9    results that she testified to, right?

10                MR. CARROLL:      That's correct, Your Honor.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:         And what other evidence was

12   there of the results besides her testimony?

13                MR. CARROLL:      There was no other evidence.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:         No other.

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           In the case of the blood

16   that was tested in the police lab, there the person who

17   was testing did testify at the trial, right?            It wasn't

18   just Lambatos -- Lambatos, but the one who had tested

19   the blood?

20                MR. CARROLL:      The -- the person who

21   tested or who analyzed Mr. Williams' blood did testify

22   live at the trial.

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Yes.

24                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Abbinanti testified that

25   she did the blood test and it went into the State

1    database with reference to the other crime, not this

2    crime; am I correct?

3                 MR. CARROLL:     Yes, Your Honor.        The -- when

4    he was arrested for an unrelated matter.

5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But she's an expert.   She

6    testified how she did the test and what the -- and that

7    she put the DNA result into -- into the data bank.

8                 MR. CARROLL:     That's correct, Your Honor.

9                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Hasn't it long been accepted

10   that experts may testify to the facts that form the

11   basis for their opinions on the ground that when the

12   experts go over those facts, they are not -- those --

13   that information is not being introduced to prove the

14   truth of the matter asserted, that -- the truth of those

15   underlying facts; only that those are the facts that the

16   expert has relied on in reaching an opinion?           And that

17   has not been considered to be hearsay.

18                Now, do you argue that those -- that that's

19   incorrect?   Those -- those statements cannot be

20   testified to as an -- by an expert without their

21   constituting either hearsay or testimony within the

22   meaning of the Confrontation Clause?

23                MR. CARROLL:     In this case, where the --

24   where the basis evidence the expert testifies to, where

25   it's -- the expert's opinion depends on that -- those


                                     6

1    statements being considered true, in those instances

2    then, yes, we are arguing that the Confrontation Clause

3    does not allow --

4                  JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, let's say that -- let

5    me put it this way:      Let's say the expert -- people from

6    the -- the expert testifies, I received the -- I looked

7    at the report from -- from the lab; I looked at the

8    report from -- I looked at the report from Cellmark, the

9    outside lab; I looked at the report that we did; and

10   there -- there is a match.

11                 And so, the expert is -- is mentioning facts

12   that form the basis of the opinion but not testifying to

13   the truth of those.      Is that a violation of the

14   Confrontation Clause at that point?

15                 MR. CARROLL:      If the -- the expert is not,

16   you know, asserting that the statements are true, then

17   no.   However, that's not what happened in this case,

18   Your Honor.   Ms. Lambatos --

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, it would be utterly

20   irrelevant, would it not, if the statements were not

21   true?   I mean, it's one thing for an expert to testify

22   about a hypothetical, you know:            Assuming this, this,

23   this, Mr. Expert, what would the result be?            Well, on

24   those assumptions, it would be this.

25                 But this was not -- nobody asked -- asked

1    her to assume those things at all.                 She testified

2    that -- that she had a match between what she had done

3    and what had been done on the -- on the DNA of this

4    individual by somebody else.

5                 MR. CARROLL:       That's correct.

6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          That seems to me quite

7    different from the -- from the ordinary hypothetical put

8    to an expert.

9                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Yes, I would have

10   thought -- yes.   You can -- sorry, go ahead.

11                MR. CARROLL:       No, I was just going to --

12                JUSTICE BREYER:          You were going to agree

13   with that.   And --

14                (Laughter.)

15                JUSTICE BREYER:          I know.       I mean, I'm sure

16   you've looked at this probably.            But the most -- one of

17   the more interesting things I've found in these briefs

18   were the references to Wigmore.            So, I went back and

19   read what Wigmore said about scientific evidence, expert

20   evidence, and business records.            And he certainly

21   concedes and agrees with Justice Scalia, and those

22   opinions are filled with hearsay.             I mean, there's no

23   expert who isn't relying on what his teachers told him

24   in college, which reflects dozens of out-of-court

25   statements given to dozens of people who wrote them up


                                       8

1    in books.

2                So, expert opinion is always based on

3    hearsay, almost, and -- and so are business records.

4    They are filled with hearsay.          But Wigmore writes a

5    treatise, doesn't he, where he says exceptions have been

6    recognized since the 17th century or earlier to cover

7    that kind of material?

8                So, my question for you is why shouldn't we

9    recognize a similar, related kind of exception here?

10   We're trying to discover the meaning of "testimonial."

11   The difference here is a police lab or a lab that

12   reports to a police lab.     The individuals there probably

13   know that there is a fairly good chance that what they

14   say will be used in a criminal trial.           They don't know

15   it for sure, but they're controlled by the canons, by

16   accreditation, by tests of reliability, by the fact that

17   they're not normally interested in the results of a

18   trial, as here they couldn't care less; they don't even

19   care if it is used in a trial.

20               And all the Wigmore factors for both

21   exceptions could support a similar exception here, which

22   would have the following virtue:          It would have the

23   virtue of not requiring 10 people to come in and

24   testify, whom the defense is, of course, free to call;

25   and it would also have the virtue of removing the


                                    9

 1   temptation for prosecutors to stop relying on the more

 2   reliable evidence, DNA, and instead encourage them to

 3   rely on the less reliable evidence; namely, the

 4   eyewitness testimony in a case.

 5                  Now, that -- that really is all my questions

 6   in one.

 7                  (Laughter.)

 8                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Because I understand every

 9   argument you're making as fitting it in with hearsay.            I

10   agree with that.    And I also agree to a degree with the

11   testimonial point.     And I see the need for an exception,

12   and Wigmore provides all the reasons, and since we're

13   interpreting that word "testimonial," don't we have the

14   power, and why shouldn't we create one out of the word

15   "testimonial"?

16               MR. CARROLL:        Well, Your Honor, because the

17   Confrontation Clause guarantees the defendant the right

18   to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him,

19   and that's the reason why this Court should not make an

20   exception --

21               JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, I'll go further in

22   your direction --

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:           You're not objecting to

24   hearsay, are you, counsel?          You're objecting to a

25   violation of the Confrontation Clause --

 1                MR. CARROLL:       That's right.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:          -- which is quite different

 3   from what -- what Mr. Wigmore was writing about, which

 4   was hearsay.

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:          Yes, but Wigmore actually

 6   believed that the Confrontation Clause simply

 7   encapsulated the hearsay rule.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:          We've said the contrary,

 9   though, haven't we?

10               (Laughter.)

11               JUSTICE BREYER:           I'm asking you the

12   question, and I -- I'll go further in your direction.

13   I'll go further, because I would say what about saying

14   this:   that not only do we recognize the exception, but

15   it isn't a full exception; that if the defendant can

16   show some reason to believe that either the laboratory

17   is not properly accredited, it isn't doing things

18   properly; or that the individual technician has

19   something personal or knows about -- about the defendant

20   that makes it suspect, immediately the presumption that

21   the exception applies disappears, and the prosecutor has

22   to call the -- the witness.

23               You can say, well, we shouldn't make that

24   up, but I believe if you go back to the 18th century,

25   you'll discover that your interpretation of the

 1   Confrontation Clause was not there.                 So -- so, that's

 2   what's basing my question, and I'd like your reaction.

 3   It's a long question, considers an exception, and I'd

 4   like you to give me your reaction to that.

 5                 MR. CARROLL:       Well, Your Honor, I think that

 6   this Court's decisions in Crawford and Melendez-Diaz and

 7   Bullcoming largely foreclose on making such an

 8   exception.    The --

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Justice Breyer dissented

10   from those opinions.

11                (Laughter.)

12                JUSTICE BREYER:           I did, but I --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- Justice Breyer's

14   dissent.

15                JUSTICE BREYER:           And I mean it because I see

16   extending those cases from one individual from a

17   laboratory being familiar with the results to requiring,

18   in ordinary cases, the calling of what could be up to 10

19   technicians -- I see that as making a sea change in

20   normal criminal law practices, and my motive is as I

21   said:   I fear it will push the system in the direction

22   of relying on less reliable eyewitness testimony rather

23   than more reliable technical laboratory DNA-type

24   evidence.    Now, you have my -- I've made the point, and

25   I really want to get your response.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Mr. Carroll, are we

 2   talking about 10 witnesses?        I thought we were talking

 3   about just one witness, from Cellmark.

 4               MR. CARROLL:     Yes, on this record, Your

 5   Honor, the -- the statements that were produced were the

 6   statements of the authors of the report.          So --

 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          That's 1 person, not 10.

 8               MR. CARROLL:     I believe there are two

 9   signatories to the report.

10               JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, 10 isn't -- 10 is not

11   a far-fetched hypothetical.        We have an amicus brief

12   from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office and the

13   New York City Chief Medical Examiner's Office, and they

14   say that their very fine crime lab involves at least 12

15   technicians in the analysis of DNA.

16               They break it down that way because it

17   increases accuracy; it decreases the chance of any

18   favoritism for the prosecution.         And they say that if --

19   it is impossible for us to bring all 12 of those

20   technicians into court to testify in every case in which

21   there is DNA evidence, and if we have to do that, we

22   will just not be able to use DNA evidence in court.          We

23   will have to rely on less reliable evidence.

24               Is that just a -- do you think that's just a

25   practical consequence that we have to accept under

 1   Crawford?

 2               MR. CARROLL:     No, Your Honor, because even

 3   in the worst-case scenario described in the New York

 4   County's brief, not all 12 people in that situation make

 5   testimonial statements, and not all 12 people's

 6   testimonial statements are presented at trial.          The

 7   Confrontation -- for the Confrontation Clause to be

 8   satisfied, it is only those witness who the prosecution

 9   chooses to present at trial who must testify.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:        It's up to the prosecutor

11   which of those 12 he wants to bring in, whether he wants

12   to bring in all 12 or just 1.          If he thinks the jury

13   will be sufficiently persuaded by bringing in just one,

14   he can bring in just one, right?

15               MR. CARROLL:     That's correct, Your Honor.

16               JUSTICE ALITO:       How will bringing in --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:        But he has to bring in the

18   one and not -- and not hearsay about what the one would

19   say.

20               JUSTICE ALITO:       How will bringing in one

21   satisfy the Confrontation Clause problem?          If 12 people

22   perform steps in the analysis and 1 person testifies

23   about what 11 other people did, don't you have the same

24   Confrontation Clause problem?

25               MR. CARROLL:     No, Your Honor.       Again, it's

 1   who's testifying.

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:       You don't?

 3                MR. CARROLL:     No, we don't, because the

 4   question is, whose statement is being presented?          Now,

 5   given the five steps in the brief, the electrophoresis

 6   step, the person who does the DNA typing and determines

 7   what alleles are present in the sample, that person

 8   probably has to testify because that's really what the

 9   results are, what alleles are present.

10                The amplification step, the person who, you

11   know, copies the DNA and tags it -- I don't think that's

12   a testimonial statement.      And in this case, no

13   statements from someone who did that was presented.

14                Next step, quantization --

15                JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, why is that not a

16   testimonial statement?

17                MR. CARROLL:     Well, just performing a test

18   is not a testimonial statement.          And just stating --

19                JUSTICE ALITO:       If the -- if the person were

20   in court, the person would say this is what I did.

21                MR. CARROLL:     If the person was in court

22   and --

23                JUSTICE ALITO:       And that's not testimony?

24                MR. CARROLL:     In that case, it would be

25   testimony.   However, that person doesn't have to testify

 1   in order for the State to present its evidence.            If the

 2   State chooses to present that person's testimonial

 3   statement at trial, then, yes, the Confrontation Clause

 4   would require them to present that testimony live.

 5   However --

 6                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Mr. Carroll, I -- I'm just

 7   trying to figure out -- this out, and I'm -- here's my

 8   question:    Suppose you had two witnesses, one from --

 9   one who had done the lab analysis on Mr. Williams and

10   one who had done the lab analysis from the victim.           And

11   they both testify.    And now an expert comes in, and the

12   expert says, I've looked at both reports, and there's a

13   match.

14                Now, there would be no problem at all with

15   that; is that right?

16                MR. CARROLL:      That's correct, Your Honor.

17                JUSTICE KAGAN:        Okay.     So, now we only have

18   one of the lab technicians, and we take away the other

19   lab technician.    And what you are saying is, well, now

20   we have this expert, and she's saying she could do a

21   match, but the question is a match of what?           That's the

22   question, right?

23                MR. CARROLL:      That's correct, Your Honor.

24                JUSTICE KAGAN:        So, why is that a

25   Confrontation Clause issue?          Why isn't it just that the

 1   prosecutor has failed to prove an element of his case?

 2                 MR. CARROLL:     It's a Confrontation Clause

 3   issue because the prosecution presented the statements

 4   of the person who did the analysis on the victim's

 5   vaginal swab.

 6                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, is that right?      I

 7   mean, I thought that the judge here said:             No, I'm not

 8   taking this for the truth of the matter asserted; I'm

 9   only taking your statements about the lab tests as an

10   indication, as -- as the basis for your opinion.             So,

11   I'm listening to your opinion.

12                 The problem is in this whole case, there has

13   been no factual testimony about what the results were

14   from the swab on the victim.             Isn't that right?

15                 MR. CARROLL:     Well --

16                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Or am I missing something?

17                 MR. CARROLL:     You are missing something,

18   Your Honor.    And the trial judge in this case never

19   stated he was not considering the evidence for its

20   truth.   No place in the record does it -- the trial

21   judge state that.    And, in fact, in the finding of

22   facts, he states that he was convinced of the -- that

23   there was a match because the evidence from the experts

24   established that victim -- that Williams' semen was

25   found on the victim.     And he notes that, well, Cellmark


                                     17
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   was an accredited lab.     If he wasn't considering

 2   Cellmark's statement for the truth, he wouldn't care if

 3   they were accredited.

 4               JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, what did the Illinois

 5   appellate court say about that, about whether the

 6   information was -- whether the evidence was admitted for

 7   the truth of the matter asserted?

 8               MR. CARROLL:     The appellate court held, as a

 9   matter of Illinois law, these statements -- statements

10   that serve as the basis of an expert's opinion are

11   generally deemed not to be admitted for their truth.

12               However, in this case, there's no meaningful

13   distinction between considering Cellmark's statements

14   to -- you know, in assisting the evaluation of Lambatos'

15   testimony and considering it for its truth.      If the

16   statements weren't true, then Lambatos' testimony would

17   not link Williams' DNA to the crime.

18               JUSTICE ALITO:       Isn't -- but isn't Justice

19   Kagan's question there the correct question?      Isn't that

20   a question of Illinois evidence law, not a Federal

21   constitutional question?

22               MR. CARROLL:     No, Your Honor.

23               JUSTICE ALITO:       Was there sufficient -- was

24   a sufficient foundation laid for the introduction of the

25   -- of the expert's testimony?

 1                  MR. CARROLL:     No, Your Honor.

 2                  JUSTICE ALITO:       That was -- that was

 3   addressed by the -- by the Illinois court?

 4                  MR. CARROLL:     No, Your Honor.           The question

 5   here isn't whether the State's evidence was sufficient.

 6   It's whether the evidence the State did present violated

 7   Mr. Williams' rights under the Confrontation Clause.

 8                  Now, this -- I can give an example or an

 9   analogy.   Suppose a police officer were to testify:                 A

10   witness gave me this photograph and told me this is a

11   photograph of the offender.           I compared this photograph

12   to a photograph of the defendant.             I found that they

13   matched.

14                Now, the police officer -- he compared the

15   photographs.    You know, we're not contesting Lambatos'

16   match.   But the statement that this is a photo of the

17   offender, that's not the officer's statement.                 That's a

18   statement of the witness who gave him that photograph.

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But that's just

20   because the photographing is something that people

21   wouldn't dispute.    I mean, what if the State presents

22   testimony saying, I took the sample; I put it in the

23   sample case; I sent it to Cellmark saying give us a DNA

24   analysis of this sample; we got back from Cellmark the

25   analysis with the same name on it?                 And the expert

 1   testifies, I compared that to DNA from the defendant,

 2   and it was a match.

 3                  You would be free in cross-examining to say:

 4   Do you know what they did at Cellmark?

 5                  And she would say:          Well, they're a DNA lab;

 6   we asked them to do a DNA analysis.

 7                  But do you know what happened?

 8                  No, I don't.

 9                  As far as you know, do they -- did they just

10   ignore it and not do anything?

11               Well, yes, I didn't -- I'm not testifying to

12   what happened at Cellmark.          I'm just telling you we sent

13   the DNA there, and this is what we got back.

14               Why is that not perfectly fine?

15               MR. CARROLL:        Because that person's

16   testimony that the results we got back were connected to

17   the samples we sent --

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 They did not -- she

19   does not say that.     She said:          We sent the sample marked

20   "crime scene" or whatever it was.             We got back a data

21   sheet that said "crime scene."

22               Well, Expert, do you know that they didn't

23   mix them up?

24               No, I don't.        All I know is what we sent and

25   what we got back.

 1                 MR. CARROLL:     Your Honor, I still believe

 2   that would be a Confrontation Clause violation because

 3   the writing on the data sheet that said "crime scene," a

 4   person at Cellmark had to write that down on the data

 5   sheet.    So, someone from Cellmark was making a

 6   representation that that data sheet is connected to

 7   this --

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              And all the witness

 9   is -- all the witness is testifying to is what they sent

10   and what they got back.       And you're free to

11   cross-examine about what went on at Cellmark, and a jury

12   is free to say, well, I believe the circumstantial

13   evidence about what happened.            Or the defense counsel

14   can say, why don't they have anybody here from Cellmark?

15   And a jury can say, well, yes, that's a good point.

16                It just seems to me that nobody from

17   Cellmark is testifying, and what you're -- that's what

18   you're objecting to, but they don't need that testimony

19   to present the expert's conclusion to the jury.

20                MR. CARROLL:      Well, Your Honor,

21   hypothetically, the State could -- I believe the State

22   could present its evidence through circumstantial

23   evidence, but that's not what happened in this case.

24   Lambatos did testify that -- she didn't simply state

25   that I got a profile back.         She testified, I got a

 1   profile that was the male DNA profile found in the semen

 2   from the vaginal swab.

 3                 That's a statement from Cellmark.                That's

 4   not Lambatos' statement.          And --

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:              And she -- and she goes

 6   further.    She says:      And based on that, which I believe

 7   to be true.    She didn't say that, but this is the

 8   implication.     Based on that, which I believe to be true,

 9   this belongs to Williams.           This DNA is Williams's DNA.

10                 And if she weren't relying on the truth of

11   the assertion from Cellmark, it would be irrelevant for

12   the jury.   Isn't that your point?

13                 MR. CARROLL:        That's correct, Your Honor.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:           That's true whenever --

15   whenever an expert -- an expert makes a statement.

16   There is a conceptual difference between their

17   testifying to something out of court for its truth and

18   that being the basis for the expert opinion.                 In the one

19   case, she's relying upon a statement in order to form

20   her opinion; and in the other case, she's introducing

21   the statement.    And you're saying, in this case, that's

22   a distinction without a difference.                  Isn't that what's

23   going on?

24                 MR. CARROLL:        That's correct, Your Honor.

 1   is the conceptual difference.            And as long as there is

 2   that conceptual difference, don't we have a basis for

 3   distinguishing this case from Melendez?

 4               MR. CARROLL:      I do not believe so, Your

 5   Honor.   Had -- had Cellmark's statements been presented

 6   in the report itself, the report being admitted itself,

 7   I think there would be no question that that was a --

 8   that would be a violation of the clause under

 9   Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming.            The fact that the same

10   statements were coming in for the same evidentiary

11   reason through the live testimony of Lambatos shouldn't

12   change that situation.     It's the same statements coming

13   in for the same reason.

14               If there's any more -- I'll --

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, you're -- you're

16   saying that the State of Illinois case is weaker here

17   than in Melendez, where they had a certificate, and in

18   Bullcoming, where they had somebody from the lab testify

19   as to lab procedures.     Here they have neither.           And,

20   yet, Illinois somehow says it comes in.

12                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          I'm changing the facts.

13                 MS. ALVAREZ:      -- and if she had --

14                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Under your theory, she

15   could have introduced the lab report?

16                 MS. ALVAREZ:      If we offered her -- the

17   Cellmark report into evidence for the truth of the

18   matter asserted, it would be a different situation.

19                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          I don't understand the

20   difference.    Meaning, the fact that you didn't

21   physically introduce the report makes a difference?

22                 MS. ALVAREZ:      The -- Ms. Lambatos testified

23   consistent with the Confrontation Clause here.           She

24   testified --

25                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          She testified that she

 1   reviewed lab samples --

 2                MS. ALVAREZ:     As an expert.

 3                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- that matched the

 4   defendant.   So, what's the difference between that and

 5   saying I have the report in my hand, I match that report

 6   with the Williams report, and this is my conclusion?

 7                MS. ALVAREZ:     She did not parrot the

 8   Cellmark report, as we had seen in Bullcoming.              She did

 9   not testify that Cellmark said this was the defendant's

10   profile, that Cellmark said this was a match.              She did

11   much more.

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         No.      She said that

13   Cellmark said this is L.J.'s vaginal swab DNA.

14                MS. ALVAREZ:     Right.

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So, she said that.

16                MS. ALVAREZ:     Because the vaginal swab that

17   was taken from the victim -- and there was a -- there

18   was a chain of custody here and proper foundation that

19   was laid -- the vaginal swab that was taken from the

20   victim, and this bore out through the business records

21   that came in on the shipping manifest that --

22                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So, what's the

23   difference between this and Justice Kennedy's question

24   about Bullcoming?   Could the expert in Bullcoming have

25   said, as one of the amici here said, that all they would

 1   have had to do in Bullcoming is to read or to give a

 2   report that gave the blood alcohol content, the .5 or

 3   .10 or whatever it was, and have an expert come in and

 4   say that number shows he's drunk?

 5                  MS. ALVAREZ:     Well, if the --

 6                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Is that any different

 7   than this situation?

 8                  MS. ALVAREZ:     If the expert in Bullcoming

 9   did more than what he simply did in Bullcoming -- and

10   that was just simply read the report and testify that

11   that's what that lab did.         If he actually did his own

12   independent analysis based on his expertise, based on

13   his skill --

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            No, no.   The only part

15   of his expertise is the report says point .10; I'm not

16   offering it for the truth; I'm assuming if that's true,

17   then he was legally drunk.

18               MS. ALVAREZ:        If he were -- if he were to

19   give his independent opinion, based on his analysis and

20   what he had done, then we would have seen a situation

21   closer --

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            He has done nothing.

23               MS. ALVAREZ:        -- closer to this.

24               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            All the report did was

25   give a number.    And the supervisor comes in and says

 1   that number violates -- is legal drunkenness.

 2                  MS. ALVAREZ:     Well, if the --

 3                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          How is that different

 4   from that?

 5                  MS. ALVAREZ:     If that -- if that report is

 6   being used, is being offered to prove the truth of the

 7   matter asserted --

 8                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          All right, but you're

 9   not telling me why that's not the same here, because he

10   -- what this expert said is the Cellmark report is from

11   this victim.    So, it's the same set of numbers as in

12   Bullcoming.    Now he's taking a step and saying, instead

13   of legal drunkenness, it matches someone else's that I

14   took.

15                 MS. ALVAREZ:      But, no, what happened here

16   was Ms. Lambatos testified based -- and gave her own

17   independent expert opinion based on her skills, her

18   knowledge, her expertise.         She relied --

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           You -- you said

20   "independent," and I don't -- you said that in your

21   brief.   I don't understand how Lambatos's testimony can

22   be independent of the test results supplied.             I mean,

23   it's based on the test results.             She -- it can't be

24   independent of them because it's entirely dependent on

25   them.

 1                MS. ALVAREZ:      But an expert can always

 2   testify about the material that they relied on, whether

 3   that material is ever admitted into evidence, and

 4   sometimes that material could never be admitted into

 5   evidence.    But she, in fact, testified to what she

 6   relied on, in addition to what --

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:         No, but didn't she say, I

 8   relied on stuff that I received from -- from Caremark --

 9   whatever the name of the lab was?

10                MS. ALVAREZ:      Cellmark.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:         She said:      I -- I relied on

12   material that was a swab containing the DNA, the -- the

13   sperm of this particular individual.              And she did not

14   know that.

15                MS. ALVAREZ:      She testified that she relied

16   on those materials, and she can testify --

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:         She didn't just say, I got

18   something back from the lab, and I relied on whatever

19   that said.   No, she said what she had gotten back from

20   the lab, and she did not know, of her personal

21   knowledge, that it was what she said it was.

22                MS. ALVAREZ:      She knew from the -- the

23   procedures and the chain of custody and the shipping

24   manifest that what was sent initially to Cellmark after

25   preliminary tests were done at the Illinois State police

 1   crime lab showing the presence of sperm, that it was

 2   sent to Cellmark, and it was analyzed at Cellmark and

 3   came back from --

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:          She didn't know if they had

 5   incompetent people there.        The last case we had

 6   involving this kind of an issue, the reason they didn't

 7   bring in the lab technician to testify was that he had

 8   been fired in the interim for some reason which we

 9   didn't know, but it was pretty clear why -- why he would

10   not have been a very good witness.                We don't know how

11   good this lab was.    We don't know how good the

12   individuals who did the test were.

13               And that's why it's up to the State to bring

14   forward testimony saying what the lab did.                And the only

15   testimony they brought forward was the testimony of this

16   witness who was not there.

17               MS. ALVAREZ:       The testimony of Ms. Lambatos

18   satisfies the Confrontation Clause because she is the --

19   the witness against the accused in this case, and the

20   fact that she testifies that she relies on material that

21   was generated by Cellmark does not make Cellmark the

22   witness against the accused.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:          If she said that, I would

24   agree with you.   But she said more than that.               She said,

25   I relied on material provided by Cellmark which is....

 1   And then she described what that material was, and she

 2   had no personal knowledge of that.

 3                MS. ALVAREZ:      She had no personal knowledge

 4   of that, and that came through during this

 5   cross-examination.    Ms. Lambatos was subjected to a

 6   very -- quite lengthy and a quite -- a specific

 7   cross-examination.

 8                JUSTICE ALITO:        Well, there are two types of

 9   evidence that are -- that are involved here.          One is

10   chain of custody evidence.         Was the result that was sent

11   back the result that was done on the sample that was

12   sent to Cellmark?    That's just purely chain of custody.

13   That has nothing whatsoever to do with the -- the

14   accuracy or the professionalism of what was done at

15   Cellmark.   And she did make a statement.         She did say

16   that the sample -- that the result that came back from

17   Cellmark was -- was done -- was based on a test of the

18   vaginal swab that was sent there.

19                The other has to do with what Cellmark did,

20   how well they did it.      She didn't say anything about

21   that.

22                Now, as to the chain of custody, if that's

23   testimonial, isn't -- isn't it simply duplicative of the

24   very strong circumstantial evidence regarding the chain

25   of custody, the sending of it out with certain markings

 1   and the receipt back with certain markings?

 2                 MS. ALVAREZ:     Right.        The -- the chain of

 3   custody was -- was strong -- was strong in this case,

 4   the evidence that was presented through the shipping

 5   manifest, through the other witnesses that testified in

 6   this case.    The -- the fact that Ms. Lambatos testified

 7   that she did not know exactly what they did at

 8   Cellmark -- again, as an expert, she was able to talk

 9   about what material she relied on, the Cellmark

10   materials.    The Cellmark materials were never --

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But the -- the chain of --

12   the chain of custody are just supporting actors.            The

13   key actor in the play, the Hamlet in the play, is the

14   person who did the test at Cellmark, and she or he is

15   not here.    And if you want to say, oh, this is not --

16   tell the jury, now, we're not saying that this is

17   admitted for the truth, we're not saying that this is

18   Williams' DNA, the judge would say, well, then it's

19   irrelevant, it's excluded.

20                 MS. ALVAREZ:     But the matching --

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And it seems to me, in --

22   as in response to Justice Scalia, that not only does he

23   indicate that this is hard to distinguish from

24   Bullcoming; in Bullcoming, at least you had an expert

25   say how the laboratory works.            Here, you don't even have

 2                MS. ALVAREZ:     Well --

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You have less here with

 4   reference to Cellmark than you did in Bullcoming.

 5                MS. ALVAREZ:     Ms. Lambatos did testify both

 6   on direct examination and cross-examination that

 7   Cellmark was an accredited lab.            The Illinois State

 8   Police crime lab routinely uses -- outsources --

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, in Bullcoming, we

10   said that was not sufficient.           And in that case, the

11   person was from that lab.

12                MS. ALVAREZ:     But -- but Ms. Lambatos -- we

13   never introduced any Cellmark reports in this case.

14   There were no testimonial statements conveyed through

15   her testimony.   There were no out-of-court statements

16   used to prove the truth of the matter asserted.

17                What was presented was the expert opinion of

18   Ms. Lambatos, who was a duly qualified expert in -- in

19   forensic biology, in DNA.       And not only did she have the

20   ability to look at the Cellmark material; she

21   interpreted the material that -- that came from

22   Cellmark.   And what came from Cellmark, the

23   electropherogram, what I would submit to you is not

24   testimonial -- it's a machine-generated chart that, to

25   the naked eye, to a trier of fact means absolutely

 1   nothing unless an expert actually interprets that.            And

 2   Ms. Lambatos testified to how she interpreted that.            She

 3   talks about the alleles and the peaks --

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I don't know how that's

 5   any different from Bullcoming and Melendez-Diaz.

 6                MS. ALVAREZ:     I -- well, Melendez-Diaz, what

 7   we had in Melendez-Diaz was, in fact, a certificate, an

 8   affidavit.   It was -- it was -- it was created --

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           In other words, you had

10   something more than you have here; and, therefore, it

11   goes out and this comes in?         That doesn't make sense.

12                MS. ALVAREZ:     No, I think in Melendez-Diaz,

13   it's clear because that was -- that report was drafted,

14   created, for the primary purpose of being used as

15   substitute of live testimony.           I submit to you that the

16   Cellmark reports were not.        The electropherogram, again,

17   which would need expert interpretation; the allele

18   chart, again, I would submit is not testimonial, that

19   those reports were not created in lieu of live

20   testimony.

21                And Ms. Lambatos looked at that.          She

22   interpreted it.   In fact, she even said that there was

23   something on the electropherogram that she didn't agree

24   with Cellmark on, and it was a certain one peak that was

25   higher that she felt was, just in her expert opinion,

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          If the report had been

 3   introduced, the Cellmark report, it would be

 4   testimonial; is that -- is that right?

 5                 MS. ALVAREZ:     Well, I -- I believe if -- if

 6   the State had tried to introduce that Cellmark report --

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Yes.     Right.

 8                 MS. ALVAREZ:     -- it would have been offered

19   introducing it for the truth, then it's not relevant.

20                 MS. ALVAREZ:     Right.       I think the key is the

21   use.   How are these statements used?             How are these

22   reports used?    And in this particular case, they were

23   not used to prove the truth of the matter asserted.

24   They were used for the limited purpose of explaining the

 2                JUSTICE KAGAN:         How do we know that, Ms.

 3   Alvarez?    Is there a statement from the finder of fact,

 4   who's the trial judge here, that he's understanding her

 5   testimony to be not for the truth of the matter

 6   asserted?   What's the best evidence that that's what the

 7   court was thinking?

 8                MS. ALVAREZ:       There is.          And in the joint

 9   appendix on page 172, the language from the trier of

10   fact, he says just that, that he's considering these for

11   the limited purpose.      In fact, the Illinois appellate

12   court also affirmed, stating that this evidence came in

13   for a limited purpose, as well as the Illinois --

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             It's the limited purpose

15   of -- of explaining the basis for her opinion.               But her

16   opinion is that this is matched to Lambatos.

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Her opinion is that this

19   is a match to Lambatos.        But if -- if the match material

20   isn't admitted for the truth of the matter asserted or

21   isn't considered for the matter asserted, then that

22   testimony is irrelevant and meaningless.

23                MS. ALVAREZ:       Well, not irrelevant, but I

 1   a bench trial.    It was a judge.          But if in fact the

 2   State presents the evidence in the way that was -- we

 3   presented it here, we're always taking the chance that

 4   it would weaken the -- the case.             And it has to be

 5   considered for the weight to be given to Ms. Lambatos'

 6   testimony.

 7                JUSTICE KAGAN:         Suppose the State had not

 8   presented evidence of the shipments, so that you didn't

 9   even have that.   Would -- at that point, should the

10   judge have just thrown out the case?

11                MS. ALVAREZ:       No, Your Honor.       I would say

12   no.   I believe there was the testimony of the victim in

13   this case, who identifies this defendant as the

14   perpetrator in -- in this rape.            In addition, the judge

15   made a finding when -- in his ruling.              The trier of fact

16   said that he believed her 100 percent, and he found her

17   extremely credible.

18                JUSTICE KAGAN:         But I guess what I'm trying

19   to suggest is that if there's no evidence in the case

20   that the -- that the match is to the victim, where is

21   your case?

22                MS. ALVAREZ:       Well, then we probably would

23   have problems with the Illinois evidentiary rules and --

24   and the law in Illinois.

25                We obviously presented in this case a

 1   sufficient chain, a sufficient foundation, to show

 2   where -- when that -- we -- we presented the testimony,

 3   not only of the victim but the doctor who was present

 4   when the swab was taken, of the officers who brought the

 5   sealed swab to the Illinois State Police crime lab, how

 6   that sealed swab was first looked at, preliminary tests

 7   by Mr. Hapack in -- in ISP, in order to -- before they

 8   sent it to Cellmark, and then Cellmark extracts a DNA

 9   profile of a woman -- a female and a man.

10                Cellmark never makes the match here.

11   Cellmark never says this is Mr. Williams' DNA.        That is

12   done by Ms. Lambatos.     Through her expert and her

13   expertise, she makes the match.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:        No, but Cellmark says this

15   is the male DNA that was found in the sample that was

16   sent.   Cellmark made that decision, right?       And her

17   testimony was based upon the fact -- was based upon

18   comparing that male DNA with -- with her own blood

19   sample.   It's meaningless unless that male DNA was

20   indeed the defendant's.

21                MS. ALVAREZ:     And she can testify to what

22   she relied on.   Again -- and it goes to her weight if

23   the trier of fact chooses not to believe it.        The -- but

24   the evidence here was clear --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:        You know, I would believe


                                    37
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that if the prosecution put the question to -- to her

 2   this way:   Assume that you got a report which said that

 3   this was the defendant's DNA.             And if you were to match

 4   that with this -- the work you've done on the blood

 5   sample, would you find that -- that, you know, that the

 6   sample was taken from the defendant?                 And she would say

 7   yes.   And the jury would say:            So what?

 8                 I mean, you've just -- you've just made a

 9   hypothesis.     "If you had been told."              That -- that would

10   be worth nothing.

11                 Her testimony was, I received information

12   that this was indeed the DNA taken from -- the male DNA

13   taken from the -- from the swab that was sent.                Without

14   that, the testimony was worthless.                 It's just, you know,

15   a hypothesis.    She responds to a hypothesis.              That was

16   not the way this was played out in the trial, was it?

17                 MS. ALVAREZ:      The -- again, our position is

18   that her testimony was consistent with the Confrontation

19   Clause.   The Confrontation Clause is concerned about

20   what statements are admitted, what evidence is admitted.

21   No Cellmark reports were admitted here.                She did not

22   parrot the testimony -- I mean, the report of Cellmark.

23                 She testified to what she did, how she

24   arrived at her own independent opinion on this, which --

25   again, we did not offer any out-of-court statements to


                                      38

 1   prove the truth of the matter asserted.           We offered Ms.

 2   Lambatos, who was subjected to a lengthy

 3   cross-examination, and that satisfies the Confrontation

 4   Clause.   And the inability to test the reliability of

 5   what happened at Cellmark does not trigger the

 6   Confrontation Clause.

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          I thought you earlier

 8   recognized that her -- her opinion could not be

 9   independent of the test results.           It depended entirely

10   on the test results.    So, I -- now you've -- you've

11   inserted "independent" again, and I thought you had --

12   you had given up on that.

13                MS. ALVAREZ:     Well, I think, you know, what

14   we saw in Bullcoming was not an independent opinion of

15   an expert.   With -- he offered no independent analysis.

16   He simply read off a report that was prepared by another

17   lab, and that -- in Bullcoming, that was offered to

18   prove the truth of the matter asserted.

19                We did not offer Cellmark reports here to

20   prove the truth of the matter asserted.          We offered the

21   expert opinion of Ms. Lambatos, and her credibility was

22   attacked through a very vigorous cross-examination here,

23   and that satisfies the Confrontation Clause.

 1   testimony, and the key is the live testimony here, which

 2   we presented live testimony.            The reports from Cellmark

 3   in our -- our conclusion is that they are not

 4   testimonial in nature.

 5                And what Petitioner is asking you here -- to

 6   do here today is to expand Crawford, to expand the

 7   Confrontation Clause, to expand the definition of

 8   hearsay and the definition of "testimonial."

 9                And -- and our position simply is to ask you

10   to maintain the rule of Crawford, which is quite clear,

11   that a witness becomes -- an out-of-court declarant

12   becomes a witness against an accused within the concept

13   of the Confrontation Clause when their extrajudicial

14   statements are offered to prove the truth of the matter

15   asserted.   And so, the witness here --

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Does Illinois -- does

17   Illinois have notice and demand?

18                MS. ALVAREZ:     No.

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          It does not?

20                MS. ALVAREZ:     No.       No.      And so, our -- our

21   position, Your Honors, is to maintain the rule of

22   Crawford.   There is no such thing as inferential

23   hearsay, as the Petitioner wants you to believe.               A

24   statement is a statement.       Hearsay is hearsay.           There is

25   no such thing as inferential hearsay.              What was

 1   presented here in this case was consistent with the

 2   Confrontation Clause; it was satisfied.              And for -- and

 3   for that, we respect your opinion here today, but we ask

 4   that you maintain the ruling of Crawford.

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:        She was asked, just -- just

 6   to be clear what she was testifying to:              "Did you

 7   compare the semen that had been identified by Brian

 8   Hapack from the vaginal swabs of Latonia Jackson to the

 9   male DNA profile that had been identified by Karen Kooi

10   from the blood of Sandy Williams?"

11               "Yes, I did."

12               She is accepting and -- and affirming this

13   statement that what she was comparing was the semen that

14   had been identified from the vaginal swabs.

15               MS. ALVAREZ:     She -- she is accepting and

16   she is relying on the material that was generated by

17   Cellmark, but, again, the State did not admit into

18   evidence or -- or try to admit into evidence the

19   Cellmark report or any statements from Cellmark.

 1   and may it please the Court:

 2                Sandra Lambatos's testimony really has to be

 3   analyzed as having two components to it.              The first

 4   component is the match, the match between the data

 5   reflecting the allele charts from Cellmark and the data

 6   that was produced in analyzing Petitioner's blood.                As

 7   to that component of her testimony, she's a live

 8   witness.   She's subject to cross-examination.             I don't

 9   think that anyone asserts there's a Confrontation Clause

10   issue.

11               But as several members of the Court have

12   pointed out, that testimony is entirely irrelevant and

13   nonprobative unless it can be linked to the semen that

14   was taken from the victim and that was subsequently

15   analyzed to generate a DNA profile.              As to that issue,

16   Illinois State law provides that her testimony cannot

17   prove for the truth of the matter asserted what Cellmark

18   did.   She cannot repeat on the witness stand, when she

19   gives the basis for her testimony, things that Cellmark

20   said and have them be taken for the truth --

21               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          But, Mr. Dreeben, she

22   did repeat what Cellmark said.          I asked your -- the

23   State's attorney whether, if she had read the data

24   report from the laboratory analysis, would that have

25   been a violation of the Confrontation Clause?             Not


                                    42
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   clear.     She says, only if you admitted it.

 2                 But in fact that's what she did.           If you

 3   read her testimony -- I give you an example at page

 4   79 -- she tells on cross-examination exactly what the

 5   steps were in the Cellmark report, what numbers they

 6   gave, and she tells and explains -- she -- the State's

 7   attorney took pride in this -- she said, I disagree with

 8   that number that they came up with; I think the number

 9   should be....

10                 So, she's really reading the report.

11                 MR. DREEBEN:      Well, first of all, Justice

12   Sotomayor, that did come in on cross-examination, and I

13   don't think that Petitioner is contending that evidence

14   that he himself elicits on cross-examination --

15                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          All right.   So, then

16   let's --

17                 MR. DREEBEN:      -- would violate the

18   Confrontation Clause.

19                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          All right.   So, let's --

20   so, let's get to --

21                 MR. DREEBEN:      Can I focus on --

22                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Could the State have

23   done this?

24                 MR. DREEBEN:      Can I focus on your question?

25   I think, because she clearly did link the DNA that she


                                      43
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   compared to the blood DNA to the semen that was sent to

 2   Cellmark, and I think that several members of the Court

 3   have raised the question, is she implicitly thereby

 4   repeating what Cellmark said and then making Cellmark

 5   the out-of-court witness?

 6                 My answer to that is twofold.              First of all,

 7   as a matter of Illinois State law, she could not do

 8   that.    She is not permitted to give the basis for her

 9   opinion in that respect and have it taken for the truth.

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            If that's so, why isn't

11   there insufficient evidence in this case?

12                MR. DREEBEN:      And this brings me to my

13   second reason for saying that this is not a

14   Confrontation Clause problem.

15                It's in essence what the Chief Justice

16   described and what Justice Alito referred to as the

17   circumstantial way in which the factfinder can infer

18   that Cellmark tested the DNA in the semen that was sent

19   to it.   There's a shipping manifest that shows that the

20   semen goes out to the lab; there's a shipping manifest

21   that shows that it comes back.             And Cellmark tenders

22   a --

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            None of -- none of which

24   has anything to do with the accuracy of the test.

25                MR. DREEBEN:      Correct.           And that is I think


                                     44
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the crucial point here.        The State may have a very weak

 2   case if it doesn't produce a witness from the lab who

 3   can attest to the fact that the lab did what it was

 4   supposed to do and conducted a properly authorized DNA

 5   examination.    It has to get by with the very skimpy

 6   circumstantial showing of we sent the material out --

 7                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              No, it -- it doesn't

 8   though.   It could have -- could it have a witness saying

 9   Cellmark is the nation's foremost DNA testing

10   laboratory; they hire only people who have Ph.D.'s in

11   DNA testing?    I mean, is that all right?

12                MR. DREEBEN:       Yes.        Yes.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                The State can make

14   its case a lot stronger --

15                MR. DREEBEN:       And it did that here by saying

16   that Cellmark is an accredited laboratory and Sandra

17   Lambatos participated in designing proficiency

18   examination.    But she had to admit on cross-examination

19   that she had no idea what Cellmark actually did in this

20   case.   She could draw inferences.             And the inferences

21   that she drew are what enable her to say my opinion is

22   there is a match between the DNA in the semen and the

23   DNA in the blood.

24                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             As you understand our

25   precedents, would this have been a stronger or a weaker


                                      45
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   case if a representative, an employee, of Cellmark had

 2   come and said, although I didn't do this sample, I want

 3   to tell you how our procedures work and why we're a

 4   respectable lab, et cetera, et cetera?

 5               MR. DREEBEN:     It would have been relatively

 6   stronger had a witness been able to actually come from

 7   Cellmark and validate that Cellmark is an accredited

 8   laboratory and conducts procedures in a certain way.

 9   But the crucial point here --

10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Mr. Dreeben, if no

11   expert from either lab came in, if an expert had the

12   Cellmark information and the Illinois State Police

13   information, not offered for the truth of the matter,

14   and came in and said, I matched this and I matched that,

15   and it's the defendant -- could that have been done?

16               MR. DREEBEN:     Only if as a matter of State

17   law there was a sufficient foundation for the factfinder

18   to conclude that the DNA actually came from the blood

19   and the DNA came from the semen.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Mr. Dreeben, that seems to

21   me -- I mean, we have a Confrontation Clause which

22   requires that the witnesses against the defendant appear

23   and testify personally.     And -- and the crucial evidence

24   here is the testing of the semen found on the swab.

25   That is -- that's the crux of this evidence.         And you're


                                   46
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   telling me that this Confrontation Clause allows you to

 2   simply say, well, we're not going to bring in the person

 3   who did the test; we're simply going to say this is a

 4   reliable lab.

 5                I don't know how that complies with the

 6   Confrontation Clause.

 7                MR. DREEBEN:      The Confrontation Clause,

 8   Justice Scalia, does not obligate the State to present a

 9   strong case.    It does not prevent the State from

10   presenting a relatively weaker case, so long as it does

11   not rely on testimonial statements to prove the truth of

12   the matter asserted.

13               This Court held, in Bruton v. United States,

14   that there is a very narrow exception to the almost

15   invariable presumption that juries will follow the

16   instructions that they're given.            If they are told not

17   to take evidence for the truth of the matter asserted,

18   they are presumed to follow that instruction.           Here

19   Illinois State law supplies that filter.

20               Everything that the judge heard, he filtered

21   through Illinois State law that says the basis for the

22   expert's opinion doesn't prove its truth.           So, the State

23   gave up the right to say you can believe that this DNA

24   report is reliable and trustworthy because Cellmark says

25   so.   The State doesn't get that benefit, and as a result

 1   of not getting that benefit, it is not obligated to

 2   treat Cellmark as if it's a witness.              Cellmark --

 3                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       I suppose the problem is,

 4   Mr. Dreeben, that if the -- if the State put up Ms.

 5   Lambatos and Ms. Lambatos had to say I did a match -- I

 6   was given two reports; there was a match, but I have no

 7   idea where this other report came from; you know, it

 8   might have been from the victim, but it might not have

 9   been; I don't have a clue -- the State would never have

10   put that prosecution on, because the State would have

11   understood that there was no case there.

12                 The State is relying on the fact that people

13   will take what Ms. Lambatos says about what she knows

14   about where the report came from as a fact, as the truth

15   of the matter, that in fact this report did come from

16   the victim.    And so, the jury can be given instructions

17   saying you can't consider this except for the truth of

18   the matter asserted.

19                 But it's a bit of a cheat, no?

20                 MR. DREEBEN:     No.       I think, Justice Kagan,

21   when you consider the things that this Court has held

22   juries can properly apply limiting instructions to, they

23   can hear the fact that evidence was seized from the

24   defendant, marijuana was found at his house.             The

25   defendant gets up on the stand and says, no, it wasn't.

 1   The State can introduce that marijuana to impeach his

 2   testimony.   And the jury is instructed you may not use

 3   that as proof that he possessed marijuana, only to

 4   impeach his testimony.

 5                The same is true with unwarned statements in

 6   violation of Miranda.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:        What was the instruction

 8   here?   That --

 9                MR. DREEBEN:     There's no instruction here,

10   Justice Scalia, because this is a bench trial.         And in a

11   bench trial, the judge is presumed to follow the law,

12   and as my colleague read to the Court --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:        So, we simply have a

14   presumption even though -- even though the court's

15   statement seems to indicate that he does take it for the

16   truth of the matter.

17                MR. DREEBEN:     Well, the Illinois --

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:        And you're saying, well, he

19   couldn't have because that would be against the law.

20                MR. DREEBEN:     The Illinois Supreme Court

21   found as a matter of State law that he did comply with

22   State evidentiary rules and he did not take the Cellmark

23   report for the truth of the matter asserted.         And there

24   is in this case an alternative route of proof which is

25   circumstantial.   And I take the Chief Justice's

 1   amendment of my description of the facts to include that

 2   Cellmark is an accredited laboratory.               That does add to

 3   the probative value.     But it's a much weaker chain of

 4   support to conclude that the DNA male profile came from

 5   the semen than if they had produced Cellmark.               But not

 6   having produced Cellmark, they do not need to afford

 7   confrontation on Cellmark.

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, counsel.

10             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN W. CARROLL

11                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12                MR. CARROLL:      Thank you, Your Honor.

13                First, the State cited page 7 -- or 172 in

14   the joint appendix as a reference to the trial judge

15   stating that he was not considering Cellmark's statement

16   for its truth.    That's not a cite to the transcript of

17   the trial.   That's a cite to the Illinois Supreme

18   Court's opinion.

19                Nowhere in the actual trial transcripts did

20   the judge ever state, I'm not considering this evidence

21   for its truth.    In fact, in the statement of facts on

22   page JJJ 151 of the record, he states that it's the --

23   it's the testimony of the expert that makes this link.

24   Cellmark's an accredited lab.

25                And it's inconceivable that, in the face of

 1   the evidence of Cellmark's work that the prosecution

 2   presented through Lambatos' testimony and during defense

 3   counsel's objections to that testimony, that the judge

 4   would never state at any point, hey, I'm not considering

 5   this for its truth.

 6                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Are you saying that we

 7   owe no deference to the Illinois Supreme Court's

 8   judgment on this evidentiary issue?                And if so, no

 9   deference, tell me what proposition of law supports that

10   or are you saying deference is due, but we shouldn't

11   give it.   Which of the two positions are you taking?

12                MR. CARROLL:       I think deference is due, but

13   you shouldn't take it given the record in this case.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Why is deference due?        I

15   mean, it's either the fact or it's not the fact.               If a

16   State supreme court opinion says something that

17   contradicts the -- you know, the record, we owe it

18   deference?   I don't know any such rule.

19                MR. CARROLL:       Well, if the Court --

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:          We owe deference to its

21   interpretation of Illinois law, I suppose.

22                MR. CARROLL:       I guess I -- if this Court

23   would like not to give the Illinois Supreme Court

24   deference, I'd be more than happy --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:          I think we should give it

 1   deference where deference is due and not give it

 2   deference where deference is not due.               And on statement

 3   of facts that either are erroneous or not, I don't -- I

 4   don't know why deference is applicable.

 5                MR. CARROLL:     Yes, Your Honor.

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              You do think our law

 7   is established, though, that a jury will follow an

 8   instruction in this situation to -- not to take the

 9   testimony for truth of the evidence, for truth of the

10   matter.

11                MR. CARROLL:     Not in this situation, Your

12   Honor.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Do we have any --

14   any case saying that instruction is inadequate in a case

15   like this?

16                MR. CARROLL:     Not in this particular fact

17   pattern.   But this case is different than a Bruton type

18   situation where there are -- there's a proper way to

19   consider the evidence and an improper, and there's a

20   fear that the jury is going to -- or the trier of fact

21   is going to consider the improper.               Here Illinois law

22   did allow the trier of fact --

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Are you aware that in

24   Illinois they have an instruction -- assuming it was a

25   jury case, this is a bench case, but if it were a jury

 1   case:    Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you are not to

 2   presume or assume that the DNA tested by Cellmark came

 3   from this sample.

 4                 MR. CARROLL:     Yes, Your Honor.          There is

 5   such an instruction in Illinois law; however --

 6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And then they routinely

 7   give that to juries?

 8                 MR. CARROLL:     I believe they do, Your Honor.

 9   However, in this case -- or Illinois law does not

10   prohibit the trier of fact from considering Cellmark's

11   statements.    The trier of fact is allowed and is

12   expected to consider it in assisting the trier of fact

13   in evaluating Lambatos' opinion.

14                 And in this situation, where Lambatos -- the

15   only way that the Cellmark statements support Lambatos'

16   opinion is if they are true, there is no meaningful

17   difference between considering the statements in

18   assessing Lambatos' opinion and considering them for the

19   truth.

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          I'm sorry.     I'm going

21   back to Justice Kennedy's question.               There is an

22   Illinois requirement that the trial judges give the

23   instruction he described?

24                 MR. CARROLL:     I believe there is a

25   recommended jury instruction for -- that the basis
