 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. RUSSELL:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               Congress rarely makes ignorance of the law a

12   defense to civil liability, and the Fair Debt Collection

13   Practices Act is no exception to that rule.                 While it

14   may seem unfair to hold defendants in some sense

15   strictly liable for legal mistakes in the civil context,

16   the accumulated wisdoms of generations of legal practice

17   has been that attempting to fix that unfairness through

18   a mistake of law defense causes more harm than it

19   prevents.

20               And as a consequence, in light of that

21   subtle understanding, courts should not read a Federal

22   statute to establish a mistake of law defense, unless

23   Congress quite plainly makes that intent to do so clear.

24   And in this case, nothing in the text, structure, or the

25   history of the bona fide error provision of the FDCPA


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                               4
 1   indicates such an intent.

 2               I could begin with the -- the text of the

 3   statute.   It is not enough under the bona fide error

 4   provision that the defendant's violation be in good

 5   faith, that it have been bona fide.

 6               There is an additional element, that the

 7   defendant has to show that the violation was not

 8   intentional.   And in common legal discourse, a violation

 9   is not rendered unintentional simply because the

10   defendant misunderstood the legal consequences of its

11   actions.

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I think -- reading

13   "intentional" the way you just articulated is absolutely

14   right, but when you add -- I don't see what work "bona

15   fide error" does in the statute, if "intentional" should

16   be read in this case to mean what you say.

17               MR. RUSSELL:        Well, I think it captures the

18   circumstance in which somebody makes a mistake of fact,

19   but does so and with -- not in good faith.                 I think --

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But you say:   Well,

21   intentional means you meant to send out the document;

22   you meant to serve it; in other words, no specific

23   intent requirement.      But if -- a bona fide error, it

24   seems, doesn't make the activity not intentional under

25   the traditional understanding of intentional.

                                                                         5
 1              MR. RUSSELL:           But I think that's right.     I

 2   think both provisions do separate work, and so that if

 3   all it took to show that something wasn't intentional is

 4   that you didn't mean to violate the law, it would be

 5   very difficult to understand what work "bona fide" was

 6   doing in that circumstance.

 7              And I think Congress included the bona fide

 8   requirement in order to capture instances in which

 9   people make factual mistakes, but not in good faith.

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:              I really don't think that

11   the -- the word that we're wrestling with here is the --

12   the word "intentional."         It seems to me it's the word

13   "violation," because violation -- when it says the

14   violation was intentional or unintentional, does

15   "violation" mean the act that constitutes a violation of

16   the law, or does "violation" mean the -- the fact of

17   violating the law?

18              MR. RUSSELL:           I think that is the central

19   question here and it is Respondents' best argument.             I

20   think that the word "violation" is best understood to

21   refer to the act.     That is how this Court has construed

22   that word in the statutory phrase "knowing violation" in

23   a number of cases, and that's how the courts of appeals

24   have construed the term "intentional" -- or "intentional

25   violation" in the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural

                         Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                                    6
 1   Workers Protection Act, which we cited in our brief.

 2                 I did mention in our brief that it is a less

 3   usual formulation, "intentional violation," and at the

 4   time we wrote our briefs we weren't able to find any

 5   cases from this Court construing that particular term.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So what -- the part that's

 7   worrying me most is where the lawyer is the debt

 8   collector.     All right?      So he's within the act, and he

 9   has a client of debt collectors, and the clients all

10   say:   Please go collect the debt.                 And they say:        We

11   want to do this, like in this -- suppose in this case,

12   they say:    Tell us if you don't owe it; ask them to

13   write a letter to that effect; we won't collect it; now,

14   is that legal?

15                 And the lawyer looks up everything in sight

16   and says, yes, it's legal.            And then that's what he

17   thinks.     All the circuits have said this.                   And then he

18   asks the FTC and they say, yes, it's legal.                      So there he

19   is.    Everybody's told him it's legal.                    And lo and

20   behold, this Court, surprisingly, holds the opposite.

21   Well, he shouldn't be liable.              And if he has to worry

22   about that, he can never defend his client.                      The only

23   answer is:     Whatever the man says who is opposed to your

24   client, that's what you have to do.                      That can't be the

25   meaning of this statute.

 1               MR. RUSSELL:        Well, let me address the

 2   hypothetical, to make sure I understand it.                   If we're

 3   talking -- well, first of all, if we are talking about a

 4   case in which they've asked the opinion of the FTC, they

 5   are entitled to the safe harbor defense, because

 6   Congress specifically --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:           No, no.          What the FTC said

 8   is:   We won't give you one.

 9               MR. RUSSELL:        Okay.        Well, in that

10   circumstance, I think it's important to distinguish

11   between lawyers who are simply giving advice to debt

12   collector clients -- they're not covered by the act.

13   It's only when the lawyer engages in debt collection

14   activities himself.      And a lot of the time the debt --

15   the lawyer is simply --

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Does litigation constitute

17   debt -- debt collection activity?

18               MR. RUSSELL:        Yes.       This Court held in

19   Heintz that litigation can be a form of --

20               JUSTICE BREYER:           So he is a lawyer

21   litigating for a client.        That was my hypothetical.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Okay.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes.

24               MR. RUSSELL:        In that circumstance -- in

25   that circumstance, I think yes, the lawyer can be held

                                                                                    8
 1   liable for -- for mistakes.             But to the extent this

 2   Court --

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:           It's not a mistake.         The

 4   point is, in a sense, that any decent lawyer would say

 5   that's what the law was; that sometimes lawyers get

 6   surprised because courts don't always act the way they

 7   think is reasonable.

 8                 MR. RUSSELL:        And when that happens, their

 9   clients are almost never protected from liability,                       for

10   -- because they did what their lawyers reasonably told

11   them to.     And the antitrust --

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Why aren't they in good

13   faith?

14                 MR. RUSSELL:        The lawyer?

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Both.

16                 MR. RUSSELL:        Well, certainly, because there

17   generally is a mistake of law defense.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Ah, but that's in your view

19   of it.     I am saying that the opposite view of it is that

20   your view of it puts lawyers in an impossible position,

21   let alone the client.

22                 MR. RUSSELL:        Well --

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:           It -- it's not just that

24   it's unfair.     It's worse than unfair.                 The lawyer is

25   under an obligation to represent his client, and he

                        Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                              9
 1   cannot do anything but tell the client:                 Just pay money

 2   to this particular plaintiff whose view of the law is

 3   totally contrary to every circuit court that's ever

 4   decided it.    Now, how can you put lawyers in that

 5   position?

 6                 MR. RUSSELL:       I think the lawyers are not in

 7   a terribly different position than is, for example, the

 8   executive of a company that has a fiduciary duty to its

 9   shareholders to maximize profits and is considering a

10   venture that could violate the antitrust laws.                 And in

11   that circumstance, they have to make a calculated

12   judgment, because the antitrust laws don't have a

13   mistake of law defense.        And neither does any other

14   civil --

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               But you are sort of

16   begging the question there.            I mean, the antitrust laws

17   also don't have a bona fide error defense, and the

18   question is whether that includes a legal mistake

19   defense.

20                 MR. RUSSELL:       That's right.          And my -- my

21   point simply is that you shouldn't read that defense as

22   necessarily creating a mistake of law defense simply

23   because you think it's so unfair, because that

24   unfairness is simply common.

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:          But it -- but it suggests


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                          10
 1   that you would like a -- a sensible interpretation of

 2   this that avoids the result I said, if possible.             And

 3   there is a different way of going about it, which is you

 4   could say that a bona fide error in respect to a lawyer

 5   imposes much higher standards on that lawyer than it

 6   does on most -- and it's simply a client -- that before

 7   you can call an error bona fide, that lawyer really has

 8   to look into it.     He has to have asked the FTC.          He has

 9   to have gotten -- and made an effort to get a letter

10   back.     And if there are one or two circuits that hold

11   the other way, well, where?             And if you don't, you are

12   not bona fide.

13                 Now, that would get to virtually the same

14   place but it would protect the lawyer against true legal

15   surprise.

16                 MR. RUSSELL:        Well, I do think that if you

17   disagree with us, that's the better reading than the

18   second.     That's not the reading most courts have given.

19   It's not the reading that the Sixth Circuit gave in this

20   case.

21                 But I think there is every reason to think

22   that if Congress was concerned about the especially

23   problematic application of this statute to lawyer

24   conduct and particularly to litigation conduct, it would

25   have expected courts to deal with that in different way,

                                                                                 11
 1   and not through the bona fide error defense, which,

 2   after all, applies to lawyer who are engaging in the

 3   same conduct as lay debt collectors and to nonlawyers

 4   alike.    It's a very blunt instrument for dealing with

 5   this problem.

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                One -- one of the

 7   things you have to include on this initial communication

 8   is the name of the creditor, right?

 9                MR. RUSSELL:        Yes.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Okay.     So let's say

11   the bank that is the creditor is being sold or taken

12   over.    And, you know, you have heard that, well, they

13   have merged, but, you know, the closing date of the

14   merger is two months later or whatever.                    It's just not

15   clear what the name of the creditor is.                    So you -- you

16   are not a lawyer, but you are trying to collect the

17   debt, and you go -- you fill in, I --                   it's either A or

18   B, and you say:    I think it's A, and you fill it in and

19   it turns out that it's -- it's B.                 Let's say that's a

20   bona fide error.    Okay?

21                But if you are sitting there as the debt

22   collector and you say:        I don't know if it's A or B.

23   And you say:    I know; I'll call the lawyer.                  You call

24   the lawyer and the lawyer says:               Oh, it's -- it's B -- I

25   mean, it's -- it's A.       And you put down A and it turns

 1   out it's wrong, aren't -- you are in a worse position if

 2   you ask the lawyer than if you didn't, right?

 3                MR. RUSSELL:        No, because in either

 4   circumstance it would be a factual error.                 It would be

 5   subject to the bona fide error defense.

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, it's a -- it's a

 7   legal -- the lawyer looks at it and says:                 Well, you

 8   know, the merger is not going to close for whatever, but

 9   I think it's still this bank.             And it turns out his

10   legal analysis of who the creditor is was wrong.

11                MR. RUSSELL:        Well, again, I'm not sure that

12   that's a legal -- but assuming that it is a legal

13   mistake --

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Yes.

15                MR. RUSSELL:        -- I think that the client is

16   not -- I mean, if it's a legal mistake, it's a legal

17   mistake for the client as well as the lawyer, and I

18   think either one of them would be in the same position.

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But if the client

20   just says:    I'm not going to ask the lawyer; I'm just

21   going to make -- I think it's A -- it's a bona fide

22   error, but it's an error -- he gets the benefit of that

23   position.    But if he asks the lawyer, he doesn't get the

24   benefit.

25                MR. RUSSELL:        Well, under our view, he


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                             13
 1   wouldn't get benefit under either circumstance, because

 2   it would be a mistake of law and the statute doesn't

 3   cover it.

 4                 If I could finish my answer --

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Who the -- who the

 6   creditor is is necessarily a mistake of law, rather than

 7   fact?

 8                 MR. RUSSELL:       No.      That's why I -- I

 9   initially told you I thought it was a mistake of fact,

10   and that would be a mistake of fact for the lawyer or

11   the client.    And I think actually, in that scenario --

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, is it a

13   mistake of fact if the lawyer does legal research to

14   find it out?

15                 MR. RUSSELL:       Well, I don't think --

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               He looks and he

17   says:   Well, it depends upon the date of the closing of

18   the merger, not the announcement.

19                 MR. RUSSELL:       Well, if the --

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               And it turns out

21   that's a legal mistake.

22                 MR. RUSSELL:       Then I -- I don't think the

23   defense would apply and I don't think it would apply to

24   the client, either.

25                 But I do think that if you are especially

                                                                            14
 1   concerned about applying the law to lawyers and to

 2   litigation, it's much more likely that Congress intended

 3   the Court to deal with that in a tailored way by

 4   interpreting the substantive provisions of the statute

 5   with that particular problem in mind.

 6                 Knowing that Congress didn't have litigation

 7   conduct specifically in mind when it enacted this

 8   statute, because at the time lawyers were excluded from

 9   the act altogether, and keeping in mind in addition that

10   Congress presumably didn't intend the act to

11   unreasonably interfere with litigation collection

12   methods, and the constitutional aspects --

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So how -- how do we do

14   that?   Because you see, you are quite right.             The client

15   runs the same risk in antitrust law in a whole other lot

16   of areas.     Absolutely right.           But once you bring the

17   lawyer into it, the lawyer has what he doesn't have in

18   an antitrust case under your reading, which is an

19   incentive to distort the law in order to protect his own

20   pocketbook.     And that is, to me, a big problem.

21                 So you say there is -- there is a -- a way

22   around that.     And what?

23                 MR. RUSSELL:        And that is to recognize that,

24   as this Court held in Heintz, that Congress didn't

25   intend for every unsuccessful lawsuit to result in


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                                  15
 1   liability under this statute.              Plaintiffs have to point

 2   to some particular provision of the statute that was

 3   violated by what the lawyer did in litigation.

 4              And for example, the lawyer makes a mistake

 5   about the statute of limitations.                  Some courts have held

 6   that that constitutes a violation of the provisions

 7   against deceptive practices or unconscionable collection

 8   practices --

 9              JUSTICE BREYER:              The lawyer writes a letter

10   to the client.    The first thing the lawyer tries to do

11   is to settle the case.         "Dear Client:             Please send me

12   the money, and by the way, if you don't owe it, tell me

13   in writing."

14              Okay?      That's what the lawyer does.                 That's

15   a legal activity.     It's at the heart of practicing law,

16   because nobody goes to court anymore.                    And -- though he

17   will, if necessary, so he's part of this.

18              Now, how do we get out of this problem that

19   I'm putting?     I'm really looking for an answer to that,

20   because I think it's a big problem.

21              MR. RUSSELL:           Well, typically -- I don't

22   know that that's a uniquely lawyerly activity.                    Lay debt

23   collectors do that all the time.

24              But to the extent you think that Congress

25   could not have intended that kind of activity to be


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                16
 1   subject to liability when somebody makes a reasonable

 2   legal error, I think it's more likely that Congress

 3   intended you to look at what provision of the statute

 4   are they saying was violated and construe that provision

 5   in a way that is consistent with your expectations about

 6   what Congress would have meant, rather than providing --

 7   rather than, you know, taking the bona fide error

 8   provision to do that work, when the bona fide error

 9   provision is much broader and would apply to all kinds

10   of mistakes of law, including having this consequence of

11   basically giving debt collectors the opportunity to take

12   the narrowest possible construction of -- of consumers'

13   rights, as long as the -- the question is unsettled.

14              The other reason to think that Congress

15   wouldn't have intended this to be the solution to that

16   problem is that at the time they wrote the bona fide

17   error defense, lawyers weren't included, so this could

18   not have been Congress' intended solution to that

19   particular problem.

20              And at the time Congress used this language,

21   it was borrowing it from the Truth in Lending Act, where

22   it had an established meaning in the circuit courts as

23   not including the mistake of law defense, and that

24   remained the interpretation of the Fair Debt Collection

25   Practices Act provision as well, for -- for nearly

                                                                            17
 1   25 years.

 2               It wasn't until 2002 that the court of

 3   appeals first suggested that it did not extend to legal

 4   mistakes.

 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Counsel, if the district

 6   court were to say:    You violated the act; this was a

 7   mistake of law not covered, but I'm not awarding

 8   statutory damages because --

 9               MR. RUSSELL:         I think they --

10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              -- in this case, just

11   for the reasons here, you did something the Sixth

12   Circuit -- or that the circuit law said was permissible,

13   so you didn't do it -- you did it intentionally because

14   you did the violation of the act, but it was based on a

15   mistake of law.

16               MR. RUSSELL:         I do think that that's a

17   perfectly permissible exercise of discretion.               Congress

18   gave the district court discretion with respect to

19   statutory damages, and that's another way of dealing

20   with this problem.

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, what about

22   attorneys' fees?

23               MR. RUSSELL:         No, the attorneys' fees is not

24   discretionary in that sense.

25               And so there are other structural reasons,


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                               18
 1   though, to think that Congress knew how to make a

 2   mistake of law defense clearly and did not do so here.

 3                 Congress did provide, in effect, a mistake

 4   of law defense to civil penalties.                  The civil penalties

 5   provision that applies to this statute, which is at

 6   15 U.S.C. 45(m)(1), and that's quoted in relevant part

 7   on page 24 of the blue brief, provides for very serious

 8   civil penalties for somebody who acts with actual

 9   knowledge or knowledge fairly implied that the act was

10   prohibited.

11                 And I think that provision shows two things.

12   One, it shows that Congress knows how to make an

13   express -- how to expressly speak to a defendant's

14   knowledge of the unlawfulness of his conduct.

15                 And in addition, it shows that Congress

16   treated knowledge of unlawfulness as an aggravating

17   circumstance, as something deserving of special

18   punishment, rather than, as Respondents would have it,

19   most of the time being a minimum prerequisite for any

20   liability at all.

21                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Congress wrote this

22   statute to -- to have a cottage industry of litigation.

23   These were attorneys --

24                 MR. RUSSELL:        Well, I -- I would not say

25   that.   I would say that Congress wrote this statute, in


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                               19
 1   a way, to encourage private enforcement, to be sure.                 It

 2   enacted statutory damages and fee shifting because it

 3   understood that this was an industry in which there was

 4   a particular risk of very aggressive and harmful

 5   practices, in part because debt collectors don't rely on

 6   the good will of the consumers they deal with in order

 7   to prosper.    And so all of the economic incentives in

 8   the industry push people to aggressive practices, and

 9   Congress wanted this statute to be a counterweight to

10   that.

11                 And as in many circumstances, Congress

12   enacts statutory language and puts up requirements and

13   holds people to them civilly because the -- the general

14   rule in our legal system is that the risk and the cost

15   of a legal mistake is generally allocated to the

16   lawbreaker in the civil context and not to the people's

17   whose rights have been violated.                 And there is no reason

18   to think that Congress was acting particularly

19   differently here.

20                 We were speaking earlier on about the words

21   "intentional violation," and I wanted to bring to the

22   Court's attention the fact that after we filed our

23   brief, and in fact, last night, we -- we did find a case

24   in which this Court construed that term, and we notified

25   Respondents' counsel and the United States.                 And I just


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                              20
 1   want to give you the cite so you can look at it.                  It's

 2   Ellis v. United States, 206 U.S. 246.                  The relevant

 3   passage is at page 257.       It's a 1907 opinion from

 4   Justice Holmes.

 5              And it's consistent with the way that the

 6   Court has construed the phrase "knowing violation" in a

 7   number of contexts, including in -- in the criminal

 8   context, where it's much more common for Congress to

 9   make a mistake of law a defense to liability.

10              I mentioned before that that kind of history

11   of the development of the statute -- I think it's also

12   worth noting, Justice Breyer, that at the time, Congress

13   withdrew the attorney exemption from the act.                 It was

14   the uniform opinion of the courts of appeals at that

15   time and all the district courts that the language of

16   the bona fide error defense did not create a mistake of

17   law defense.   And again, Congress had no reason to

18   expect that in subjecting the attorneys to that

19   statutory regime, that the bona fide error provision

20   would be the solution to any special problems.

21              And Congress has also shown itself to be

22   attentive to this special area of concern.                 In 2006, it

23   made a tailored adjustment to the statute to make clear

24   that pleadings are not an initial communication

25   triggering the validation notice requirement.                 And I


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                           21
 1   think that demonstrates that Congress is -- is on top of

 2   this issue, and it stands at the ready to make

 3   adjustments that are necessary to make this legal system

 4   operate in a way that both makes sense, but nonetheless

 5   gives effect to their intent to treat attorney debt

 6   collectors on a par with regular debt collectors who are

 7   not attorneys.

 8              I should also mention, Justice Breyer, to

 9   the extent there are some really intractable problems

10   with respect to the act application to attorneys,

11   there -- there is ongoing litigation in the lower courts

12   about the Noerr-Pennington doctrine about how the

13   constitutional implications of regulating in-court

14   activity apply to the Court's interpretation of the

15   statutory provisions.

16              And again, I think it's more likely that

17   that is the solution Congress would have intended, an

18   interpretive solution --

19              JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, maybe your colleague

20   can, but how -- so they define a -- the reasonable error

21   falls in is because he's a person who regularly collects

22   or attempts to collect consumer debts owed to a -- you

23   know, owed to another person.           That's pretty broad.

24   That doesn't come about until '86.               You are saying the

25   bona fide language there is before, in '77?

 1               MR. RUSSELL:          Yes.       And at the --

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:             Okay.       But then what --

 3   how -- but I still can't figure out how we get this

 4   thing to work here, and -- and you just came up with a

 5   new idea.

 6               MR. RUSSELL:          Well, no.              It's -- again, it's

 7   the same idea, that you construe the provisions in a way

 8   that avoid the most troublesome applications of it to

 9   attorney conduct.     So I was giving the example of state

10   statutes of limitations.          I think it's very open to

11   dispute whether attempting to collect a debt on which

12   the limitations period has run constitutes an unfair or

13   deceptive practice, because there's not a -- all it does

14   is gives the -- the debtor the opportunity to raise an

15   affirmative defense.

16               And I think -- you know, in that

17   circumstance, Congress would not have intended the

18   statute to --

19               JUSTICE BREYER:             So -- I get -- okay.

 1              MR. JAY:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 2   please the Court:

 3              I would like, if I may, to pick up with a

 4   point that Mr. Russell made, which is that the FDCPA is

 5   of a piece with most civil regulatory statutes, in that

 6   it makes knowledge of the law an aggravating factor and

 7   subjects violators who know that they are violating a

 8   law subject to substantial civil penalties of up to

 9   $16,000 per day.    But it doesn't completely excuse

10   violations based on a lack of knowledge of the law.                 In

11   order to be excused, the violation must have resulted

12   from a bona fide error and meet all three elements of

13   the bona fide error defense.

14              We think that two of those elements are not

15   satisfied by the Respondents' error in this case.

16              First, legal errors, for the reason Mr.

17   Russell explained, aren't unintentional.                 Justice Scalia

18   asked about whether the phrase "the violation is not

19   intentional" is a signal in that respect.                 We think that

20   the work that that phrase, "the violation was not

21   intentional," does in this circumstance is to show that

22   the portion of the debt collector's conduct that

23   triggers the violation of the statute, it was -- is what

24   must be unintentional.

25              Let me illustrate that with an example.

                                                                         24
 1   Under the statute, a debt collector who places a call to

 2   a debtor at home after 9:00 at night may well violate

 3   the statute; likely does violate the statute.            So what

 4   must be unintentional for that debt collector to make

 5   out the bona fide error defense is not that the

 6   telephone call had been -- had been placed

 7   unintentionally, but rather that the debt collector

 8   didn't have knowledge, for example, because of an error

 9   about what time zone the debtor lives in.

10               The -- the debt collector didn't know that

11   the call was being placed after 9:00 at night.            That is

12   an unintentional error, and it is excused under the

13   statute if the debt collector can also show that it

14   maintains procedures reasonably adapted to prevent any

15   such errors.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And your example of that

17   couldn't happen, because if you were calling debtors,

18   you should certainly check what time of evening the call

19   is.   So you get over the first problem, but then on the

20   second problem, the second -- how could that possibly be

21   careful procedure, if you don't even check to see what

22   time zone the person is in?

23               MR. JAY:     Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg,

24   if -- if you check, but due to a keyboarding error, for

25   example, Arizona is entered as Alabama or an error in


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                             25
 1   time zone is entered in whatever record is being

 2   consulting by the debt collector, that's the kind of

 3   factual error, a clerical, bookkeeping type error

 4   that -- that Congress had in mind when it created this

 5   defense.     And it bears repeating that Congress has

 6   created this -- this defense in identical terms in a

 7   number of other statutes; federal agencies have

 8   construed the identical language in a number of other

 9   statutes.     And never has Congress or a federal agency

10   contemplated that one of these defenses would, in fact,

11   encompass legal errors.

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Do you know why when

13   Congress codified that law errors don't count, codified

14   that for the Truth in Lending Act purposes, it didn't

15   make the corresponding change in the others?

16                 MR. JAY:     We don't have a specific

17   indication, Justice Ginsburg, why it didn't go back and

18   revise every other statute that -- that already had such

19   a defense.    But I think that the answer is simply that

20   Congress was revising the Truth in Lending Act in a

21   statute called the Truth in Lending Simplification Act,

22   and the -- the statute in which that was passed didn't

23   make any other -- any other changes to non-financial

24   statutes.    It didn't reopen the Federal -- Fair Debt

25   Collection Practice Act in any other way.                In fact, the

                                                                              26
 1   relevant portion of the FDCPA, Section 1692k, hasn't

 2   been amended in any way since Congress first enacted it

 3   in 1977.

 4                 So we think that the relevance of the 1980

 5   amendment to TILA is simply this:                  It's part of a

 6   consistent pattern by Congress and by the agencies such

 7   as the Department of Housing and Urban Development and

 8   the Federal Reserve Board that interpret statutes with

 9   identical or very similar bona fide error provisions to

10   say:     Errors of law are not what Congress or the agency

11   had in mind.

12                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Even if the -- even if the

13   error of law is completely reasonable?                   Let's say in

14   this case the Sixth Circuit had a case directly on

15   point.     Still, it was just too bad.

16                 MR. JAY:     Well, I think, Justice Alito,

17   that that is not uncommon under any civil statute, that

18   when a court of appeals has precedent on point, that

19   there is always a possibility that that precedent will

20   be reversed.

21                 Now, of course, this statute has a very

22   short statute of limitations.              It's one year.       And if

23   there's some possibility that the law will change down

24   the road, that short statute of limitations will prevent

25   most violations from being reconsidered down the road

 1   after the -- after the law is clarified.

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           It also makes it hard to

 3   use the safe harbor to get the -- to get advice from the

 4   FTC.

 5                MR. JAY:    I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.             You

 6   are saying that the statute of limitations makes it

 7   difficult?

 8                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           That -- that if you

 9   have -- you can -- you are home free if you ask the FTC,

10   right?

11                MR. JAY:    That's correct.

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But that's the only --

13   only way you -- under your reading that you are home

14   free?

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:          If you ask and they answer.

16                MR. JAY:    If you ask and they answer and

17   they say that your view of the statute is the correct

18   one.

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               How many times have

20   they answered in the past decade?

21                MR. JAY:    In the past decade,

22   Mr. Chief Justice, they have been asked seven times for

23   opinions by the debt collection industry, and they have

24   answered four of them under the criteria that they

25   adopted in the regulations they are cited in footnote 10

 1   of our brief.

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So that's not a very

 3   realistic procedure to rely on, is it?

 4               MR. JAY:      Well, the debt collection industry

 5   seems to not have asked very many times, Mr. Chief

 6   Justice.

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And why is that?

 8   Because it's a little difficult dealing with the FTC

 9   bureaucracy and getting an answer from them in a

10   reasonable time?

11               MR. JAY:      I submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that

12   first, even if this were relevant to what Congress

13   intended the -- how Congress intended the adviser

14   opinion process to work when it wrote this provision in

15   1977, that the debt collection industry, as we pointed

16   out in our brief -- if you ask the FTC for an adviser

17   opinion, and it sides against the requester, which,

18   incidentally, in none of these four opinions has it ever

19   done -- in each case it sided with the requester -- but

20   if it sides against, then the requester is on notice of

21   the law.   And the requester is going to be -- as I

22   mentioned at the outset, the requester is going to be in

23   the category of -- for heightened penalties, because it

24   will be very difficult to suggest that you don't know

25   the law.

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So you are saying

 2   that the debt collection industry doesn't does ask the

 3   FTC, which would be a safe harbor for them, because if

 4   they get a bad answer, they may not follow it and then

 5   they may be subject to heightened penalties?

 6               MR. JAY:     Well, I'm saying,

 7   Mr. Chief Justice, that the -- that they would

 8   understandably prefer to ask their own lawyer for an

 9   opinion if the -- if this Court were to agree with the

10   Respondent's position and affirm the Sixth Circuit.

11   They would be able to ask their own lawyer, get a

12   private opinion, and if the opinion is favorable, then

13   they are home free under the bona fide error defense.

14               If -- if it's an -- if it's adverse advice,

15   they may need -- even if they disregard the advice, they

16   may never need to disclose the opinion at all, whereas

17   the FTC advisory opinion process clarifies the law for

18   the benefit of the entire field.               Those opinions are

19   public.   They are published and --

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, but there are

21   four of them.   I don't care how public they are.               There

22   are four of them over the past 10 years.                It's not a

23   very reliable or usable effort to clarify the law and

24   address the problem that the statute presents.

25               MR. JAY:     Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I submit


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                            30
 1   that you can't look simply at the number of responses

 2   without looking at the number of inquiries.               And I am

 3   confident that if this Court, as we urge that it do,

 4   reverses the Sixth Circuit and makes clear that asking

 5   your own lawyer for an opinion is not going to be a safe

 6   harbor defense under Subsection C, that there will be

 7   increased use of the -- of the safe harbor defense that

 8   Congress actually wrote into the statute in Subsection

 9   E.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Do we know what the time

11   interval was?   You said there were seven requests for

12   affirmative responses.       How long did it take from when

13   the request was made until the FTC responded?

14               MR. JAY:     In the four that were granted,

15   three of them took three to four months.               The fourth is

16   an exception, and that -- that's the one cited in the

17   retail collection attorneys' amicus brief.

18               That is an exception because the request was

19   originally submitted as a comment in a pending

20   rulemaking conducted by the FTC and a number of other

21   agencies.   The FTC agreed to take that comment in the

22   rulemaking and act on it an advisory opinion under the

23   FDCPA so that it wouldn't have to wait for the other

24   agencies to agree with its view, and so that one took

25   considerably longer.     But the average processing time is


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review

 1   three to four months.

 2                 And of course the FTC makes a number of

 3   other informal guidance avenues available, if what the

 4   debt collector wants is simply a quick answer and not a

 5   formal safe harbor with the imprimatur of the

 6   Commission.    One can -- the Commission staff has

 7   published guidance, and indeed, the Commission staff is

 8   available over the telephone --

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               And if that's wrong,

10   it doesn't do you any good.

11                 MR. JAY:     If that's wrong, it doesn't confer

12   the safe harbor.     But that's up to the debt collector,

13   Mr. Chief Justice.       If you -- if you want an informal

14   opinion, you can get one very quickly.                  If you want the

15   safe harbor, that requires the imprimatur of the

16   commissioners, and that takes a bit longer.

17                 We don't think that's at all inconsistent

18   with what Congress intended, and we do think that

19   Congress intended that this be the primary avenue.                  And

20   if you look at the advisory opinion provision of the

21   Truth in Lending Act, we think that illustrates it.

22                 At the time Congress enacted the FDCPA, the

23   Truth in Lending Act advisory opinion provision had only

24   been on the books for a couple of years, but it had

25   already filled more than 100 pages of the Code of


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                        32
 1   Federal Regulations with advisory opinions.            And we

 2   think that that's how Congress intended for the law

 3   under this statute to be clarified as well, not in a way

 4   that effectively confers qualified immunity on debt

 5   collectors whenever there is an ambiguity in the law.

 6               We think that that is reinforced as well by

 7   a substantive aspect of the statute, which is that

 8   Congress recognized -- and this is in particular in the

 9   legislative history at page 18 in footnote 9 of our

10   brief -- that the debt collection industry is extremely

11   aggressive and looks for loopholes whenever they exist.

12               So the substantive prohibitions of the

13   statute, especially 1692d, e, and f, are written in such

14   a way that they contain broad, substantive prohibitions

15   that are illustrated by examples, but those examples

16   expressly are illustrative and not exclusive.           Congress

17   would not have wanted a debt collector to be able to

18   say:   Well, gee, this -- this practice is not expressly

19   addressed by the statute and has not yet expressly been

20   addressed by any judicial opinion, and to say:           Well,

21   that law is not clearly established.

22               We think it's -- may I finish the

23   sentence Mr. Chief Justice?           We think, instead, that

24   Congress would have recognized that the purpose of this

25   statute is to protect the unsophisticated debtor, and

 7             ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE S. COAKLEY

 8                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 9              MR. COAKLEY:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11              The starting point for discerning

12   congressional intent is the text of the statute.                 The

13   Respondents submit that in a review of the text of this

14   statute, all of the components may be read plainly to

15   include the bona fide error defense, to include legal

16   error, starting with the words that the Court was

17   discussing with Mr. Russell and Mr. Jay, "violation not

18   intentional," moving on to "violation resulting from a

19   bona fide error," then "the maintenance of procedures

20   reasonably adapted."

21              The Sixth Circuit and the trial court and --

22   have construed this statute in a plain-meaning analysis;

23   that is to say, they start with the plain meaning of

24   each of those words and construe them in their context.

25   They did not find an ambiguity.                They did not find an


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                               34
 1   absurdity.   They found that each of those -- each of

 2   those components may be squared with a -- with a legal

 3   error analysis.

 4                Petitioner even concedes with respect to the

 5   element of "violation not intentional" that our

 6   interpretation is, quote, "not linguistically

 7   impossible," end quote.

 8                What -- what Petitioner has done is to avoid

 9   the conventional standards of -- of congressional -- I

10   mean, of statutory interpretation, which is the

11   plain meaning from Lamie, and moving, then, outward if

12   necessary.   And they have opted instead for looking at

13   unrelated statutes such as TILA, then going to the safe

14   harbor, and then pulling the words "violation" and

15   "intentional" out of the first prong, taking them out of

16   context, taking them out of order, and then applying

17   them to this maxim, "ignorance of the law."                   Even --

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           And also saying -- and

19   then this sentence is what I would like to have your

20   response on, that there is no statute -- Federal statute

21   that makes mistake of law a defense.                   So this would be

22   highly extraordinary, and if that's what Congress meant

23   to do, to make something that ordinarily is no defense a

24   defense, we would expect Congress to do so expressly.

25                MR. COAKLEY:       Justice Ginsburg, that is

 1   their argument, that it is unprecedented.                  But their

 2   unprecedented argument gets them nowhere.                  That is one

 3   of the panoply of arguments that is outside the plain

 4   meaning that they go to to say well, this is

 5   unprecedented; Congress couldn't have intended this.

 6                There are reports that read the TILA bona

 7   fide error to mean legal error at one point in time, so

 8   it wasn't unprecedented to the extent of that, and what

 9   did Congress do with respect to TILA?                  In 1980, they

10   didn't like the interpretation that they were getting

11   with respect to legal error from the TILA error, which

12   is a totally different statute, and so they reacted by

13   amending TILA to say no legal error in TILA.

14                They did not correspondingly amend the

15   FDCPA, which shows Congress's intent to distinguish the

16   two statutes.

17                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Do you think before our

18   Heintz decision, that they intended for debt collectors

19   to have an automatic defense if they just called up a

20   lawyer?   And so a lawyer's opinion would give them

21   absolute immunity from liability?

22                MR. COAKLEY:        Absolutely not, Justice

23   Sotomayor.   This --

24                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            No, I think part of the

25   difficulty in this case, isn't it, is the -- is our

 1   Heintz decision which made lawyers debt collectors, and

 2   so now we are in this quandary about a lawyer's good

 3   faith.    But -- but if we start with what was understood

 4   at the time, do you think that this language was

 5   intended to give debt collectors immunity by simply

 6   calling a lawyer?

 7                MR. COAKLEY:         Well -- it was absolutely

 8   meant to protect debt collectors, however, that term was

 9   defined in 1977, which included lay debt collectors.               In

10   1986 it went up a level when we added lawyers, and the

11   exemption went out and in 1995 it went up another level

12   when we added litigating lawyers.

13                But most certainly it went back to 1977 and

14   included lay debt collectors, and lay debt collectors

15   didn't get a "get out of jail free" card here by just

16   pulling up the bona fide error defense and saying I'm

17   done.    They are subject to the three rigors of the bona

18   fide error defense.      They have to prove that the

19   violation was not intentional -- that the violation --

 1              MR. COAKLEY:          No, but --

 2              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Even if the lawyer made

 3   a mistake, if the debt collector relies, you know, I

 4   have a reputable law firm, they are well educated, they

 5   tell me they do legal research, that -- I can assume

 6   that, so why don't I have a "get out of jail" card?

 7              MR. COAKLEY:          The unfairness of this

 8   statute, as Justice Breyer indicated in his commentary

 9   with Mr. Russell, is -- is exemplified by your question.

10   If a lay debt collector calls a lawyer in the 1977 to

11   1986 round and asks a lawyer for an interpretation of

12   this act, and he base -- he relies upon that and acts

13   accordingly, per their interpretation only applying to

14   clerical error, that lay debt collector who relied upon

15   advice of counsel is out of luck if the decision goes

16   against the lay debt collector, because he or she has no

17   error of law as a defense.           So it goes up, the levels of

18   unfairness go up as the time goes on.

19              JUSTICE BREYER:             That's true of antitrust

20   defendants, too.

21              MR. COAKLEY:          But in this, Your Honor, there

22   is a -- there is a bona fide error defense that has been

23   crafted into this statute.

24              JUSTICE BREYER:             No, I see that.   Is it --

25   is it -- what do you think of the idea that your

                        Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                          38
 1   opponent here has suggested that the way to deal with

 2   the lawyer's problem that I mentioned is simply read the

 3   substantive provisions, so that there is no violation

 4   for ordinary legal activity where they have gone and

 5   asked the FTC or you know, all the things that are

 6   against them?   What you would have to do.

 7              That isn't so hard to do as I first thought,

 8   because the words that seem to make -- the primary words

 9   of what is outlawed are the words "unfair or

10   unconscionable means."        Now I -- I doubt -- you would

11   know -- I doubt that there are other words in the

12   statute that forbid lawyers from doing anything that

13   really shouldn't be forbidden.              I mean, they shouldn't

14   call people up in the middle of the night and harass

15   them and so forth.

16              But -- but you could read unfair and

17   unconscionable means to say that where a lawyer is

18   really hit by surprise, you know, all the circuits were

19   against him, the FTC wouldn't give him an opinion, that

20   he no longer is acting unfairly and unconscionably.

21   What about that?

22              MR. COAKLEY:          Justice Breyer, I don't think

23   that gives credence to the 1977 focus when lawyers were

24   not part of the statute.         Certainly your example

25   heightens the unfairness of it once lawyers come in in

 1   1995 through Heintz as a litigating lawyer.                Certainly a

 2   lawyer has -- it creates this irreconcilable conflict of

 3   interest that you alluded to in your discussion with Mr.

 4   Russell.   That puts the lawyer between the proverbial

 5   rock and a hard place.       He either -- he or she either

 6   chooses to follow the law and risk --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:           That's right.       I was seeing

 8   a special problem with lawyers.              Call -- the unfairness

 9   problem that you are talking about, call that the

10   antitrust problem, because it is just as much.                But I

11   saw the special problem of putting the lawyer in the

12   impossible situation that you've just described.

13               Now it's with respect to that problem that

14   he offers the cure of reading the words "unconscionable"

15   and what is it?   "Unconscionable and unfair means."

16   Read those words to exempt the lawyer when he's in the

17   dilemma I discussed, and therefore the lawyer will not

18   have an incentive to -- to skew his advice.

19               MR. COAKLEY:        I believe that the lawyer

20   would be just subject to the rigors of the bona fide

21   error defense, the way any other debt collector as

22   defined from 1977 forward would be.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I suppose it would

24   make interpretation of the act a little more difficult.

25   The same practice would be unconscionable in -- not

                       Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                        40
 1   unconscionable in one circumstance, you would have an

 2   opinion saying this is not unconscionable; but yet if

 3   somebody else does it, you know, two weeks later, that

 4   doesn't have the same -- he says, well, look, it's not

 5   unconscionable, but it turns out it is, in his case.

 6               And it would have to be -- the opinion would

 7   have to clarify the law by saying, this is normally

 8   unconscionable but we are going to say it's not here

 9   because of this activity that is unlikely to happen.

10               MR. COAKLEY:        Mr. Chief Justice, I believe

11   this would be part of the inquiry that a lawyer would be

12   faced in trying to prove the affirmative defense of bona

13   fide error in a legal situation, and that -- that would

14   be part of the good faith analysis, part of the

15   reasonable procedures that he would present to the

16   court --

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Could we do that in the

18   context of this case?      Because we are talking on a

19   highly abstract level.       This is a statute that required

20   a validation notice, and for the most part the

21   validation notice that was sent to the debtor is exactly

22   the words of the statute.

23               But the lawyer added two words that are not

24   in this statute, "in writing."             Where did that come

25   from?   We are told this was not the model form that was

 1   used by the debt collectors' association.

 2                MR. COAKLEY:        There was a case, Graziano,

 3   Your Honor, that talked about the -- was construing the

 4   statute and specifically section 1692g(a)(3) and

 5   determining because g -- the second and third prong of

 6   the statute had the words in writing, does the first

 7   prong in order to be coherently read remain "in

 8   writing"?    Graziano says yes, you should put "in writing

 9   in order" to make a coherent --

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            It says you "should" --

11                MR. COAKLEY:        "Should."

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Rather than "may"?

13                MR. COAKLEY:        No.      Well Graziano suggested

14   "in writing" is the only effective way to construe this

15   statute; otherwise, it makes no sense.

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That issue is still

17   not settled, is it?

18                MR. COAKLEY:        That's correct, Mr. Chief

19   Justice.

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We still don't know

21   if the lawyer here was right or wrong.

22                MR. COAKLEY:        That's correct.          And that

23   actually points out a -- the unfairness of this whole

24   situation.   Because my clients, respondents tomorrow

25   could be sued in the Southern District of Ohio by

 1   somebody for -- because they took the words "in writing"

 2   out of their validation notice.              Immediately upon being

 3   sued in this case, they could be sued in the Southern

 4   District of Ohio for not following -- or not following

 5   Graziano, because somebody would conclude that that was

 6   the more effective way -- reading of that statute, and

 7   if they are wrong, then the lawyer has no bona fide

 8   error --

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Coakley, one of your

10   earlier statements confused me.              You relied upon the

11   fact that TILA was amended in 1980 to provide that legal

12   errors are not covered by the TILA defense, and I think

13   you -- I think you describe that as -- as changing the

14   law to -- to provide that -- that legal errors were not

15   covered.

16              But as I understood the situation, every

17   court of appeals to have construed TILA prior to 1980

18   had held that legal errors were not -- were not

19   included, as -- as your opponent says, they are not

20   included here.   So the amendment to TILA was just an

21   affirmation of the judicial interpretation of the

22   language similar to the language here.

23              MR. COAKLEY:         Justice Scalia, there were

24   cases, although not court of appeals cases that --

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Every court of appeals to

 1   construe it had held that mistakes of law were not

 2   covered.   Is that accurate or not?

 3               MR. COAKLEY:         That's correct.

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, then -- then your

 5   prior statement was very misleading.

 6               MR. COAKLEY:         Well, to the extent that there

 7   were two different -- two different analyses or

 8   interpretations that had emerged before 1980 that led

 9   the Congress to -- in 1980, enact or to amend TILA,

10   otherwise, as pointed out in the Herrera case in our

11   brief, if everything was so settled in 1980, why would

12   there be a need to clarify the definition of bona fide

13   error under TILA, and -- and if it was clarified in 1980

14   under the FDCPA, then why didn't they take the step and

15   clarify it in the FDCPA from 1980 to 2010, especially

16   when Congress --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:            There is no basis for

18   saying that the amendment was overturning -- changing

19   the prior meaning of TILA.           There is no basis for saying

20   that.   All you had were just a few district court

21   opinions, and all the courts of appeals have come out

22   the other way.

23               MR. COAKLEY:         Your Honor, the -- the

24   Petitioner's position was that the case law was uniform

25   at the time, and our position is the case law was not


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                         44
 1   uniform at the time.    There were cases that had taken an

 2   opposite approach to the court of appeals decision on --

 3   on TILA, and that is what led to Congress reacting in

 4   1980 to specifically exclude legal error from the TILA

 5   defense and has -- Congress has --

 6              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But why doesn't that just

 7   mean that Congress wants to confirm that the judges --

 8   the majority of judges who -- who had held that it

 9   didn't -- that errors of law were not a defense, that

10   they were right, it's not changing -- changing anything.

11   It's just confirming that the majority view is right.

12              MR. COAKLEY:        Well, Justice Ginsburg, the

13   case law says that the law has to be settled, and as we

14   pointed out in our brief, it was not settled, and the

15   courts, afterwards, have reflected that there was no

16   settlement, and that that's one of the reasons why the

17   error portion of the TILA bona fide error was -- was

18   clarified, as the Petitioner puts it, to say this

19   excludes any interpretations of legal -- of legal -- of

20   the legal interpretations of TILA.

21              And then there was no -- whether you call it

22   a clarification, whether you call it a ratification,

23   whether you call it an amendment, it doesn't matter,

24   Congress didn't then similarly amend the FDCPA to be

25   consistent with their --

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, why wouldn't one

 2   say, now, Congress has confirmed that the word in the

 3   Truth and Lending Act means thus and so, Congress has

 4   said that's what those words mean, and then go back to

 5   the other statutes and say the same language was used,

 6   so it means the same thing, the same thing that Congress

 7   has just confirmed?

 8                 MR. COAKLEY:        Justice Ginsburg, I believe

 9   that the -- the words "bona fide error" in the TILA

10   statute were being construed, although not by courts of

11   appeals, to reasonably read the bona fide error

12   encompasses legal error.

13                 There was a change -- change -- a

14   clarification, whatever, in 1980, to specifically say,

15   bona fide error does not include legal interpretations

16   of TILA, and that was then never clarified, ratified, or

17   whatever, nothing was done to the FDCPA at that time,

18   and -- and the --

19                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Were there any district

20   court decisions, of any kind, reading bona fide errors

21   to mean legal mistakes under any of the other statutes?

22                 MR. COAKLEY:        I --

24   changed, the ones that Justice Ginsburg is -- is

 4   Congress may or may not have acted --

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              I'm talking about under

 7   this statute, under any other statute that uses similar

 8   language.

 9               MR. COAKLEY:         Yes --

10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Were there any district

11   court cases that were reading those statutes to include

12   mistakes of law?

13               MR. COAKLEY:         Well, in this case that we are

14   here on, Judge Gaughan from the U.S. District Court of

15   the Northern District of Ohio read the -- read that

16   TILA --

17               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              But that was after the

18   TILA amendment?

19               MR. COAKLEY:         That was after the amendment.

20   Now, you're talking about before 1980?

24   came into effect in 1977, and the -- TILA was in 1968.

25   You are asking between '68 and '77?                     The were -- the

                                                                          47
 1   Wellmaker case did -- did construe the statute to

 2   include legal error.

 3                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Do you think that a -- a

 4   mistake of law has to be substantively reasonable in

 5   order to fall within this defense, and if so, where do

 6   you get that?    Where do you find that in the statute?

 7                 MR. COAKLEY:       The statute doesn't refer to

 8   substantively or procedurally, Justice Alito, the

 9   statute refers to bona fide error and the maintenance of

10   procedures reasonably adapted.              As a -- as a -- as

11   either a lay debt collector or as a lawyer debt

12   collector, they must establish good faith in attempting

13   to comply with the law as it existed at the time.

14                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, suppose that a lawyer

15   spends a whole week researching a question, but arrives

16   at a conclusion that is plainly incorrect, does not,

17   therefore, intend to violate the statute and proceeds in

18   good faith.    Would that -- how would that work out?

19                 MR. COAKLEY:       Well, in proving --

20                 JUSTICE ALITO:         It would be an unreasonable

21   decision, and yet, would it -- it would fall within your

22   understanding of this provision; is that correct?

23                 MR. COAKLEY:       Absolutely.            I mean, he

24   would -- he would have -- that lawyer would have to meet

25   the three prongs of the affirmative defense by a


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                             48
 1   preponderance of the evidence.               If he doesn't prove all

 2   of the prongs, he's out.          If he proves all of the

 3   prongs, he's in, and if he creates an issue of fact on

 4   one of the three prongs, than he's going back to the

 5   district court for a fact-finding analysis, which turns

 6   out to be the -- you know, this statute has not proved

 7   to be unworkable.

 8               And if I could follow up to Justice Scalia's

 9   and Justice Ginsburg's query about the -- the -- and

10   Justice Sotomayor's -- about the interpretation of the

11   words "TILA" versus "FDCPA," I think a review of the

12   cases of the Seventh and Tenth Circuits is instructive

13   because the Seventh Circuit was one of the circuits

14   that, under TILA, had -- had interpreted the word to

15   mean clerical error only.           The Tenth Circuit -- and the

16   tenth circuit as well.

17               Now, today, under interpreting the FDCPA

18   bona fide error, they have abrogated that meaning in

19   TILA and have come around to this means legal error

20   under the FDCPA.

21               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Could you answer one

22   question -- I'm just a little confused about.                    One

23   statute has the defense in expressly.                    The other

24   doesn't.   Is there a difference in the likelihood of

25   unfairness under the two statutes?                  Why -- is there a


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review

                                                                            49
 1   reason why Congress would have wanted to provide a

 2   mistake of law defense under TILA and not in this --

 3   this -- in this case?        Why would it treat them

 4   differently?

 5               MR. COAKLEY:          There -- there are

 6   differences -- substantial differences, Justice Stevens,

 7   in the TILA and in the FDCPA statute, starting with the

 8   purposes of the statute, starting with the construction

 9   of the statute, one, TILA has a criminal liability, TILA

10   has life lines that the debt collector doesn't have in

11   the FDCPA, TILA dealing -- is dealing with disclosure of

12   financial information, TILA has regulations, as opposed

13   to no regulations --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I would think all -- which

15   way do these cut?     I mean, the fact that there is

16   criminal liability under TILA would seem to me to cut in

17   precisely the opposite direction.                  You would want to

18   provide excuses of bona fide errors of law, I would

19   think.   Why -- am I missing something here?

20               MR. COAKLEY:          The -- no, Your Honor.

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I would think --

22               MR. COAKLEY:          It's a -- it's a distinction

23   between why -- in trying to answer Justice Stevens'

24   question, it's a distinction why TILA would be

25   interpreted differently by the -- than the FDCPA.

 1               JUSTICE STEVENS:            But the question is -- is

 2   there a greater need for the mistake of law defense

 3   under one statute, rather than the other, I sort of --

 4               MR. COAKLEY:        Given --

 5               JUSTICE STEVENS:            -- have the same problem

 6   Justice Scalia expressed.

 7               MR. COAKLEY:        Given -- well, given the

 8   purpose of TILA, and TILA dealing with computational

 9   errors, regulation C, Truth in Lending, they -- they

10   amend -- they amended TILA -- I mean, I'm sorry.

11   Originally TILA didn't have a bona fide error and then

12   they amended it so as to -- before it was enacted -- so

13   as to cover this area to provide for the computational

14   error.   Because it's so fraught with mathematical errors

15   and the like.

16               That is not the situation in the FDCPA.                And

17   that is precisely the reasoning that is the Seventh and

18   Tenth Circuit have noted, and the case of Frye that we

19   have cited in our brief has noted, as the distinction

20   between these two statutes, and why one could be

21   interpreted this way and the FDCPA could be reasonably

22   interpreted the other way.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So I mean, you're --

24   the substance of your answer is that they are just two

25   very different statutes.

 1              MR. COAKLEY:         Absolutely.

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But I -- but I share

 3   Justice Scalia's concern, I mean the -- the ways in

 4   which they are different would suggest you need the

 5   legal mistake defense more in TILA than you do in the

 6   FDCPA.

 7              MR. COAKLEY:         Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I

 8   don't believe that that is consistent with the purpose

 9   of -- of TILA.   And certainly lawyers are not -- lawyers

10   are not creditors under TILA.            And -- so that's a

11   distinction between the -- the two statutes.               And

12   further, the -- there is an administrative penalty under

13   the FDCPA that -- the $16,000 a day, but the bona fide

14   error does not apply to that.            So there is no

15   inconsistency between the administrative penalties under

16   the FDCPA and the civil penalties under the FDCPA.

17              And in -- and in truth, the -- the statutes

18   are -- are significantly different.

19              JUSTICE BREYER:            I was wondering if you

20   know, can you give me just a rough idea, of the

21   percentage of instances in which people write to the FTC

22   to take advantage of the safe harbor and the FTC just

23   says, "Well, we won't tell you."

24              MR. COAKLEY:         I do not have that empirical

25   evidence, Your Honor.      I do know that the briefs are


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   consistent on this point, and as admitted to by the

 2   Petitioners, there have been four advisory opinions from

 3   the FDCPA -- from the FTC in 30 years.

 4              JUSTICE BREYER:              How many have asked?

 5              MR. COAKLEY:           I don't know how many have

 6   asked.

 7              JUSTICE BREYER:              I mean, it seems to me

 8   that's the obvious solution to the problem, that --

 9   until you hold they are not -- they are liable for

10   mistake of law, but anyone can write to the FTC ahead of

11   time and -- and get a safe harbor.

12              It's -- so I don't know what we could do to

13   suggest maybe that mechanism, which is built into the

14   statute, should be used.

15              MR. COAKLEY:           I think that --

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Didn't Mr. Jay tell us

17   there were seven requests?            Are you disputing that?

18              MR. COAKLEY:           I am not disputing that,

19   Justice Ginsburg.     What I am basically saying is it

20   really doesn't make any difference, because the truth

21   with respect to the FTC and the safe harbor defense and

22   the FDCPA, that Mr. Jay does not argue that one is

23   superfluous to the other; the Petitioner argues that one

24   makes the other superfluous -- neither are superfluous

25   to the other.

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, all right.       But I

 2   mean, if there have been seven requests and four answers

 3   then all these horrible things that are going to happen

 4   if you do say there is -- unless you have mistake of law

 5   defense, aren't going to happen.                Because all that has

 6   to happen is that people write to the FTC and they get

 7   an answer.

 8                MR. COAKLEY:        But the safe harbor defense on

 9   its face applies prospectively.               The FDCPA bona fide

10   error defense --

11                JUSTICE BREYER:           That means lawyer, if you

12   are worried about this, go write before you do it.

13                MR. COAKLEY:        Yes, but the bona fide error

14   defense applies retrospectively.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I see I have a copy

16   in the retail -- Association of Retail Collection

17   Trades.   The first -- second sentence in the FTC's

18   response is I apologize for the delay in responding to

19   your request.

20                MR. COAKLEY:        I --

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                It is not an

22   atypical issue in dealing with government agencies.

23                MR. COAKLEY:        And -- yes, Mr. Chief Justice,

24   and the penultimate paragraph in there:                 For the

25   foregoing reasons your request for advisory opinion does

 1   not satisfy either the prerequisites described, well --

 2   and accordingly we can't -- grant it.

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Mr. Coakley, why do you

 4   need a safe harbor if there is no store?                  I mean what is

 5   the purpose of -- of having this procedure, however

 6   inefficient it may be, what is the purpose of having it

 7   unless you were going to be liable if you make a mistake

 8   of law?

 9              MR. COAKLEY:           The safe harbor --

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:              You are talking about a

11   safe harbor rule.     Leave the harbor.

12              MR. COAKLEY:           Justice Scalia, as it worked

13   out the safe harbor is neither safe nor a harbor, but

14   that's not the perspective that we have to look at it.

15   We have to look at it from 1997, it was for a

16   prospective course of conduct that gives the debt

17   collector categorical --

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:              What does that have to do

19   -- what does that have to do with anything, whether it's

20   prospective or not?      The point is what benefit does it

21   give to the person who is asking?                  If the person is not

22   going to be liable for a bona fide mistake, why would he

23   ever use it?

24              MR. COAKLEY:           Well, there are reasons why a

25   debt collector may use it if he has time and he needs

                       Official - Subject to Final Review

 1   the prospective letter from the FTC.                   In -- in reality

 2   debt collector's going to go to the bona fide error

 3   because it's retrospective, although there is risk with

 4   the bona fide error, because it's not the categorical

 5   immunity that the safe harbor gives.                   And there's --

 6   they're not inconsistent.

 7               The safe harbor is not a --a statutory

 8   interpretation why you should drive a meaning into the

 9   bona fide error provision that is not apparent on its

10   face.

11               I would say in closing that Justice Breyer,

12   your -- your comments earlier are just right.                  This is

13   worse -- a reading, the safe harbor, reading the bona

14   fide error provision to exclude legal error is worse

15   than unfair.

16               JUSTICE BREYER:           Oh, now I do see -- which

17   is why I asked the question, I asked to get an answer,

18   and the answer now seems to be floating around the FTC

19   idea.   It's -- seven letters, that isn't very much.                    I

20   just wonder if the -- if the bar in this area, and their

21   clients, if they made an effort, might be able to get

22   the financing for the FTC so they could have enough

23   people to respond quickly to the letter.

24               (Laughter.)

25               MR. COAKLEY:        Justice Ginsburg asked the

 1   question about unprecedented.             In -- in truth, what

 2   would really be unprecedented here would be for this

 3   Court to construe the bona fide error defense so that a

 4   lawyer or a debt collector who is giving advice to his

 5   client to follow a particular way of action, and the law

 6   was unsettled, for that lawyer to be subject to -- to be

 7   punished for personal liability.                And we think that the

 8   bona fide error clearly under Lamie encompasses --

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:            There are severe limits on

10   the liability, aren't there?             Isn't there a thousand --

11   isn't it a $1,000 limit?

12               MR. COAKLEY:         Yes, Your Honor.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's not big bucks for an

14   attorney, is it?

15               (Laughter.)

16               MR. COAKLEY:         But let that -- well, maybe

17   for the prior group that was up here, but I don't --

18               (Laughter.)

19               MR. COAKLEY:         It's big in Cleveland.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             This isn't -- this is a

21   class action, wasn't it?         It was brought as a class

22   action?

23               MR. COAKLEY:         This is definitely a class

24   action.   This is a class action that wants all of the

25   validation notices that were sent out by this law firm


                          Alderson Reporting Company

                                                                            57
 1   to -- that included the words "in writing" in it for

 2   that period, and further than that, they wanted the

 3   financial information from the law firm, the financials

 4   because, under the class action provision, it's $500,000

 5   or 1% of the net worth of the firm, which is ever less.

 6              So the request was made of my client, give

 7   me the financials of your law firm, and for some reason,

 8   my client did, but this -- the statute was not meant to

 9   punish lay debt collectors, including lawyers.

10              The bona fide error defense is the shield,

11   and we ask the court to affirm the judgment of the Sixth

12   Circuit Court of Appeals.
