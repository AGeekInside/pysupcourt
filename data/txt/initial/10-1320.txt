 4   next in Case 10-1320, Blueford v. Arkansas.

 5                  Mr. Sloan.

 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD M. SLOAN

 7                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                  MR. SLOAN:    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10                  The question in this case is whether the

11   jury foreperson's announcement that the jury had voted

12   unanimously that Petitioner was not guilty of capital

13   murder and first-degree murder has double jeopardy

14   consequences.    We respectfully submit that it does, for

15   two reasons.

16                  First, the foreperson's announcement on this

17   record establishes an acquittal; and, second, even if it

18   is not viewed as an acquittal, under this Court's

19   well-established standard, there was not manifest

20   necessity for a second trial on the same murder charges.

21                  Now, with regard to the acquittal, the

22   reasons why the foreperson's announcement was an

23   acquittal are twofold:       First, the foreperson's

24   announcement was clear and explicit that the jury had

25   voted unanimously against guilt; and, second --


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                              4
 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Is that -- is that

 2   altogether clear, because she first said -- didn't she

 3   first say that the jury cannot agree on any one charge?

 4                 MR. SLOAN:    Yes, Your Honor.        And then the

 5   court specifically asked what is the count on capital

 6   murder?   And she said unanimous against that.           What is

 7   the count on first-degree murder?            Unanimous against

 8   that.   And both the Arkansas trial court and the

 9   Arkansas Supreme Court here observed that the foreperson

10   has been explicit that the jury had voted unanimously

11   against --.

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       Well, that's the count.        The

13   jury takes lots of votes.        Was it utterly clear that the

14   jury could not go back and reconsider that?            Unless that

15   was absolutely clear, it seems to me a verdict had not

16   been announced.   She just said how we voted the last

17   time.

18                 MR. SLOAN:    With regard to finality, Your

19   Honor, I think that -- that the jury could have changed

20   its mind, but I want to emphasize the reason I say that

21   because I think it highlights something very important

22   that is conspicuously absent here; and three brief

23   points on that, Your Honor.

24                 First, when the foreperson announced that

25   the jury had voted unanimously against guilt on the


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                        5
 1   murder charges, she was announcing a jury decision.

 2   There was nothing equivocal or qualified about that.

 3                  Second, Your Honor --

 4                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       Excuse me.      Excuse me.

 5   When you say she was announcing a decision, then you

 6   mean they can't go back on it?

 7                  MR. SLOAN:    No, that was -- well, that's

 8   my second --

 9                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       She was announcing a vote.

10                  MR. SLOAN:    Yes.         She was announcing the

11   decision that they had made at that point.             But the

12   reason -- my second point, Your Honor, the reason why I

13   say that they could have gone back is the historic

14   traditional principle that a jury can correct or revise

15   a verdict while it continues to be sitting.

16                  Now, in this Court's opinion, in Smith v.

17   Massachusetts, this Court talked about that traditional

18   and historic principle, cited an English case from 1824,

19   the Parkin case, where the jury had done that, had gone

20   back after announcing a verdict.             And how that would

21   play out here, if the jury came back and they said, you

22   know, we were unanimous before, but now one juror says

23   that he doesn't really agree with that, then, of course,

24   a court could take that into account.

25                  JUSTICE ALITO:       I think you've conceded away


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                               6
 1   your case when you say that.              The one characteristic of

 2   a verdict that seems perfectly clear to me is that it is

 3   final.

 4                  The jury can't render a verdict and be

 5   discharged and then come back the next day and say, you

 6   know what, some of us -- one of us has changed his mind

 7   or her mind.    It's the final vote.               And so, why isn't

 8   the critical question here whether what the -- what the

 9   foreperson said was this is our final vote, we're not

10   going to go back, this is it; or this is the way we

11   voted now, and it's -- one or more of us may have wanted

12   to -- wanted to retain the right, reserve the right, to

13   go back and -- and vote again.

14                  MR. SLOAN:    Because the -- the reason why I

15   think the announcement was an acquittal here is twofold:

16   First, there was the explicit statement of -- of what

17   the vote was at that time; but, second, there is nothing

18   on the record in this case that contradicts that

19   statement.   At the time the jury was discharged and at

20   the time the trial ended, the jury had said nothing that

21   contradicted that earlier statement.

22                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Suppose the -- suppose the

23   court said, after this colloquy, I want you to go back

24   and think about this whole case again.                 Could the jurors

25   then have revisited the first count?

 1                MR. SLOAN:    Well --

 2                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           The capital murder count?

 3                MR. SLOAN:    Your Honor, if -- if the jurors

 4   had come back and said --

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           No.   The colloquy is what

 6   we've got.

 7                MR. SLOAN:    Yes.

 8                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And the judge said I want

 9   you to deliberate more about this entire case.            (A) was

10   he permitted to do that under Arkansas law, I guess is

11   one of my real questions.

12                MR. SLOAN:    Oh.     Well, in terms -- in terms

13   of Arkansas law and the particular transition

14   instructions here, no, we don't think that the

15   transition instructions operate that way, Your Honor.

16   There's nothing in the instructions that say that --

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Nothing -- nothing --

18   Arkansas law doesn't permit the jury to -- before it's

19   delivered its final formal verdict, to think about the

20   case again and vote on it again?

21                MR. SLOAN:    No.     It -- it does, Your Honor,

22   and that's why I'm trying to draw a distinction between

23   how the transition instructions here operate, the sort

24   of acquittal-first instructions, and the general

25   principle that a jury can correct or revise its verdict.

 1   I mean, in a sense, one way to think about --

 2                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, but I -- I think

 3   this may be what Justice Alito asked.             Well, I -- I

 4   don't think it gave a verdict here.              I don't think it's

 5   revising its verdict.

 6                MR. SLOAN:    Well --

 7                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It's mid-deliberation, as

 8   Justice -- Justice Scalia said at the outset.

 9                MR. SLOAN:    There -- there's nothing in the

10   jury statement at all that suggested that it was

11   tentative.   It said we have unanimously voted against

12   guilt on the murder charges.

13                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Counsel, one --

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But then they went -- then

15   they went out again.

16                MR. SLOAN:    Pardon me?

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           And that's the problem.

18   They, the jury -- the judge gave them an Allen charge,

19   and they went out again.      And I think you have

20   recognized that the jury could have then said we'll go

21   back to square one, we'll consider capital murder,

22   first-degree murder.

23                So, they -- I think you recognize that after

24   the judge gives them a charge of this kind, they can

25   begin all over again.     And here, when they came in and


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                          9
 1   said we -- we can't agree, defense counsel didn't ask to

 2   have the jury polled.

 3                MR. SLOAN:      The -- the defense counsel asked

 4   for verdict forms to be sent into the jury room that

 5   would allow them to record their verdicts on the murder

 6   charges.   And that's a very important point here, Your

 7   Honor, because it was the State that prevented any

 8   additional elucidation about what the jury thought on

 9   the murder charges.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:         But that -- so long as it's

11   still tentative thoughts, it doesn't matter.            The jury

12   could have -- suppose the jury went back after this

13   announcement -- you know, we -- you know, we've decided

14   on a -- on the greater charge, or we voted on the

15   greater charge for the defendant.             Suppose they go back

16   and one of the people who wants to convict on the lesser

17   charge, as to which they are deadlocked, finally says,

18   well, look it, if you won't come along to convict him on

19   the lesser charge, by God, I'm not -- I'm not going to

20   acquit on the greater charge.

21                Isn't that the kind of stuff that goes on in

22   jury rooms all the time?

23                MR. SLOAN:      Yes, it does, Your Honor.

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:         So, there is no certainty

25   whatever that -- that what was the vote at that time


                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   would be the vote when they finally got done.

 2               MR. SLOAN:     Well, but, Your Honor, on the

 3   record as the case comes to this Court, what you have is

 4   this very clear and explicit statement against guilt on

 5   the murder charges and then nothing in what the jury

 6   says when it comes back that contradicts that --

 7               JUSTICE KAGAN:        Well, I guess one --

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Counsel, I thought that

 9   part of your argument was that, given the instructions

10   in this case, which the jury appears to have followed to

11   the T, they can't get to a lesser count unless they've

12   acquitted on the preceding count.

13               MR. SLOAN:     Yes.

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          When the judge asks

15   them, did you reach criminal negligence, they say we

16   were told not to.

17               Now, the judge, whether he was right or

18   wrong under Hughes as to whether they followed the

19   instructions or he misunderstood them, I don't know.

20   But it's very clear in context from the government's

21   arguments to the jury, to the defense argument to the

22   jury, you don't reach the split count or even talk about

23   it unless you've been acquitted.

24               So, given that the jury responds at the end

25   we haven't reached a verdict, and the jury said earlier


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that they hadn't reached a verdict on the one issue,

 2   isn't the -- the only assumption is that they didn't go

 3   back?

 4                MR. SLOAN:      Yes, I think that's exactly

 5   right, Your Honor, because the jury instructions very

 6   explicitly said that you don't go to a lesser offense

 7   unless you have a reasonable doubt on the greater

 8   offense.   The State --

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, it's --

10                MR. SLOAN: -- over and over --

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm sorry.   Go

12   ahead.

13                MR. SLOAN:      I was just going to say the

14   State over and over again in its closing argument said

15   to the jury you cannot reach a lesser offense unless you

16   unanimously find the defendant not guilty on the greater

17   offense.   And as you point out, the Arkansas Supreme

18   Court in the Hughes case has said that the law in

19   Arkansas is that you don't get to a lesser offense

20   unless -- the jury doesn't get to a lesser offense

21   unless it in essence acquits on the greater offense.

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Right, but that's

23   the final say.   You don't know what the jury did as a

24   preliminary matter.      I would think it in a case like

25   this perfectly reasonable for the jury to say:                  Let's

 1   take a preliminary vote; we'll go down; and if -- if we

 2   all agree on something right away, that's what we'll do.

 3                 Does everybody agree on capital murder?              No,

 4   some don't.   Does everybody agree on murder?             No.   Does

 5   everybody agree on manslaughter?             Yes.   Okay, we all

 6   know that manslaughter, he's at least guilty.              Now let's

 7   go back and talk about the more serious offense, and

 8   some of us will try to persuade the holdouts.

 9                 And yet, you would say as soon as they

10   reached the point of saying, yes, he's guilty on

11   manslaughter, they can't go back.

12                 MR. SLOAN:     Well, the instructions don't

13   provide for them to -- for them to go back.              The State,

14   which had never made that argument until this Court in

15   this litigation, that they can go back, doesn't point to

16   any case that --

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, but then I'm not

18   sure it's just a matter of State law then, we're --

19   what we're doing here is talking about the

20   constitutional minimum.        And I -- Justice Scalia gave a

21   hypothetical, you can have a more -- even a more

22   principled juror than that.          He says, you know, now that

23   we're thinking about manslaughter, it is true that thus

24   and so happened; maybe we were wrong on the first --

25   first-degree count.      I mean, that's perfectly plausible.

 1               MR. SLOAN:     Well, let me say, whatever one

 2   thinks about finality -- and I do think there was

 3   sufficient finality here for the reasons we have been

 4   discussing, but whatever one thinks about finality,

 5   let's consider this in the context of manifest necessity

 6   because whatever one thinks of finality, I submit that

 7   it is clear that when a jury foreperson stands up in

 8   front of the jury, in front of the defendant, lawyers

 9   for both sides, and says we have voted unanimously that

10   he is not guilty of these murder charges, that is

11   something at the very core of the Double Jeopardy

12   Clause --

13               JUSTICE ALITO:       Are you saying --

14               MR. SLOAN:     -- at the heartland of it.

15               JUSTICE ALITO:       Are you saying that there

16   was no manifest necessity to declare a mistrial as to

17   any count, in which case there could be no retrial

18   whatsoever, or no manifest necessity to declare a

19   mistrial on capital murder?       And if you're saying the

20   latter, then what would you have us do with the decision

21   by the Arkansas Supreme Court that Arkansas law does not

22   allow a partial verdict?

23               MR. SLOAN:     Okay.       Your Honor, so, first I'm

24   saying only that there was no manifest necessity as to

25   capital murder and first-degree murder, which were the

 1   two charges on which they were unanimous.       We agree he

 2   can be retried on manslaughter and negligent homicide.

 3               Now, as to the Arkansas Supreme Court

 4   decision on that -- and that brings up a very important

 5   point because the State's position essentially is it

 6   could never be final enough, as Your Honor suggests,

 7   because it simply is impermissible under Arkansas law to

 8   have an acquittal on a greater offense as long as you're

 9   deadlocked on a lesser offense.

10               And as to that, this Court's opinions are

11   clear that if you have a State law that prevents giving

12   effect to what is in substance an acquittal, it must

13   yield to the Federal constitutional command of the

14   Double Jeopardy Clause.

15               And Hudson v. Louisiana is very instructive

16   on this point because, in Hudson, Louisiana had a law

17   that after a conviction, a judge could not enter an

18   acquittal order; he could only enter a new trial order.

19   And after the conviction on murder in Hudson, the judge

20   entered a new trial order and explained that it was

21   because of insufficient evidence.

22               And this Court unanimously said that that

23   substantively was an acquittal; it has full double

24   jeopardy consequences, notwithstanding the fact that

25   Louisiana law does not allow a judge to enter an

 1   acquittal order --

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:         What's bothering me is I

 3   can't figure this out very well.             We have an imaginary

 4   State, and what the State says to the jury:                 Jury, you

 5   have three choices.      Choice one is you acquit this

 6   person of everything.       Choice two is you convict him of

 7   something.   Choice three is you say you're hung.                 Okay?

 8                I don't see anything in the Constitution

 9   that prevents a State from doing that.                 So, if that --

10   if no -- what is it?      And, of course, if you follow

11   that, there was no acquittal on those early charges.

12   That wasn't a permissible verdict.                 And now you

13   structure your argument any way you want, but that

14   the State has -- I would think, within the limits of due

15   process, it can structure the jury's arguments as it

16   wishes.

17                But -- so, what's wrong with that?                  And if

18   that -- if there's nothing wrong with that, then how do

19   you win?

20                MR. SLOAN:      Okay, Your Honor.            Two points:

21   One that focuses on the jury foreperson's announcement

22   here --

23                JUSTICE BREYER:         Well, you could say, well,

24   you could -- well, that's one route.                 What you say is

25   nothing wrong with that.        But if the judge is foolish

 1   enough to get the jury -- to get the foreperson to say

 2   what the state of the deliberation is in detail, then

 3   the Double Jeopardy Clause kicks in.               Well, that's an

 4   argument.

 5                 MR. SLOAN:    Well, Your Honor --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:       So, they make a mistake and

 7   now suddenly it's jeopardy where it wasn't before,

 8   or -- this seems like a minor matter compared to the

 9   issues of jeopardy, whether the jury honestly said what

10   was going on in the room, particularly if it's

11   changeable.

12                 MR. SLOAN:    With respect, Your Honor, I

13   disagree that it's a minor matter when a foreperson

14   stands up, with the jury present, and says we have voted

15   not guilty.   And as to that, with an announcement -- for

16   example, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court

17   decision in the Roth case, which is in the briefs, is

18   instructive because in that case the Massachusetts court

19   said very emphatically you should not ask a jury that

20   kind of question, but --

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:       Okay.         So, let's -- go

22   ahead.

23                 MR. SLOAN:    But -- may I just finish --

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:       Please.

25                 MR. SLOAN:    -- the sentence, Your Honor?


                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1                But in that case, the trial court had asked

 2   the jury, and the foreperson had said that they had

 3   voted against guilt on the greater offenses.           And so,

 4   the Massachusetts court said, if the -- essentially,

 5   these are my words -- but if the Double Jeopardy Clause

 6   means anything, it means that when you have an

 7   announcement like that, it has to matter.

 8                And the other point, Your Honor, is that

 9   this Court's opinions such as Fong Foo and Sanabria say

10   that it doesn't matter if an acquittal is on an

11   erroneous basis.   Once it happens, we give full double

12   jeopardy consequence to it.        So, even if one thinks that

13   the judge shouldn't have asked the question and it would

14   have been permissible not to ask the question, once he

15   did and once that's on the record, that is of

16   considerable constitutional --

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Only if --

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Why should there --

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Only if -- and I think this

20   is the premise of your argument.           Only if there is a

21   constitutional necessity to -- to sever the various

22   charges, there is a constitutional necessity to let the

23   jury come in on one charge without coming in on the

24   other.   It seems to me that's the premise of your

25   argument.   And I don't know where that constitutional

 1   necessity comes from.

 2                 MR. SLOAN:    Well, Your Honor, first, on the

 3   manifest necessity point, when there is an

 4   announcement like this, because --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       Your manifest necessity

 6   depends upon the necessity of severing, yes.            If you

 7   sever, then there is no manifest necessity of

 8   resubmitting the greater charge.            But it assumes -- it

 9   assumes a severing, and I don't know where the severing

10   comes from.

11                 MR. SLOAN:    The -- the manifest necessity

12   argument is that when there is an announcement like this

13   that goes right to the core of double jeopardy -- and,

14   you know, we know that with greater and lesser included

15   offenses, if there is a basis for an acquittal, then

16   that has to be given effect on the separate charges.

17   That's Green and Price.

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But that's -- but that's

19   after a verdict.   Why is it that the purposes of the

20   Double Jeopardy Clause are implicated when a jury,

21   before it delivers a final verdict, says where -- where

22   it is mid -- mid-deliberations?            The defendant, of

23   course, is terribly disappointed if they go back and

24   then find him guilty.      So, I guess there's a personal

25   disappointment interest for the few hours that it takes

 1   for the jury to come to a different verdict, but he

 2   doesn't have to prepare the defense again; he doesn't

 3   have to go to trial again.        It's all one trial.

 4                I don't see why there's a double jeopardy

 5   interest in the Massachusetts case that you point out.

 6   I don't see where the double jeopardy interest was in

 7   saying that you can't go back.

 8                MR. SLOAN:    Well, because --

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What -- what --

10                MR. SLOAN:    It's not --

11                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What purpose of the Double

12   Jeopardy Clause is implicated by the rule that says you

13   can't go back?

14                MR. SLOAN:    Well, Your Honor, on the

15   manifest necessity point, I'm not saying you can't get

16   back.   What I am saying is that when you have an

17   announcement of such constitutional moment at the

18   heartland of the Double Jeopardy Clause, a judge can do

19   many things --

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I'm asking why it's the

21   heartland of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

22                MR. SLOAN:    Well, because this Court --

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I question that.

24                MR. SLOAN:    Yes, Your Honor.         Because this

25   Court, again and again, has talked about the special

 1   role of an acquittal where a jury finds the defendant

 2   not guilty.     Now, even if one views that as not final,

 3   it surely is significant at the heartland of the Double

 4   Jeopardy --

 5                   JUSTICE BREYER:       Why "surely"?

 6                   MR. SLOAN:    Pardon?

 7                   JUSTICE BREYER:       I mean, why "surely"?

 8   Look, the thing ends.        To go back to my example, the

 9   case is over, the jury comes in and says, Judge, we're

10   hung.   Okay?    Everybody is going to go home.

11                   MR. SLOAN:    Okay.

12                   JUSTICE BREYER:       But the defense lawyer

13   says, Judge, I'd like to know which of the five charges

14   they're on.     Does the defense lawyer or the prosecutor

15   have a constitutional right to find out?

16                   MR. SLOAN:    Okay.        Well, Your Honor.   If one

17   assumes the foreperson's announcement is not in it or

18   it's of no consequence -- it's --

19                   JUSTICE BREYER:       No, I'm not assuming

20   anything.   I'm giving you the example.

21                   MR. SLOAN:    What -- but, no, no -- it's just

22   what I'm saying.     So, there's just the question, does

23   the defendant have a right to inquire?

 6   is -- remember, there were three possible verdicts:

 7   Acquit of everything, convict of something, or say

 8   you're hung.    That's what we're imagining.              Okay?    And

12   for Arkansas here, that has addressed the issue in the

12   Honor.

13                 Judge, I would like a poll of the jury, each

14   juror, as to numbers one, two, three, and four to be

15   sure that they were unanimous on each as to the

16   acquittal, which under the instruction allowed them to

17   go to the next one.

18                 Okay?   Constitution requires it?

19                 MR. SLOAN:     Well, no.        I mean, look, I think

20   there can be variations in State procedure, but I think

21   the core --

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:        No, no.       Why doesn't the

23   Constitution require it?        You have to be sure there was

24   an acquittal.   You have to be sure there was an

25   acquittal.    And what -- what I'm doing obviously is I'm

 1   spinning out what I see as the constitutional

 2   consequences of taking your constitutional position, and

 3   I'm going to be ending up by saying I've never heard of

 4   this before.

 5                  MR. SLOAN:    Well --

 6                  JUSTICE BREYER:       But there's a lot of stuff

 7   I haven't heard of.      So, that doesn't prove that much.

 8                  (Laughter.)

 9                  MR. SLOAN:    Well, there are several States

10   that have this, and the reason --

11                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Counsel, what do several

12   States have?    I've -- if I read what those States are

13   saying, including the Massachusetts State that you point

14   to, it's a very simple rule.              And you seem to be arguing

15   past it or around it or -- I think what they say is,

16   once the jury announces an acquittal, then that's the

17   substance; the person's been acquitted once they've made

18   a judgment and announced it.              It -- the Constitution

19   doesn't -- the Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't entitle

20   someone to have it announced, doesn't entitle someone to

21   force the jury to announce it.

22                  But if the jury gets up at the end of the

23   trial in a State that doesn't permit partial verdicts

24   and said, contrary to the instructions of the judge,

25   contrary to the law of the State, the jury says we

                                                                          25
 1   acquitted on counts one and two, we're hung on count

 2   three, the Constitution says jeopardy attaches because

 3   there has been an announcement of a verdict.           Isn't that

 4   your position?

 5               MR. SLOAN:     That's exactly right.           There's

 6   another body of case law also which I was addressing,

 7   which talks about when jeopardy attaches even if there's

 8   not that kind of announcement.           But, Your Honor --

 9               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Well, Ball -- our case

10   in Ball says it doesn't matter whether a judgment is

11   entered or not.   As far back as 1896, Ball said the

12   judgment is irrelevant.      It is the verdict of acquittal,

13   and it basically equated that verdict with -- it doesn't

14   matter if it's entered properly, if the jury is polled,

15   if anything happens.    It's as soon as the jury announces

16   acquittal, that's the operative double jeopardy kicker.

17   Isn't that what you're saying?

18               MR. SLOAN:     Yes.         Yes, Your Honor.

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            And I thought I heard

20   you arguing that here the lack of manifest necessity was

21   that the judge had heard they reached that verdict.

22               MR. SLOAN:     Well --

23               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            And he should not have

24   discharged the jury without asking them, could they

25   reach a verdict that they had -- had they reached the

 1   verdict that they announced?

 2                MR. SLOAN:     Yes.         From a manifest necessity

 3   perspective, this Court's decisions on manifest

 4   necessity, from United States v. Perez in 1824 through

 5   Renico v. Lett in 2010, have emphasized the judge has to

 6   exercise sound discretion.         And to exercise sound

 7   discretion here, the judge could have done many things,

 8   but the one thing he could not do, consistent with sound

 9   discretion, is to do nothing and to proceed as though

10   that announcement hadn't happened, and --

11                JUSTICE ALITO:        You suggested that the --

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               You've talked about

13   our manifest necessity decisions.            It's true that we --

14   isn't it, that we said last year we have never reversed

15   the district courts' exercise of discretion under the

16   manifest necessity standard?

17                MR. SLOAN:     In the case of a jury deadlock?

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Yes.

19                MR. SLOAN:     Is what Your Honor is talking

20   about?   Yes, this Court has emphasized the -- the

21   deference due a district court.            But Renico --

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               In -- and under

23   that -- I'm sorry.    Go ahead.

24                MR. SLOAN:     Renico did not present the

25   important threshold issue about what are the charges on

                                    Official

 1   which the jury is deadlocked.             And here there's an

 2   insufficient basis to conclude that the jury was

 3   deadlocked on the murder charges.             There was nothing

 4   like the foreperson's announcement at issue in Renico.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I don't want to --

 6   I'm sorry for taking up your time, but your friend says

 7   you did not object when the judge announced that he was

 8   going to declare a mistrial; is that correct?

 9               MR. SLOAN:       Your Honor, there's not an --

10   an objection at that time, but that is not a waiver for

11   a couple of reasons.      First, the Arkansas Supreme Court

12   reached the merits.      It's a Federal constitutional

13   issue.

14               Second, before that point, defense counsel

15   had been very explicit that it only wanted a mistrial on

16   the -- on the remaining counts and not on the other

17   ones.

18               And, third, this Court has emphasized that

19   the distinction in manifest necessity is when the

20   defendant affirmatively consents or moves for a

21   mistrial, as opposed to either if the judge does it

22   sua sponte, and the defendant doesn't have to object, or

23   the prosecutor moves for it.

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

 1                ORAL ARGUMENT OF DUSTIN MCDANIEL

 2                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 3                MR. MCDANIEL:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 4   please the Court:

 5                There are three key reasons why jeopardy has

 6   not terminated in this case.            First, the jury was free

 7   to revisit capital and first-degree murder when it

 8   resumed its deliberations.        Thus --

 9                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Where does it say that in

10   the jury charge?

11                MR. MCDANIEL:      I think that there's a

12   critical misunderstanding by Petitioner of Arkansas's

13   jury instructions, and there's a lot of use of -- of

14   titles, such as "acquittal first" or "hard transition"

15   or "soft transition."

16                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, as I understand what

17   the Arkansas instructions said, what the instructions in

18   this case said, is that the jury unanimously had to have

19   a reasonable doubt on an offense before it could go down

20   to the next offense.    So, that's to say that the jury

21   unanimously had to find what is -- what leads to an

22   acquittal.   So, the jury had to unanimously acquit on

23   the greater offense before it could go down to the next.

24                And the -- the instructions don't say

25   anything about moving back up.           And this jury seems to


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                          29
 1   take its responsibility under these instructions

 2   extraordinarily seriously.         This jury was instructing

 3   the judge on the instructions --

 4                 (Laughter.)

 5                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       -- and about how they had to

 6   go down step by step and reach unanimity on the one

 7   before they could get to the next lowest down.           So, I

 8   guess I'm asking why do you think, under these

 9   instructions, that the jury felt itself able to go back

10   up?

11                 MR. MCDANIEL:      Well, there are three primary

12   reasons.   One, in States that are acquittal-first

13   States, States that truly require a resolution of each

14   charge before the transition to subsequent charges, they

15   use words like "unanimous."         In fact, they all use the

16   word "unanimous" in their instruction.            Arkansas doesn't

17   do that.   We use a rather ambiguous, or unambiguous,

18   depending on how you look at it --

19                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       The chief prosecutor kept

20   saying:    You all have to agree on this.

21                 MR. MCDANIEL:      And he was accurate, and he

22   was echoed by the defense counsel in her closing

23   argument as well.    But there is no requirement of a

24   resolution.   The jury verdict forms reflect that

25   perfectly.

 1                In fact, Justice Breyer's example of a given

 2   State is exactly what Arkansas does, as compared to a --

 3   a true acquittal-first State, where there are multiple

 4   jury verdict forms, where you truly resolve one charge

 5   attaching final resolution and, in fact, attaching

 6   jeopardy or terminating jeopardy at that point.

 7                In this case, there is one verdict form.

 8   You can decide something --

 9                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          I'm sorry.   I'm so

10   totally confused by you ignoring Hughes.

11                MR. MCDANIEL:      I think --

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          The Arkansas charge

13   says:   If you have a reasonable doubt of the defendant's

14   guilt on the charge of capital murder, you will consider

15   the charge of murder in the first degree.

16                And I thought the Arkansas cases said no one

17   juror is going to think they can go to the next count.

18   They have to understand from this charge that it has to

19   be unanimous.   And that's what the prosecutor argued.

20   It's what the defense argued.           It's what your supreme

21   court has said has to happen.           I'm a little confused,

22   given your case law, your supreme court case law, that

23   says you can't move on to the next one unless it's

24   unanimous, how you can answer Justice Kagan's question

25   the way you have.   I mean, there's nothing in your case


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   law that --

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       You didn't finish your

 3   answer, did you?   I thought you were going on to some

 4   other points.

 5                 MR. MCDANIEL:      I did.      And, in fact, I think

 6   that Hughes is extraordinarily important.           And,

 7   respectfully, I believe that the Petitioner has

 8   mischaracterized Hughes.       There is a line of dicta in

 9   Hughes that is particularly useful in the Petitioner's

10   brief, but it is Justice Corbin of the Arkansas Supreme

11   Court who authored Hughes, who was rejecting a double

12   jeopardy claim in Hughes and, in fact, invoked this line

13   which says -- what has been quoted in the briefs.           It is

14   Justice Corbin who was presented with this exact same

15   argument to interpret the instructions in Blueford and

16   authored Blueford and rejected what allegedly was his

17   position on the instructions.            Hughes was not about the

18   instructions.   No part of Hughes was asked to interpret

19   what our instructions are.

20                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       I think if you -- if you

21   look at what the -- what the judge said, what the

22   prosecutor said, what the defense counsel said, and then

23   what the jury said, it's clear that they all thought

24   that they had to unanimously agree on something before

25   they could go to the next crime.            And, again, there's no


                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   suggestion in what anybody said that they could go back

 2   up.

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Is there any suggestion

 4   that they couldn't go back up?

 5               MR. MCDANIEL:       That is extraordinarily

 6   important, Justice Scalia.        There's not.

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Isn't it usually assumed

 8   that a jury is not finished until it's finished?

 9               MR. MCDANIEL:       The State would assert that

10   that is precisely the case here.           You have exactly the

11   type of jury verdict form that Justice Breyer suggested

12   in his example.   They have to decide on something.             You

13   have one charge, capital murder and its lesser -- lesser

14   and includeds.

15               This person, Mr. Blueford, does not deny

16   that he is guilty of a homicide offense.             That was

17   included in their closing argument.              Does not deny that

18   he's subject to retrial because there was manifest

19   necessity on at least two of the charges.             They simply

20   would like to say that there was not manifest necessity

21   for the greater of the two.

22               And the only way that that happens is

23   either -- to answer, I believe it was Justice Kennedy's

24   hypothetical earlier -- are you required to go in and

25   engage in partial verdicts even if a State does not


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   choose to do so, even if a State is, in fact, a general

 2   verdict State?

 3                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, even if, General --

 4                  MR. MCDANIEL:      Or --

 5                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Even if you're not

 6   required -- and maybe you are required -- but even if

 7   you're not, here the jury comes back.              The jury tells

 8   the judge we've unanimously reached acquittal on these

 9   two counts.    At that point, why doesn't the judge have

10   an obligation -- you know, the judge sends them back for

11   a half hour.     There's no reason to think that in that

12   half hour they moved back up the scale.              There's every

13   reason to think they just remained stuck where they

14   were.

15                  But even assuming that there is some

16   conceivable possibility that they went back up, why

17   doesn't the judge, working with the manifest necessity

18   standard, have an obligation to say, well, what about

19   it?   Did you?   Did you reach acquittal?            Did you reach a

20   judgment on these two counts?

21                  MR. MCDANIEL:      Well, there are a couple of

22   reasons.   One, I think it's fair to say that the State

23   recognizes it was improper for the judge to inquire in

24   the way that he did.      I think that it's fair to say that

25   he recognized that it was improper, as he didn't do it


                           Alderson Reporting Company

                                                                          34
 1   on their first announcement of deadlock and he didn't do

 2   it on their final announcement of deadlock.

 3                It's important to note that, although

 4   defense counsel at trial did ask for revised verdict

 5   forms, that was not her initial reaction.              Her initial

 6   reaction was to say, judge, I think that the jury needs

 7   to go back and keep deliberating, and I would ask that

 8   you give them another Allen charge.              That's not the

 9   reaction that anyone would have if they had just heard

10   an acquittal of their client.           This was, in fact, a

11   mid-deliberation report, probably wrongfully elicited by

12   the trial judge, but it was just that, a snapshot in

13   time with no intent by the jury to make an announcement.

14                So, when they returned, the real question, I

15   think, hinges -- as this Court analyzed in Smith v.

16   Massachusetts, is, is it possible for there to be

17   revision?   And it doesn't, in fact, Justice Kagan, have

18   to be the entirety of the jury completely pivoting in

19   their decisions.   All it would have to be is one.             And

20   we recognize that, even after they have announced

21   unanimously, signed a verdict form, offered their

22   assent, if they're polled in the box and one person

23   changes their vote, then that bears the effect of

24   changing the verdict.

25                So, is it possible?          Yes.

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Would this be different

 2   if they had -- if the judge had called them back in and

 3   said, are you deadlocked on the third count?             And -- my

 4   hypothetical to your adversary.           And they said:    Well,

 5   we have acquitted on capital murder.              We've acquitted on

 6   the second count.    We are still, Judge, deadlocked.

 7                If this had been announced at the very end,

 8   what would be your position today?

 9                MR. MCDANIEL:       Certainly, there would be --

10   it would be a tougher case if everything ended at that

11   moment because, at that point, counsel would have to ask

12   the trial court, if you're declaring a mistrial at this

13   moment on this report, what are you going to do?             Are

14   you going to accept this or are you not going to accept

15   it?   Will there be an opportunity for polling?

16                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Doesn't sound like the

17   judge was interested in any of the defense counsel's

18   positions on mistrial.      He announced that whether the

19   jury told him they were deadlocked or not, he was going

20   to call them back.

21                So, I don't know that the judge would have

22   done what you suggested.

23                MR. MCDANIEL:       It's --

24                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Because a judge -- the

25   defense attorney did ask for partial verdicts after

 1   their first announcement.

 2                MR. MCDANIEL:        And, Justice Sotomayor, they

 3   were -- they were rightly rejected.                Partial -- partial

 4   verdicts are not contemplated in Arkansas law.               It would

 5   have been error for him to engage in partial verdicts at

 6   that time.   And there's nothing in the Fifth Amendment

 7   that would require this Court to intrude upon the

 8   liberty of the States to determine whether they're

 9   general --

10                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So, if the State rule

11   says we don't take partial verdicts and the judge had

12   entered a verdict -- a judgment -- declared a mistrial

13   or entered a judgment saying hung jury as to all counts,

14   would jeopardy have attached?

15                MR. MCDANIEL:        If there's a hung jury as to

16   all counts, then --

17                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           No.      If the jury had

18   announced what it did, but following Arkansas law as you

19   read it, you don't take partial verdicts, it could only

20   be one hung jury.

21                MR. MCDANIEL:        Correct.

22                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Would jeopardy have

23   attached?

24                MR. MCDANIEL:        No.     If there's manifest

25   necessity for a mistrial, and in this case there's one

 1   charge, one homicide offense, and as this Court has long

 2   recognized, Brown v. Ohio being a key -- a key

 3   analysis --

 4                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So, really the only

 5   issue here is whether it's reasonable to conclude that a

 6   jury that had been told acquit first comes back and says

 7   we're only hung on this, and the jury says listen to

 8   each other on what your hung on, that that jury

 9   reasonably -- the judge could have ignored their stated

10   verdict and enter a trial -- a mistrial on everything

11   else.

12                  MR. MCDANIEL:      Respectfully, Justice

13   Sotomayor, they were not told acquit first.

14                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       You don't agree --

15                  MR. MCDANIEL:      That is a -- a subtle but key

16   distinction.

17                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       You don't agree -- I don't

18   think you agree that it was their stated verdict, do

19   you?

20                  MR. MCDANIEL:      I absolutely do not.     It was

21   not a verdict.    And bears none of the hallmarks.

22                  JUSTICE BREYER:       There is no room in Arkansas

23   law for saying you're acquitted as to one, acquitted as

24   to two.   But Arkansas law says you come in with a

25   verdict of guilty of something, a verdict of acquittal

 1   of everything, or the words "hung jury."            Is that right?

 2                MR. MCDANIEL:        Well, it's not up to the jury

 3   to determine whether they're hung.

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:         No.     They say to the judge,

 5   Judge, we are hung.      Judge says "hung jury."

 6                MR. MCDANIEL:        That is correct, Justice

 7   Breyer.   That is correct.

 8                JUSTICE KAGAN:         I guess, General McDaniel,

 9   one question about what Arkansas law does is -- it seems

10   a little bit as if it's trying to get the sweet of an

11   acquittal for a State without the bitter.            So, the sweet

12   is an acquittal-first system, where you force a jury to

13   reach agreement on one thing before it goes to the next

14   thing, makes compromised jury verdicts harder, and

15   that's why a State might say we want an acquittal-first

16   system.

17                The bitter that most States take with that

18   is that they say, well, if we're forcing them to agree

19   on these things and they agree on a verdict of not

20   guilty, we're stuck with that.

21                Now, what Arkansas seems to want is a system

22   in which it forces juries to agree on the -- the greater

23   charges before going to the less, but won't take the

24   consequence of that, which is that sometimes they agree

25   that on the greater charges, they're not guilty.

 1               MR. MCDANIEL:         No, Justice Kagan.          The --

 2   the majority of the States and circuits recognize there

 3   is a difference between a hard-transition instruction

 4   and an acquittal-first instruction.                They recognize the

 5   difference between a partial verdict and a general

 6   verdict on charges that include lesser and includeds.

 7   And what we require is one verdict on a charge:                guilty

 8   or not guilty.

 9               And they are at liberty to consider -- they

10   can be at the very end -- again, it's very important to

11   know -- it's wholly speculative in this case to know

12   where they were when they ultimately were hung.                And so,

13   we are -- we are operating in the world of bright-line

14   rules, which are very important for jeopardy.

15               We know when jeopardy attaches.                 When the

16   jury is in the box.      We know when jury -- or when

17   jeopardy terminates, and it's when there's some

18   conclusion with finality.         Every case that this Court

19   has analyzed, even Price and Green and Selvester, where

20   the jury remained silent, there was some finality that

21   led to termination of jeopardy.

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             General McDaniel, in this

23   case, they deliberated for 4-1/2 hours at the point

24   where the judge asked them where do you stand on this

25   count; where do you stand on that?                 And so, they were up


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                       40
 1   to the manslaughter, and they were stuck on that.        And

 2   the jury foreman said we can't go to negligent

 3   homicide because we haven't reached agreement on -- on

 4   the manslaughter charge.       Then they go back for just a

 5   half hour.

 6                 How realistic is it to think that they began

 7   over at that point, rather than trying to resolve the

 8   manslaughter charge so they could do exactly what the

 9   judge told them, and then get to the negligent homicide

10   charge?

11                 MR. MCDANIEL:      The State wouldn't venture to

12   speculate as to what they did, although I would

13   respectfully say that that is probably what happened.

14   They went back and they tried to follow the instructions

15   of the court.   That's certainly viewing things in a

16   light most favorable to the Petitioner, and there's no

17   evidence --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       General McDaniel, how --

19   how probable is it that when the jury is polled, and

20   having voted unanimously when they were back in the jury

21   room, one of the members of the jury changes his mind

22   and votes the other way?       That's not at all probable, is

23   it?   But it happens sometimes, doesn't it?

24                 MR. MCDANIEL:      It does.

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       And when it happens, what's

 1   the result?

 2                 MR. MCDANIEL:      It -- it bears all of the

 3   difference in the finality of the verdict.               And, again,

 4   as this Court noted in Smith, it's the availability;

 5   it's the incorporation within a State's procedure for

 6   that finality to be undone.         My Lord, how likely is it

 7   truly for a trial court to completely reverse his or her

 8   granting of a motion of dismissal?                But this Court said,

 9   if there's a procedure in place for it to be revisited,

10   then jeopardy doesn't terminate until the point at which

11   there's no return.

12                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Is this a fair explanation

13   of Arkansas law, which doesn't seem to me to be

14   perfectly clear?   What the jury is supposed to do is to

15   vote on the greatest offense first and reach a

16   reasonably firm vote.      And if they reach a reasonably

17   firm vote that is unanimous not guilty, then they can

18   move on to the next -- to the lower offenses, but that

19   reasonably firm vote is not an absolutely final vote,

20   and there is still the possibility for the jury to go

21   back.

22                 MR. MCDANIEL:      Yes, Justice --

23                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Is that a correct

24   understanding?

25                 MR. MCDANIEL:      Yes, Justice Alito, that's


                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   precisely correct.    And, just as Justice Scalia noted

 2   earlier, we recognize that there are compromises that

 3   are incorporated into transitions.                One may be willing

 4   to say:    I'm willing to move on from first-degree

 5   murder.    I'm the only one here that believes that we

 6   should find guilty of first-degree murder, but that's

 7   not going to happen.     I'm not going to change your

 8   votes.    But I'm willing to move on and go to

 9   manslaughter.

10                 JUSTICE ALITO:       For double --

11                 MR. MCDANIEL:      But would that vote equate to

12   an acquittal if asked in -- with finality?

13                 JUSTICE ALITO:       For double jeopardy

14   purposes, is the question what Arkansas law actually

15   says, or what the jury understood Arkansas law to be?

16                 MR. MCDANIEL:      I think what Arkansas law

17   actually says is how we should be judged, but at the

18   same time, the evidence here was that the jury came in

19   to answer questions about the status of their

20   deliberation.    I think that Justice Kagan properly noted

21   that they were in fact giving the judge some

22   instructions on how the instructions should work.

23                 And they were answering that question, and

24   the foreperson -- one person was asked, well, where are

25   you?   And she announces -- and we have no reason to


                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   believe that she was not being truthful.               At the same

 2   time, we have no way to verify it.               And the defense

 3   counsel said, Judge, I think they ought to be given

 4   another Allen charge, and they need to go keep

 5   deliberating.

 6                And at that point, if they had returned, no

 7   matter how unlikely -- if they'd come back in 10 minutes

 8   later and said we find unanimously guilty of capital

 9   murder, no matter how unlikely, if that was possible,

10   then jeopardy could not have terminated upon that

11   report.   It could not have been an acquittal because

12   they couldn't have continued deliberating on those

13   charges for another instant.

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         General, how do you deal

15   with our cases, Ball and Martin Linen and the whole line

16   that says State -- the form of State law judgments

17   doesn't control?

18                MR. MCDANIEL:      I think that Ball is

19   particularly helpful to us, and I think that the Hudson

20   case cited by Petitioner is also important.

21                If -- if a State puts a procedural bar to

22   considering a final judgment of acquittal, then that

23   procedural bar is trumped by the Fifth Amendment of the

24   Constitution.   Mr. Ball was --

25                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         I'm not sure what that

 1   means.

 2                 MR. MCDANIEL:      Well --

 3                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         And that's the problem

 4   with all of this area, which is States vary on how they

 5   enter judgments after the jury speaks its verdict.                  So,

 6   where do we draw the line as to when a State law

 7   trumps -- when a Federal law, the Double Jeopardy

 8   Clause, trumps a State system?

 9                 MR. MCDANIEL:      Justice Sotomayor, I think

10   that your answer is contained within the question.                  A

11   verdict is the true answer.         If there is a verdict, then

12   the -- the force and impact of that verdict is what

13   matters.    Did this jury announce a verdict?              If so,

14   jeopardy attached.    But this was not a verdict.                It bore

15   none of the hallmarks of a verdict.                It wasn't

16   published.   It wasn't verified.          It wasn't accepted by

17   the court.   It wasn't even accepted by the defendant's

18   attorney.    It wasn't a verdict.

19                 In Ball, there was a clear verdict.                The

20   jury announced acquittal.        The judge entered acquittal.

21   And later, the indictment was dismissed as being faulty.

22   And under the law of England up until that time, even in

23   the United States, a faulty indictment dismisses

24   everything, and you start de novo.                So, even the

25   acquittal gets thrown out because you can't acquit of

 1   something that was void ab initio.

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Mr. Sloan told us that it

 3   was the State that prevented the elucidation because

 4   defense counsel said:     Judge, we can try to do what

 5   Double Jeopardy Clause says, not try a person twice for

 6   the same offense.   So, Judge, please ask the jury to

 7   rule on those two -- give them a sheet that gives them a

 8   choice of guilty or not guilty.

 9                But they went -- that originally was just a

10   series of guilty on the four counts, and then their

11   other choice was acquittal.

12                Now, defense counsel says, ask them, is it

13   guilty or not guilty, instead of asking just is it

14   guilty.   And the judge declines to do that.           Isn't that

15   why we don't have definitive answers?            Because defense

16   counsel says -- said, Judge, give the jury the chance to

17   tell us whether they --

18                MR. MCDANIEL:      Some States do, in fact, give

19   the opportunity to inquire into the jury's

20   deliberations.   Partial verdict forms and inquiries are

21   permitted, but they're not required.             And in Arkansas,

22   the State properly objected to changing the agreed-upon

23   verdict forms, as the judge said, midstream.            They had

24   been agreed to; they had been submitted; and they

25   properly reflected the law in Arkansas.            So that to

                                                                           46
 1   change them would have either been by agreement or

 2   because they were constitutionally required.             And that's

 3   ultimately the case -- the question in front of this

 4   Court:   Are they -- are they constitutionally required?

 5                 And that leads into the manifest necessity

 6   analysis because anytime there is a charge with lesser

 7   and included offenses and a general verdict State, and

 8   the jury simply announces we cannot reach a

 9   determination, is -- is the constitutional trigger truly

10   resting on the fortuity of the announcement of a

11   snapshot vote in open court, or is a constitutional

12   trigger how they voted back in the jury room?             And if

13   that is the constitutional trigger, then wouldn't

14   verdicts -- partial verdicts be required?

15                 In fact, this Court does not require partial

16   verdicts.    A -- an announcement of unable to render a

17   verdict warrants a mistrial.             This Court has said

18   clearly in Renico that we defer to a -- a trial court's

19   decision that manifest necessity exists.             In fact, this

20   Court has never overturned a trial court's decision that

21   manifest necessity existed for the -- on a hung jury.

22                 Here a jury was hung.           They simply could not

23   render a decision on the verdict forms they were

24   submitted:    guilty or not guilty of a homicide?           They

25   couldn't answer the question.             And, therefore, jeopardy

                                                                             47
 1   should continue, and the retrial should be permitted.

 2                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       General, you mentioned Green

 3   and Price before, and those are the cases, of course,

 4   where there is a conviction on a lesser charge.                We

 5   don't know anything about the greater charge.                And then

 6   the conviction is overturned.

 7                 And what the Court says there is, well, we

 8   don't know anything, but we're going to make a

 9   reasonable assumption, and the reasonable -- no, I think

10   it said a "legitimate" assumption.                The legitimate

11   assumption that they acquitted on the greater charges

12   before they went down to the lesser charge.

13                 Now, it seems to me as though there are a

14   hundred reasons why that might not be true.                The jury

15   could have just gone to the lesser charge immediately as

16   a compromise position without voting on the greater

17   charge, but the Court said we'll make a legitimate

18   assumption.

19                 So, why isn't the same true here?              We're

20   making a legitimate assumption, I think honestly, on the

21   basis of much more than Green and Price had to work

22   with, if you will, that the jury, in fact, acquitted of

23   those greater offenses.

24                 MR. MCDANIEL:      Well, in Green and Price

25   there were verdicts, and --


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                          48
 1                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       There was a verdict --

 2                 MR. MCDANIEL:      -- in this case there's no

 3   verdict.

 4                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       -- that eventually got

 5   overturned.   There was no verdict on the greater

 6   offenses.

 7                 MR. MCDANIEL:      You have to look at Green and

 8   Price in conjunction with this Court's holding in Brown

 9   and the analysis of lesser included offenses within a

10   general offense.    They are one for jeopardy purposes.

11                 In this case, Mr. Blueford was facing one

12   charge for jeopardy purposes.            The information, the

13   indictment, only included one charge.             So, he could not

14   have been convicted of both manslaughter and murder in

15   the first degree.    This Court's very clear about that.

16                 So, in Green and in Price, where there was a

17   conviction on a lesser charge and silence -- in other

18   words, they didn't expressly say not guilty of this

19   higher charge and not guilty of this higher charge, and

20   guilty of this lesser charge -- it stands only to

21   reason, and certainly to constitutional scrutiny, you

22   can only be convicted of one of them.             And if a jury

23   finds -- and, again, it still requires publication,

24   verification, and acceptance by a court of an actual

25   verdict of one of those charges -- it only stands to

                                                                          49
 1   reason and logic that the upper charges were dismissed.

 2   That's -- that is entirely different, respectfully --

 3                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well --

 4                JUSTICE ALITO:       In Green --

 5                MR. MCDANIEL:      -- from this case.

 6                JUSTICE ALITO:       In Green and Price, the

 7   defendants were tried once on the greater offense, and

 8   jeopardy terminated without a finding of manifest

 9   necessity regarding the termination of jeopardy.            To me

10   that is the sound basis for those decisions.            But I have

11   to agree with what Justice Kagan said.            The -- Justice

12   Black's reasoning in Green, that the jury impliedly

13   acquitted the defendant of the greater offense by

14   convicting the defendant of the -- of the lesser offense

15   doesn't really make any sense because they could have

16   simply been in disagreement about the greater offense.

17                MR. MCDANIEL:      Well, and I think that's

18   correct, and I think that there has to be some question

19   here as to, is it an implied acquittal or was it an

20   express verdict?   I think the Petitioner can't really

21   decide, or at least hasn't articulated, where the

22   jeopardy terminating event occurred.             Was it when they

23   made their announcement?      In which case, why did they go

24   and subsequently deliberate even on the request of

25   counsel?   Was it at the conclusion when there was the

                                                                             50
 1   possibility that nothing really had changed after the

 2   report and a declaration of manifest necessity?             Which

 3   did not come, by the way, at the request of the State.

 4   It was sui sponte by the court.

 5                And then there was, in fact, a waiver, and I

 6   think a legitimate waiver, of an objection by defense

 7   counsel.   There was -- at no time at that point before

 8   releasing this jury did defense counsel renew a motion

 9   to submit partial verdict forms, to inquire into the

10   jury, to poll where they were.

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well -- she had asked;

12   so, why was it necessary for her to repeat it?             And she

13   said, Judge, please let them vote yes or no on the --

14   the two most serious charges.             And the judge said no.

15   She might have figured if she was going to repeat that,

16   she would just annoy the judge.             She had made the -- she

17   had made the request.

18                MR. MCDANIEL:        The primary difference would

19   be, in fact, the possibility that polling may be

20   different after another half hour of deliberations.               All

21   it takes is one juror to change their mind.             And, in

22   fact, it may have benefitted the defendant.             What if they

23   had already decided they'd changed their mind again and

24   acquitted on -- on manslaughter and had moved down to

25   negligent homicide?      And that's what they were talking

 1   about.

 2                Where they were at the end of the final 30

 3   minutes of deliberation is purely speculative.            And

 4   because it's purely speculative, regardless of whether

 5   it could benefit the State or the defendant, it means

 6   that no report was a verdict.           No report could have been

 7   a verdict.

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          General, other than

 9   trenching on State rules that don't create the

10   constitutional protection, what's wrong with a simple

11   rule that says, once a jury announces that it is

12   unanimous on acquittal of a count, you can't go back

13   unless the jury says that it's not unanimous in some

14   way?   What's wrong with that rule?

15                MR. MCDANIEL:      It would be difficult to

16   apply in practicality, and it certainly would be --

17                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Why?    The jury comes out

18   and says we're unanimous.       There's a poll.       One juror

19   says I'm really not unanimous.          They go back.    But once

20   a jury says it's unanimous, a judge can't declare a

21   mistrial, can't do something until it ensures itself

22   that -- that jeopardy hasn't attached.

23                MR. MCDANIEL:      The primary reason why the

24   majority of jurisdictions have rejected that analysis,

25   whether it's announced or not, is the coercive effect on


                         Alderson Reporting Company

                                                                         52
 1   -- on a jury.

 2                  If you have a tired, frustrated, potentially

 3   angry jury, and they're told we're either going to let

 4   you go or you're -- we're not going to let you go home

 5   until you decide something; you have to tell

 6   us something.

 7                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         No, I'm not -- I'm not

 8   asking -- I'm not announcing or setting a rule that says

 9   you have to ask them, you have to force them to give a

10   verdict.   I'm not -- I'm saying what's wrong with the

11   constitutional rule that simply says, once the jury says

12   we're unanimous, there can't be manifest injustice --

13   there can't be manifest necessity until you're sure that

14   they can't reach a verdict -- that that verdict is not

15   their verdict?

16                  MR. MCDANIEL:      So, we're not asking, but if

17   -- just so I understand your hypothetical -- we're not

18   asking them, but if for fortuitously they happen to

19   announce --

20                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         That's what --

21                  MR. MCDANIEL:      -- spontaneously or

22   otherwise --

23                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         That's what three State

24   courts have said.    Three State courts have said, if

25   there's any meaning to jeopardy, it is that once a jury

 1   out loud says to a defendant you're not guilty, the

 2   defendant is entitled to rely on that.               So, what's wrong

 3   with that simple rule?

 4                MR. MCDANIEL:       First, this Court hasn't --

 5   that court -- that rule -- could be allowed to work,

 6   and, in fact, it does work in some States.               I don't see

 7   how it could benefit Mr. Blueford; and so, I don't see

 8   how it follows into his relief because it didn't in fact

 9   happen.   And so, it takes us -- it might be beneficial

10   to future defendants if they ever find themselves in

11   such a circumstance, but it doesn't apply retroactively.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, General.

13                Mr. Sloan, you have 3 minutes remaining.

14             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CLIFFORD M. SLOAN

15                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16                MR. SLOAN:     Thank you, Your Honor.

17                The core of the State's position is that the

18   foreperson's explicit announcement that the jury had

19   unanimously voted against guilt is of no constitutional

20   moment whatsoever.

21                Now, there is no opinion of this Court that

22   has ever said that a jury statement like that is

23   entitled to no weight whatsoever.            And if this Court

24   were to say that in an opinion, it would open the door

25   to many of the core double jeopardy evils that this


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official

                                                                         54
 1   Court has repeatedly focused on.          For example, acquittal

 2   avoidance, emphasized in the Arizona v. Washington.          A

 3   court doesn't want to accept the acquittal consequences;

 4   so, it just says we're not going to accept that.

 5               And something that's a very real and

 6   practical danger here, which this Court has emphasized

 7   over and over again in opinions, is giving the State the

 8   opportunity to refine and hone its case based on what it

 9   learned at the first trial about what went badly.

10               And that is exactly what happened here.          So,

11   it was vigorously contested.           The State's capital murder

12   and murder -- first-degree murder case fell apart.

13   Their lead expert on it was destroyed.          The jury heard

14   both sides, voted unanimously not guilty.          And as this

15   Court said in Ashe v. Swenson, a core evil of the Double

16   Jeopardy Clause is that we don't let the prosecutor have

17   a dry run at a first trial, and then get to go before a

18   second trial with a new jury and plug the holes in it.

19   And the State's position here, that this is of no moment

20   at all, would raise that danger very prominently.

21               In conclusion, Your Honor, the jury in this

22   case heard the evidence on both sides, unanimously voted

23   against guilt on the murder charges, announced that in

24   open court, and never said a word that contradicted it.
