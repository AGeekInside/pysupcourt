 8                   ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 9            MR. KESTER:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11            As of this morning, it is exactly 70 years ago

12   to the day, minus 4 months, that this Court heard argument

13   challenging the new Federal Declaratory Judgment Act of

14   1934, in an action to construe an insurance contract.

15            And exactly 25 years -- 25 days later, in a

16   unanimous opinion written by Chief Justice Hughes, joined

17   by Justices Stone, Brandeis, and others, the Act was held

18   fully consistent with Article III of the Constitution.

19            This morning, you are here because an action was

20   brought for a declaratory judgment that a biomedical

21   manufacturer need not play -- pay large sums, under a

22   license as patent royalties, under a patent it contends is

23   invalid, unenforceable, and not infringed, but is paying

24   royalties under protest in the meantime.                 That complaint

25   was ordered dismissed by the Federal Circuit as outside

 1   the Article III judicial power of the United States.

 2            In detail, the Petitioner, MedImmune, is a

 3   biotech company, formed in 1988.              During the 1990s --

 4            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Mr. Kester, would it --

 5            MR. KESTER:      Yes?

 6            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               -- would it -- would

 7   your position be different if the contract contained a

 8   specific -- the license -- a specific provision specifying

 9   that the licensee may not sue?

10            MR. KESTER:      No, it would not, Your Honor,

11   because --

12            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               You -- do you think such

13   a provision would be enforceable?

14            MR. KESTER:      I doubt it would be enforceable.

15   It would be a matter -- under the Lear case, Lear against

16   Adkins, it would be an -- it would be an affirmative

17   defense if such -- if such a claim were raised.              This case

18   is here at the level of subject-matter jurisdiction.

19            JUSTICE SCALIA:          Excuse me, I don't -- I don't

20   understand what you just said.             You mean, it would be

21   enforceable; that if such a suit were brought, the

22   licensor could raise that contractual provision as a basis

23   for dismissing the suit.        Is that --

24            MR. KESTER:      Under 12- -- under 12(b)(6) --

25            JUSTICE SCALIA:          Okay.

 1             MR. KESTER:         -- perhaps.

 2             JUSTICE SCALIA:             So, then it is enforceable.

 3             JUSTICE SOUTER:             No, but --

 4             MR. KESTER:         No.

 5             JUSTICE SOUTER:             -- your point is, it's not

 6   jurisdictional.

 7             MR. KESTER:         It's not jurisdictional, exactly,

 8   Justice Souter.      This is a jurisdictional ruling.                   And

 9   that's all that this Court granted certiorari on.

10             JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, but as a matter of

11   policy, we, at some point, either in this case or some

12   later case, may have to address the question of whether or

13   not such a provision is enforceable.                       If it is, we may be

14   -- not be talking about much.                It's just going to be

15   boilerplate in every license agreement, and that's the end

16   of it.   And it --

17             MR. KESTER:         And so --

18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:             -- but it -- on the other

19   hand, it may be that there are reasons not to enforce

20   this, so that we don't have courts flooded with lawsuits,

21   et cetera, et cetera.

22             MR. KESTER:         And those reasons, I would suggest,

23   Justice Kennedy, were taken care of in Lear, for the most

24   part, in 1969.    Provisions in license contracts that

25   prevent challenges to the contracts are not enforceable

 1   under the patent laws of the United States.                      But then, I

 2   -- as I was saying, that is a matter of patent law.

 3   That's not a matter of jurisdictional law.                      We're here --

 4            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, let's look at what

 5   might be a matter of jurisdictional law.                      I take it, from

 6   your position, there's nothing preventing Genentech from

 7   suing, either, is there?           In other words, to establish the

 8   validity of their patent.

 9            MR. KESTER:         It has -- it has happened, on

10   various occasions, that patentees have brought suit to

11   establish the validity of --

12            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Against licensees?

13            MR. KESTER:         Against licensees and others.                   And

14   the --

15            JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Against licensees who are not

16   claiming that the patent is invalid?                      And where is the

17   controversy?

18            MR. KESTER:         The controversy could arise in any

19   number of ways.

20            JUSTICE GINSBURG:                I mean, I can see, if the --

21   if licensee says the patent is invalid, that the patentee

22   says paying its royalties -- how does it --

23            MR. KESTER:         The patentee could be paying his

24   royalties.     The patentee could also be putting ads in the

25   paper saying, "This is not a valid patent."                      It could --


                                          6

 1   it could have acquired a lot of publicity.                And, in the

 2   end, there could be reasons, and there have been such

 3   cases -- which we cited, 47 of, our brief -- where such

 4   suits have been brought.          But --

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            If it -- if the -- if the --

 6   if the licensee came into court and said, "I'm not

 7   contesting this patent," that would be the end of it,

 8   wouldn't it?

 9               MR. KESTER:     If the licensee said, "I am not

10   contesting that patent," that could be.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Oh, but the patentee

12   would just say, "Look, we have a license.                I think the

13   patent's valid, and you owe me a dollar a unit."                The

14   licensee said, "Well, I don't think they're -- it's valid,

15   so I owe you nothing."        And they settle on a license for

16   50 cents.    Why can't the patentee say, "You know, if I get

17   a judicial decision establishing that the patent is valid,

18   I can charge a higher license, either when this agreement

19   expires or for other licenses"?

20               MR. KESTER:     That -- I agree with that, Mr.

21   Chief Justice.    But the practicality is that a patentee

22   starts out with, essentially, a judgment that the patent

23   is valid.    There is a presumption of validity.              And to

24   challenge that patent -- that presumption of validity, is

25   a very difficult undertaking.              Most of them don't bother.

 1   Why would they?   If they are receiving -- if they're

 2   receiving --

 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I'm trying to see how

 4   far you want -- are willing to push your argument that

 5   just because there's been an agreement, or perhaps even a

 6   settlement, that that somehow or another doesn't moot the

 7   controversy, the underlying legal dispute.               And it -- I

 8   gather your answer to me is that Genentech, or a patentee,

 9   can sue, even though they have an existing -- they're

10   getting royalties from the licensee, they can still sue

11   the licensee.

12              MR. KESTER:     A settlement does not deprive a

13   Federal Court of subject-matter jurisdiction.              That's the

14   narrow point that is before this -- before this Court.

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Why aren't you -- you said,

16   "The only question before the court is jurisdictional."

17   If that's so, why isn't your position that the Federal

18   Circuit put the wrong label on this, that license is

19   listed in 8(c) as an affirmative defense; so, whatever the

20   outcome should be, the wrong label should -- is -- was

21   used.   It shouldn't be a subject-matter jurisdiction,

22   shouldn't be 12(b)(1); it should be an 8(c) affirmative

23   defense.   And then the -- you're out of the jurisdiction

24   box, but you're left with the same underlying question.

25              MR. KESTER:     But not the same underlying

 1   question, Justice Ginsburg, with respect, because then you

 2   are in a situation like the business forms case in the

 3   Seventh Circuit, which came out shortly after the Lear.

 4   There was a settle -- settlement, and the -- and it was

 5   argued that the settlement was not effective because of

 6   the Lear decision, and parties can't settle themselves out

 7   of the Lear decision.      But that is all under 12(b)(6), and

 8   not 12(b)(1).   This case involves a 12(b)(1) motion, not a

 9   12(b)(6) --

10            JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But what --

11            MR. KESTER:       -- motion.

12            JUSTICE GINSBURG:              -- good would it do?   Suppose

13   we said, "Federal Circuit, you put the wrong label on it.

14   It should be 12(b)(6), not 12(b)(1), or perhaps even 8(c),

15   affirmative defense"?      Then you go back to the Federal

16   Circuit, and they'll come up with the same decision, that,

17   as long as you are licensed and are paying your royalties,

18   you have -- and they just put a different label on it --

19   you have --

20            MR. KESTER:       They --

21            JUSTICE GINSBURG:              -- you have no -- you have

22   not stated a claim.

23            MR. KESTER:       That would be effectively

24   overruling Lear, which is what, I think, is what many of

25   the parties in this case actually seek to do.

 1             Lear does not allow inhibitions of challenges to

 2   patent licenses.   A licensee can challenge the validity,

 3   the enforceability of the patent.                That's because there's

 4   a public interest in this, as well.                     Parties cannot simply

 5   contract with each other and prevent a challenge to a --

 6   to a patent --

 7             JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But then --

 8             MR. KESTER:      -- license.

 9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- the Federal Circuit

10   distinguished Lear, and said what -- in Lear, the licensee

11   had stopped paying royalties.             Isn't that so?

12             MR. KESTER:      That -- those were the facts of

13   Lear.   But -- it happened that way in Lear, but that

14   wasn't the reasoning of Lear.             Lear would not totally

15   cover that situation, but we would submit to this Court,

16   it shouldn't make any difference.                The reasoning of Lear

17   is the same.   The licensee cannot, by contract, be

18   estopped, licensee estoppel, from challenging a patent.

19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So, there's no way, I --

20   under your view, that a patent holder can protect itself

21   from suit through any license arrangement or any agreement

22   of any kind.

23             MR. KESTER:      I suspect there are many ways, Mr.

24   Chief Justice, but not by throwing them out on a

25   jurisdictional basis at the very first moment of the

 1   lawsuit.

 2              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              How about --

 3              MR. KESTER:       There may be ways this could be

 4   arranged at the second level, through --

 5              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Well, what are those ways --

 6   I mean, the ones that have been mentioned as possibilities

 7   in the Government brief -- one, you rejected, and the

 8   other that was mentioned was: if you sue -- if the

 9   licensee sues, then the royalty fees will be upped.                   Would

10   that be effective?

11              MR. KESTER:       That is a question that would arise

12   under Lear against Adkins.            And the question before this

13   Court in that situation, if it got to this Court, would

14   be, Is that kind of a provision compatible with the policy

15   that was so firmly expressed by Justice Harlan in Lear,

16   and has been reiterated in so many subsequent cases of

17   this Court?

18              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              So, you have rejected both of

19   the Government's suggestions on what the patent holder

20   might do to protect itself.               Do you have anything concrete

21   that you would concede the patent holder could do?

22              MR. KESTER:       I don't think that I have rejected

23   both the Government's suggestions.                   I've said that they

24   raise problems on -- as to the scope of Lear.

 1   are talking about a jurisdictional defense or whether we

 2   are talking about an affirmative defense, assuming

 3   jurisdiction, is there any -- is there any reason for us

 4   to accept your position, other than the reason that you

 5   have mentioned a number of times, and that is the adoption

 6   and encouragement of a public policy that allows patent

 7   challenges freely?      Is that the nub of our reasoning, if

 8   we were to support your position, either jurisdictionally,

 9   in this case, or in recognizing -- or the -- in dealing

10   with the affirmative defense in another case?

11            MR. KESTER:         Not quite, Justice Souter.         I would

12   say the nub of your position is the Altvater case, the

13   Aetna case, the Maryland --

14            JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, Altvater is difficult for

15   you, isn't it?    Because there was an injunction in

16   Altvater, wasn't there?

17            MR. KESTER:         That -- but that -- but was --

18            JUSTICE SOUTER:             Which raises an entirely

19   different policy issue?

20            MR. KESTER:         Well, I would say what it -- what

21   it raises is simply an extra fact, but it wasn't a

22   necessary fact.    Because this Court, in Altvater,

23   specifically pointed out that even if there weren't an

24   injunction there, there would be -- there would be the

25   danger forced on the licensee, of an infringement suit;

 1   and an infringement suit means, possibly, an injunction of

 2   the patent, treble damages, any number of sanctions.                      An

 3   injunction suit can put a company out of business,

 4   especially like a company like my client here.                   And --

 5             JUSTICE SOUTER:            But that is -- that is a good

 6   reason.   And, I take it, it's your logic that that is a

 7   good reason to recognize a fairly broad right on the part

 8   of the licensee to challenge.

 9             MR. KESTER:        Right.

10             JUSTICE SOUTER:            In other words, the nub of your

11   position, as I understand it, is the public policy that

12   favors relative --

13             MR. KESTER:        It --

14             JUSTICE SOUTER:            -- freedom to challenge --

15             MR. KESTER:        It's more -- it's more than public

16   policy, it's Article III.            Article III says that you can

17   bring a lawsuit in this situation.                   And that was settled --

18             JUSTICE SOUTER:            No --

19             MR. KESTER:        -- in Aetna.

20             JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, I realize that.         But, I

21   mean, what we've got in this case, and in any of these

22   cases, is a question of line-drawing under Article III.

23   And your argument is, you want to draw the line where you

24   want it drawn primarily because there are practical

25   reasons to favor a public policy of free challenge.

 1             MR. KESTER:        What we are presenting in this case

 2   is a dispute about money.            It's not abstract.            It's not

 3   hypothetical.     It's not conjectural.                   It is concrete,

 4   immediate.     All the facts are in.               It's definitely

 5   adversarial.    It's legal.

 6             JUSTICE SCALIA:            You -- well, you can have such

 7   a dispute on a theoretical question between, I don't know,

 8   the ACLU and the National Rifle Association, but that

 9   doesn't create a case or controversy.                      What is the injury,

10   the imminent injury to your -- to your client that is the

11   basis for the case or controversy?

12             MR. KESTER:        The --

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is it anything other than, "I

14   have to pay the royalties that I agreed to pay."?

15             MR. KESTER:        It is the -- it is that, "I am

16   having to pay the royalties -- that I say I did not agree

17   to pay, because this is an invalid patent."                     Money is

18   being paid by my client every quarter, large amounts of

19   money.   That is a major injury.

20             JCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, if you don't --

21             MR. KESTER:        And if --

22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 -- think --

 1   agree to pay somebody money who does not have a patent?

 2              MR. KESTER:       It is --

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:           I mean, you're speaking as

 4   though somehow that -- such a contract is contrary to

 5   public policy, and void.

 6              MR. KESTER:       No, we're saying that that isn't

 7   what we agreed to.      We're saying this is a contract

 8   dispute.   And the whole purpose of the --

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, then why are you

10   paying it, if you -- if you don't think you owe it?

11              MR. KESTER:       Because the --

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Because of the threat of

13   treble damages --

14              MR. KESTER:       The threat --

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- and injunction.

16              MR. KESTER:       -- of this --

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                If we're trying to

18   figure out where the public policy is here, why don't we

19   give some weight to those congressional enactments that

20   obviously fortify the strength of the patent?                      In other

21   words, Congress passed these provisions providing for

22   treble damages for attorneys' fees.                       And --

23              MR. KESTER:       But --

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- and to respond that

25   there's got to be a public policy to counterbalance that,

 1   Congress can always do that, if it wants; but it didn't --

 2   it thinks that you need these provisions to protect the

 3   patent holders.

 4               MR. KESTER:      But, Mr. Chief Justice,

 5   Congress can also amend the Declaratory Judgment Act, if

 6   it wants.    And Congress was proud of the Declaratory

 7   Judgment Act when it was passed in 1934.                  And the

 8   legislative history of it -- and nothing in the text is

 9   contrary, says the purpose of this is so that contracts

10   can be resolved without breach, and judicial

11   determinations can be had.            It's like a noninvasive, a

12   less invasive kind of surgery.

13               JUSTICE STEVENS:          Mr. Kester, may I ask you this

14   question?    Is it your view that Gen-Probe represented a

15   change in the law?

16               MR. KESTER:      Absolutely.

17               JUSTICE STEVENS:          Were there -- before Gen-Probe

18   was decided, were there any cases, like this case, that

19   were decided?

20               MR. KESTER:      There were many, Your Honor, and

21   they were decided --

22               JUSTICE STEVENS:          Where the -- where the

23   licensee brought suit challenging validity while the

24   license was still in full --

 1            JUSTICE STEVENS:            -- force?

 2            MR. KESTER:        We had suits in the Third Circuit,

 3   the Seventh Circuit, the Second Circuit, and even in the

 4   Federal Circuit, in its early days, where it quoted those

 5   cases which said, "It is not necessary for the licensee to

 6   stop paying payments in order for Article III to be

 7   satisfied."

 8            This case came as a shock in 2004.                     And, in

 9   fact, the judges below, in this series of cases, all said,

10   "We thought it was settled law the other way."                    All this

11   case represents, from our point of view, is, "Let's go

12   back to the way it has always been."

13            I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

14            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, Mr. Kester.

16             ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD

17                    ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

18            MS. MAYNARD:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19   please the Court:

20            There is a concrete dispute between the parties

21   about their legal rights and obligations.                    If that dispute

22   is resolved, money will change hands.                    That is an Article

23   III case or controversy.

24            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 How do you ever end

25   these things?   Let's say they have this dispute, they

 1   bring the litigation, and they settle it.                 They're saying,

 2   "Okay, we're going to settle it.                 Instead of paying a

 3   license fee of 50 cents, it's going to be 40 cents, and

 4   we'll go on."     Then they can sue again, I take it.

 5              MS. MAYNARD::         In that situation.            Recognizing

 6   that's not the situation we have here --

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Can they settle that, by

 8   the way?     Is it all right to settle it, or is -- that

 9   interfere with the policy that patents have to be open to

10   challenge?

11              MS. MAYNARD:        May I -- if I can answer the first

12   question first.

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Either one.

14              MS. MAYNARD:        If there were to be a settlement,

15   in the second case, the -- it would not be an Article III

16   case or controversy problem with the second case.                   And

17   that suit should not be dismissed under 12(b)(1).

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Okay.

19              MS. MAYNARD:        The -- in that case, the patent

20   holder might have a valid 12(b)(6) defense, and the suit,

21   laying aside enforceability issues that you raised, may be

22   easily resolved, on that ground.                 But, in terms of the

23   question before the Court today, that wouldn't be an

24   Article III matter.

25              I think, as a policy matter -- so, moving off


                                         18

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the question before the Court right now -- as a policy

 2   matter, the -- it's not clear from this Court's cases

 3   exactly what types of agreements would be enforceable.                   I

 4   think there's a spectrum of cases one can imagine, ranging

 5   from Pope -- the type of promise that was extracted in

 6   Pope, which this Court held was unenforceable --

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, I think you

 8   overread Pope.    All Pope said was that they're not going

 9   to grant specific performance.               In fact, they've said,

10   "Whatever you may think of the policy here, we don't --

11   specific performance calls on the equitable discretion,

12   and we're not going to do it."               But, I don't read Pope as

13   holding that the clauses are otherwise unenforceable.                   In

14   --

15               MS. MAYNARD:      Well --

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              -- other words you're

17   maybe entitled to damages.           And that may be measured by

18   the license fee that you agreed to pay.

19               MS. MAYNARD:      Well, there certainly would be a

20   question, though, the way that Lear read Pope, and under

21   Lear, about whether a bare agreement not to challenge

22   licenses, especially ones like in Pope, where they agreed

23   not to challenge the license, even beyond the term, would

24   be enforceable.    And the Government thinks there's a

25   spectrum.    One -- at one end of the spectrum would be


                                        19

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   licenses like those in Pope, and at the other end of the

 2   spectrum would be a consent decree entered after

 3   settlement of a bona fide patent infringement suit where

 4   the -- which included an agreement not to settle.                   Now,

 5   that's clearly not what we have here.

 6             JUSTICE BREYER:          Now, is -- if -- I guess there

 7   are three possible positions on the question of whether a

 8   licensee can attack a contract, a patent where he has a

 9   license and wants to keep the contract.                   One, he can never

10   do it.   Two, he can always do it.               Three, it depends on

11   what the contract says.        Now, do any of those questions

12   have anything to do with the question before us, which is

13   whether it is a case or controversy?

14             MS. MAYNARD:       No, Your Honor.

15             JUSTICE BREYER:          All right.           If we were to reach

16   the question, which is very interesting, "What is the

17   Government's position as to which of those three positions

18   is the right position?" -- were we to reach it -- I agree

19   with you, I don't see it in front of us; but maybe it is

20   -- if it were, what would be your view?

21             MS. MAYNARD:       The Government's view is that

22   there's a spectrum along the spectrum, and it would have

23   -- you would have to consider each case on its terms.                   And

24   it's not clear, from this Court's cases, where the

25   policies in that --


                                       20

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1            JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.           So, basically,

 2   though, you're not certain.             The Government's view would

 3   be, it is a matter as to whether you can sue claiming the

 4   patent is invalid, whether the licensee can do it, that

 5   probably -- but you're not certain, and you haven't made

 6   up your mind definitely, because it is not in this case --

 7   but you think it's going to be something they could

 8   regulate themselves by contract.

 9            MS. MAYNARD:        It's certainly not foreclosed by

10   this Court's precedent, and it's an open question where

11   the policies -- how they would weigh out.                  There's no

12   language in this license, however, suggesting any type of

13   settlement.   And, moreover, I think it's important to

14   recognize that the parties here actually have a concrete

15   dispute about what the licensing agreement means.                  Count

16   one in the complaint is asking for a declaration --

17            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, you don't think

18   that matters, though, do you?             I mean, even if they all

19   agree there's no dispute about what the license agreement

20   means, your position is still the same, right?                  There is

21   an Article III controversy because they challenge the

22   validity of the patent?

23            MS. MAYNARD:        If the parties have a concrete

24   dispute about the validity of the patent, and it would

25   affect their rights and obligations in the way that it


                                       21

 1   would here -- in other words, that money will no longer be

 2   due to the Respondents if the patent's invalid --

 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Is --

 4              MS. MAYNARD:        -- and the --

 5              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- that always the case?

 6   I mean, could -- can you enforce a license agreement based

 7   on an invalid patent?        You thought it was valid -- parties

 8   had a dispute about it -- whether it is valid.                 You

 9   entered into agreement, say, "Well, let's split the

10   difference.   We'll -- you know, 50 cents rather than a

11   dollar or nothing."       It's determined that the patent is

12   invalid.   Can the patentee then still say, "Well, you

13   still owe me the money.          We've, kind of, cut -- split the

14   difference.   That was part of the agreement"?

15              MS. MAYNARD:        It might depend on whether there

16   was consideration beyond the patent itself.                In the -- in

17   this -- in this case, though, the Petitioner claims that

18   if the -- if the patent is invalid, they no longer owe

19   licensing fees, and, under Lear, they would be entitled to

20   the licensing fees, that they've paid since they began

21   challenging, back.      So, it's clear that under either the

22   contract or a question of --

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:           Contractually?       They say that

24   that's their contractual right?

25              MS. MAYNARD:        They claim that, under the

 1   licensing agreement, they only owe royalties on valid

 2   claims.     That's count one of the complaint, in the (j) --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Where does that appear in the

 4   licensing agreement?        Or --

 5               MS. MAYNARD:       Where does it appear in the

 6   licensing agreement?

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Yes, I took them as just

 8   asserting a general proposition of law -- that, where

 9   they've agreed to pay royalties because of a patent, if

10   the patent is invalid, they don't have to pay royalties --

11   not because there's some special provision in this

12   contract.

13               MS. MAYNARD:       The parties actually have a

14   concrete dispute about the meaning of the licensing

15   agreement in that regard, Justice Scalia.                     On page 399 of

16   the joint appendix is the provision about which they have

17   a dispute.    And the language in there provides that they

18   will pay on substances which would, if not licensed under

19   this agreement, infringe one or more claims of either or

20   both of the Shamir patents, or coexpression patents, which

21   have neither expired nor been held invalid by a court or

22   other body of competent jurisdiction.                     There was similar

23   language in --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:          So, there's really not much at

25   issue in this case.       And that's clearly a case of

 1   controversy, isn't it?        There is a dispute over the

 2   meaning of that provision of the agreement.

 3               MS. MAYNARD:      Yes, Your Honor.

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Gee, there's less here than

 5   meets the eye.

 6               MS. MAYNARD:      That's what the Government

 7   believes, Your Honor.

 8               It's also -- the licensee also does not need to

 9   breach the licensing agreement in order to create a case

10   or controversy.    The licensee is currently paying

11   royalties that it does not believe it owes and that it

12   believes it would be entitled to have back if it should

13   prevail on its interpretation of the -- of the patent and

14   the licensing agreement.          It doesn't have to make that

15   injury more severe by breaching.                That's clear from this

16   Court's decision in Altvater.              In Altvater, royalties were

17   being demanded and royalties were being paid, but,

18   nevertheless, this Court held --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, but that -- it's

20   been pointed out that was pursuant to an injunction.

21               MS. MAYNARD:      Yes, it was pursuant to

22   injunction, but that was not important to the Court's

23   reasoning.    What the Court said is, "You need not suffer

24   patent damages in order to bring the suit."                Not a

25   contempt.    "You need not breach the injunction and put

 1   yourself at risk of treble damages for infringement."                  It

 2   was the patent damages that put the licensee at risk, and

 3   that's the same risk that the Petitioner faces here and

 4   should not have to bear in order to bring suit.

 5            The case or controversy is whether or not the --

 6   they owe the royalties.         The whole point of the

 7   Declaratory Judgment Act was to allow contracting parties

 8   not to have to sever their ongoing contractual relations

 9   in order to get disputes resolved between --

10            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Do you think --

11            MS. MAYNARD:         -- themselves.

12            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Do you think there would

13   be a case or controversy if Genentech were suing to

14   establish the validity of its patent?

15            MS. MAYNARD:         In the situation that we have

16   here, Your Honor?

17            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Yes.

18            MS. MAYNARD:         Yes, I do.            Where the Petitioner

19   claims that the patent is invalid, that they could -- that

20   the Petitioner's claims unsettles their right, damages

21   their property value, potentially, and that they could

22   bring a declaratory judgment action of validity.

23            JUSTICE SCALIA:            And what would their -- what

24   would their concrete injury be?               What is the threatened

25   imminent injury that they would assert in that -- in that

 1   action?

 2             MS. MAYNARD:       Well, right now --

 3             JUSTICE SCALIA:          You have a licensee who's

 4   paying the license fees.         What is their concrete injury?

 5             MS. MAYNARD:       It -- from the moment -- the

 6   Petitioner has an argument that from the moment it ceased

 7   -- it starts claiming that the patent is invalid and pays

 8   under protest, that it is entitled to those royalties

 9   back.

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:          But --

11             MS. MAYNARD:       The --

12             JUSTICE SCALIA:          -- so long as they're still

13   paying the royalties, isn't that sort of an abstract

14   disagreement?   I mean, it's sort of like the ACLU saying

15   that the patent's invalid.          You know, it's a nice

16   theoretical question that we can argue about, but as long

17   as they're paying the royalties, where's the concrete

18   injury?

19             MS. MAYNARD:       Well, I think, technically,

20   Justice Scalia, they probably have a claim for patent

21   infringement, to which the defense, as Justice Ginsburg --

22             JUSTICE SCALIA:          I --

23             MS. MAYNARD:       -- points out --

24             JUSTICE SCALIA:          I find it --

25             MS. MAYNARD:       -- would be an easy defense.

 1             JUSTICE SCALIA:          I --

 2             MS. MAYNARD:       So, there's not an Article III

 3   lack of case or controversy, which is --

 4             JUSTICE SCALIA:          I find it --

 5             MS. MAYNARD:       -- what's the question before --

 6             JUSTICE SCALIA:          -- very difficult --

 7             MS. MAYNARD:       -- the Court.

 8             JUSTICE SCALIA:          -- to see how there would be a

 9   proper declaratory judgment action brought by the patentee

10   here.   It's just not the kind of a situation where you can

11   have a mirror-image suit.          I don't see what the --

12             MS. MAYNARD:       Well, you need --

13             JUSTICE SCALIA:          -- patentee --

14             MS. MAYNARD:       You -- may I answer that question?

15   You need not have a mirror-image suit, in that sense,

16   Justice Scalia.   And Altvater makes that clear.              In

17   Altvater, the patentee's claim was --

18             JUSTICE SCALIA:          That's fine.

19             MS. MAYNARD:       -- much narrower than the

20   counterclaim; and, nevertheless, the Court allowed that

21   counterclaim to proceed.

24              ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

25                     ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT


                                       27

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1             MS. MAHONEY:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 2   please the Court:

 3             I'd like to start with the fact that there are

 4   four counts in the complaint for declaratory relief.              The

 5   first one is styled as a -- contractual relations claims.

 6   The other three are styled as patent law claims.              And it's

 7   important to emphasize, at the outset, that this Court, in

 8   Skelly Oil, in Calderone, and in, really, all of the

 9   cases, has said it's very important to look behind the

10   labels that a Declaratory Judgment Act plaintiff puts on

11   their claims.   We need to actually see what is the cause

12   of action they're trying to adjudicate so we can do an

13   accurate assessment of justiciability -- standing,

14   ripeness, Federal-question jurisdiction.

15             I want to start by explaining why there is no

16   contract claim at issue here.              You heard today, they're

17   trying to salvage this, say that there's a contract

18   dispute, a dispute about the terms of the contract.              They

19   didn't argue that below, and with good reason.              And I'd

20   just point you to the briefs in the Federal Circuit.

21   Roman numeral I, which is all about the improper dismissal

22   of the Declaratory Judgment Act claims, refers to the fact

23   these are, quote, "patent-law claims," end quote, at page

24   27.   Nowhere do they say that there is a dispute about the

25   proper interpretation of the contract terms.              And let me


                                        28

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   explain why.

 2            The contract terms, which were just read to you,

 3   is Section 110 of -- 1.10 at JA-399 of the license -- says

 4   that there is an obligation to pay royalties for Synagis

 5   on any claim -- not any valid claim, any claim -- that has

 6   not been held invalid by a court or other competent

 7   jurisdiction from which no appeal has, or may, be taken.

 8   Now, they never said, below, "That clause means that we

 9   can come to court and have the court decide whether this

10   patent is valid, and, depending on whether we win or not,

11   then we can stop paying."          And the reason they didn't make

12   that argument is, it was rejected by this Court a hundred

13   years ago, in United States versus Harvey Steel.             Very

14   similar clause.   The United States says, "This means that

15   we don't have to pay if the patent is invalid."             And, in

16   an opinion by Justice Holmes, this Court rejected it out

17   of hand by -- and said, "This was a conventional proviso.

18   We don't even need to look to evidence of the party's

19   intent, because this is the standard proviso.             It does not

20   mean" -- and they said it was a "twisted interpretation"

21   that the Government was offering -- it doesn't mean that

22   the licensee, quote, "thought the patent bad and would

23   like to have the Court say so now," end quote.             Yet that

24   is exactly --

25            JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Was that a case about Article


                                       29

 1   III case or controversy?

 2               MS. MAHONEY:      It is, in the following sense,

 3   Your Honor.    They can't just show up here today and say,

 4   "Well, there really is a dispute about the contract."              But

 5   they never argued, below, and is foreclosed --

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:         Shouldn't we send that back?    I

 7   mean, I thought we were here to decide one question, that

 8   the Federal Circuit has said that, "Unless there is a

 9   reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit, you can't bring a

10   declaratory judgment action, because of the Constitution

11   of the United States."        Now, I have to admit, I've looked

12   up, or I've had my law clerk look up, probably now

13   hundreds of cases, and we can't find, in any case, such a

14   requirement.    Indeed, the very purpose -- as I -- we've

15   just heard the SG say, of this act, the Declaratory

16   Judgment Act, seems to be to allow people who -- a

17   contract -- who are in a real concrete disagreement, to

18   get a declaratory judgment without getting rid of the

19   contract.    But I might be wrong about that.

20               But you've now argued a different point.

21               MS. MAHONEY:      Well --

22               JUSTICE BREYER:         So, isn't the right thing for

23   us to do, to decide the issue in front of us and then send

24   it back?    If you're right that they have to pay, whether

25   they win or lose; if they're right that they promise not


                                        30

 1   to sue; if you're right on 14 other grounds, you might

 2   win.     But should we decide those grounds today?                    Why?

 3               MS. MAHONEY:       Well, first of all, with respect

 4   to this issue, whether there would be jurisdiction over a

 5   real live contract dispute, they never argued it, Your

 6   Honor.     It's not part of this case.                    The Federal Circuit

 7   didn't address it, because they didn't argue it, because

 8   it's foreclosed by --

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But the question --

10               MS. MAHONEY:       -- a precedent a hundred --

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The question that is

12   presented to us -- whatever they suggested at this oral

13   argument that wasn't in III, the question it presented to

14   us is, Was the Federal Circuit right when they said, "You

15   have no access to a declaratory judgment unless there is a

16   reasonable apprehension that you will be sued"?

17               MS. MAHONEY:       Your Honor, that is the right --

18   that is the right starting point for a test, depending on

19   the cause of action they're seeking to adjudicate.                      In

20   here, what the Federal Circuit properly understood is that

21   they are seeking to adjudicate affirmative defenses to an

22   infringement action under the patent laws.

23               And, just like in Steffel, if you're trying to

24   adjudicate, on an anticipatory basis, an enforcement

25   action, you have to show that you would reasonably fear


                                         31

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that enforcement action.         And, in fact, Steffel uses that

 2   language, and Poe versus Ullman dismisses a case for

 3   failure to establish a genuine fear of prosecution.                   But

 4   then, you have to go one step beyond, and that is to say,

 5   Are they -- is the cause of action not ripening because

 6   the declaratory judgment plaintiff is forfeiting their

 7   legal rights in order to avoid some very severe harm that

 8   would be cognizable coercion?             That's the test that's used

 9   in Steffel for -- in essence, being able to test a --

10   defenses to a cause of action that --

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:         And why --

12              MS. MAHONEY:      -- an enforcement action.

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:         -- doesn't that work here?

14              MS. MAHONEY:      It doesn't work here, for several

15   reasons.   Most fundamentally, this is a settlement.                  I

16   mean, Mr. Steffel did not enter into a settlement or a

17   compromise with the prosecutor.              He wasn't complying

18   because he was under an agreement to do so.                Here, it has

19   been settled for -- forever, that if a -- an agreement --

20   if you're making payments pursuant to an agreement, in the

21   nature of a compromise, you can't come and say that it's

22   been coerced or it's a form of duress.

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:         What is the --

24              JUSTICE SOUTER:         Why should we accept the

25   characterization that it's a compromise?                As I -- and


                                       32

 1   maybe I'm just factually wrong here?                   I thought, at the

 2   time they entered into the license agreement, they had

 3   some disagreements about the scope of the then-patent, the

 4   scope of the anticipated patent, and so on, and they

 5   couldn't very well be resolved.             But they were -- they

 6   were not settling, in the -- in the classic sense of the

 7   word, a -- let us say, a focus claim, one against the

 8   other.

 9            MS. MAHONEY:       I think the answer, Your Honor,

10   is, they weren't settling, for all time, in the sense that

11   they could never get out of the deal.                  Certainly, they

12   could repudiate and then go ahead and sue.                  But yet, at

13   page 3 of their petition, they expressly say, the reason

14   they entered into this agreement was in order to avoid the

15   costs and risks of litigation.             It is the reason --

16            JUSTICE SOUTER:          But had they gotten to the

17   point, prior to the execution of the contract, in which

18   one party was saying, "You may not do this," and the other

19   party was saying, "Oh, yes I can," so that there -- there

20   was a focus controversy that would have been the subject

21   matter of a conventional lawsuit, then and there, had

22   there not been this license agreement?

23            MS. MAHONEY:       Not exactly, but what they did was

24   they headed it off at the pass.             They understood that --

25            JUSTICE SOUTER:          But the question is, How far


                                      33

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   ahead of the pass can they get and still call it a

 2   settlement?" in the sense that you're using that term.

 3               MS. MAHONEY:       It's a compromise.           It's a

 4   compromise of the very claims they're trying to adjudicate

 5   here.     What they want to adjudicate are affirmative

 6   defenses to a patent infringement action.                  That is not a

 7   ripe claim, and there is not sufficient immediacy, because

 8   they are preventing that claim from ripening by continuing

 9   to make voluntary payments --

10               JUSTICE SOUTER:          But --

11               MS. MAHONEY:       -- under their --

12               JUSTICE SOUTER:          But you --

13               MS. MAHONEY:       -- agreement.

14               JUSTICE SOUTER:          Right.        But you were saying

15   that the status of that agreement, for purposes of the

16   jurisdictional question here, is exactly the same as the

17   status of an agreement that they might have entered into

18   after one party had brought suit against the other.                  And

19   --

20               MS. MAHONEY:       Well --

21               JUSTICE SOUTER:          And they -- they had settled.

22   And then, later on, somebody wanted to repudiate the

23   settlement.

24               MS. MAHONEY:       I don't know if it's exactly the

25   status.    For instance, in a settlement after litigation

 1   has been filed, I think that Lear would say that you can't

 2   even repudiate that.      But certainly -- so, there might be

 3   some differences -- but from --

 4             JUSTICE SOUTER:          In any event --

 5             MS. MAHONEY:       -- the standpoint of coercion --

 6             JUSTICE SOUTER:          -- it's equivalent to a

 7   settlement after a formal demand has been made.

 8             MS. MAHONEY:       It is equivalent to that, in the

 9   following sense.   They understood that if they -- if they

10   didn't get a license, that they would be exposed to

11   Genentech's claims under the -- under the infringement

12   laws.   And in order to avoid that exposure, even though

13   they had all the information they needed to assess the

14   validity of this patent at the time --

15             JUSTICE KENNEDY:          Suppose they didn't have all

16   the information.   Suppose you enter into a license

17   agreement -- you're convinced, as the one that's going to

18   pay the license fee, that it's a good patent -- after the

19   agreement's signed, the technological advances, other

20   disclosures, indicate that the patent is deficient.          Could

21   you sue then?

22             MS. MAHONEY:       No, I don't think so, unless --

23             JUSTICE KENNEDY:          Well, but then -- so then, the

24   argument that you've made is just not --

25             MS. MAHONEY:       No, I --

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:         -- relevant for us, the fact

 2   that they knew everything --

 3               MS. MAHONEY:      They did.

 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:         And it also means that this

 5   isn't really a settlement, in any respect.

 6               MS. MAHONEY:      It's a compromise of claims that

 7   could be brought.

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:         Ms. Mahoney, can I ask this

 9   question?    Supposing at the time they negotiate the

10   license agreement there's some uncertainty about whether

11   the patent is valid or not.              So, at the end of the license

12   agreement -- they agree on the royalties, the term, and

13   the -- everything it covers, but they put in a provision

14   and say, "We're not entirely sure the patent is valid, so

15   we reserve the right to bring an action challenging the

16   validity of the patent.         We will pay royalties in the

17   meantime, and the -- you will accept these royalties as

18   sufficient for the use of the patent, that, if we win, you

19   don't have to pay royals, if we lose, you do."              Would that

20   be a valid provision?

21               MS. MAHONEY:      I don't think so, but that would

22   certainly be a closer case if there --

23               JUSTICE STEVENS:         But would it --

24               MS. MAHONEY:      But I --

 1   issue as a jurisdictional matter as to whether there's a

 2   case or controversy?

 3            MS. MAHONEY:       No, I don't think so, because the

 4   real issue, in terms of Steffel, is whether you can say

 5   that the party is being coerced.              And, at least in your

 6   hypothetical, you could say that they have --

 7            JUSTICE STEVENS:          He's not being coerced, but

 8   he's bargaining a little better royalty rate than he'll --

 9   otherwise would have to pay.

10            MS. MAHONEY:       Well, in terms of whether they're

11   -- if the parties expressly agreed that that was part of

12   their deal, then you at least wouldn't say that there was

13   an issue of coercion.     But here, that isn't what happened.

14   Instead, they used --

15            JUSTICE STEVENS:          No, I'm really asking --

16            MS. MAHONEY:       -- a standard proviso --

17            JUSTICE STEVENS:          -- whether the parties could

18   agree to create a case or controversy.

19            MS. MAHONEY:       I think probably not, Your Honor.

 1   Stevens' hypothetical?          Assume it, take it as given.        They

 2   did put that in.      I know you think they didn't, but I want

 3   to assume it.

 4               MS. MAHONEY:        Uh-huh.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:           Now, I'd like to also assume --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Could I have a review of the

 7   bidding?    What --

 8               [Laughter.]

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Go back -- what is the

10   hypothetical --

11               JUSTICE BREYER:           The hypothetical is --

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Continue on.

13               JUSTICE BREYER:           -- that they write into the

14   contract -- the party who's the licensee says, "And we

15   stipulate that the licensee thinks that the patent is

16   invalid."    Nonetheless, the licensee wants a license, for

17   business reasons.      Therefore, the licensee and the

18   licensor agrees that, after they sign the contract and

19   he's paying a thousand dollars a month in royalties, he

20   can go into court and challenge the patent."               So, we

21   assume that's written into the contract.

22               MS. MAHONEY:        Uh-huh.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:           And now, let us also assume a

24   state of the law.      The state of the law is that there is

25   no public policy or any other policy that forbids such a

 1   condition in a contract.        All right?

 2            Now, on those two assumptions, the next thing

 3   that happens is that the licensee asks for a declaratory

 4   judgment that the patent is invalid.

 5            On those assumptions, is there a case or

 6   controversy under the Federal Constitution?             If not, why

 7   not?

 8            MS. MAHONEY:       I don't think so, because I think

 9   what they're really asking for is advice about a business

10   deal under those circumstances.

11            JUSTICE BREYER:          But he says, by the way, "If I

12   win, I will, in fact, save $42 billion a year in licenses"

13   --

14            MS. MAHONEY:       Yes.

15            JUSTICE BREYER:          -- "I would other have to pay."

16   And the other side will -- or -- I was a thousand dollars,

17   I meant 42 billion, okay?

18            [Laughter.]

19            MS. MAHONEY:       But -- you know, but now -- but

20   now, can they come even before they sign the deal?            In

21   other words, what's --

22            JUSTICE BREYER:          No.      Now, that's --

24            JUSTICE BREYER:          I'm not asking --

 7               [Laughter.]

 8               MS. MAHONEY:      I think the problem -- I think the

 9   problem is, it -- is, it leads notion that parties can

10   simply, sort of, set up a -- even if there's not true

11   adversity, and come to court for answers to legal

12   questions.    And that has --

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, isn't there --

14               MS. MAHONEY:      -- is something --

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              -- true adversity?          I

16   thought the assumption underlying the -- everybody's

17   hypothetical is that, if the patent is determined to be

18   invalid, that the license -- then the license agreement is

19   also invalid.    Is that -- is that right?

20               MS. MAHONEY:      I don't think so.               I don't think

21   the license agreement itself is invalid.                     It simply --

 1   that has been determined to be invalid?

 2              MS. MAHONEY:       Not on that patent.            Right.   The

 3   license --

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               It would --

 5              MS. MAHONEY:       -- made.

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               It would be pursuant to

 7   the agreement.

 8              MS. MAHONEY:       If the patent has been -- under

 9   Lear and other cases, if a patent has been held to be

10   invalid by a final decision of a court, then I think it is

11   improper for a licensee to seek to obtain --

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Collective --

13              MS. MAHONEY:       -- royalties --

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Even if --

15              MS. MAHONEY:       -- for that.

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               -- the royalty agreement

17   says, you know, "We have a dispute about the validity of

18   this patent.    We don't know.           We disagree.     And so, we've

19   entered into a compromise royalty rate that reflects the

20   uncertainty."    But once it's determined to be invalid, the

21   license fees are not collectible.

22              MS. MAHONEY:       I think that that is correct, Your

23   Honor, under the -- under the current state of the law.

24              JUSTICE SOUTER:          One further -- on further

25   wrinkle.   What if the contract goes the further step and

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   says, "Even if the patent were determined, in any action,

 2   to be invalid, there will still be a royalty payable,

 3   because that's what -- that's -- that is consideration for

 4   the fact that we are not going to start any controversy

 5   now."   Let's assume they assume, precisely, the

 6   invalidity.   Would you say the contract is unenforceable

 7   then, and the -- and the --

 8             MS. MAHONEY:       Well --

 9             JUSTICE SOUTER:          -- and, for jurisdictional

16   hypothetical, add the following.               There is a provision in

18   contract, the license is determined to be invalid,

19   royalties will still be payable under this contract --

20             MS. MAHONEY:       Uh-huh.

21             JUSTICE SOUTER:          -- because that is one of the

22   contingencies, which is a consideration for our bargain.

 1            MS. MAHONEY:       Well, I don't know what the

 2   dispute would be about, Your Honor, because it sounds like

 3   the contract terms would be clear.                And if the contract

 4   terms are clear, they would simply go in accordance,

 5   unless they have an argument that the contract is --

 6            JUSTICE SOUTER:          No, but I'm talking about

 7   jurisdictional purposes.

 8            MS. MAHONEY:       -- unenforceable.            If the -- if

 9   the point is that it is actually invalid, illegal, that --

10   that may be a different case, although I think there would

11   still be an estoppel argument, that they should not be

12   permitted to bring that action without giving up the

13   benefits of the bargain, which is the immunity from suit.

14   I mean, that is one of the fundamental problems with this

15   case.

16            JUSTICE SOUTER:          But do you see --

17            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               I thought your argument

18   -- I'm sorry.

19            JUSTICE SOUTER:          Well, if -- do you see a

20   difference between -- I guess you're saying there's no

21   difference between my added wrinkle on the hypo and the

22   Chief Justice's hypo, for jurisdictional purposes.

23            MS. MAHONEY:       I don't think that there's a

24   difference, from a jurisdictional perspective --

25            JUSTICE SOUTER:          Okay.

 1             MS. MAHONEY:         -- but I think, here, that the

 2   major problem, from a jurisdictional perspective, is that

 3   there is not anything in the language of the contract that

 4   gives them a right to come to court to dispute validity.

 5   Instead, we're --

 6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What about the fact that

 7   it's under protest?

 8             MS. MAHONEY:         That makes no difference, Your

 9   Honor.   The fact is that they are making the payments

10   pursuant to an agreement.            They're not under compulsion of

11   an injunction.     They're doing it because they voluntarily

12   entered into it.     Altvater is completely different.

13   There, there was no license agreement in force.                The

14   courts found that it -- that the reissue patents were

15   never part of the agreement, to begin with.                In other

16   words, Altvater never agreed to pay royalties.                Altvater

17   had been sued, so there wasn't a counterclaim for

18   invalidity.

19             JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Could the --

20             MS. MAHONEY:         And --

21             JUSTICE GINSBURG:               -- patent holder take the

22   position that, "I -- Sooner or later, I'm going to have to

23   fight out validity with someone, and might as well do it

 1   controversy"?

 2              MS. MAHONEY:        I don't think that the patent

 3   holder is allowed to come to court and seek a declaration

 4   of validity.     I don't think any court has ever allowed

 5   that.

 6              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Is it -- it's -- no, the

 7   patent -- the licensee is coming into court and wants a

 8   declaration of invalidity so it can manufacture without

 9   the fear of an infringement suit.

10              MS. MAHONEY:        And they're under a license?

11              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Yes.

12              MS. MAHONEY:        Yes.

13              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And the patent holder chooses

14   not to plead the license -- chooses not to plead the

15   license.   Wouldn't the patent holder have that option?

16              MS. MAHONEY:        Yes, the patent -- well, no.          I

17   mean, not necessarily.         Their view is that, because of the

18   terms of the agreement, that the patent holder has no

19   choice but to -- because they're receiving the royalties,

20   to simply --

21              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I don't mean their view.   I

22   mean, they start a lawsuit.               They say, "We're -- we want"

23   --

24              MS. MAHONEY:        But that is -- that's what

25   happened here.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- "we want a declaration of

 2   infringement."     And the patent holder doesn't take the

 3   position that you're taking; instead says, "I'm prepared

 4   to fight this out now.         I know that I have the license,

 5   which could be an affirmative defense, but I'm not going

 6   to raise it.     I'm going to go head to head on the validity

 7   of this patent."     Would that be a case or controversy?

 8               MS. MAHONEY:       I don't think so, Your Honor,

 9   because I don't think the parties are allowed to just

10   decide, "Well, we'd like to do this now," when they're --

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So, even --

12               MS. MAHONEY:       -- they've treated --

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- even if the patent holder

14   chooses not to raise the license, the court would have to,

15   on its own motion, say, "Sorry, you didn't -- you're not

16   the master of your defense.               We decide that you have to

17   effectively plead the license."

18               MS. MAHONEY:       I think the plaintiff has to show

19   that they are here pursuant to -- that they have a legal

20   right that permits them to adjudicate the issue of

21   validity.     What the -- what the patent owner does, or not,

22   I don't think turns this into a case or controversy; that,

23   instead, we have to start with the fundamental question,

24   "What is the cause of action that they are attempting to

25   adjudicate?     Is it a contract action or is it a -- an

 1   action under the patent laws?               Is it an infringement

 2   action?"   Here, I don't think there's any question but

 3   that it is -- they're trying to adjudicate an action for

 4   an infringement that can't arise, because they're immune

 5   from suit, because they continue to make their payments.

 6   And, under those circumstances, it is not sufficiently

 7   immediate to establish jurisdiction in --

 8              JUSTICE BREYER:           It is --

 9              MS. MAHONEY:        -- this Court.

10              JUSTICE BREYER:           -- it is, under other fields of

11   the law, isn't it?      I mean, I imagine that the very -- we

12   see, all the time, declaratory judgments where a State

13   passes a law and the individual says, "Well, I think this

14   is unconstitutional, but my preferences are not to go to

15   jail; my preferences are not to be penalized.                      So, my

16   first choice is unconstitutional and my second is to obey

17   it."   There's no possibility in the world that he will

18   violate that law.     And yet, we've often held that, with

19   regulations, you have to have the other requirements.                       You

20   have to have the requirements that it's concrete, it's not

21   just ideological, there's real harm.                      But, if those other

22   requirements that are fulfilled, I've never seen any where

23   it said that there also has to be a reasonable

24   apprehension of a lawsuit in the absence of the

25   declaratory judgment.        I've just never found that phrase,

 1   and I can't imagine why it would be part of the law.

 2            MS. MAHONEY:        Your Honor, Poe versus Ullman,

 3   this Court actually dismissed a declaratory judgment --

 4            JUSTICE SOUTER:           Oh, there are many dismissed,

 5   for the reasons that they aren't concrete, definite --

 6   there are a lot of reasons why to dismiss it.                   I'm just

 7   wondering if there is an additional reason that there has

 8   to be a reasonable apprehension of a lawsuit in the

 9   absence of the declaratory judgment action.                   It's that

10   phrase that I've never found anywhere --

11            MS. MAHONEY:        We --

12            JUSTICE SOUTER:           -- and can't think of any

13   reason why that would be an additional constitutional

14   requirement.   And I'm putting that directly to you,

15   because I want to hear you give me the counterexamples.

16            MS. MAHONEY:        Well -- but in Poe versus Ullman,

17   it was a declaratory judgment action.                   They were seeking

18   to have a statute declared unconstitutional.                   And this

19   Court did dismiss, because they didn't have a reasonable

20   fear that they would actually be prosecuted.                   Dismissed

21   for lack of jurisdiction.

22            JUSTICE BREYER:           And you say there has never

23   been a declaratory judgment action, except in the instance

24   where, in the absence of the action, the person would have

25   violated the law, if it's a Government law.                  In other

 1   words, if they're -- so, it's really not --

 2               MS. MAHONEY:      Even --

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:         Yes.

 4               MS. MAHONEY:      Well, you could -- you could --

 5   I'm not -- it is possible that that framework could be

 6   extended.    I -- it has not been done to date, and it would

 7   be --

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:         As I think as we --

 9               MS. MAHONEY:      But --

10               JUSTICE BREYER:         -- both know --

11               MS. MAHONEY:      But --

12               JUSTICE BREYER:         -- in the Government area, it

13   happens --

14               MS. MAHONEY:      It --

15               JUSTICE BREYER:         -- a lot.

16               MS. MAHONEY:      It does.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:         Yes.

18               MS. MAHONEY:      But there is always a reasonable

19   apprehension, and there was always a finding of coercion.

20   Poe versus Ullman says you can't do it unless there is --

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Do I remember that --

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:         Well, Poe versus Ullman was a

23   case in which, even if there was a violation of the law,

24   there was going to be no prosecution.

25               MS. MAHONEY:      That's why they didn't --

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:          He -- but, in this -- in this

 2   case, if there's a failure to -- of -- conform to the

 3   terms of the license agreement, there's going to be a

 4   lawsuit.     So, I think Poe versus Ullman is just not

 5   relevant.

 6               MS. MAHONEY:       That -- it goes to the next point,

 7   which is that there still has to be a coercive choice.

 8   You have to choose -- there, they're choosing to give up

 9   constitutional rights in order to avoid jail and

10   imprisonment, arrest and prosecution.                     Here --

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:          No, but --

12               MS. MAHONEY:       -- what's at issue --

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:          -- but, in Poe versus Ullman,

14   the ultimate action was basically like violating the

15   contract here, and that's why it's not an applicable

16   precedent.

17               MS. MAHONEY:       I don't -- I don't think it's like

18   violating the contract here, though, Your Honor, because,

19   What are the consequences here?                What is the choice?

20   First of all, they actually owe the royalties under the

21   agreement, so they're trying to escape their bargain, not

22   enforce it.    That's number one.              So, they're not

23   forfeiting any rights under the contract, they're simply

24   trying to get out of the contract.

25               Number two, the consequences here, the choice


                                         50

 1   they're talking about, isn't in the nature of coercion.

 2   Again, they're not being arrested or prosecuted.                    All

 3   they're going to do if they walk out of this agreement, if

 4   they stop paying royalties -- yes, they may well be sued

 5   for infringement -- but, if they do, all they face is the

 6   loss of their discount.

 7            JUSTICE ALITO:         But your argument seems --

 8            MS. MAHONEY:       That's --

 9            JUSTICE ALITO:         -- to be based on their having

10   implicitly given up their right to sue.                    Isn't that right?

11   That was your main argument.           This is a settlement.            This

12   is in the nature of the settlement.                    As part of the

13   bargain, the patent holder promises not to sue for

14   infringement.

15            MS. MAHONEY:       It's not based on them giving up

16   their right to sue, in the sense that all they have to do

17   is stop paying royalties, and they can sue.                    They have to

18   --

19            JUSTICE ALITO:         But in answer to the

20   hypotheticals, you seem to say it wouldn't matter if they

21   explicitly did not give up their right to sue.                    So, what

22   is left of this argument that what's involved here is

23   essentially a settlement?

24            MS. MAHONEY:       Well, it is in the nature of a

25   compromise, Your Honor, and there's nothing in this


                                      51

 1   agreement that gives them a right to sue.                    They have to

 2   find some legal right.       What they're really saying -- what

 3   their argument has always been is that Lear actually

 4   creates an implied right of action for a licensee to sue

 5   at any time of their choosing.              That's been their argument

 6   from the beginning.

 7             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, their concrete

 8   right is, as I thought you conceded earlier, that if the

 9   patent is declared invalid, they will not owe license

10   fees.

11             MS. MAHONEY:       That's true.               But that's getting

12   the cart before the horse.          What this Court said in --

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, that's what --

14             MS. MAHONEY:       -- U.S. v. Harvey Steel is --

15             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               -- a declaratory

16   judgment action does, though, isn't it?

17             MS. MAHONEY:       Well, I don't think so, Your

18   Honor.   I think every single contract case in the lower

19   courts where they have allowed a suit to be brought on a

20   contract prior to breach, there was a genuine dispute

21   about the interpretation of the terms.                   Here, what they're

22   trying to do is adjudicate a cause of action outside of

23   the contract.   They're trying to adjudicate an

24   infringement action and then say, "Aha, see what I have?

25   I have a judgment that the patent's invalid.                    And so, now

 1   I'd like to say that I don't have to pay royalties under

 2   my contract."

 3             JUSTICE SCALIA:          Ms. Mahoney, the patent bar is

 4   sort of specialized -- more than "sort of" -- it's a

 5   specialized bar, and I've never -- I've never been a part

 6   of it.   Do you agree with the statement of the

 7   Petitioner's counsel that Gen-Probe came as a -- as a

 8   shock to the --

 9             MS. MAHONEY:       As a -- I do not agree that it

10   came as a shock.   And, in fact, I think that Warner

11   Jenkinson, which is a Second Circuit case that allowed

12   this kind of action back in the '70s, was one of the only

13   cases ever that allowed it.             And other reasons were found

14   to dismiss similar kinds of claims.                     In Gen-Probe, it was

15   a surprise that a licensee could do this.                    It -- the law

16   -- by the time that this license was executed in the

17   Federal Circuit, there was a case, called Shell Oil, where

18   the Court specifically held that a licensee cannot take

19   advantage of the protections of Lear until it has

20   repudiated the license, stopped paying, and said that it

21   wants to challenge validity.             So that was the background

22   rule that was in force at the time of this license.                    And

23   then, when you couple that with the fact that --

24             JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But that wasn't -- the

25   District Court, in this very case, seemed to say, "I think


                                       53

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   this suit should go forward, but there's Gen-Probe, and I

 2   must follow Gen-Probe."        The District Court, at least as I

 3   read it, seemed to think that Gen-Probe moved in a

 4   different direction from where the Federal Circuit was

 5   before.

 6             MS. MAHONEY:       In all of the prior Federal

 7   Circuit cases, the licensee had stopped paying royalties.

 8   And what the Court explained in Gen-Probe is that that is

 9   the sine qua non, that a licensee can't establish

10   jurisdiction, and it can't establish a right to challenge

11   validity, if it's still paying royalties.

12             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Ms. Mahoney, you argue,

13   in the alternative, that we should dismiss it on the basis

14   of equitable considerations under the Declaratory Judgment

15   Act.   We can't reach that argument unless we rule against

16   you on the Article III question.               Is that right?

17             MS. MAHONEY:       I don't think so, Your Honor.           I

18   think you can, because I think that you can do it as an

19   alternative threshold prudential jurisdictional dismissal

20   in the nature --

21             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               We would have to be

22   assuming that we had jurisdiction, wouldn't we?

23             MS. MAHONEY:       I think that --

24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Under Article III?

25             MS. MAHONEY:       I think that a prudential


                                       54

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   dismissal under Article III would also be fine, and that

 2   Steel Co. would allow for that kind of dismissal, because

 3   Wilton said that you can dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,

 4   at the front end, on prudential grounds if you know that

 5   there would not be relief allowed at the back end.

 6              And I think that there's no need for a remand to

 7   do this.     We are really talking about an equitable rule

 8   that has governed equitable actions for 300 years.                       It is

 9   a --

10              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But what -- but jurisdiction

11   is a question of power, Does the Court have the power to

12   do this?     A discretion question is different.                    It's, "We

13   have the power to entertain this case, but, as a matter of

14   equity, we're not going to do so."                        The power question, I

15   think, is a -- one that's -- it's either yes or no, either

16   the court has the power, or doesn't.

17              MS. MAHONEY:        But I don't think that the Court

18   has to answer that question in order to dismiss on a

 1            JUSTICE STEVENS:             Ms. Mahoney, can I ask you one

 2   question before your light goes off?                       I know it's not --

 3   goes to the "case or controversy" issue, but, in your

 4   view, was the bringing of this action a material breach of

 5   an implied condition of the contract that would justify a

 6   termination of a license?

 7            MS. MAHONEY:          It would depend on whether there

 8   is an implied covenant, Your Honor.                       It wasn't --

 9            JUSTICE STEVENS:             I'm asking you whether --

10            MS. MAHONEY:          -- argued below.

11            JUSTICE STEVENS:             -- you think there was.

12            MS. MAHONEY:          I think it -- it may well be, but

13   I don't think the answer in this case turns on it, because

14   I think they have to have their own right to bring the

15   action, whether it's a breach or not, and that they don't.

16   Because they don't have an implied right of action under

17   Lear, they don't have a right to bring this action.                      And

18   that is an essential component of their ability to

19   challenge the issue of validity.                 So, I think that's the

20   first and fundamental --

21            JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, if that's so, and it's a

22   super-violation of an implied covenant, and I guess you

23   could get damages.

24            MS. MAHONEY:          I think that their theory, Your

25   Honor, is that a licensee can do this at any time, and


                                         56

 1   that --

 2             JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But I think that your theory

 3   is that it's a super-violation of an implied covenant.

 4             MS. MAHONEY:        Your Honor, I don't think --

 5   whether it's an implied covenant or not --

 6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:           "Not only did we agree to it,

 7   but we you can't even do it if you agree to it."

 8             MS. MAHONEY:        I think that an additional factor

 9   that bears on this analysis is also the fact that Congress

10   has never created an implied right of -- has never created

11   a right of action --

12             Thank you, Your Honor.

13             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, Ms. Mahoney.

15             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. KESTER

16                     ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

17             MR. KESTER:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.           Just

18   several quick items.

19             I think -- I think, Mr. Chief Justice, you were,

20   a while ago, putting the horse in front of the cart, which

21   was right where it belongs.              The contract claim is clear

22   in the record.    It's at page 136 of the joint appendix.              I

23   don't think more needs to be said about it.

24             Harvey Steel, on which Respondents rely, was, of

25   course, overruled --

 1            JUSTICE SCALIA:            Wait, wait.          Before you leave

 2   that, do you agree that it was not raised below?

 3            MR. KESTER:        No, we don't.

 4            JUSTICE SCALIA:            Where -- can you tell us where

 5   it was raised below?

 6            MR. KESTER:        Well, it -- it's raised in the --

 7   in the first remanded complaint.                It's been a -- it's been

 8   here throughout.    If it -- if it even matters.                 I mean, we

 9   wouldn't concede that that -- that that would even matter.

10            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But was it raised before

11   the Federal Circuit?

12            MR. KESTER:        Yes.         The whole record was -- you

13   mean was it argued --

14            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Yes.

15            MR. KESTER:        I believe it was.             I'd have to go

16   back and -- you mean in terms of the oral argument.                  It

17   was certainly in the briefs.             It was certainly not waived.

18            There was never, of course, any -- anything in

19   the license, or anyplace else, where Petitioner gave up

20   the right to sue.     Petitioner doesn't need permission in

21   the license to sue.

22            And as for the shock in the lower courts when

23   this case was decided, I would call to your attention what

24   the Federal Circuit, in 1983, itself, said, and it quoted

25   the Warner-Jenkinson case, which was the Second Circuit


                                        58

 1   case that my friend dismissed somewhat.                   The C.R. Bard

 2   case -- this is Federal Circuit, early -- starts out, the

 3   opening line -- it says, and I quote -- this is 716 F.2d

 4   875 -- "We hold that a patent license need not be

 5   terminated before a patent licensee may bring a Federal

 6   declaratory judgment action," close quote.                  And the last

 7   words of the same opinion, at 882 of 716 F.2d, are, "We

 8   hold that a patent licensee may bring a Federal

 9   declaratory judgment action to declare the Federal -- to

10   declare the patent subject to the license invalid without

11   prior termination of the -- of the license."                  That was

12   1983.   Gen-Probe was 2004.           Something happened in the

13   interval.

14               Finally, the discussion of settlements here

15   strikes me as, indeed, strange, because if this -- if a

16   license were to be redesignated as a settlement, we would

17   have the situation here where -- a license was signed in

18   1977; the only patent at issue in this case was not even

19   issued until 2001.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, Mr. Kester.

21               MR. KESTER:      Thank you, Mr. --

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               The case is submitted.

23               [Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the case in the

24   above-entitled matter was submitted.]
