 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G. GARRE

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9               GENERAL GARRE:         Thank you,

10   Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

11               This case concerns the qualified immunity of

12   high-ranking government officials, like the Attorney

13   General of the United States and Director of the FBI,

14   and supervisory liability claims under Bivens based on

15   the alleged wrongdoing of much lower level officials.

16               In concluding that the complaint in this

17   case was sufficient to subject the high-ranking

18   officials, like the Attorney General, to the demands of

19   civil discovery, the court of appeals erred in two

20   fundamental and interrelated respects.

21               First, the court erred in concluding that

22   the complaint stated a violation of clearly established

23   rights by the former Attorney General and Director of

24   the FBI, because under this Court's precedents the

25   complaint fails adequately to plead the personal


                                       3
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   involvement of those high-ranking officials for the

 2   alleged discriminatory acts of lower level officials.

 3               And, second --

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               General Garre, will you

 5   clarify one point?      You said "fails to state" enough to

 6   overcome qualified immunity.              But, usually, these -- the

 7   pleading is analyzed discretely.                 This is a 12(b)(6)

 8   motion, is it?

 9               GENERAL GARRE:            It is a 12(b)(6) motion.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               And so that tests just

11   the pleading.    Qualified immunity is an affirmative

12   defense which hasn't even been stated formally.                So

13   isn't it entirely conceivable that you could have a good

14   complaint judged from the 12(b)(6) point of view, but

15   when the qualified immunity defense is asserted, the

16   plaintiff isn't able to come up with enough to stave off

17   a summary judgment motion?

18               GENERAL GARRE:            No, for two reasons,

19   Justice Ginsburg.     The first is that this Court has

20   recognized that a defense can be a basis for a motion to

21   dismiss under 12(b)(6).          It did so most recently in the

22   Jones versus Bock case.          And -- and it's established

23   practice in the Federal courts, in part because of this

24   decision, that appeals from the denial of a motion to

25   dismiss on the ground of qualified immunity are


                                          4

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   appropriate.

 2               And, second, as the Second Circuit

 3   recognized -- and we think it got this right -- the

 4   question of whether a complaint adequately pleads the

 5   personal involvement of government officials goes

 6   directly to the question of qualified immunity -- and

 7   the court of appeals said that on page 14a of its

 8   decision -- because it goes to the question of whether

 9   these defendants have violated any clearly established

10   rights.

11               And so the question of supervisory liability

12   in this case we think is essential to the question of

13   whether or not the Attorney General and Director of the

14   FBI are entitled to qualified immunity.                And in denying

15   the government's -- the Petitioner's motion to dismiss

16   on the ground of qualified immunity, the district court

17   erroneously deprived these Petitioners of the

18   protections of that important defense.

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, Mr. Garre, isn't

20   there more involved here than simply derivative

21   liability for the acts of others?               I -- I've got a bunch

22   of excerpts from the complaint, but let me just go to

23   one, on section -- paragraph, rather, 97.               That charges

24   the defendants Ashcroft and Mueller with willfully and

25   maliciously designing a policy.             It doesn't sound like


                                       5

 1   respondeat superior.        I mean, it seems to -- to charge

 2   them directly with coming up with what these people are

 3   complaining about.

 4               GENERAL GARRE:            Well, I think that that's

 5   fair, Justice Souter.        I mean, I think that there are

 6   two general types of allegations in this complaint.                 One

 7   set of allegations says that Petitioners came up with

 8   this policy, and if you look at those allegations -- and

 9   I think I would point you to paragraph 69 and paragraphs

10   10 and 11 -- those allegations we think describe a

11   policy which is neutral on its face, a policy of holding

12   persons determined by the FBI to be of interest in

13   connection with a terribly important investigation until

14   they have been cleared.

15               And so we think that those allegations can't

16   be enough to sustain these -- to subject these

17   Petitioners to -- to civil discovery.

18               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Well, why don't -- may I

19   just interrupt you there?            Why don't you think the

20   reference here in the language I just read, to designing

21   a policy, includes the policy which is several times

22   described as being one which called for holding -- for

23   Arab Muslim men of certain countries of origin without

24   reference to any penal purpose?                I mean, that -- I think

25   that is adequately described in there as part of the


                                          6

 1   policy.

 2               GENERAL GARRE:          I think if you look at the

 3   complaint, that -- that interpretation doesn't hold up.

 4   And in particular, I would point you to paragraph 48,

 5   which is on page 164a of the joint appendix -- I'm

 6   sorry, the petition appendix.             And what that paragraph

 7   says is that these allegedly discriminatory

 8   determinations, classifications, were made by FBI

 9   officials in the field, not Petitioners here, the former

10   Attorney General and director of the FBI.                 And

11   importantly, these determinations were made, quote, and

12   this comes from paragraph 48, "without specific criteria

13   or uniform classification system."

14               And so that's what's going on here.                 You've

15   got a complaint that alleges that specific lower level

16   officials are making these determinations.                 That's in

17   paragraphs 50 and 51.      You've got a complaint alleging

18   that these determinations are being made on the basis of

19   ad hoc criteria.   That's page 48.               And then you have

20   these overarching allegations that the Attorney General

21   and the Director of the FBI knew about, approved, and

22   condoned these discriminatory conduct of much lower

23   level officials.

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You don't -- you

25   don't dispute that, whatever the policy was, that it was


                                        7
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   approved and condoned by the Attorney General and the

 2   Director of the FBI?

 3               GENERAL GARRE:         We've accepted that at some

 4   level that this complaint maintains, and it's in

 5   paragraph 69, that there was a policy of holding

 6   suspects until they -- the suspects were determined to

 7   be of interest by the FBI, until they were cleared by

 8   the FBI in connection with this investigation.                That

 9   policy we have not disputed, and that policy we think is

10   a -- is a factually neutral, perfectly lawful law

11   enforcement response to the 9/11 attacks, resulting in

12   --

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, it may -- it

14   may very well be, but isn't it, for purposes of a

15   complaint, sufficient to raise a due process claim by

16   saying what they say?     In other words, you -- you may

17   have a very good defense to it.             You may have something

18   that does not ever get beyond -- get them beyond the

19   point of summary judgment.         But for them simply to

20   charge that there was a policy in which they picked up

21   people and they held them until they were cleared, i.e.,

22   sort of demonstrated to be innocent in some way, that at

23   least on the face of it seems to -- to state a due

24   process problem under the Fifth Amendment, doesn't it?

25               GENERAL GARRE:         Not with respect to the


                                       8

 1   Petitioners here, the former Attorney General and the

 2   Director of the FBI, because -- and I think in

 3   evaluating --

 4               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Even -- even if, as the

 5   Chief Justice said, they knew and condoned the policy?

 6               GENERAL GARRE:           Well, the question is which

 7   policy, what policy?       And if you look at the complaint,

 8   I think the only policy that the allegations bear out

 9   with respect to the Attorney General and the Director of

10   the FBI is a policy described in paragraph 69 of holding

11   suspects until cleared.         The --

12               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, you may be -- you --

13   I mean, you may be right.           I think there's -- there's a

14   lot of tension in the -- in the allegations here.                  I --

15   I grant you that.    But isn't the proper way to deal with

16   those tensions at this stage to file a motion for a more

17   definite statement and find out for sure?

18               GENERAL GARRE:           No.      I mean, certainly that

19   is one option.   I mean, the Court mentioned that in the

20   Crawford-El case, and that's an option.                  But just as in

21   the Bell Atlantic case, where that was an option, too,

22   and where the defendants in that case did not avail

23   themselves of their opportunity to file a motion for a

24   more definite statement, the Petitioners here did not do

25   so and they were not required to do so.                  They had a


                                         9

1    different option under the Federal Rules of Civil

2    Procedure to move for dismissal under 12(b)(6).                       They

3    exercised that option, and the complaint -- the

4    complaint should be dismissed because it fails to state

5    a claim against those individuals.

6                JUSTICE SOUTER:             The difference, it -- and

7    maybe this isn't a sufficient difference.                    But the

8    difference in my mind between this and Bell Atlantic was

9    that, in Bell Atlantic you had a set of allegations in

10   which in -- in effect it was an either-or choice.                      There

11   were two possibilities consistent with the allegations

12   in Bell Atlantic.    One was a conspiracy possibility; one

13   was a -- a lawful parallel conduct possibility.                    And

14   there just wasn't any way to pick one as being a more

15   probable interpretation of what they were getting at.

16               Here the problem is not so much an either-

17   or choice as to which we are clueless, but a just

18   vagueness or uncertainty.           Does the -- Does the talk

19   about the -- the racial criterion go to the policy as

20   devised or the policy as implemented?                    And so on.    And

21   it seems to me that here we're -- we're in a kind of

22   conceptually a squishier situation and it might be

23   better to get a more definite statement than to say,

24   well, you -- you've got to make a choice, and there's no

25   way to make a choice.

1                GENERAL GARRE:           That's one of the reasons

2    why I think it's important to distinguish between the

3    different sets of claims.           I think the general claim of

4    a policy of holding suspects until cleared is much more

5    like the Bell Atlantic situation, where you have got

6    factually neutral allegations, perfectly lawful law

7    enforcement conduct to have a policy that says, FBI

8    agents, if you determine these people are of interest,

9    hold them until they are cleared so that we are not

10   releasing people that are potentially suspects or

11   wrongdoers in this investigation.

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              General Garre, I think

13   that the Bell Atlantic case -- and -- and I'm sure that

14   Justice Souter will correct me if I'm wrong about this,

15   but most of it is about what it takes -- what are the

16   essential elements of a Sherman section 1 charge.              And

17   there's a big mistake that the pleaders are making; that

18   is, there has to be an agreement, and they haven't

19   alleged an agreement.

20               This case seems to be quite different.              And

21   I think you have taken Bell Atlantic, frankly, for more

22   than is there.   That is, twice -- at least twice in the

23   opinion, the Court says, we are not developing any

24   heightened pleading rules.           Form 11 is as good today as

25   it was yesterday.    What we are talking about is a

1    missing -- is an essential element to a substantive

2    claim for relief.     I thought that's what --

3                GENERAL GARRE:           And we're not asking for a

4    heightened pleading standard, Justice Ginsburg.                  I think

5    what's missing here fundamentally is a substantive

6    requirement of the cause of action -- Bivens -- for

7    supervisory liability which is an affirmative link.

8    Subsidiary allegations suggesting a plausible

9    affirmative link between the discriminatory actions

10   allegedly taken by much lower level officials in the

11   field and the Director of the FBI and the Attorney

12   General of the United States.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  That -- that sounds

14   like an argument on the merits of the Bivens claim,

15   rather than an argument going to qualified immunity.

16               GENERAL GARRE:           It -- it's not -- I mean, in

17   -- in a similar way that this Court considered the scope

18   of a Bivens cause of action in the Wilkie case recently

19   and in the Hartman case recently.                 In both of those

20   cases the Court recognized that the scope of the Bivens

21   cause of action goes directly to the question of

22   qualified immunity.

23               And here, in order to evaluate whether the

24   pleadings are adequate against the Attorney General and

25   the Director of the FBI, you have to know what the

1    substantive standard under Bivens is for a supervisory

2    liability type claim.        You have to know -- just as you

3    did in Bell Atlantic, you had to know the substantive

4    standard of antitrust law in this kind of context.                    Here

5    you have to know the substantive standard of what's

6    required to subject the Attorney General of the United

7    States or the Director of the FBI to potential

8    liability, civil damages, burdens of civil discovery,

9    for supervisory liability for the claims of much lower

10   level officials.

11                JUSTICE BREYER:             How does -- how does this

12   work in an ordinary case?            I should know the answer to

13   this, but I don't.      It's a very elementary question.

14   Jones sues the president of Coca-Cola.                    His claim is the

15   president personally put a mouse in the bottle.                   Now, he

16   has no reason for thinking that.                 Then his lawyer says:

17   Okay, I'm now going to take seven depositions of the

18   president of Coca-Cola.          The president of Coca-Cola

19   says:    You know, I don't have time for this; there's no

20   basis.   He's -- he's -- I agree he's in good faith, but

21   he's -- there is no basis.            Okay, I don't want to go and

22   spend the time to answer a question.

23                Where in the rules does it say he can go to

24   the judge and say, judge -- his lawyer will say -- my

25   client has nothing to do with this; there's no basis for

1    it; don't make him answer the depositions, please?

2                   GENERAL GARRE:         And I think it would be --

3                   JUSTICE BREYER:           Where does it say that in

4    the rules?

5                   GENERAL GARRE:         It -- it says that, as this

6    Court interpreted it, in Rule 8 of the rules, Justice

7    Breyer.

8                   JUSTICE BREYER:           In Rule 8?

9                   GENERAL GARRE:         Yes, because in Rule 8 --

10                JUSTICE BREYER:             I thought Rule 8 was move

11   for a more definite statement.

12                GENERAL GARRE:           No.      Rule 8 is the -- is the

13   plain statement showing entitlement to relief.                       It is

14   the rule interpreted in Bell Atlantic, and there the

15   Bell Atlantic Court said that the plaintiff had the

16   obligation to show a plausible entitlement to relief.

17   And --

18                JUSTICE BREYER:             He shows a plausible

19   entitlement.    He says -- there's no doubt it's a claim

20   if the president of Coca-Cola did put the mouse in the

21   bottle.   It's just there is no basis for thinking that.

22                GENERAL GARRE:           It's --

23                JUSTICE BREYER:             So he wants to go to the

24   judge and say:    I've set out a claim here; I copied it

25   right out of the rules.          All right?               Now, what allows

1    the judge to stop this deposition?

2                  GENERAL GARRE:         Rule 8 does, as interpreted

3    --

4                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Where?

5                  GENERAL GARRE:         -- in Bell Atlantic, because

6    that is not a plausible entitlement of a claim to relief

7    --

8                  JUSTICE SOUTER:           But, Mr. Garre, you are

9    using the word "plausible" or you're taking the word

10   "plausible" out of Bell Atlantic, I think, and you are

11   using it to mean something that probably can be proven

12   to be true.   Bell Atlantic drew that distinction.                They

13   -- the plausibility there is a plausibility that if they

14   prove what they say, they will -- they will establish a

15   violation.

16                 GENERAL GARRE:         I certainly agree with you.

17   You don't have to show that it probably is, but you have

18   to show facts suggesting -- above the speculative level.

19   And just as in Bell Atlantic --

20                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Okay.       I -- I think you are

21   right that if somebody makes just a totally bizarre

22   allegation that nobody in the world could take

23   seriously, that -- that the issue can be raised.

24                 But in Justice Breyer's case, the -- that --

25   that may be the case if the claim is that the president

1    of Coke was -- was personally putting mouses in bottles.

2    But the claim, it seems to me, that the Attorney General

3    or the Director of the FBI was establishing a policy of

4    no release until cleared or a policy that centered on

5    people with the same characteristics as the hijackers

6    does not have that kind of bizarre character to it and,

7    I think, would not run afoul of the -- of the

8    plausibility standard.

9                   GENERAL GARRE:         Well, we certainly think --

10   I mean, in Bell Atlantic, the Court said common economic

11   experience would -- would support its determination in

12   that case.   We think here, and I think the brief filed

13   by former attorney generals from several different

14   administrations makes this point as well, that common

15   government experience would suggest that the Attorney

16   General of the United States is not involved in the sort

17   of microscopic decisions --

18                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, I would agree, but

19   this is about as far from common government operation as

20   one can get.

21                GENERAL GARRE:           The -- and I think that gets

22   to one of the fundamental problems with the Second

23   Circuit decision, is it held the extraordinary context

24   of the 9/11 attacks and the aftermath of those attacks

25   against the Petitioners in this case.                     And that's

1    problematic, not only from the qualified-immunity

2    perspective of what it's going to be like for officials

3    next time they have to --

4                  JUSTICE SOUTER:           Oh, I know, but the courts

5    can't --

6                  GENERAL GARRE:         -- deal with something like

7    that.

8                  JUSTICE SOUTER:           The courts can't ignore the

9    extraordinary circumstances, either.

10                 GENERAL GARRE:         But it's problematic because

11   you have to look at the reality of the job of the

12   Attorney General of the United States and the Director

13   of the FBI.    In general, these are people who are

14   responsible not only for the litigating divisions within

15   the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of

16   Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Agency, enforcing

17   countless laws.    These are people who have

18   extraordinarily busy schedules.               And ordinary --

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I'm sorry, I just don't

20   have the answer to my question.               I must not have said it

21   properly.    Imagine, way before Twombly -- these rules

22   have been in existence for decades.                      So we go back years

23   ago.    Certainly, there have been many cases where, for

24   whatever reasons, the plaintiffs included allegations

25   that were just factually very unlikely.                     I want to know


                                        17

1    where the judge has the power to control discovery in

2    the rules.   That's -- I should know that.                     I can't

3    remember my civil procedure course.                      Probably, it was

4    taught on day 4.

5                 (Laughter.)

6                 GENERAL GARRE:          Well, Rule 26 governs

7    discovery, Justice Breyer.

8                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, I see that.           It says

9    a person has a right to go and get discovery.                      It

10   doesn't say they only control it under certain

11   provisions which don't seem to me to apply to the truly

12   absurd discovery.    There must be some power a judge has.

13                And the second question I'm going to ask

14   you, when you tell me what that power is, which

15   apparently I'm not going to find out -- but -- but

16   whatever that power is, which must be there, why doesn't

17   that work to solve your problem?

18                GENERAL GARRE:          Well, the power to -- to

19   govern discovery doesn't solve the problem for the same

20   reason that it didn't in Bell Atlantic.                     The Court

21   specifically said we are not going to rely on district

22   courts to weed out potentially meritless claims because

23   we recognize the burdens that discovery can impose in

24   the civil and in trust contexts.                And those burdens are

25   multiplied many times here where you are talking about


                                        18

1    subjecting to -- subjecting high level government

2    official to the burdens of civil discovery.

3                 I think fundamentally we think you don't get

4    to the question of how do district judges control

5    discovery, because they haven't gotten through the

6    gateway of pleading an adequate claim.                  And if I can

7    give you the substantive rule that we think is on point

8    here -- this Court, in the Rizzo case, which is a

9    section 1983 case, considered the question of claims

10   against high-ranking officials, the Mayor of the City of

11   Philadelphia, the Police Commissioner of the City of

12   Philadelphia, for alleged wrongdoing by individual

13   police officers there.

14                And there -- in that case, the Court held

15   that a plaintiff under section 1983 has to establish, as

16   a matter of law, an affirmative link between the acts of

17   the -- the subordinates and the higher-level officials.

18   And we think that that substantive rule in section 1983

19   at a minimum carries over to the Bivens context.

20                JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, what -- I mean, my

21   basic question, which I really want to hear the answer

22   to, is the Attorney General is very busy and what he

23   does is very important.        The president of Coca-Cola is

24   very busy.   The president of General Motors is very busy

25   -- and very busy at the moment.              And what he --


                                       19

1                 (Laughter.)

2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            What they are doing is very

3    important.   There are quite a few people in this country

4    who aren't even in the government, and what they do is

5    very important and they are very busy.                   And so if there

6    is something in these rules that allows people to bring

7    suits without any factual foundation, even though the --

8    the complaint says there is --

9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How about --

10                JUSTICE BREYER:            I'll bet those people are

11   being harassed --

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How about Rule 11 to take

13   care of Justice Breyer's problem?                 The judge would say

14   to the lawyer:   Now, you signed this pleading, and when

15   you made -- you signed it, you made certain

16   representations, and I'm going to read the Riot Act to

17   you if it turns out that this is a frivolous petition.

18                GENERAL GARRE:          Sure.        That's one

19   protection, Justice Ginsburg.              And --

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Reading the Riot --

21                GENERAL GARRE:          And this Court --

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Reading the Riot Act

23   to the lawyer is protection against the Attorney General

24   and the Director of the FBI after they're hauled in for

25   discovery or subjected to depositions and the judge

1    finds out --

2                GENERAL GARRE:         We --

3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm sorry, Mr.

4    Garre.

5                -- the judge finds out that there wasn't in

6    fact a sufficient basis for it, and that -- that will

7    show them, if they get read the Riot Act by a judge?

8                GENERAL GARRE:         It's certainly not adequate

9    protection, Mr. Chief Justice.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I was responding to

11   Justice Breyer's Coca-Cola president.                  I think Rule 11

12   would work quite well to answer that.

13               GENERAL GARRE:         I would have thought that

14   this Court's decision in Bell Atlantic put an end to

15   those sorts of claims where the court --

16               JUSTICE STEVENS:           Well, Mr. Garre, it seems

17   to me you are really arguing -- I am very sympathetic to

18   the argument -- that if there was no plausible claim in

19   Bell Atlantic, in which there was a direct allegation of

20   a conspiracy in violation of section 1, was rejected

21   because the Court thought it implausible, a fortiori

22   this claim is implausible because it's got exactly the

23   same problems in that you don't want to subject these

24   important people to all the inconvenience of discovery.

25   It seems to me these cases are very, very similar.

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1                 GENERAL GARRE:         Absolutely, Justice Stevens.

2    And certainly that's our position.                 We think it's --

3                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Of course, in both of the

4    cases, the job of the district judge would have been

5    made much easier if one of the defendants had filed an

6    affidavit denying those allegations, but nobody has done

7    that in either case.

8                 GENERAL GARRE:         No one did it in either

9    case, but in both cases the defendants are entitled to

10   dismissal.   I think this case is even stronger, not only

11   because we think that the factual allegations are less

12   plausible, but because we have the substantive rule of

13   law that comes from Bivens, that you have to establish

14   the affirmative link of alleged wrongdoing between much

15   lower level officials, the FBI agents in the field here.

16   And the Attorney General of the United States and the

17   Director of the FBI, common experience shows, simply

18   aren't involved in those sorts of granular decisions.

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I have two questions -- I

20   have two questions that might be related.                You began by

21   saying that you had two points for us.

22                (Laughter.)

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You said the first was

24   that the court erred in saying that there was a -- a

25   violation had been alleged.


                                       22
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1                 GENERAL GARRE:         And --

2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And I wanted to reach the

3    second, and I was wondering if the second would address

4    this sub-question that I have.              If we were to say that

5    Twombly is to be confined to the antitrust and

6    commercial context, would -- would that destroy your

7    case?

8                 GENERAL GARRE:         Well, let me answer both

9    those questions:   First, the second point I wanted to

10   add is interrelated with the first, and that's that the

11   court of appeals applied an overly expansive conception

12   of the supervisory liabilities available under Bivens.

13   And, I think, in order to evaluate the adequacy of the

14   pleadings, this Court has to have in mind the standards

15   of supervisory liability that Bivens applied.                   And we

16   think the that court of appeals applied an overly

17   expansive concept of that under Rizzo and other -- the

18   other precedents we cite in our case.

19               And second:        No, our case would not go away

20   if this Court got rid of Bell Atlantic or if this Court

21   limited Bell Atlantic to the antitrust context.                   We

22   don't think the Court should do that.                   When the Court

23   dispensed -- disavowed the broad no-set-of-facts

24   language from Conley v. Gibson, we took the Court to be

25   saying:   We are disavowing that for all cases under Rule


                                       23
                         Alderson Reporting Company

1    8; we are not limiting it to parallel conduct in the

2    section 1 of the Sherman Act context.

3                So I think that Bell Atlantic's explication

4    of Rule 8 and the disavowal of the no-set-of-facts

5    language, which, after all, is the test under which the

6    district court had to resort to, to sustain the claims

7    in this case --

8                JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I do have the same

9    lingering doubts as Justice -- or concerns or questions

10   as Justice Breyer.      It's hard for me to believe we had

11   to wait for Twombly in order to have this, and it seems

12   to me Rule 11 is not applicable here because it simply

13   works after the fact.

14               GENERAL GARRE:            Well, we don't think you had

15   to wait for Twombly to get rid of those claims.                We

16   think that many of those claims would dismiss.             They

17   certainly would have been dismissed in the section 1983

18   context under this Court's decision in Rizzo.

19               And we could talk about what it would be

20   like for claims against the president of Coca-Cola or

21   Ford Motor Company, but really we're here talking about

22   claims against the highest level officials of our

23   government, who everyone agrees are entitled to the

24   doctrine of qualified immunity, a doctrine that was

25   designed, at the end of the day, to protect the

1    effective functioning of our government.                   These

2    officials are entitled at least to the protections that

3    this Court found appropriate for civil antitrust

4    defendants.

5                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            General Garre, there was

6    a reference, I think, in Judge Gleason's decision in the

7    Eastern District to the Office of the Inspector General

8    report on the detainees' treatment at the Metropolitan

9    Detention Center.     Is there nothing in those reports

10   that lends some plausibility to Iqbal's claims?

11                 GENERAL GARRE:         We don't think so,

12   Justice Ginsburg.    I mean, most fundamentally,

13   extra-record materials, extra-complaint materials can't

14   make up for the deficiencies in the complaint itself.

15   Plaintiffs had the benefit of that 200-page report when

16   they brought their action in this case.                  They have

17   amended their complaint twice already.                   And so, in that

18   respect, they are in a much better position than the

19   typical plaintiffs.

20                 And, secondly, if you look at that report,

21   if you want to go outside the record and look at that

22   report, I would urge you to look at page 70 of the

23   report, which says that "we found" -- and I am quoting

24   from the report -- "we found that the information

25   provided to high-level officials suggested this 'hold


                                        25

1    until cleared' policy was being applied to persons

2    'suspected of being involved in the'" 9/11 attacks, a

3    perfectly lawful law enforcement program.               And it goes

4    on to say that "in practice the policy may have been

5    applied differently in the field. "

6                And the other pages I would point you to are

7    pages 18, 40, 47, and 158, which make clear that this --

8    the alleged discriminatory acts were -- were taken on an

9    ad hoc basis.   That's what the complaint in this case

10   says on page 48, where it says that FBI officials, far

11   removed from the Attorney General and the Director of

12   the FBI, were making these determinations without

13   criteria, without a uniform classification system.

14               And we think that to go back up the chain to

15   suggest that the Attorney General of the United States

16   and Director of the FBI may be potentially subject to

17   civil liability, the burdens of civil litigation goes

18   far beyond Rule 8 as it's described in Bell Atlantic,

19   far beyond this Court's qualified immunity cases.

20               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Garre, can I ask you a

21   factual question because I really don't know?              In the --

22   assume that -- that they had to go to trial on this

23   case, which may not be the case.               Would they be entitled

24   to be defended by the Department of Justice or would

25   they have to get private counsel?

1                  GENERAL GARRE:         They are being defended by

2    the Department of Justice, the -- the Attorney General

3    and Director of the FBI.

4                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           And that applies even if

5    there would be a trial later on?

6                  GENERAL GARRE:         Yes, and that's a

7    discretionary determination that has been made in this

8    case.

9                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           I see.

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is there other

11   litigation, General Garre, pending with respect to the

12   detentions?

13                 GENERAL GARRE:         Yes, there are other claims.

14   There are also claims that have been made.               And we cite

15   one of these cases, the Twitty case, which we cite in

16   our reply.

17                 This case involved a prisoner who claimed

18   that he was transferred one -- from one prison to the

19   next for a retaliatory motive.               They included a claim

20   against the Attorney General of the United States.               And

21   the district court said:          Well, under the Iqbal

22   claim that -- under the Iqbal case, that case can go

23   forward, and potentially the Attorney General can be

24   subject to civil -- to civil discovery, which I think

25   underscores Judge Cabranes's point that the decision in

1    this case is a blue point -- is a blueprint for civil

2    plaintiffs who are challenging the implementation of

3    important law enforcement policies to subject the

4    Attorney General, the Director of the FBI, or other

5    high-level officials to civil discovery based on

6    conclusory and generally -- and general and inadequate

7    allegations.    If I could --

8                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is there -- is there a

9    Tort Claims Act action pending or -- I don't know where

10   I got that impression -- arising out of these

11   detentions?

12                 GENERAL GARRE:         There are tort claims,

13   Federal Tort Claims Acts, asserted in this case, and

14   there's other parallel litigation going on in the Second

15   Circuit, Justice Ginsburg.

16                 If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, General.

18                 GENERAL GARRE:         Thank you.

20                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDER A. REINERT

21                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

22                 MR. REINERT:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

23   please the Court:

24                 I think I should start with paragraph 69 of

25   the complaint because I think Petitioners' treatment of


                                        28
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


1    paragraph 69 shows why they have no coherent theory of

2    what a conclusory allegation is and what it's not.

3    Because what does paragraph 69 do?                   It sets out a

4    policy, and it says that Petitioners approved the

5    policy.    Paragraph 96 does exactly the same thing.

6    Paragraph 69 you can find at 168 of the appendix;

7    paragraph 96 you can find at 172 to 173.

8                  In both -- in both cases it does the same

9    thing.     We have Petitioners approving a policy.                Now,

10   Petitioners here conceded at oral argument, contrary to

11   their reply brief but consistent with their opening

12   brief, that paragraph 69 states a factual allegation.

13   So if paragraph 69 states a factual allegation that is

14   entitled to be considered true, then paragraph 96 states

15   a factual allegation that is entitled to be considered

16   to be true.

17                 This isn't -- this case is not about ad hoc

18   decisions made at the low level of the Department of

19   Justice.    This is about a policy approved with the

20   knowledge of Petitioners that discriminated against

21   detainees.

22                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, General Garre said

23   there's no question that there was a policy, and that it

24   was known by and approved by the Petitioners here, but

25   that the policy is different from the policy that you

1    allege.

2                   MR. REINERT:        Well, Justice --

3                   JUSTICE ALITO:         And that's the question.

4                   Where -- what do you think is the most

5    specific allegation in your complaint as to the

6    Petitioners' knowledge and approval of the -- of an

7    illegal policy?

8                   MR. REINERT:        Well, paragraph 96

9    specifically alleges knowledge, and Rule 9(b) says you

10   can allege knowledge generally.                So that -- we have

11   established knowledge of the policy.                      The policy is

12   described between paragraphs 47 and 94 of the complaint.

13               JUSTICE ALITO:            As to paragraphs 96 and 97,

14   which did seem to be the most specific, are those based

15   on any specific information that you have concerning

16   Petitioners, or are they based on inferences that you

17   think you can draw from your allegations about what

18   happened and the nature of the responsibilities of the

19   Petitioners?

20               MR. REINERT:           They are based in -- they are

21   based in part on the Office of Inspector General's

22   report about what happened after September 11th.                      They

23   also are based on other information that we gathered in

24   advance of filing the -- the complaint.                      But, Your

25   Honors, what we think Petitioners are asking us to do

1    here --

2                JUSTICE ALITO:          I'm not sure that really

3    answered my question.      Are they based on anything

4    specific that you know about what the Petitioners did?

5                MR. REINERT:         Yes.       We know that Petitioners

6    ordered a -- ordered to have certain groups targeted for

7    questioning, for detention.            That's all in -- some of

8    that's in the Office of the Inspector General's report;

9    some of that is in public documents referred to by some

10   of the amicus briefs.      We think --

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Are you suggesting

12   General Garre's statement he just made to us -- he said

13   there's nothing in the Office of the Inspector General's

14   report that suggests that the Attorney General or the

15   head of the FBI were engaged in any wrongdoing?

16               MR. REINERT:         Oh, I don't think that's

17   correct, Your Honor.      I mean, the Office of the

18   Inspector General's report says that from the -- from

19   the Department of the Attorney General -- from the

20   Attorney General's Office, there was a direction to make

21   the conditions of confinement as harsh as possible.

22               That was -- that was directed to the -- BOP

23   Director Sawyer.   It said, we don't want them to be able

24   to get access to Johnny Cochran, for instance.             That

25   statement was made.

1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, that's a

2    little bit different -- if I could interrupt you -- than

3    saying, make the conditions of confinement as harsh as

4    possible.    It's saying, make the conditions of

5    confinement such that they will not be able to

6    communicate with alleged -- alleged -- other prisoners

7    that -- that might be part of the same group connected

8    with the activities on 9/11.

9                  MR. REINERT:         Well -- and certainly, Your

10   Honor, we have also -- I mean, we have -- this case is

11   at a funny posture, right, because we have all this

12   discovery that we have obtained since the complaint was

13   filed which, we think, confirms the allegations in this

14   complaint.

15                Now, we think Petitioners' position would

16   require us to allege facts at the complaint stage that

17   we could only obtain through discovery.                   But, Your

18   Honors, some of --

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, you -- you could have

20   said the same thing about the existence of a conspiracy

21   in -- in the antitrust case.              I mean, that was the

22   argument.    How can we prove an agreement until we have

23   discovery?

24                MR. REINERT:          Well, the difference --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:             We say you need something


                                         32

1    more in order to go forward, something more than, you

2    know, you prevented these people from talking to Johnny

3    Cochran.   That's not going to do it.

4                   MR. REINERT:        Well, but, Justice Scalia, the

5    difference between this case and Bell Atlantic is

6    exactly what Justice Souter alluded to in his colloquy

7    with General Garre, which is that in -- in Bell Atlantic

8    there were two possible -- there were two possibilities.

9    A reviewing court was basically left in equipoise,

10   looking at the complaint in Bell Atlantic.

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, there are two

12   possibilities here.       Number one is the possibility that

13   there was a general policy adopted by the high-level

14   officials which was perfectly valid and that whatever

15   distortions you are complaining about was in the

16   implementation by lower level officials.                  That's one

17   possibility.

18               The other possibility, which seems to me

19   much less plausible, is that the -- the high-level

20   officials themselves directed these -- these

21   unconstitutional and unlawful acts.

22               MR. REINERT:           Well, Your Honor, we have two

23   different theories, right.            One is knowledge of and

24   approval of, and the other is direction.

25               But those -- both of those possibilities are


                                         33
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1    unlawful possibilities.        The question is who is

2    responsible?   Now, Bell Atlantic doesn't -- doesn't

3    prohibit plaintiffs from pleading cases in the

4    alternative.   And if you are going to plead cases in the

5    alternative, it's possible, of course, that some people

6    will ultimately be held responsible and some won't.                 But

7    the --

8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Do you agree that --

9    to follow up on Justice Breyer's questioning of General

10   Garre, do you believe that the same pleading standards

11   apply in the action against the president of Coca-Cola

12   as apply to the actions of the Attorney General and

13   Director of the FBI on the evening of September 11,

14   2001?

15               MR. REINERT:         Certainly, Your Honor, I think

16   the same pleading standards apply.

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I'm sorry?

18   Certainly or certainly not?

19               MR. REINERT:         Certainly, Your Honor, I think

20   the same pleading standards apply.                 To the extent

21   Petitioners seek protection, the protection is through

22   the -- through the doctrine of qualified immunity.                 And

23   they have that protection.

24               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, why -- why isn't the

25   protection -- I have the number of the rule I want.

1    Maybe I am not understanding it.                 But Rule 26(e)(2),

2    says -- says, among other things, that the judge can

3    change the number of depositions you get.                 He could

4    reduce them to zero if, for example, he decides the

5    burden or the expense outweighs the likely benefit.

6    Can't he do that whether you are the president of Coca-

7    Cola or whether you are the president of Ford or whether

8    you are the President, or you are the Attorney General?

9                   MR. REINERT:        Well, certainly --

10               JUSTICE BREYER:              Can he do that or not?

11               MR. REINERT:           No -- Justice Breyer, yes, a

12   district court judge can do that.

13               JUSTICE BREYER:              Yes, he can.

14               MR. REINERT:           In fact, the Second Circuit

15   directed the district court to do that here.                I mean,

16   Petitioners argue as if discovery is impending against

17   them.   In fact, the Second Circuit's opinion quite

18   clearly says, you don't get discovery against

19   Petitioners unless you get discovery from lower level

20   officials that confirm the need to have discovery from

21   Petitioners.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, I mean, that's

23   lovely, that -- that the -- the ability of the Attorney

24   General and Director of the FBI to -- to do their jobs

25   without having to litigate personal liability is

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1    dependent upon the discretionary decision of a single

2    district judge.   I mean, I thought that the protection

3    of qualified immunity gave them -- gave them more than

4    that.

5                 MR. REINERT:        Your -- Your Honor, it gives

6    them quite a bit, Justice Scalia, and they got --

7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It doesn't give them much,

8    if that's all it gives them.

9                 MR. REINERT:        Well, Justice Scalia, in this

10   case what they were permitted to argue was that the law

11   was not clearly established.            They argued that; they

12   lost that.   They were permitted to argue that they were

13   -- they acted objectively reasonably.                   They argued that;

14   they lost that.   They didn't petition for cert on either

15   of those questions.     So they have been given the

16   protections afforded by qualified immunity.                  What they

17   don't get because of qualified immunity is extra

18   protections not described in the rules, not approved by

19   Congress, not referred to by this Court in any -- in any

20   way.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So the pleading

22   standard -- let's leave the president of Coca-Cola out

23   of it.   The local manager of the Coca-Cola distribution

24   center, you can state that the same rigor required in

1    Attorney General and the Director of the FBI in the wake

2    of 9/11?

3                 MR. REINERT:        Your Honor --

4    Mr. Chief Justice, the pleading standard isn't

5    different.   The substantive standard of liability may be

6    different, and that's certainly true.                   I mean, one has

7    to allege much more to allege a claim on --

8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But your -- your

9    response then focuses solely on the merits of the

10   underlying claim, not any requirement of -- of

11   heightened pleading.

12                MR. REINERT:        That's correct, Your Honor,

13   and we think that this Court has rejected heightened

14   pleading at every instance.            I mean, even in Bell

15   Atlantic, this Court rejected heightened pleading, and

16   this Court has rejected heightened pleading even in --

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well I thought --

18   and others may know better in connection to Bell

19   Atlantic, but I thought in Bell Atlantic what we said is

20   that there's a standard, but it's an affected by the

21   context in which the allegations are made.                  That was a

22   context of a particular type of antitrust violation and

23   that affected how we would look at the complaint.                  And

24   here, I think you at least accept, don't you -- or I

25   understood from your answers to the question on Coca

1    Cola that maybe you don't -- that because we're looking

2    at litigation involving the Attorney General and the

3    Director of FBI in connection with their national

4    security responsibilities, that there ought to be

5    greater rigor applied to our examination of the

6    complaint.

7                 MR. REINERT:        Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

8    there's no reference to that in the rules.                 We think

9    qualified immunity provides the protection that

10   Petitioners are seeking.         And we think what the Second

11   Circuit did was balance a very difficult -- difficult

12   principles on both sides.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Do you -- do you

14   disagree with the notion that Bell Atlantic at least

15   established that the level of pleading required depends

16   on the context of the claim -- the context of the

17   particular case?

18                MR. REINERT:        I don't -- I don't understand

19   Bell Atlantic to argue that the level of pleading

20   requires -- depends on the context of the case, but that

21   the substantive liability that is in the background of

22   the case affects what you have to plead.                 And what

23   Petitioners are asking is to take the substantive

24   background of an affirmative defense and make that

25   affect the ability -- what you have to plead, not --

1                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           But they pleaded a

2    conspiracy -- they pleaded a conspiracy in Bell

3    Atlantic.    It wasn't a matter of not -- not setting

4    forth in the complaint the substance of what produced

5    liability.    They pleaded conspiracy.

6                  MR. REINERT:        Well, what this Court --

7    Justice Scalia, what this Court said in Bell Atlantic,

8    to the extent it disregarded the allegation about

9    agreement -- it said the problem with the agreement was

10   that it didn't allege what, it didn't allege who, it

11   didn't allege when.      And I don't think it can be said

12   about this complaint.       This alleges who, this alleges

13   what it was, this alleges --

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:            When?

15                MR. REINERT:         -- when it occurred --

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Does it say when?    Does it

17   say what basis?

18                MR. REINERT:         In the weeks after September

19   11th.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't know on what basis

21   any of these allegations against the high-level

22   officials are made.

23                MR. REINERT:         Justice Scalia, they are made

3    that.

4                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Mr. Reinert --

5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           The Solicitor General

6    contests that.

7                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           I want to throw you a

8    question.   I'm not sure it's a softball question.             You

9    can --

10               (Laughter.)

11               JUSTICE SOUTER:            You can let me know.

12               I -- I'm starting with the assumption, which

13   I think is -- is in Bell Atlantic, that what we are

14   concerned with in context is that the -- the context

15   tells us how specific you've got to be versus how

16   conclusory you've got to be, and the reason it does so

17   is that some allegations are -- are more likely to be

18   true than others depending on the context.

19               Is it fair to say -- going back to Justice

20   Breyer's question, is it fair to say that your basic

21   pleading here rests on the following assumption:              That

22   it is more plausible that the Attorney General of the

23   United States and the Director of the FBI were in fact

24   directly involved in devising a policy with the racial

25   characteristics and the coercive characteristics that

1    you claim, than that the President of Coca Cola was

2    putting mouses in bottles?

3                MR. REINERT:        Well, I think that -- I think

4    that is our -- our contention, Your Honor, because it's

5    a -- it's an allegation about a policy.

6                JUSTICE SOUTER:           So you would say, if -- to

7    the Coke question you would say, yes, they've got to get

8    more facts there, this is just -- this is just crazy to

9    think that the president is putting mice in the bottles.

10               But you're saying that, so far as the close

11   involvement of the Attorney General and the FBI

12   director, it's not crazy to assume what you -- what you

13   say, and, therefore, you don't have to get into more

14   detail in order to have an adequate claim here.                Is

15   that --

16               MR. REINERT:        We certainly don't think it's

17   absurd or bizarre, which is the argument that the

18   Petitioners raised below --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But that's also not

20   the --

21               MR. REINERT:        I'm sorry.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Absurd and bizarre

23   is also not the pleading standard, and how are we -- to

24   follow up on Justice Souter's question -- how are we

25   supposed to judge whether we think it's more unlikely

1    that the president of Coca-Cola would take certain

2    actions as opposed to the Attorney General of the United

3    States?

4                 MR. REINERT:         I think it is a problem posed

5    by that interpretation of Bell Atlantic.                 I don't think

6    it's a problem that's posed by this particular case, Mr.

7    Chief Justice.   I think --

8                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Of course, the problem

9    with the president of the Coca-Cola is the allegation

10   probably would be that the Coca-Cola Company has adopted

11   sloppy procedures in its manufacturing lines, and the

12   president is responsible for those procedures, and

13   that's why the bottles are filled with rats.

14                MR. REINERT:         Well --

15                JUSTICE STEVENS:            That's the way you would

16   allege it.   You wouldn't say he did it personally.

17                MR. REINERT:         Well, Justice Stevens --

18                JUSTICE STEVENS:            And then you would have a

19   similar question.

20                MR. REINERT:         You probably wouldn't say he

21   did it personally, and there might be a respondeat

22   superior theory there, for liability, that we don't have

23   access to in the Bivens arena, which we concede; we have

24   to establish a link between the unconstitutional conduct

25   and -- and the actions of the Petitioners.                So that may

1    be how it's pleaded, and that might get it closer if

2    there were -- certainly if there were a policy of

3    putting mice in Coke bottles, that would certainly get

4    it closer.

5                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           No, this is a policy of

6    being derelict in the sanitary conditions in the plant

7    and so forth and so on; therefore, mice -- mice are

8    getting into bottles with undue frequency, and the

9    president is responsible for that.                 I don't see that

10   that's a fanciful allegation.

11                MR. REINERT:        It -- I -- I don't know that

12   it is fanciful, Justice Stevens.               I think --

13                JUSTICE STEVENS:           I'm not suggesting that

14   Coca-Cola really does that.            Of course not, but --

15                MR. REINERT:        No, certainly not.

16                (Laughter.)

17                JUSTICE STEVENS:           But the standard theory is

18   that --

19                MR. REINERT:        I think -- I mean, the

20   essential point in this case is that the Second Circuit

21   was faced with a dilemma.          I mean, there's a liberal

22   pleading standard and there's qualified immunity.                And

23   the Second Circuit tried to resolve it, did I think a

24   very good job of resolving it with the interests -- all

25   of the interests that Petitioners are concerned about.

1    They were --

2                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, they weren't "all"

3    completely -- they were not --

4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I was just going to

5    say the -- the difficulty with wrestling with the case

6    through the perspective of the hypothetical of the mice

7    in the bottles is that it's -- it's by its nature

8    particularly absurd, but what if the allegation is that

9    the president of Coca Cola is individually involved in a

10   particular price-fixing scheme?              Then does this case

11   seem so terribly different from the level of specificity

12   Bell Atlantic would require?

13                MR. REINERT:        Well, I guess I want to

14   distinguish that allegation from the allegations here.

15   We are not alleging that the Petitioners individually

16   identified particular detainees as of interest or as of

17   high interest.   We are alleging that they either created

18   the policy or they knew of and approved of it.

19                Now -- now, we could talk about "knew of and

20   approved."   As I said, under Rule 9(b), "knew of" is

21   established by a saying that they knew it; we can't read

22   9(b) any other way, and Petitioners don't suggest that

23   we do.

24                So then we have "approved."                Now, if they

25   knew it, right, if we accept that they knew about this


                                       44

1    policy, and we also accept paragraph 69 as Petitioners

2    concede we must accept it to be true, then we know that

3    they knew that there was this policy occurring and they

4    approved the policy of not releasing them --

5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But that's easy.   I

6    hope that the Attorney General and the Director of FBI

7    -- of the FBI knew of and approved whatever the policy

8    was.   What you have to show is some facts, or at least

9    what you have to allege are some facts, showing that

10   they knew of a policy that was discriminatory --

11               MR. REINERT:         Yes.

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 -- based on

13   ethnicity and country of origin.

14               MR. REINERT:         And I think I was -- I was

15   trying to get there, Mr. Chief Justice, and the way I

16   would say it is this:      We've alleged that they knew, in

17   paragraph 96, that the policy was discriminatory.

18   That's clearly alleged in paragraph 96.                 We've also

19   alleged that they approved the policy.

20               The link -- to the extent that approval is

21   not sufficient for this Court, the link between approval

22   in 96 and an allegation is paragraph 69, because if they

23   knew that these individuals were being detained in

24   restrictive conditions of confinement because of their

25   race, religion, and national origin, as we alleged in


                                       45
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1    96, and they also approved that they should not be

2    released until cleared, then they are approving them

3    being held in restrictive conditions of confinement

4    based upon race, religion, and national origin.

5                 JUSTICE BREYER:           No, but they didn't -- that

6    isn't what 96 says.     What 96 says, which I think is

7    important, is it says that they knew of and agreed to

8    subject the plaintiffs to these harsh conditions solely

9    on account of their religion, race, and national origin,

10   and for no legitimate penological interest.                  Because, if

11   they are looking for suspects from 9/11, given the

12   people they found, it's not surprising that they might

13   look for people who looked like Arabs.                  All right?   That

14   isn't surprising to me, because that was what the

15   suspects looked like.

16                So, they want to say, yes, that was part of

17   it, but it's not for no legitimate penological interest;

18   it was for every good reason:             We didn't want more bombs

19   to go off.

20                Now, suppose that's their view.                 Suppose

21   also -- I'm just hypothetically -- they never, and they

22   know this, ever had a conversation where they said, go

23   look for people of Arabic descent alone.                  They never

24   said that.   They said, look for those people who have

25   other connections and had something we reasonably

1    believe is 9/11-connected; they might be dangerous.

2    Suppose that's what they thought.               So they read this,

3    and they think, Judge, I want to tell Judge that you

4    have no evidence to show anything other than what I just

5    said, which sounds as if it might be reasonably

6    connected to the 9/11 investigation.                   What is open to

7    our two defendants, if you win this case?                   If they're

8    right, how do they prevent lots of depositions from

9    coming in and taking their time?              How do they prevent

10   this case dragging on and taking their time?                  If the

11   facts are what I just said, rather than what you think?

12               MR. REINERT:        Well, Justice Breyer, if those

13   are the facts, then those are facts that have to be

14   established through discovery.             They cannot be

15   established at the pleading stage.                I would think we

16   could all agree on that.        And that's their -- and they

17   can do that through discovery.

18               Now, at the pleading stage, if they don't

19   want to file an answer and deny the facts, they can move

20   to dismiss on qualified-immunity grounds as they have.

21               JUSTICE BREYER:           They'll -- they'll deny the

22   facts; then you'll say there's a factual matter.                  And

23   suppose hypothetically -- not what you think -- but you

24   have no reason at all hypothetically, imagine, for

25   believing that they did this solely for racial reasons

1    unrelated to the investigation of 9/11.                     Suppose you

2    don't have any information that shows that, and they are

3    going to say everything else is covered by qualified

4    immunity, and you have nothing else.                      Then what do they

5    do to get out of 10 years of discovery?

6                   MR. REINERT:        Well, the Second Circuit gives

7    a clear path for defendants in that situation,

8    Justice Breyer, and the answer is, if you want to make a

9    Rule 12(e) motion, make it; it was referred to in

10   Crawford-El.    But, more importantly, we don't get

11   discovery of them.      We don't get to drag them through

12   discovery unless --

13                JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I just interrupt?

14   There are a whole bunch of other defendants in this

15   case.   As I understand it, they're still in the case.

16                MR. REINERT:          That's correct.

17                JUSTICE STEVENS:             So you do have discovery

18   of maybe 25 to 30 officials who would have a lot of

19   information about this case.              It seems to me it's

20   entirely possible that you could either postpone

21   discovery and dismiss the two principal defendants for

22   now and then bring them in later, if the facts you

23   develop from the other discovery would prove what you

24   have alleged.

25                MR. REINERT:          Well, as to postponing

1    discovery, that's exactly what the Second Circuit

2    directed the district court to do.                   So that's been done,

3    Your Honor.

4                   As to dismissing them and re-filing later,

5    the problem with that is there could be a statute of

6    limitations problem, and that -- so that's just not a

7    solution.     I mean, that's -- that was a solution that

8    might result ultimately in absolute immunity in these

9    kinds of cases.

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What is the statute of

11   limitations that would apply?

12                 MR. REINERT:         It's 3 years here, Your Honor.

13   And so we've -- we've obtained discovery.                  Now, if it

14   had been -- if this --

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You have -- you have not

16   had discovery from the Attorney General or --

17                 MR. REINERT:         Certainly not.

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So --

19                 MR. REINERT:         Certainly not.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So it's -- it's as though

21   discovery with respect to those two defendants was

22   stayed pending your discovery from the lower level

23   defendants?

24                 MR. REINERT:         In fact, it has been formally

25   stayed, Justice Ginsburg --

1                   JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Has it?

2                   MR. REINERT:        And the Second Circuit's

3    decision confirms that.          I mean, the --

4                   JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, that may be what

5    happened here, but if -- if the Second Circuit is

6    affirmed, there may be other suits that are like this.

7    And what is the protection of the high-level official

8    with qualified immunity with respect to discovery if the

9    -- the official cannot get dismissal under qualified

10   immunity at the 12(b)(6) stage?                How many district

11   judges are there in the country?                 Over 600?   One of the

12   district judges has a very aggressive idea about what

13   the discovery should be.           What's the protection there?

14               MR. REINERT:           Well, if this Court --

15               JUSTICE ALITO:            It's a discretionary

16   decision, interlocutory discretionary decision by the

17   trial judge.

18               MR. REINERT:           Well, if -- Justice Alito, if

19   this Court in affirming the Second Circuit outlines and

20   says the Second Circuit took the proper steps -- this is

21   what the district court should do -- then if any

22   district court disregards that, then there could be a

23   petition for mandamus.         And that's -- and I think courts

24   of appeals would respect this Court's opinion if this

25   Court said, look, here's the dilemma, here's the best

1    way to resolve it.

2                I do want to make a point about the -- I do

3    want to make one jurisdictional point, Your Honor --

4    Your Honors, and that is, if Petitioners had raised

5    these arguments in the context of a motion to dismiss

6    for failure to state a claim, and they had lost, we

7    wouldn't be here today, right?                There would be no

8    jurisdiction.   And Johnson v. Jones, I think, makes

9    clear that you can't bootstrap jurisdiction by referring

10   to qualified immunity.

11               And, in fact, if you look at Petitioners'

12   Notice of Motion to Dismiss, point 1 is dismiss for

13   qualified immunity; point 2 is dismiss because it does

14   not sufficiently allege personal involvement.               That is,

15   in their notice of motion itself, they separated out

16   these two issues.

17               Now, in their briefing at all the lower

18   courts and in this Court, they've elided them.               But our

19   position on -- on jurisdiction is that there is no --

20   there is no appellate jurisdiction to -- to deal with

21   this question, and in fact Petitioners' own motion

22   suggests that these two issues are separable and that

23   the only issue here is whether or not clearly

24   established law applied and the objective reasonableness

25   of Petitioners' conduct.           And that, we think, is another

1    way of resolving the case.

2                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            May I ask you this

3    question?    And -- and I ask it, you know, mindful of

4    what you've just said, but I -- I'm not sure that the

5    two issues can be kept as -- as separated as you

6    suggest.

7                 Another avenue to responding to the problem,

8    I think, that Justice Breyer's last hypo raised would be

9    as follows -- and then I'll tell you the difficulty that

10   I have with it, and I was going ask you to comment on

11   the difficulty.

12                He said that the -- the allegation -- one

13   way to read the allegation, and I think a fair way, is

14   to say that the Attorney General and the Director of the

15   FBI devised a policy and condoned the implementation of

16   a policy that was based on racial and religious grounds

17   with no penological purpose.             Well, under the

18   circumstances of immediate post-9/11, it is not

19   surprising necessarily that they -- they devised a

20   policy that had reference to religion and national

21   origin and so on, given what we knew about the

22   hijackers.

23                What is not so easy to accept, as a matter

24   of adequate pleading, is the claim that there was no

25   penological interest involved in the decision of how


                                        52
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


1    to and how long to hold the individuals who were picked

2    up.

3                 One answer to that, which I think is -- is

4    in your pleadings, is that you refer to specific

5    individuals and in particular to your own client, who

6    was in the position of being held under these conditions

7    for a considerable period of time, and it turns out

8    there's -- there's no indication that there was

9    ultimately a justified penological interest.

10                So that might be your answer to

11   Justice Breyer's question.           There's enough in here about

12   specific detentions to make it plausible for pleading

13   standards that they were being held without any

14   penological interest.

15                The difficulty I have with that line of

16   thinking is this:    You also allege in there that lower

17   level officials were making decisions on an ad hoc basis

18   without adequate criteria as to -- as to how they should

19   make them.   And that particular line of allegations

20   suggests that what was really going on here, including

21   what was happening to your client, wasn't the result of

22   -- of clear policy decisions made by the Attorney

23   General and the Director of the FBI, but they -- they

24   were just being scattered.           So, what in the context of

25   your whole pleading makes it adequate simply to charge


                                        53

1    on a conclusory basis that these two defendants were

2    devising a policy that had -- that was intended to have

3    an effect of no penological interest?

4                 MR. REINERT:        Well, Your Honor,

5    Justice Souter, I do think that in this way the OIG

6    report is very instructive.            It basically confirms that

7    none of the folks who were held as of interest or as

8    high interest were ever charged or suspected of being

9    involved in terrorism.       That was well over 700 people.

10   As for paragraph 48 --

11                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Did -- you'll have to help

12   me out.   Did you allege that?

13                MR. REINERT:        We alleged that many -- like

14   many -- plaintiffs, like many detainees, were held for

15   no reason.

16                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Okay.       That's what you're

17   saying --

18                MR. REINERT:        That's what we alleged.

19                And in paragraph 48, I just want to say that

20   does not support the view that there was no racial

21   criteria here.   What it -- paragraph 48 is immediately

22   followed by paragraph 49, which says the classifications

23   were made because of race.          Paragraph 48 is saying the

24   distinction between "of interest" and "of high interest"

25   was totally arbitrary.       But that's just a way of saying


                                       54

1    that this was a racial classification policy.                     It was a

2    racial classification policy that resulted in harsh

3    conditions of confinement for our client and for many

4    individuals.    And now we have alleged Petitioners'

5    connection to that.      You know, we could say --

6                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Are you -- are you saying

7    that the -- that the claim that there was no penological

8    interest for certain decisions goes simply to the

9    distinction between the decision whether to classify as

10   "of interest" versus as "of high interest"?

11               MR. REINERT:          No, Your Honor, I think

12   it's -- I think it's very difficult for us to say in a

13   complaint anything other than no -- no legitimate

14   penological interest, because we couldn't go through the

15   complaint proving all the negatives.                     The fact is our

16   client posed no threat that connected to 9/11.                     We

17   alleged that.   We alleged that's true of multiple

18   detainees, and we think that's sufficient to say that

19   there was no penological interest.                  Now, Petitioner --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Is -- is no penological

21   interest enough?

22               MR. REINERT:          Oh --

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I mean, is that the only

24   basis -- after an attack on the country of the magnitude

25   of 9/11, is that the only basis on which people could be

1    held?   Namely that these people are the -- are the

2    guilty culprits, and we are going to put them in jail?

3                 MR. REINERT:        Well --

4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Surely for at least a

5    period, you can hold people just -- just to investigate?

6                 MR. REINERT:        Well, Justice Scalia, I don't

7    think for a period it's constitutional to hold them

8    solely based on their race, religion, and national

9    origin.   And if it is --

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, it wasn't solely on

11   that.

12                MR. REINERT:        Well, that is the allegation.

13   If it is, that's an issue to be dealt on the merits,

14   exactly as this Court did in Johnson v. California.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:           But the net was surely not

16   cast wide enough if anybody with that race, religion was

17   -- was swept in.

18                MR. REINERT:        Well --

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I mean, if it's solely for

20   that reason, there would have been hundreds of thousands

21   of others.

22                MR. REINERT:        Justice Scalia, that is the

23   allegation in the complaint, that as individuals were

24   encountered --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- implausible.

1                 MR. REINERT:        We respectfully disagree with

2    -- about that, Justice Scalia.              But I would say

3    that with --

4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Wasn't it limited to

5    people who were already indicted on other charges?

6                 MR. REINERT:        These were people --

7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            We're not dealing with

8    the universe of men who are of a certain national

9    origin; we are dealing with only ones who were

10   incarcerated for an offense that has nothing to do with

11   terrorism.

12                MR. REINERT:        Justice Ginsburg, these were

13   individuals who were swept up either in the immigration

14   detention system or in the justice criminal detention

15   system, and that's where the classification was made.

16   But -- but I -- I do --

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm sorry -- swept

18   up?   You mean they were in -- in prison because they had

19   violated immigration and other laws, right?

20                MR. REINERT:        That's correct,

21   Mr. Chief Justice, that's correct.                 We don't dispute

22   that.

23                But I think this Court's decision in Johnson

24   v. California and in Parents Involved is instructive,

25   because there the Court says, look, if there is a racial


                                       57
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1    classification, it has to be judged under strict

2    scrutiny.   And even in Johnson v. California, where the

3    Court said the State's power was at its apex, which is

4    in the context of their prisons, and even where there is

5    an argument that we have gang violence -- we know that

6    racial identity goes to gang violence to some extent --

7    still the State was put to its burden of proof of a

8    compelling State interest, and even though that was a

9    case that involved damages, it was a qualified immunity

10   case.

11                And Johnson v. California is in many

12   respects no different from this case.                   Yes, the 9/11

13   context makes a difference, and Petitioners were able to

14   rely -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You can finish.

16                MR. REINERT:        The Petitioners were allowed

17   to rely on the 9/11 context in making their argument

18   about qualified immunity, about the objective

19   reasonableness of their conduct, and about whether the

20   law was clearly established.            But that does not mean --

21   thank you, Your Honor.

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

1                 GENERAL GARRE:           Thank you, Mr. Chief

2    Justice.   And, first, let me clarify the record on

3    discoveries.

4                 The Second Circuit didn't hold that

5    discovery could not go forward against these

6    Petitioners.   It held that the district court might --

7    that's the word it used on page 67a of the petition

8    appendix -- postpone or limit discovery.                  So --

9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But it -- it did happen?

10   At least it did --

11               GENERAL GARRE:            To the grace of the district

12   court, that's right, and I think Judge Cabranes

13   emphasized the -- the concerns of potentially vexatious

14   discovery in this context, and we certainly

15   wholeheartedly agree with that.

16               Second, I think Mr. Reinert made an

17   important concession when he acknowledged that

18   substantive standards of law affect what you have to

19   plead.   And here there are two substantive standards --

20   two substantive issues that are key.

21               One is the standard for supervisory

22   liability under Bivens, which requires that the

23   plaintiff show an affirmative link between the

24   wrongdoing alleged by lower level officials and the

25   potential wrongdoing on the part of higher level

1    officials like the Attorney General.                      The complaint in

2    this case has no subsidiary facts on which a reasonable

3    person could affirm that kind of affirmative link.

4                 And, second, the -- the Attorney General is

5    much different than the president of Coca-Cola in that

6    he is entitled to a presumption of regularity of his

7    actions.   So that -- that standard itself ought to

8    affect how one views the complaint.

9                 JUSTICE STEVENS:             Mr. Garre, I just wanted

10   to -- would you say that the -- the Attorney General

11   might be subject to taking a deposition, even if he's

12   not a defendant?

13               GENERAL GARRE:            Certainly we would -- we

14   would oppose that.      It's conceivable they could try to

15   get that discovery.

16               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Is there any -- some

17   standard rule of law that government officials don't

18   have to testify at proceedings?

19               GENERAL GARRE:            I don't know that there is

20   that standard, Your Honor.            The same concerns --

21               JUSTICE STEVENS:              I certainly didn't think

22   there was when I wrote Clinton v. Jones.

23               (Laughter.)

24               GENERAL GARRE:            Fair enough, Your Honor.

25               But certainly, you know, when we think they

1    are parties to the case the potential demands of civil

2    discovery and the burdens of civil litigation are much

3    greater.     Third --

4                   JUSTICE BREYER:              And the reason you can't

5    make this argument under 26(b)(2)(C) is?

6                   GENERAL GARRE:            Well, we are in the realm of

7    discovery, and we are in the realm of relying on the

8    district court --

9                   JUSTICE BREYER:              The judge there is supposed

10   to weigh burdens versus desirability of going forward.

11   And so why don't you make this argument right at that

12   point?   If you are right you win; if not, you lose.

13                 GENERAL GARRE:             For the reason this Court

14   gave in Bell Atlantic:            We don't rely on district court

15   judges to weed out potentially meritless claims through

16   discovery.    We apply faithfully the pleading standards.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:               If you are right, you win

18   assuming you get a district judge who is also right.

19                 GENERAL GARRE:             Right.

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:               And that's also true, I

21   guess, of complaints, and every other legal question.

22                 GENERAL GARRE:             We think that Bell Atlantic

23   answers that question correctly, Your Honor.

24                 Third, context does matter.                    The Chief

25   Justice is right about that.                 In evaluating the claim,


                                            61

1    you have to look at the context in which it arises.

2    Here the fact it arises in the qualified immunity

3    context with respect to high-level officials is very

4    important.   The higher up the chain of command you go,

5    the less plausible it is that the high-level official

6    like the Attorney General is going to be aware of and

7    know about the sort of microscopic decisions here:

8    mistreatment in the Federal detention facility in

9    Brooklyn, alleged discriminatory applications made by

10   FBI agents in the field.

11                These are not matters that one would

12   plausibly assume the Attorney General of the United

13   States has time out of his busy day to concern himself

14   with.   The Second Circuit decision should be reversed.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, General

16   Garre --

17                GENERAL GARRE:         Thank you.

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- Mr. Reinert.

19                The case is submitted.

21   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
