 4   first this morning in Case 10-553, Hosanna-Tabor

 5   Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. The Equal

 6   Employment Opportunity Commission.

 7               Mr. Laycock.

 8               ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS LAYCOCK

 9                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10               MR. LAYCOCK:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11   please the Court:

12               The churches do not set the criteria for

13   selecting or removing the officers of government, and

14   government does not set the criteria for selecting or

15   removing officers of the church.             That's a bedrock

16   principle, and these Respondents would repudiate it.

17   They no longer seriously argue that Cheryl Perich was

18   not a minister.    Instead, they argue that even people

19   who are indisputably ministers can sue their churches on

20   claims that turn on their qualifications, their job

21   performance, and the rules of ministry.                They would --

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Laycock, would you

23   clarify one point?     You say the church decides who's

24   qualified to be a minister, but, as I understand the

25   facts here, she was never decommissioned as a minister,


                                       3

 1   and, beyond that, she was even recommended by the


 2   officials to other parishes to be a commissioned


 3   minister.    So, it's -- it's odd to say there's any


 4   interferences with who is qualified to be a minister,


 5   because the church was holding her out as being

 6   qualified.

 7                 MR. LAYCOCK:      Well, she was removed from her

 8   ministry at Hosanna-Tabor.          They do not have to indulge

 9   in a vendetta against her and file charges with the

10   synod.   And if you look at that recommendation -- it's

11   in the joint appendix -- it is not much of a

12   recommendation.    There's excellent, commendable,

13   proficient, and in ministry qualities, she gets

14   proficient.    We all know if there's a 5, a 4, and a 3, a

15   3 isn't very good.

16                 So, they were not recommending her; they

17   simply weren't pursuing formal charges against her

18   before the -- before the Missouri Synod.           And -- and the

19   problems they had were most severe at Hosanna-Tabor.             In

20   another congregation that didn't know this history, she

21   might have been able to be effective again.           That was

22   for them to decide.      They make their own calls.

23                 But she was removed at Hosanna-Tabor, which

24   was where the problem was.

25                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Counsel, most of the

 1   circuits have recognized a ministerial exception.             But

 2   they've, in one form or another, created a pretext

 3   exception.   The reason for that is the situation that

 4   troubles me.    How about a teacher who reports sexual

 5   abuse to the government and is fired because of that

 6   reporting?

 7                  Now, we know from the news recently that

 8   there was a church whose religious beliefs centered

 9   around sexually exploiting women and, I believe,

10   children.    Regardless of whether it's a religious belief

11   or not, doesn't society have a right at some point to

12   say certain conduct is unacceptable, even if religious

13   -- smoking peyote?     And once we say that's unacceptable,

14   can and why shouldn't we protect the people who are

15   doing what the law requires, i.e., reporting it?

16                  So, how do we deal with that situation under

17   your theory?    Under your theory, nothing survives if the

18   individual is a minister, no claim, private claim.

19                  MR. LAYCOCK:     I think if you look at the

20   court of appeals cases, they have not indulged in

21   pretext inquiries for ministers.             The case you present

22   is obviously a difficult case, and I would say two

23   things:   We think the appropriate rule should be the

24   government could do many things to force reporting, to

25   penalize people who don't report, but a discharge claim


                                       5

 1   by a minister presents the question why she was

 2   discharged, and the court should stay out of that.

 3               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         The problem with that is

 4   that it doesn't take account of the societal interest in

 5   encouraging the reporting.       And, in fact, if we -- if we

 6   define the ministerial exception in the way you want, we

 7   take away the incentive for reporting; we actually do

 8   the opposite of what society needs.

 9               MR. LAYCOCK:     I understand that concern, and

10   that was my second point, that if you want to carve out

11   an exception for cases like child abuse where the

12   government's interest is in protecting the child, not an

13   interest in protecting the minister, when you get such a

14   case, we think you could carve out that exception.

15               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         How?     Give me a

16   theoretical framework for this.

17               MR. LAYCOCK:     The -- first you have to

18   identify the government's interest in regulation.           If

19   the government's interest is in protecting ministers

20   from discrimination, we are squarely within the heart of

21   the ministerial exception.

22               If the government's interest is something

23   quite different from that, like protecting the children,

24   then you can assess whether that government interest is

25   sufficiently compelling to justify interfering with the


                                    6

 1   relationship between the church and its ministers.               But

 2   the government's interest is at its nadir when the claim

 3   is:   We want to protect these ministers as such.            We

 4   want to tell the churches what criteria they should

 5   apply for -- for selecting and removing ministers.

 6                JUSTICE ALITO:         Mr. Laycock, the ministerial

 7   exception is not something new.             It has been widely

 8   recognized, as Justice Sotomayor mentioned, by the

 9   courts of appeals going back 40 years.             So, we can see

10   how the recognition of this exception within -- with

11   certain contours has worked out.             And how has it worked

12   out over those past 40 years?             Have there been a great

13   many cases, a significant number of cases, involving the

14   kinds of things that Justice Sotomayor is certainly

15   rightly concerned about, instances in which ministers

16   have been fired for reporting criminal violations and

17   that sort of thing?

18                MR. LAYCOCK:       The only -- I'm not aware of

19   any such case.   The one case I am aware of cuts the

20   other way.   A minister, a priest accused of sexually

21   abusing children who was fired, sued to get his job

22   back, and the church invoked the ministerial exception,

23   and that case ended.      They were able to get rid of him.

24                There is a cert petition pending in which a

25   teacher with a long series of problems in her school


                                       7

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   called the police about an allegation of sexual abuse

 2   that did not happen at the school, did not involve a

 3   student of the school, did not involve a parent at the

 4   school, someplace else; and -- and called the police and

 5   had them come interview a student without any

 6   communication with -- with her principal.               And the

 7   respondents tried to spin that as a case of discharge

 8   for reporting sexual abuse.           But if you look at the

 9   facts, it's really quite different.               And those are the

10   only two cases I'm aware of that even approach touching

11   on this problem.

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But here what we have is a

13   claim of retaliation, so that she can't even get a

14   hearing.   So, we can look at the various tests that are

15   proposed here, and I think it's difficult to formulate

16   the tests, but this can't even be -- be litigated

17   because she is discharged.         The allegation is that

18   there's a retaliation for even asking for a hearing

19   where these tests could -- could be applied.

20                MR. LAYCOCK:      Well, she can't get a hearing

21   in civil court.    She could have had a hearing in the

22   synod before decisionmakers who would have been

23   independent of the local church.            This Court has

24   repeatedly said churches can create tribunals for the

25   governance of their officers.            The churches --

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Again, that -- that could

 2   be an argument you could make in the -- in the pretext

 3   hearing.

 4                 MR. LAYCOCK:     Well, it's an argument we make

 5   in the hearing on whether the ministerial exception

 6   applies.    You know --

 7                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But you're asking for an

 8   exemption so these issues can't even be tried.

 9                 MR. LAYCOCK:     Well, we're asking to apply

10   the exemption --

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It's almost like a summary

12   -- like a summary judgment argument.

13                 MR. LAYCOCK:     It was precisely a motion

14   for --

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And that's the -- that's

16   the analogy, I think.

17                 MR. LAYCOCK:     It was a motion for summary

18   judgment.

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           No, no, no.   What she is

20   saying is that you basically gave me summary judgment;

21   you didn't allow me to go to the agency to have a proper

22   test applied.   The summary judgment was just an analogy.

23   Forget it.

24                 (Laughter.)

25                 MR. LAYCOCK:     I'm not entirely sure I

 1   understand the question.      We agree she couldn't go to

 2   civil court if she's a minister.           She could have gone to

 3   the synod.   She wasn't cut off from that.             She decided

 4   not to do it.

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But I'm saying if there

 6   are some substantial interests the church has that can

 7   be litigated in EEOC hearing.           She was fired simply for

 8   asking for a hearing.

 9                MR. LAYCOCK:     I understand that.           But once

10   you start to litigate these cases --

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:         I think your point is that

12   it's -- it's none of the business of the government to

13   decide what the substantial interest of the church is.

14                MR. LAYCOCK:     That's one of my points, maybe

15   the most important of my points.           These -- these

16   decisions are committed to the churches by separation of

17   church and state, but -- but beyond that, once the --

18   this process of trying to identify, we can decide some

19   issues in this case and we won't get to other issues in

20   this case doesn't work.      As Justice Breyer said in a

21   First Circuit opinion, that requires more and more

22   finely spun distinctions that create entanglement rather

23   than avoid it, Universidad de Bayamon.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Counsel, you

25   referred to the ministerial exception, but, of course,

 1   your position extends beyond ministers.                How do we --

 2   how do we decide who's covered by the ministerial

 3   exception and who is not?

 4                 MR. LAYCOCK:      Right.        Here I think it's very

 5   easy.    She's a commissioned minister in the church.                She

 6   holds ecclesiastical office.              She teaches the religion

 7   class.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, let's say it's

 9   a teacher who teaches only purely secular subjects but

10   leads the class in grace before lunch.                Is that somebody

11   who would be covered by the ministerial exception?

12                 MR. LAYCOCK:      The lower courts have said

13   that person is not covered.            And we are not challenging

14   that rule.    Obviously, there has to be some kind of

15   quantitative threshold.        There will be line-drawing

16   problems.    But --

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But I thought your

18   position would be if she's a commissioned minister, as

19   distinguished from a teacher who conducts grace or takes

20   the class to chapel.      I'm -- I take it the Chief is

21   asking for somebody in this -- that you categorize as a

22   minister, although mostly she's a math teacher.                You

23   would say the extent of her religious duties don't

24   matter; what counts is that she is commissioned as a

25   minister.

 1                  MR. LAYCOCK:     If she's commissioned as a

 2   minister and if that is not a sham, then we think that

 3   makes her a minister.       If you have a Jesuit teaching

 4   physics, we think he is still a priest.                And he's still

 5   controlled by the ministerial exception.

 6                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         Can we try whether it's a

 7   sham?   I thought you said we couldn't try whether it's a

 8   sham.

 9                  MR. LAYCOCK:     Well --

10                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         Is a sham different from a

11   pretext?

12                  (Laughter.)

13                  MR. LAYCOCK:     Well, I -- I certainly meant

14   something different from a pretext.                A sham is more

15   extreme, and it goes to a different point in the

16   analysis.   You can decide whether she's really a

17   minister.   That's the threshold question that courts

18   must decide.    And if we have a person with a ministerial

19   title who is doing nothing at all religious or

20   ministerial, we have a church that tries to say everyone

21   who ever worked for us or ever may is a minister, the

22   courts can deal with those cases if they --

23                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         So, you would allow the --

24   the government courts to probe behind the church's

25   assertion that this person is a minister?                You would

 1   allow that, right?    But once it is determined that the

 2   person is a minister, you would not allow the government

 3   to decide whether the firing was a pretext?

 4                 MR. LAYCOCK:     That's right.

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, different

 6   churches have different ideas about who's a minister.

 7   There are some churches who think all of our adherents

 8   are ministers of our faith.           Now, does that mean that

 9   everybody who's a member of that church qualifies as a

10   minister because that is part of the church's belief?

11                 MR. LAYCOCK:     I don't -- I don't think it

12   means that.    And, again, I -- I think courts have some

13   capacity to look at what this employee is actually

14   doing, and if he's not performing any of the functions

15   of a religious leader, if he's not teaching the faith,

16   then --

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Every one of our

18   adherents stands as a witness to our beliefs.               And

19   that -- you know, not every church is hierarchical in

20   terms of different offices.

21                 MR. LAYCOCK:     I understand that.           And lay

22   people in many churches are expected to be witnesses,

23   right.    So --

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Lay people in many --

25                 MR. LAYCOCK:     Lay people have to be

 1   witnesses.    The fact that you're expected to witness to

 2   the faith when the occasion arises doesn't make you --

 3   doesn't make you a minister.

 4                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But the answer you gave to

 5   the Chief Justice seems to me to be this case.               I was

 6   interested.   I didn't know about this -- this minister

 7   capacity in this particular church.               And as the Chief

 8   Justice indicates, many churches don't have -- some

 9   churches don't have what we think of as professional or

10   full-time ministers at all.           They're all ministers.

11                 MR. LAYCOCK:     Right.

12                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And you said, well, that

13   -- that can be litigated, that can be investigated.               And

14   I suppose when we do that we say, how many secular

15   functions do you perform?        And that's what this case is.

16   But you don't -- you don't even want that issue to be

17   tried.   You say that issue can't even be explored.

18                 MR. LAYCOCK:     How -- you know, how many

19   religious functions you perform can be explored.               The

20   issue that can be explored is whether she's a minister.

21   We think she clearly is.       The issue --

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         And that term is a legal

23   term.    What constitutes a minister is -- is decided by

24   the law, not by the church, right?

25                 MR. LAYCOCK:     That is correct.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Okay.

 2                MR. LAYCOCK:     That is correct.

 3                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Is that correct?

 4                JUSTICE ALITO:       But I thought with a lot of

 5   deference to the church's understanding of whether

 6   someone is a minister.

 7                MR. LAYCOCK:     We think there should be

 8   deference to good-faith understandings, but we are not

 9   arguing for a rule that would enable an organization to

10   fraudulently declare that everyone is a minister when

11   it's not true.   You decided the Tony Alamo case 20 years

12   ago.   We're not defending that.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:         What makes it not true?

14   What is the legal definition of "minister"?          What is it?

15   That you have to lead the congregation in their

16   religious services or what?          What is it?

17                MR. LAYCOCK:     We think -- we think you -- if

18   you teach the doctrines of the faith, if that is part of

19   your job responsibilities, to teach the doctrines of the

20   faith, we think you're a minister.

21                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, does that mean that

22   any religious teacher is a minister under your theory?

23   So, you know, there may be teachers in religious schools

24   who teach religious subjects, not mathematics, but are

25   not ordained or commissioned in any way as ministers.

 1   Are they ministers?

 2               MR. LAYCOCK:        If you're ordained or

 3   commissioned, that makes it very easy.              If you teach the

 4   religion class, you teach an entire class on religion,

 5   we think you ought to be within this rule.

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought that it was

 7   part of -- it was agreed that there was no fact dispute

 8   that what she did, her duties at the school, did not

 9   change from when she was a contract teacher, and

10   therefore not a minister, and then she takes courses and

11   is qualified to become a minister, but what she's doing

12   at the school is the very same thing.              And I thought

13   that was the basis for the -- the decision that we're

14   reviewing, that there was no difference at all in what

15   she did before she was commissioned and after she was

16   commissioned.

17               MR. LAYCOCK:        That -- that's what the Sixth

18   Circuit said.   What they -- what -- you know, I don't

19   think that changes the nature of the functions that were

20   being performed.   But what's relevant to that, that they

21   neglected was these noncommissioned -- these teachers

22   who were not commissioned ministers, the lay and

23   contract teachers, were fill-ins only when no called

24   teacher was available, and Perich identifies only one

25   person for 1 year.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But you're isolating one

 2   parish, but there was something in one of these briefs

 3   that said the majority of the teachers in the Lutheran

 4   schools -- let's see where it was.              I think it was --

 5               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           While Justice Ginsburg is

 6   looking, I had -- I had the same impression, that

 7   whether you're commissioned or not commissioned doesn't

 8   necessarily mean you can't teach a religious class.

 9               MR. LAYCOCK:     Well, it doesn't --

10               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And again, that's

11   something that -- that can be heard.              You don't even

12   want to hear it.

13               MR. LAYCOCK:     That's -- it is not uncommon,

14   even with ordained ministers, it's not uncommon among

15   Protestants, to recognize an ordination from a different

16   denomination that has similar teachings.              So, when --

17   when they can't find a called minister to cover a class

18   and they hire another Christian from another

19   conservative Protestant denomination, they say:              While

20   you teach here, you're required to teach Lutheran

21   doctrine.

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           I'm sorry.     Going back

23   to the question Justice Kagan asked you, if one of these

24   Protestant teachers that's not Lutheran led the

25   cafeteria prayer, as they are required to, you're now

 1   saying that the law must recognize that lay teacher as a

 2   minister and apply the ministerial exception, even

 3   though the religion doesn't consider her a minister?

 4               MR. LAYCOCK:        I -- I didn't say that.      I

 5   said --

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Well, but that was the

 7   answer you gave.   If she taught a religious class --

 8               MR. LAYCOCK:        If she teaches a religion

 9   class, not if she merely leads a prayer.

10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            So, what is your

11   definition of "minister"?         Maybe we need to find out.

12   So, it's not a title.       It's really -- the only

13   function -- you're saying anyone who teaches religion?

14               MR. LAYCOCK:        I think if you teach the

15   religion class, you're clearly a minister.           But if you

16   are -- if you hold an ecclesiastical office, that makes

17   this a very easy --

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay, but this is -- you're

19   saying a fortiori, but basically you'd be here anyway

20   even if she hadn't been ordained; right?

21               MR. LAYCOCK:        That's correct.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:            What is your take -- what

24   is your reaction to a less dramatic kind of holding?

25   Suppose we were to say the truth is that the particular


                                      18

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   individual here does have some religious obligations in

 2   teaching and quite a lot that aren't.               So, she's sort of

 3   on the edge.    At the same time, there is a statute

 4   which, whether it applies or not, you could take the

 5   principle, and it says a religious organization like


 6   your client may require that she conform to the


 7   religious tenets of the organization.


 8                  So, Congress focused on this.             And the


 9   district court looks at it, and suppose it were to


10   decide:   That's true, but there's no evidence here at

11   all that religious tenets had anything to do with her

12   being dismissed.    No one mentioned them.             She didn't

13   know about them.    I didn't until I read the very

14   excellent brief filed by the Lutherans that explained

15   the nature of taking civil suits.             No one said that to

16   her, whether it was in someone's mind or not.                She found

17   out on motion for summary judgment.                So, therefore, this

18   wasn't an effort by the religious organization to

19   express its tenets.      She was dismissed.

20                  She could have -- they could have had a

21   defense, but it doesn't apply, and, therefore, even

22   though she's sort of like a minister, she loses.

23                  What are your objections to that?

24                  MR. LAYCOCK:     Well, my first objection is I

25   don't think those are remotely the facts here.                You

 2   elaborate dispute resolution process.              You don't ask

 3   for --

 4                  JUSTICE BREYER:         Did anyone mention that to

 5   her?

 6                  MR. LAYCOCK:     Indeed.

 7                  JUSTICE BREYER:         Really?     My law clerk

 8   couldn't find it.    Can you tell me where -- where

 9   someone did say the reason we're dismissing you is

10   because of our religious doctrine that you cannot bring

11   civil suits?

12                  MR. LAYCOCK:     Page 55 of the joint appendix,

13   which is the letter that -- where they tell her that

14   they're going to recommend recission of her call, they

15   say, because -- because of insubordination and because

16   you threatened to sue us.

17                  JUSTICE BREYER:         I mean, does anyone explain

18   to her, which she might not have known, that this is a

19   religious doctrine that you are supposed to go to the

20   synod or whatever, and you're not supposed to go to

21   court?

22                  MR. LAYCOCK:     She --

23                  JUSTICE BREYER:         Of course, they wanted to

24   fire her because she threatened to sue them.              But what

25   I'm wondering is, is there anywhere before the motion

 1   for summary judgment where someone explains to her, our

 2   motivation here is due to our religious tenet?

 3                MR. LAYCOCK:     You don't assess the

 4   importance of a doctrine by asking the person --

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:         No, no.     I understand that.

 6   But I went on a different piece of -- matter, that the

 7   people who were involved in this were doing it for

 8   religious rather than civil reasons.             I'm just wondering

 9   what the evidence is that they knew there was such a

10   doctrine, that they were motivated by the religious

11   doctrine, and that they expressed that to her.            I

12   just -- I'll look at page 55.           Is there anything else I

13   should look at?

14                MR. LAYCOCK:     The principal --

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Is it -- is it in the

16   handbook?   I mean, one of the objections -- if this --

17   if this is a rule that's going to bind the teachers,

18   then you would expect to find it in the handbook.             But

19   the handbook doesn't tell her, if you complain to the

20   EEOC about discrimination, then you will be fired.

21                MR. LAYCOCK:     Well, I don't know if it does

22   or it doesn't, because the handbook is not in the record

23   except for a short excerpt.          But she knew about this

24   rule.

25                JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, Mr. Laycock, could

 1   you --

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:         I'm looking for a citation

 3   in the record?   I just wonder, is there anything you

 4   want me to read other than page 55?

 5                 MR. LAYCOCK:     Yes.      The principal in her

 6   deposition says:   The minute she said she might sue, I

 7   said you can't do that; you're a called teacher.

 8                 The testimony is the board talked about it

 9   at their meeting on February 22nd.                I think that's also

10   in the principal's deposition.           The president of the

11   congregation, who did not deal directly with Perich,

12   said -- said it was one of the first things that he

13   thought about.   Perich was a lifelong Lutheran.              She

14   worked 11 years in Lutheran schools.               She had these

15   eight theology courses.       It's simply not credible that

16   she didn't know about this doctrine.

17                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Mr. Laycock, doesn't this

18   inquiry illustrate the problems that will necessarily

19   occur if you get into a pretext analysis?               The question

20   of was she told that she had violated the church's

21   teaching about suing in a civil tribunal?               Well, that

22   depends.   The significance of -- let's assume she wasn't

23   told.    The significance of that depends on how central a

24   teaching of Lutheranism this is.

25                 It's like -- suppose a Catholic priest got


                                     22

 1   married and the bishop said, I'm removing you from your

 2   parish because of your conduct.            Now, there wouldn't be

 3   much question about why that was done.             So, you'd have

 4   to get in, what did Martin Luther actually say about --

 5   about suing the church or other Christians in a civil


 6   tribunal?    Is this really a central tenet of


 7   Lutheranism?    Isn't that the problem with going into


 8   this pretext analysis?


 9                  MR. LAYCOCK:     That's just part of the


10   problem.    You've got to figure, how does this doctrine

11   work?   How important is it?           How does it apply to the

12   facts of this case?      How does it interact with other

13   doctrines?

14                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Mr. Laycock, you, in

15   order, I think, to dispel the notion that nothing is

16   permitted, in your reply brief you say there are many

17   suits that could be brought that would not be

18   inappropriate.    And I think it's on page 20 of your

19   reply brief.    But I don't understand how those would

20   work if the policy is you're a minister; if you have

21   quarrels with the church or a co-worker, we have our own

22   dispute resolution, and you don't go outside.

23                  But you say tort arising from unsafe working

24   conditions.    Suppose one of these commissioned workers

25   said, I think that there are unsafe working conditions

 1   and I'm going to complain to the Occupational Health and

 2   Safety Agency.   And wouldn't she get the same answer:

 3   This has to be solved in-house.           You don't go to an

 4   agency of the state.

 5               Why -- I don't follow why the tort claim

 6   based on unsafe working conditions would not fall under

 7   the same ban on -- keeping disputes in-house?

 8               MR. LAYCOCK:       Well, it may or it may not.

 9   The rule on internal dispute resolution is most

10   emphatically and clearly stated as applying to disputes

11   over fitness for ministry, and a tort claim may not be a

12   dispute over fitness for ministry, but what --

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But I thought the reason

14   that she was unfit for the ministry was that she went

15   outside the house.

16               MR. LAYCOCK:       That's right.      Yes.

17               JUDGE GINSBURG:           So, in all of these cases,

18   you go outside the church, you go to the government,

19   then you have a --

20               MR. LAYCOCK:       What we say in the passages in

21   the reply brief that you're looking at is the legal

22   doctrine, the ministerial exception as a matter of law,

23   does not apply unless the dispute is over whether I get

24   the job back, job qualifications, job performance, or

25   rules of ministry.    The church's rule --

 1                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But she could -- she


 2   could be -- for any of these things, she could be


 3   disciplined, fired because she complained outside the


 4   house.


 5                  MR. LAYCOCK:     She could be.       And her tort --

 6   the tort claim would proceed.             We think the retaliation

 7   claim should not proceed.

 8                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          The tort claim could

 9   proceed, and then she would get damages, and that would

10   be all right?

11                  MR. LAYCOCK:     She would get damages for the

12   tort.     She would not get damages for the loss of her

13   position.

14                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Did you say -- did I

15   understand you before, in response to Justice Sotomayor

16   and Justice Scalia, that even if she were merely a

17   contract teacher, the fact that she teaches religion

18   classes would be enough for her to qualify for the

19   ministerial exception?

20                  MR. LAYCOCK:     Yes.       And the fact that she's

21   a commissioned minister is the clincher in this case.

22   Teaching --

23                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Is the clincher in this

24   case, but even -- I think you answered if she were not a

25   commissioned minister, she's teaching the faith;


                                      25

 1   therefore, she can be fired, and it doesn't matter

 2   whether she's commissioned.            So, the commission is

 3   irrelevant.    It's -- it's her job duties that count.

 4                  MR. LAYCOCK:     Job duties are enough.           The

 5   commission is not irrelevant.             It is the clincher.

 6                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Now, it was certainly for

 7   some purposes.    I mean, if every teacher who teaches

 8   religion and math and a lot of other things said, I'm a

 9   minister and I'm entitled to the parsonage allowance on

10   my income tax return, certainly that's something that a

11   government agent would review.

12                  MR. LAYCOCK:     Well, they do review it there.

13   I think there's a -- I don't think the Lutherans have

14   any problems with the IRS on that.                 But, yes, that is a

15   context where they review these questions.

16                  If I could reserve a few minutes for

17   rebuttal, I would be grateful.

 1   fundamental constitutional right.          But it's a right that

 2   must also accommodate important governmental interests

 3   in securing the public welfare.         Congress has not

 4   unconstitutionally infringed Petitioner's freedom in

 5   this case by making it illegal for it to fire a fourth

 6   grade teacher in retaliation for asserting her statutory

 7   rights.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Is the position of

 9   the United States that there is a ministerial exception

10   or that there is not a ministerial exception?

11               MS. KRUGER:     Mr. Chief Justice, if the

12   ministerial exception is understood as a First Amendment

13   doctrine that governs the adjudication of disputes

14   between certain employees and their employers, we agree

15   that that First Amendment doctrine exists.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Nothing to do with

17   respect to the ministers.      In other words, is there a

18   ministerial exception distinct from the right of

19   association under the First Amendment?

20               MS. KRUGER:     We think that the ministerial

21   exception is one that incorporates the right of

22   association as well as the rights under the religion

23   clauses.

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Is there anything

25   special about the fact that the people involved in this

 2               MS. KRUGER:       We think that the -- the

 3   analysis is one that the Court has -- has elaborated in

 4   other cases involving similar claims to autonomy,

 5   noninterference --

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Is that a "no"?   You

 7   say it's similar to other cases.            Expressive

 8   associations -- a group of people who are interested in

 9   labor rights have expressive associations.               Is the issue

10   we are talking about here in the view of the United

11   States any different than any other group of people who

12   get together for an expressive right?

13               MS. KRUGER:       We think the basic contours of

14   the inquiry are not different.           We think how the inquiry

15   plays out in particular cases may be --

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:           That's extraordinary.

17               MS. KRUGER:       I --

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:           That's extraordinary.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:           We're talking here about

21   the Free Exercise Clause and about the Establishment

22   Clause, and you say they have no special application

23   to --

24               MS. KRUGER:       The contours -- but the inquiry

25   that the Court has set out as to expressive associations

 1   we think translate quite well to analyzing the claim

 2   that Petitioner has made here.            And for this reason, we

 3   don't think that the job duties of a particular

 4   religious employee in an organization are relevant to

 5   the inquiry.

 6                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         There's nothing in the

 7   Constitution that explicitly prohibits the government

 8   from mucking around in a labor organization.           Now, yes,

 9   you -- you can by an extension of First Amendment rights

10   derive such a -- but there, black on white in the text

11   of the Constitution are special protections for

12   religion.   And you say that makes no difference?

13                  MS. KRUGER:     Well, Justice Scalia, if I may,

14   I don't understand Petitioner from the first half of his

15   argument to have disputed this basic point, which is

16   that the contours of the First Amendment doctrine at

17   issue here will depend on a balancing of interests.

18   That is the only way, I think, that Petitioner can

19   differentiate a generally neutrally applicable

20   application of anti-discrimination law with respect to a

21   church's choice of those who would govern it and a

22   church's retaliation against a teacher who would report

23   child abuse to the authorities.

24                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         I think that the balancing

25   of interests is different, according to the Petitioner,


                                      29

 1   when one of the interests is religion.                And you're just

 2   denying that.   You say:       We balance religion the way we

 3   balance labor organizations.

 4               MS. KRUGER:        Well, Justice Scalia --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's certainly not what

 6   the Petitioner is saying.

 7               MS. KRUGER:        Here is where I think what the

 8   core of the insight of the ministerial exception as it

 9   was originally conceived is, which is that there are

10   certain relationships within a religious community that

11   are so fundamental, so private and ecclesiastical in

12   nature, that it will take an extraordinarily compelling

13   governmental interest to justify interference.               Concerns

14   with health or safety, for example.                But the

15   government's general interest in eradicating

16   discrimination in the workplace will not be sufficient

17   to justify the burden.

18               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, do you dispute the

19   proposition that one of the central concerns of the

20   Establishment Clause was preventing the government from

21   choosing ministers?      When there was an established

22   church, the government chose the ministers or had a say

23   in choosing the ministers.          And the Establishment

24   Clause, many argue, was centrally focused on eliminating

25   that governmental power.        Now, do you dispute that?

 1                 MS. KRUGER:     No, Justice Alito, we don't

 2   dispute it.   What we do dispute is that what is

 3   happening when the government applies generally

 4   applicable anti-retaliation law to a religious employer

 5   is that it is choosing a minister on behalf of the


 6   church.   What it is instead doing is preventing


 7   religious employers, like any other employers, from


 8   punishing their employees for threatening to bring


 9   illegal conduct to the attention of --

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Suppose that's the central

11   tenet.    Suppose you have a religion and the central

12   tenet is:    You have a problem with what we do, go to the

13   synod; don't go to court.        And that applies to civil

14   actions of all kinds.      All right?        So, would that not be

15   protected by the First Amendment?

16                 MS. KRUGER:     Justice Breyer, two points --

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Your view is it's not

18   protected?

19                 MS. KRUGER:     It's not protected.       But I'd

20   like -- I think there are two responses that are

21   relevant to how this Court will resolve that question in

22   this case.

23                 First of all, if the Court were to accept

24   the rule that Petitioner would ask it to adopt, we would

25   never ask the question whether or not the church has a


                                     31

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   reason for firing an employee that's rooted in religious

 2   doctrine.    Their submission is that the hiring and

 3   firing decisions with respect to parochial school

 4   teachers and with respect to priests is categorically

 5   off limits.    And we think that that is a rule that is


 6   insufficiently attentive to the relative public and


 7   private interests at stake, interests that this Court


 8   has repeatedly recognized are important in


 9   determining freedom of association claims.


10                 JUSTICE BREYER:         So that, in fact, if they

11   want to choose to the priest, you could go to the

12   Catholic Church and say they have to be women.          I mean,

13   you couldn't say that.      That's obvious.       So, how are you

14   distinguishing this?

15                 MS. KRUGER:     Right.      We think that the --

16   both the private and public interests are very different

17   in the two scenarios.      The government's general interest

18   in eradicating discrimination in the workplace is simply

19   not sufficient to justify changing the way that the

20   Catholic Church chooses its priests based on gender

21   roles that are rooted in religious doctrine.

22                 But the interests in this case are quite

23   different.    The government has a compelling and indeed

24   overriding interest in ensuring that individuals are not

25   prevented from coming to the government with information


                                     32

 1   about illegal conduct.

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:        When you say that, are you

 3   not implicitly making a judgment about the relative

 4   importance of the Catholic doctrine that only males can

 5   be ordained as priests and the Lutheran doctrine that a

 6   Lutheran should not sue the church in civil courts?          I

 7   don't see any distinction between -- I can't reconcile

 8   your position on those two issues without coming to the

 9   conclusion that you think that the Catholic doctrine is

10   older, stronger, and entitled to more respect than the

11   Lutheran doctrine.

12                MS. KRUGER:      No, we're not -- we're not

13   drawing distinctions between the importance of a

14   particular religious tenet in a system of religious

15   belief.   But the difference is that the government has

16   a, indeed, foundational interest in ensuring, as a

17   matter of preserving the integrity of the rule of law,

18   that individuals are not punished for coming --

19                JUSTICE BREYER:          You're saying that going to

20   church -- sorry -- that going to court is a more

21   fundamental interest than a woman obtaining the job that

22   she wants, which happens in this case to be a Catholic

23   priest.   But that's the distinction you're making.

24                MS. KRUGER:      I am drawing a distinction

25   between --

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:         Well, why?   I don't know

 2   why that doesn't -- I mean, you may be right, but it

 3   isn't obvious to me that the one is the more important

 4   than the other.

 5               MS. KRUGER:     The government's interest in

 6   preventing retaliation against those who would go to

 7   civil authorities with civil wrongs is foundational to

 8   the rule of law.

 9               JUSTICE KAGAN:       Ms. Kruger, if I could just

10   clarify for a second there, because you're now sounding

11   as though you want to draw a sharp line between

12   retaliation claims and substantive discrimination

13   claims, and I didn't get that from your brief.         So, is

14   that, in fact, what you're saying?

15               MS. KRUGER:     I think that there is an

16   important distinction to be made between the

17   government's general interest in eradicating

18   discrimination from the workplace and the government's

19   interest in ensuring that individuals are not chilled

20   from coming to civil authorities with reports about

21   civil wrongs.

22               But if I could continue, I think that the --

23               JUSTICE KAGAN:       So, are you willing to

24   accept the ministerial exception for substantive

25   discrimination claims, just not for retaliation claims?

 1                 MS. KRUGER:      I don't think that those are

 2   the only two sets of inquiries that are important in the

 3   balancing.    And if I could continue, I think the

 4   government --

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               I'm sorry.   That was

 6   a yes -- I think that question can be answered yes or

 7   no.

 8                 MS. KRUGER:      I think that that doesn't -- I

 9   think the answer is no, in part because that doesn't

10   fully account for all of the public and private

11   interests at stake.      The government's interest extends

12   in this case beyond the fact that this is a retaliation

13   to the fact that this is not a church operating

14   internally to promulgate and express religious belief

15   internally.    It is a church that has decided to open its

16   doors to the public to provide the service, socially

17   beneficial service, of educating children for a fee, in

18   compliance with State compulsory education laws.

19                 And this Court has recognized in cases like

20   Bob Jones that church-operated schools sit in a

21   different position with respect to the -- the

22   permissible scope of governmental regulations than

23   churches themselves do.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Even with respect to their

25   religion classes and their theology classes?                It's

 1   extraordinary.


 2                 MS. KRUGER:     Well, the government's --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Just because -- just


 4   because you have to comply with State education


 5   requirements on secular subjects, your -- who you pick

 6   to -- to teach theology or to teach religion has to

 7   be -- has to be subject to State control?

 8                 MS. KRUGER:     Justice Scalia, to be clear,

 9   the government's interest in this case is not in

10   dictating to the church-operated school who it may

11   choose to teach religion classes and who it may not.               It

12   is one thing and one thing only, which is to tell the

13   school that it may not punish its employees for

14   threatening to report civil wrongs to civil authorities.

15   That is an interest that we think overrides the burden

16   on the association's religious message about the virtues

17   of internal dispute resolution as opposed to court

18   resolution.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              So, you're making --

20   you're making a judgment about how important a

21   particular religious belief is to a church.               You're

22   saying -- this may just be the same question Justice

23   Alito asked -- but you're saying:            We don't believe the

24   Lutheran Church when it says that this is an important

 1                  MS. KRUGER:     No, absolutely not, Mr. Chief

 2   Justice.   We do not dispute -- when they assert that

 3   it's an important tenet, we assume its validity, we

 4   assume that they are sincere in that religious belief.

 5   But just as in United States v. Lee, that sincere

 6   religious belief was not sufficient to warrant an

 7   exemption from generally applicable tax laws, as in Bob

 8   Jones, or --

 9                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              On the other hand,

10   the -- the belief of the Catholic Church that priests

11   should be male only -- you do defer to that, even if the

12   Lutherans say, look, our dispute resolution belief is

13   just as important to a Lutheran as the all-male clergy

14   is to a Catholic.

15                  MS. KRUGER:     Yes.       But that's because the

16   balance of relative public and private interests is

17   different in each case.

18                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Do you believe, Ms. Kruger,

19   that a church has a right that's grounded in the Free

20   Exercise Clause and/or the Establishment Clause to

21   institutional autonomy with respect to its employees?

22                  MS. KRUGER:     We don't see that line of

23   church autonomy principles in the Religion Clause

24   jurisprudence as such.       We see it as a question of

25   freedom of association.        We think that this case is


                                      37

 1   perhaps one of the cases --

 2                JUSTICE KAGAN:       So, this is to go back to


 3   Justice Scalia's question, because I too find that


 4   amazing, that you think that the Free -- neither the


 5   Free Exercise Clause nor the Establishment Clause has

 6   anything to say about a church's relationship with its

 7   own employees.

 8                MS. KRUGER:     We think that this is one of

 9   the cases that Employment Division v. Smith may have

10   been referring to when it referred to free association

11   claims that are reinforced by free exercise concerns.

12   It's certainly true that the association's claim to

13   autonomy in this case is one that is deeply rooted.           And

14   concerns about how it exercises its religion -- those

15   two things merge in some ways in that respect.           But --

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:         I don't think they merge at

17   all.   Smith didn't involve employment by a church.          It

18   had nothing to do with who the church could employ.           I

19   don't -- I don't see how that has any relevance to this.

20                I would -- I didn't understand your answer

21   to the Chief Justice's question.           You -- you say that

22   there were different institutional values or government

23   values involved with respect to a -- to a Catholic

24   priest than there is with respect to this Lutheran

25   minister.   Let's assume that a Catholic priest is -- is


                                    38

 1   removed from his duties because he married, okay?

 2   And -- and he claims:      No, that's not the real reason;

 3   the real reason is because I threatened to sue the

 4   church.   Okay?   So, that reason is just pretextual.

 5                 Would you -- would you allow the government

 6   to go -- go into the -- into the dismissal of the

 7   Catholic priest to see whether indeed it -- it was

 8   pretextual?

 9                 MS. KRUGER:     I think the answer is no,

10   Justice Scalia --

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Why?

12                 MS. KRUGER:     -- but that is the --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Why is that any different

14   from the Lutheran minister?

15                 MS. KRUGER:     I would begin with looking at

16   the burdens on association under the balancing test.          I

17   think that the core of the understanding of the

18   ministerial exception, as it was elaborated in the lower

19   courts, is that there is a fundamental difference

20   between governmental regulation that operates to

21   interfere with the relationship between a church and

22   those who would govern it, those who would preach the

23   word to the congregations, those who would administer

24   its sacraments, on the one hand, and the more public

25   relationship between a church and a school teacher and


                                     39

 1   others that provide services to the public at large.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:         I think that's saying

 3   nothing different than what the Chief Justice suggests,

 4   that you think the one is more -- is more important to

 5   -- to Catholics than the other is to Lutherans.

 6                MS. KRUGER:     I don't think it's a question

 7   of the importance of either function to the -- the

 8   religious association.     It's a question of the realm

 9   of permissible governmental regulation.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:         Yes, but then you have to

11   say that it's more important to let people go to court

12   to sue about sex discrimination than it is for a woman

13   to get a job.   I can't say that one way or the other.

14   So -- so, I'm stuck.

15                And since I'm really -- this is tough and

16   I'm stuck on this, I don't see how you can avoid going

17   into religion to some degree.           You have to decide if

18   this is really a minister, for example, and what kind of

19   minister.   That gets you right involved.          Or if you're

20   not going to do that, you're going to go look to see

21   what are their religious tenets?           And that gets you

22   right involved.

23                I just can't see a way of getting out of

24   something -- of getting out of the whole thing.           I don't

25   see how to do it.   So, suppose you said in case of doubt


                                    40

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   like that, we'll try what Congress suggested.           And now

 2   we have here a borderline case of ministry, not the

 3   heartland case.   So, you say, all right, where you have

 4   a borderline case the constitutional issue goes away,

 5   and what Congress said is okay.           So, now what you have

 6   to prove is you have to prove that -- the church has to

 7   show that the applicant was disciplined, or whatever,

 8   because she didn't conform to the religious tenets.           All

 9   right?   That's what they have to show.

10                And I'm sorry; they maybe only make a prima

11   facie case, but they got to show it, and if they don't

12   show that there was at least some evidence to that

13   effect and that somebody knew about the religious tenet

14   and there was something like that -- maybe it's in the

15   air, as is obvious with Justice Alito's question, but

16   where it isn't in the air, you'd have to make a showing.

17                Now -- now, I see that's an interference,

18   but I don't see how you avoid an interference someplace

19   or the other.    Otherwise, you're going to get into who

20   is a minister.

21                So, what's the answer to this dilemma?          At

22   the moment I'm making an argument for following what

23   Congress said, go back and try it that way, and if they

24   can show in this case and she shows in this case nobody

25   ever thought of the religious tenet, nobody told me,


                                     41

 1   they didn't read it, then she's going to win.         And if

 2   they come in and show that they really did this because

 3   of their religious tenet, they'll win.          What about that?

 4               MS. KRUGER:     Justice Breyer, I think that

 5   that is a perfectly appropriate way to come at this

 6   case, although it skips over sort of the initial

 7   inquiry, which is into whether or not the application of

 8   the regulation to the particular employment relationship

 9   results in an unwarranted interference.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:         Well, it does have the

11   virtue of deciding a statutory question before a tough

12   constitutional question.     And I agree, with what we

13   sometimes do, that seems bizarre, but I thought that was

14   the basic rule.

15               MS. KRUGER:     I think that that's absolutely

16   right, Justice Breyer.    And I think the next question

17   becomes, with respect to adjudicating a particular case,

18   whether deciding the case would require the court to

19   decide disputed matters of religious doctrine or to

20   second-guess essentially subjective --

21               JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, if -- if the plaintiff

22   proceeded that way, would she be entitled to -- I assume

23   she would -- introduce testimony by experts on

24   Lutheranism, theologians, professors of religion about

25   how the -- about this -- this tenet, and it isn't


                                   42

 1   really -- they might say, well, it's really not that

 2   strong, and it once was, but it's faded, and it's not --

 3   it's not widely enforced.

 4                And then you'd have experts on the other

 5   side, and you'd have a court and a lay jury deciding how

 6   important this really is to Lutherans.           Is that how that

 7   would play out?

 8                MS. KRUGER:     No, it's not how it would play

 9   out.

10                JUSTICE ALITO:       How are you going to avoid

11   that?   I just don't see it.

12                MS. KRUGER:     Any inquiry into the validity

13   of a particular religious doctrine is simply irrelevant

14   to the adjudication of the dispute, which is designed to

15   find out just one thing, which is whether the --

16                JUSTICE ALITO:       No, it's not irrelevant.

17   I've seen dozens and dozens and dozens of pretext cases,

18   and in practically every pretext case that I've seen,

19   one of the central issues is whether the reason that was

20   proffered by the employer is the real reason, is an

21   important reason for that, for that employer, and

22   whether they really think it's important and whether

23   they apply it across the board.          That's almost always a

24   big part of the case.

25                And once you get into that, you're going to

 1   get into questions of -- of religious doctrine.       I just

 2   don't see it.

 3                  Let me give you an example of a real case.

 4   A nun wanted to be -- wanted a tenured position teaching

 5   canon law at Catholic University, and she claimed that

 6   she was denied tenure because of her -- because of her

 7   gender.

 8                  Now, there the university might argue, no,

 9   she was -- and did argue -- she's denied tenure because

10   of the quality of her -- of her scholarship.       And, okay,

11   now, if you try that pretext issue, the issue is going

12   to be what is the real quality of her canon law

13   scholarship?    And you're going to have the judge and the

14   jury decide whether the particular writings on canon law

15   are -- make a contribution to canon law scholarship.

16   How can something like that be tried, without getting

17   into religious issues?

18                  MS. KRUGER:     If the only way that the

19   plaintiff has to show that that may not have been the

20   employer's real reason was a subjective judgment about

21   the quality of canon law scholarship, then judgment has

22   to be entered for the employer, because the plaintiff

23   has no viable way, consistent with the Establishment

24   Clause, of demonstrating that wasn't the employer's real

25   reason.


                                      44

 1                  If, on the other hand, the plaintiff has

 2   evidence that no one ever raised any objections to the

 3   quality of her scholarship, but they raised objections

 4   to women serving in certain roles in the school, and

 5   those roles were not ones that were required to be

 6   filled by persons of a particular gender, consistent

 7   with religious beliefs, then that's a case in which a

 8   judge can instruct a jury that it's job is not to

 9   inquire into the validity of the subjective judgment,

10   just as juries are often instructed that their job is

11   not to determine whether an employer's business judgment

12   was fair or correct, but only whether the employer was

13   motivated by discrimination or retaliation.

 7                JUSTICE KAGAN:        Mr. Dellinger, could you

 9   that's founded in the Religion Clauses, and tell me who

10   counts as a minister, and why this commissioned minister

11   does not count as a minister?

12                MR. DELLINGER:        I believe that there is an

13   exemption grounded in the Religion Clauses.                It means

14   that religious organizations will win -- will prevail in

15   many cases in which a comparable civil organization

16   would not prevail.    I don't think that it makes sense to

17   approach it in a categorical way of asking --

18                JUSTICE KAGAN:        I'm just asking you to

19   assume with me for a moment that there is a categorical

20   exception and to tell me who you think counts as a

21   minister, and why the woman in this case does not.

22                MR. DELLINGER:        Well, in our view, if that

23   was the test, then we would say that the court of

24   appeals was correct in holding that she was not a

25   minister, and the reason -- the principal reason is she

 1   carries out such important secular functions in addition

 2   to her religious duties in --

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 That can't -- I'm

 4   sorry to interrupt you, but that can't be the test.                The

 5   Pope is a head of state carrying out secular functions;

 6   right?

 7               (Laughter.)

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Those are important.

 9   So, he is not a minister?

10               MR. DELLINGER:          Chief Justice Roberts, I do

11   not want to suggest that it's a very good approach to

12   try to decide who's a minister and who's not a minister.

13   That's what's wrong with Professor Laycock's categorical

14   approach, because it's -- it's both over- and

15   under-inclusive.   It sweeps in cases where there is, in

16   fact, no religious reason offered --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:            It's only a bad approach if

18   we adopt your test.      Why isn't it a perfectly reasonable

19   test whether the person -- although the person may have

20   a lot of secular duties, whether the person has

21   substantial religious responsibilities?

22               MR. DELLINGER:          And the reason that is not a

23   satisfactory test is that it fails to take account of

24   the important governmental interests -- for example, in

25   this case -- in having everyone have access to the -- to

 1   the courts.

 2                  JUSTICE BREYER:         No, but that isn't -- but

 3   that isn't the problem.        The problem, it seems to me, is

 4   I don't know how substantial these interests are

 5   religiously.    I don't know how substantial the religion

 6   itself considers what they do from a religious

 7   perspective.

 8                  So, let's go back to Justice Alito's

 9   problem.    And now on the ministerial issue, we call the

10   synods, we call the how certain was it, how central is

11   it to the heart of the religion, what they're actually

12   doing, and we replicate exactly what he said, in respect

13   to the problem of religious tenet, now in respect to the

14   problem of religious minister.

15                  And maybe you can tell me we don't have to

16   go into the one or the other, but I've had enough of

17   these cases in the lower court to know they are really

18   hard.   People believe really different things, and I see

19   no way to avoid going into one or the other, and,

20   therefore, I think, rather than try this constitutional

21   matter, let's go to the one Congress suggested.

 4   Congress made it quite clear how this case should be


 5   resolved, because Congress expressly did not apply the

 6   religious exemptions of the ADA to retaliation.

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:         No.   I don't agree with

 8   that.    I think -- I think what it says is a religious

 9   organization may require that all applicants and

10   employees conform to the religious tenets.           It put that

11   in the section defining defenses.            The defenses are part

12   of the right, and when it forbids retaliation, it says

13   forbids retaliation against an individual for the

14   exercise of any right granted.

15                 And, therefore, I don't believe that a

16   person who has failed to violate the substantive section

17   could be held up normally.

18                 I mean, I don't --

19                 MR. DELLINGER:       Well, we differ on that,

20   but --

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:         I can think it's pretty

22   easy to read that exception, even though it's in a

23   different subchapter, into the retaliation exception.

24                 And assume for me that that's so.

25                 MR. DELLINGER:       It is still the case that it

 1   is a constitutional matter.            The state's interest in


 2   allowing citizens to have access to its courts and to


 3   its agencies is paramount in cases like child abuse,


 4   reporting of school safety problems, and others.             In


 5   this case, it's -- we are mindful --

 6                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         But it's not paramount.


 7   Would you -- take the firing of the Catholic priest


 8   example.    Does that get into the courts?


 9                  MR. DELLINGER:       No, it doesn't and the


10   reason is --

11                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         Why not?

12                  MR. DELLINGER:       -- that there is -- and that

13   points out, Justice Scalia, that there are ample

14   doctrines to protect church autonomy.              One is that under

15   the Establishment Clause, there can be no reinstatement

16   ordered by a court of someone to an ecclesiastical

17   position.    Another mentioned by General Kruger is

18   that --

19                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         But he can sue for money,

20   right?

21                  MR. DELLINGER:       I -- I do not believe that

22   he can be reinstated or get damages for removal from

23   the -- from the priesthood.

24                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         Not reinstated.    He can sue

25   for money.    He can sue for, you know, the loss of --

 1                 MR. DELLINGER:        I think, in that case, that

 2   that is very likely to fail because you're going to run

 3   into (a) issues of religious doctrine or evaluations of

 4   distinctly religious matters, like EEOC v. Catholic

 5   University.   Those doctrines still stand.

 6                 The problem with the -- this categorical

 7   exception is it sweeps in cases like this one, where the

 8   well-pleaded complaint in this case simply says, I was

 9   dismissed from my employment because I said I was going

10   to make a report to the EEOC.             And she's not seeking

11   reinstatement.   She just wants the economic loss.

12   There's no need --

13                 JUSTICE ALITO:        Well, if I could just come

14   back to the example of the canon law professor, because

15   I still don't see how the -- the approach that the

16   Solicitor General is recognizing -- is recommending

17   could -- can eliminate the problems involved in pretext.

18   So, the -- as I understood her -- her answer, it was

19   that you couldn't look into the question of whether the

20   professor's canon law scholarship was really good canon

21   law scholarship, but you could try the issue of sex

22   discrimination based on other evidence.             So, maybe

23   there's some stray remarks here and there about a woman

24   teaching canon law.

25                 Now, a response to that might be that wasn't

 1   the real reason, and if you just look at the scholarship

 2   and you see how miserable it is and how inconsistent it

 3   is with church doctrine, you can see that that's the

 4   real reason.

 5                  So, you just cannot get away from evaluating

 6   religious issues.

 7                  MR. DELLINGER:       This is not a problem that

 8   is unique to ministerial employees, which is why this is

 9   both over- and under-inclusive.             When you -- this is a

10   circumstance in which an organization is going into the

11   public arena providing a public service, and in that

12   situation, it ought to be governed by the same rules --

13   Justice Scalia, you said this case is not like

14   Employment Division v. Smith, but under Employment

15   Division v. Smith, we know that the State could forbid a

16   school from -- a religious school from using peyote in

17   its ceremonies, but under Petitioner's submission, they

18   could fire any employee who reported that use of peyote

19   to civil authorities, and that employee would have no

20   recourse.

21                  We know that under U.S. v. Lee, an Amish

22   employer has to comply with the Social Security laws,

23   but under their submission, the employer could fire

24   without recourse any employee who called noncompliance

25   to the attention of the EEOC.             We believe that -- that


                                      52

 1   you can trust to Congress on these hard areas where

 2   there needs to be additional accommodations; Congress

 3   could make them, just as Justice Scalia suggested.        The

 4   ministerial exemption has a long history, Justice Alito,

 5   but in almost every circuit, it did not apply to

 6   teachers.   So, I mean --

 7                JUSTICE ALITO:       It antedated -- did it not

 8   antedate the enactment of the Americans with

 9   Disabilities Act?

10                MR. DELLINGER:       That is correct.   When that

11   was enacted --

12                JUSTICE ALITO:       So, wouldn't -- shouldn't we

13   assume that Congress -- that Congress assumed that it

14   would continue to apply to the ADA, just as it applied

15   to Title VII.

16                MR. DELLINGER:       It -- in the lower courts

17   did not apply it as sweepingly as to teachers.        And I --

18   I think we have this debate with Justice Breyer about

19   whether -- whether you can say that Congress

20   specifically excluded retaliation -- retaliation cases.

21                But remember that that doctrine emerged at a

22   time when this Court had a position that religious

23   organizations could not participate in getting public

24   funding, even when they were providing remedial services

25   to low-income students.      We repudiated that doctrine in

 1   Agostini v. Felton and where the Court said that you're

 2   entitled to participate in providing public services on

 3   the same basis as all other organizations.            That means

 4   that you should comply, in some instances, with the same

 5   rules, when you leave the cloister and go into the


 6   public arena and provide public services.


 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Gee whiz.   Do -- do


 8   Lutheran schools and Catholic parochial schools share


 9   public funds the same way public schools do?


10               MR. DELLINGER:         No, they don't, Justice --

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:           You bet you they don't.

12               MR. DELLINGER:         But they are entitled to.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:           What is this argument

14   you're making?    I don't understand.

15               MR. DELLINGER:         Because we are no longer --

16   we are no longer of the -- of the Aguilar v. Felton era,

17   the pre-Employment Division v. Smith where we believe

18   that no governmental rules or involvement can be had

19   with these public institutions.

15                 MR. LAYCOCK:       Two or three points very

16   briefly:   The many distinctions and balancing tests in

17   their argument show the mess you will be in if you try

18   to decide these cases.        And we may have a line-drawing

 1   as a religious organization gives a religious reason of

 2   any kind, genuine or not, for firing someone that's

 3   associated with it, whether minister or not, that that

 4   invokes the exception.       Am I hearing your argument

 5   right?

 6                MR. LAYCOCK:       No.

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           All right.   So, why is

 8   there a difference?

 9                MR. LAYCOCK:       The position of minister is

10   categorically special because that is committed to the

11   church in the system of separation of church and state.

12   You may have religious questions when they dismiss the

13   janitor, but the level of sensitivity is not remotely

14   the same.   And -- and --

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So, you would say with

16   janitors, you can get into the pretext question.

17                MR. LAYCOCK:       The janitor can litigate his

18   pretext question.   Yes.

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So, you're limiting your

20   test to whether that person is a minister.             So, define

21   "minister" for me again.

22                MR. LAYCOCK:       A minister is a person who

23   holds ecclesiastical office in the church or who

24   exercises important religious functions, most obviously

25   including teaching of the faith.

 1                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Mr. Laycock, Mr.      Dellinger

 2   has some -- some points here about the way in which the

 3   ministerial exception relates or doesn't relate to

 4   Employment Division v. Smith.           And it seems to me that

 5   in order to make an argument for the ministerial

 6   exception, you in some sense have to say that

 7   institutional autonomy is different from individual

 8   conscience, that we've said in Smith that state

 9   interests can trump individual conscience.            And you want

10   us to say that they can't trump institutional autonomy.

11   So, why is that?

12                MR. LAYCOCK:     It's not that institutions are

13   different from individuals.          It is that the

14   institutional governance of the church is at a prior

15   step.   Smith is about whether people can act on their

16   religious teachings after they're formulated.           The

17   selection of ministers is about the process by which

18   those religious teachings will be formulated.

19   Smith distinguishes those cases --

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Might not the Establishment

21   Clause have something to do with that question --

 3   Clause applies to individuals, right?

 5   Free Exercise and Establishment:            Serbian, Kedroff,
