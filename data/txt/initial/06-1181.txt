 6         ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE

 7             ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                 MR. MEADE:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10                 Congress has provided that certain aliens,

11   including those with good moral character, are eligible

12   for voluntary departure.          Congress has also provided

13   that all aliens may file one motion to reopen raising

14   new facts within 90 days.

15                 The question is how to reconcile these two

16   provisions.    The parties agree on two key points:

17   First, the Government agrees that the statute can be

18   read to preserve motions to reopen for voluntary

19   departure recipients.       Second, the Government agrees

20   that such aliens can file a motion to reopen; and if the

21   immigration official happens to act quickly enough, the

22   alien will receive a ruling.             But, under the

23   Government's view, if the official does not act quickly

24   enough, the alien is denied an adjudication.

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Can we consider that in


                                         3

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   your case, given that the application to reopen was made

 2   when there were only two days left to run for the

 3   termination of the voluntary departure time --                    in other

 4   words, it was your delay, not the Government's, that

 5   made it impossible to decide this in the requisite time?

 6               MR. MEADE:       Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and I

 7   have two responses, one relating to this particular case

 8   as well as the cases in general.

 9               But, as to this particular case, Mr. Dada

10   found new counsel, which took a week; and in the

11   remaining time he prepared a motion to reopen with 80

12   pages of exhibits including affidavits, five letters,

13   medical documents, financial records including tax

14   returns.   And that's why it took an additional

15   two-and-a-half weeks to do the motion to reopen.

16               But, as a general matter, aliens file at

17   different periods during the period.                    For example, in

18   the Eleventh Circuit case of Ugokwe the alien filed with

19   30 days left in the period, and the Government, the

20   agency, didn't act in time.

21               But what happens in the agency is that

22   motions to reopen are, in fact, decided relatively

23   quickly -- just not quickly enough.

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 How many of those

25   are -- are granted?


                                        4

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              MR. MEADE:       How many --

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What percentage of

 3   motions to reopen are granted in favor of the alien?

 4              MR. MEADE:       We've looked for that statistic,

 5   and we have not been able to find the statistic.

 6   However, there are numerous cases presenting very

 7   sympathetic facts which show grants of motions to

 8   reopen.

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So how many -- do

10   you know how many are filed on an annual basis?

11              MR. MEADE:       Yes, I do.            As a general matter,

12   there are 10,000 motions to reopen filed, but that's for

13   all aliens, for all removal proceedings.                Since

14   voluntary departure is roughly 10 percent of all

15   removals, we estimate that'S roughly a thousand motions

16   to reopen filed by voluntary departure recipients.

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So there would be no

18   reason not to file one of these if you were subject to

19   voluntary -- if you elected voluntary departure, and it

20   extended your time to stay, right?                Seemingly, everybody

21   would file one of these if we rule in your favor.

22              MR. MEADE:       Not necessarily.            There are --

23   the statute governs when a motion to reopen is proper,

24   and the Attorney General determined, even under the

25   previous statutory scheme --


                                       5

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We're dealing with

 2   people who have already broken the law.                 So you're

 3   saying they are likely to follow the statute that says

 4   only file a motion to reopen under these circumstances?

 5                MR. MEADE:      Well, two responses:            First,

 6   there are sanctions for frivolous filing under the

 7   immigration proceedings.

 8                Second, the Attorney General, under the old

 9   regime that wasn't tightened -- the Attorney General

10   concluded that there was no pattern of abuse of motions

11   to reopen.

12                And, third, going forward, this is not a

13   risk because --

14                JUSTICE ALITO:         If an alien has not been

15   diligently pursuing his or her rights, you would argue

16   the person was still entitled to equitable tolling if

17   the alien files a motion to reopen?

18                MR. MEADE:      When you say that they're not

19   diligently pursuing their rights, I am not clear --

20                JUSTICE ALITO:         Isn't that generally a

21   requirement for equitable tolling:                 A person has to have

22   been diligently pursuing his rights?

23                MR. MEADE:      Generally, yes.

24                JUSTICE ALITO:         But you don't advocate the

25   adoption of that here.       You say if you file a petition


                                        6

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   -- a motion to reopen, you get automatic equitable

 2   tolling.

 3                MR. MEADE:        Yes.       Not necessarily equitable

 4   tolling, but, yes, automatic tolling under the statute.

 5   But to show quickly --

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Why isn't -- why isn't it

 7   fair to say:     You have the short time frame by statute

 8   to leave the country if you've left in voluntary

 9   departure.     Yet, the Government has provided reopening

10   for all aliens.    Okay.

11                Why isn't it reasonable to say that, by

12   asking for reopening when you've gotten permission to

13   voluntarily depart within "x" days, you are

14   relinquishing your voluntary departure status?

15                MR. MEADE:        That --

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Isn't that a perfect

17   reconciliation of the two?

18                MR. MEADE:        Yes, Justice Ginsburg.        That's

19   the option that the Government is proposing

20   prospectively.    It is also something that my client

21   requested at every stage of the proceedings before the

22   Board, before the Fifth Circuit, and the cert petition,

23   and in our opening brief.            That is one way to reconcile

24   the two statutory provisions which the Government is

25   proposing on an ongoing basis that will not apply to our


                                          7

 1   client.

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But you raised the

 3   question, as I remember, when you put it in the cert

 4   petition.    The Government advised against granting on

 5   that question and limiting it to the question of having

 6   it -- having it both ways, keeping your voluntary

 7   departure and moving to reopen.

 8                MR. MEADE:       Yes, that's correct, Justice

 9   Ginsburg.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel, another way

11   to reconcile the two that I think would be beneficial to

12   your client, but I'm not sure it's open to us, is to

13   address the Government's view that, when you voluntarily

14   depart, your motion to reopen is automatically

15   withdrawn.   That is, as I gather, set forth only in a

16   regulation and not the statute.

17                Now, it seems to me that if I were -- if I

18   thought it important to reconcile the two, I would be

19   much more concerned about that interpretation -- that

20   the motion to reopen is automatically withdrawn -- than

21   I would suggest we start incorporating equitable tolling

22   rules and all of that.

23                But, I take it, the vulnerability of that

24   regulation is probably beyond -- beyond debate.

25                MR. MEADE:       Well, that regulation is subject


                                         8

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   to litigation.   That would be another way to solve the

 2   problem as you suggest.        It would be --

 3              JUSTICE SOUTER:              But it wasn't directly

 4   challenged here, was it?

 5              MR. MEADE:        Excuse me?

 6              JUSTICE SOUTER:              That regulation was not

 7   directly challenged in this case?

 8              MR. MEADE:        It was not directly challenged

 9   because the Fifth Circuit is one of the circuits that

10   says that the motion -- that regulation is valid.

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So if we don't

12   address it here, there's going to be another case in a

13   year or 18 months where that's going to be raised?

14              MR. MEADE:        Your Honor, as to voluntary

15   departure recipients, this Court can construe the

16   statute to avoid the conflict here.                     And, moving

17   forward, the Government has a proposed solution which,

18   if adopted, will resolve the question on an ongoing

19   basis.

20              Some of the examples of the facts that arise

21   in motions to reopen are seen in various cases.                       For

22   example, a child newly diagnosed with mental

23   disabilities as in the Azarte case in the Ninth Circuit,

24   a parent newly diagnosed with health problems as in the

25   BIA case of Diaz Mucho --

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, in all these

 2   cases, if you think you have a good case on the motion

 3   to reopen, all you have to do is give up the benefits

 4   that you have availed yourself under voluntary

 5   departure, and then the motion to reopen is not

 6   automatically withdrawn.

 7              MR. MEADE:          With respect, that's not an

 8   option to our client.        Our client tried to do that, but

 9   was not permitted.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    No, I mean he -- you

11   should not elect voluntary departure in the first place.

12              MR. MEADE:          Well, the problem is because of

13   the very nature of the motion to reopen.                   A motion to

14   reopen, by its very nature, is based on changed

15   circumstances, circumstances that were not available at

16   the original time of the hearing.

17              So a person could enter and accept voluntary

18   departure at the time of the hearing and, because of

19   circumstances that change, that, by definition, he or

20   she could not have known about, is then in a bind when

21   he wants to --

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    What were those

23   circumstances here?

24              MR. MEADE:          The circumstances here is that

25   previous counsel had failed to submit an application and


                                         10

 1   supporting evidence.        And under the BIA case law that's

 2   a proper vehicle for a motion to reopen.

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But it existed?     You're

 4   not saying something that came up later?                  What was the

 5   ground that the, in this case, that wasn't brought up by

 6   the first counsel?

 7               MR. MEADE:         It was a file for adjustment of

 8   status, an application for adjustment of status and

 9   supporting documents, as well as the supporting evidence

10   showing that this was a bona fide marriage.                 And the BIA

11   has numerous cases which says that a motion to reopen of

12   this type is a valid motion to reopen.

13               Now, of course, the agency didn't rule on

14   whether the facts did or not -- did or did not need a

15   motion to reopen.     So that question isn't before the

16   Court.   But the other cases show the various kinds of

17   tracks that come up to establish a motion to reopen and

18   why it's an important part of the immigration process.

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Mr. Meade, why was your

20   client not allowed to withdraw the voluntary departure

21   option, withdraw from it?

22               MR. MEADE:         Justice Souter, that's unclear.

23   The agency didn't ask -- didn't answer that in the first

24   instance.   There has never been a reason given

25   throughout the entire litigation, and now there is some


                                         11

 1   irony --

 2                JUSTICE SOUTER:            So all we have on the

 3   record is just an IJ's determination that he would not

 4   accept it?

 5                MR. MEADE:       Well, it wasn't the IJ.       It was

 6   before the Board.    It was presented to the Board, and

 7   the Board's order only said he is ineligible for this

 8   relief because he has overstayed the voluntary departure

 9   period.    But there is some irony --

10                JUSTICE SOUTER:            But at the time he filed,

11   he had not overstayed, because he filed on Friday

12   afternoon, right?

13                MR. MEADE:       Yes.

14                JUSTICE SOUTER:            So -- so maybe the point is

15   we didn't have time to rule on it simply because he

16   filed it on Friday afternoon and he had to leave on

17   Sunday, and therefore, we should not take that as a

18   determination that had he filed in time for timely

19   action by the court he would have been denied.

20                MR. MEADE:       The agency has never given a

21   reason for why they did not accept the withdrawal,

22   although there is some irony in the fact that the

23   proposed solution going forward would give aliens

24   exactly what my client asked for if the agency --

25                JUSTICE ALITO:          If the voluntary withdrawal

 1   had been withdrawn successfully, he would then have been

 2   subject to the alternate order of removal?

 3               MR. MEADE:         That's correct, Your Honor.

 4               JUSTICE ALITO:            And he could have been

 5   removed immediately?

 6               MR. MEADE:         That's correct.

 7               JUSTICE ALITO:            And that would have mooted

 8   the motion to reopen, wouldn't it?

 9               MR. MEADE:         It wouldn't have mooted the

10   motion to reopen.     Motions to reopen are available to

11   all aliens subject to a final order, including criminal

12   aliens, including some accused of terrorism.

13               JUSTICE ALITO:            Would it remain pending once

14   he had left the United States?

15               MR. MEADE:         Not once he had left the United

16   States.   But all my client wants -- all my client wanted

17   at that time was to be placed in the same circumstance

18   as all other aliens subject to a final ruling.

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:              No, but he's not in the

20   same circumstance.      I mean, he's made his choice.          He

21   was offered voluntary departure, which had advantages.

22   He could arrange his affairs and go when he wanted

23   within 60 days.     What he gave up was the ability to

24   appeal the determination.

25               That doesn't seem to me as, as outrageous.

 1   I mean, it happens all the time.                 When a criminal

 2   defendant pleads to a lesser charge, he gives up the

 3   ability to appeal.      And that's what's going on here.                   He

 4   has gotten the advantage of a voluntary departure and

 5   given up the ability to appeal.                I don't bleed for him.

 6               It seems to me it's an option presented

 7   before him and he took it.

 8               MR. MEADE:         I have three responses, Justice

 9   Scalia.

10               First, I'll agree that the alien can file

11   the motion to reopen.        The only question is whether it's

12   going to be adjudicated in time.

13               Second, as for the question of the bargain,

14   whether giving up appeals is part of the bargain, all

15   parties agree that an alien who accepts voluntary

16   departure can continue to appeal to the Board, to the

17   courts of appeals.      The only, the only adjudicatory

18   process that the government says that my client is not

19   entitled to now is one motion to reopen.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Still and all, it's part of

21   the deal.   Even better.         Even better.             He hasn't even

22   given up all his appeals.

23               MR. MEADE:         One final --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:              It's just, part of the deal

25   he gave up this little ability to reopen, and that's --


                                         14

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that's the choice he made when he accepted voluntary

 2   departure.

 3                MR. MEADE:        One final response is that in

 4   the government's proposed regulation, an alien is

 5   permitted to file a motion to reopen notwithstanding

 6   having been granted voluntary departure, which indicates

 7   that the government itself does not think that the

 8   bargain includes -- or that Congress did not intend the

 9   bargain to include a waiver of the one motion to reopen

10   which all aliens are entitled to file.

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Going back to the

12   question that Justice Alito put to you, that he would

13   then be, and you agree this is what you asked for first,

14   like any other removable alien.                And Justice Alito asked

15   you:   Well, then he could be removed immediately, is

16   that not so?   My understanding was, yes, that's so, but

17   you can move for a stay of removal when you have a

18   reopening pending.      Is that true?

19                MR. MEADE:        Yes.       If you have a final order

20   of removal, yes, you can file for a stay once you have a

21   final order.   So my client is in a worse position.

22   Because he's under the voluntary departure grant, he

23   cannot get the same ability for a stay that those who

24   are subject to a final removal.                So the irony is --

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             If you say that tolling is


                                         15

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   automatic, which I assume is your position, would it be

 2   possible under the statutes to say that tolling is not

 3   automatic but can be permitted in the discretion of the

 4   hearing officer?

 5                MR. MEADE:        I --

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Or are we then just

 7   inventing something that's not in the statute at all?

 8                MR. MEADE:        Well, the problem, Justice

 9   Kennedy, is that the agency would need to act within the

10   short time period.      And --

11                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             No.      All it needs to do is

12   to say, we'll grant you an extension while we look at

13   this.

14                MR. MEADE:        That's true, Justice Kennedy.

15   But that's essentially the same action that would be

16   needed to decide the motion to reopen in the first

17   place.    Motions to reopen are discretionary.                 They go to

18   the same Board member that had decided the original

19   appeal.    So it does not take much time or effort for the

20   agency to be able to decide these, as is reflected by

21   the general time periods for adjudication.

22                For example, in the Dekoladeno case on the

23   Fourth Circuit, the motion was decided in 23 days.                   In

24   the Sidikhouya case out of the Eighth Circuit --

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, presumably it

 1   doesn't take them much time because when someone elects

 2   voluntary departure they don't have to address it.                   I

 3   mean, this would obviously increase the volume of

 4   motions to reopen.      As I said, I don't see know why

 5   anybody -- why everybody wouldn't file one, because it

 6   extends their stay.

 7              MR. MEADE:          It's a discretionary

 8   determination to the single Board member.                   And the Board

 9   member could deny the motion to reopen, even when

10   there's a prima facie case.              All they have to do is look

11   to see if it -- in the subset of cases that the agency,

12   exercising its own discretion, where they agree that a

13   motion to reopen is proper.              And all we're asking for in

14   this case, not special procedures, not anything added to

15   the motion to reopen process, but only the right to have

16   --

17              JUSTICE BREYER:               Is there appeal?       I mean,

18   what happens?     They file a motion to reopen, denied.

19   Now, can they appeal that?

20              MR. MEADE:          Yes.

21              JUSTICE BREYER:               Okay.       And how much time

22   does that take?

23              MR. MEADE:          Well, the denial of a motion to

24   reopen, at that point there would be a final order in

25   effect.

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Right.           But how -- do they

 2   then appeal the motion to -- they appeal the motion --

 3   the denial of the motion to reopen or how long -- where

 4   do they go?    Do they have -- this is the Board, so they

 5   go right to the court of appeals?

 6                 MR. MEADE:      That's correct.

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:           And how long do those take

 8   on average?

 9                 MR. MEADE:      One difference, though, between

10   petitions for review and motions to reopen is that

11   petitions for review can be decided from outside the

12   country under the 1996 amendments.                  And motions to

13   reopen under the agency's regulations, cannot.                     So the

14   problem is that there is no ability for an alien --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I'm not interested in the

16   problem.    I'm interested in how much added time it

17   actually means.    So let's go -- if you win, how much

18   additional time in a typical case would the alien have

19   before he has to leave?

20                 MR. MEADE:      Petitions for review take

21   longer.    According to the agency's current regulations,

22   they take approximately, I believe, 13 months or so is

23   what the --

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:           And then, and then do you

25   in addition ask for cert or is it not in addition?                     Are

 1   you including that within the 13 months?

 2              MR. MEADE:          Your Honor, I don't have those

 3   exact statistics.

 4              JUSTICE BREYER:               Or would you just guess on

 5   the basis of your experience?               I'm not holding you to

 6   it.

 7              MR. MEADE:          There might be cases where alien

 8   seek cert as well.      But for the most part --

 9              JUSTICE BREYER:               All right.       What I'm

10   wondering here, and this is because I see two contrary

11   things, if for to you win it means that you are adding

12   an average of, say, 400 days to a stay where Congress

13   said we want you to stay no more than 60 days or 120?

14   That's pretty hard for me to reconcile, to tell you the

15   truth.

16              MR. MEADE:          Well, one of the answers on that

17   question on the petition for review front is exactly

18   what the government has proposed in its rule going

19   forward, which is that an alien who has voluntary

20   departure can file a petition for review, but by doing

21   so the voluntary departure grant terminates and they're

22   in the same position as other aliens, on the same level

23   playing as other aliens.           That's the solution being

24   proposed by the government going forward, and as to the

25   petition for review hypothetical that would also apply.

 1   That would just put my client in the same position as

 2   all other aliens, including criminal aliens.

 3                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            I'm not sure I understand

 4   it.     Are you asking for automatic tolling just until the

 5   motion to reopen is decided or until the motion is

 6   decided and also the appeal process has run?

 7                 MR. MEADE:       Just for the motion, just for

 8   the time that the motion to reopen is decided.

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's what I thought.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well then, that's the

11   answer to my question.

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But in your discussion with

13   Justice Breyer you seemed to be saying that he can hang

14   around right through the appeal.

15                 MR. MEADE:       Thank you for the correction,

16   Justice Scalia.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, is your

18   position that the right to appeal is taken away, just as

19   under the current regime the motion to reopen is taken

20   away?

21                 MR. MEADE:       No, Chief Justice Roberts.            The

22   difference is that petitions for review can be

23   adjudicated from outside the country, so whether the

24   alien is here or abroad he can get an adjudication of

25   his motion -- of his petition for review, and that was a


                                         20

 1   change under the 1996 act.

 2                 The problem for motions to reopen is that an

 3   alien cannot receive an adjudication at all.                 He can't

 4   stay.     He can't go.     There's no way for those new facts.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's by regulation,

 6   though, that he can't, he cannot pursue that from out of

 7   the country.

 8                 MR. MEADE:        Yes, that's true.         That is

 9   not -- that is by regulation, although that regulation

10   applies to all motions to reopen, not just for the

11   subset of motions to reopen or voluntary departure

12   recipients.

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            If your client or some

14   other client, assuming the government wins in this case,

15   leaves within the 60-day period and the petition for

16   rehearing is forwarded, can he take all these affidavits

17   and apply for an adjustment of status, or is that much

18   longer?

19                 MR. MEADE:        No.      The problem is that for an

20   alien, for many aliens covered by voluntary departure,

21   once they leave the country they are subject to various

22   unlawful presence bars.           So by leaving the country these

23   bars are triggered and they cannot get the same relief

24   from outside the country.

25                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Even with voluntary

 1   departure?

 2                MR. MEADE:      Even with voluntary departure.

 3   Leaving the country triggers these bars.                 Once you're

 4   outside the country you cannot reapply for admission for

 5   in some cases up to 10 years, and that precludes the

 6   ability to leave the country and seek the relief, even

 7   if you have a marriage to a United States citizen, even

 8   if there are extreme circumstances in a particular case

 9   that need to be addressed and that would be addressed

10   under a motion to reopen.

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Do you have to argue

12   that the -- my understanding is that once the -- let's

13   say it's the government's proposed regulation and the

14   motion for -- or the voluntary departure is withdrawn to

15   enable you to consider the motion to reopen.                 They can

16   proceed with deportation at that time, correct?

17                MR. MEADE:      Absolutely.

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So you -- you almost

19   have to be arguing that the motion to reopen tolls the

20   time for deportation as well, right?

21                MR. MEADE:      No.       We just want -- under the,

22   under the question -- under the government's proposed

23   rule or under the --

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, under your

25   position, I guess, is what your position is on that.

 1                MR. MEADE:       Right.         Well, the tolling

 2   solution, the tolling construction, would permit tolling

 3   during the voluntary departure period and during the

 4   voluntary departure period there is no final order in

 5   effect.    So yes, it would toll the time for leaving the

 6   country.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 In other words, the

 8   government cannot enter a deportation order during a

 9   voluntary departure period.

10                MR. MEADE:       Yes.       That's governed by the

11   agency's own regulations that say that there's no -- the

12   ultimate order of deportation does not go into effect

13   until an overstay of a voluntary departure period.

14                One thing that is --

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:            So I'm not following this.

16   I thought the assumption was we're going to be using the

17   government's new proposed system, in which the

18   acceptance of voluntary departure is eliminated when you

19   file a reopening petition, right.                 So can the government

20   then proceed to deport you involuntarily or is that also

21   going to be stayed until, until completion of the

22   reopening petition?

23                MR. MEADE:       I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.

24   You're absolutely right.          I was addressing the tolling

25   construction with Mr. Chief Justice.                     But as to the


                                        23
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   government's proposed rule under the proposed rule and

 2   what my client asks for, the time -- the alien would be

 3   automatically subject to a final order and could be

 4   deported involuntarily so long as the alien did not get

 5   and obtain a stay of deportation from the agency or the

 6   court, so yes.

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:            And that, that involuntary

 8   deportation would effectively cancel the, the petition

 9   for reopening, right?

10              MR. MEADE:       If the agency acted quickly

11   enough and involuntarily deported someone within that

12   time --

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why are you willing to

14   leave the involuntary deportees in that position,

15   whereas you're not willing to leave the voluntary

16   deportees in that position, that their reopening

17   petition just vanishes?       Why is it any fairer for the

18   involuntary deportees than for the voluntary?           In fact

19   it's probably fairer for the voluntary because they made

20   their choice.

21              MR. MEADE:       Your Honor, I agree with you

22   that that regulation is problematic, although the Court

23   does not need to address it in this case.

24              With the court's permission, I would like to

25   reserve the balance of my time.

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

 2   Mr. Meade.

 4                     ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

 5                        ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 6                MR. KNEEDLER:          Mr. Chief Justice and may it

 7   please the Court:

 8                The filing of a motion to reopen does not

 9   automatically suspend the obligation of an alien to

10   leave the United States within the time that was

11   specified in the Board's order granting permission to

12   depart voluntarily.      The grant of voluntary departure

13   reflects an exchange of benefits between the government

14   and the alien and Petitioner's automatic tolling rule

15   would greatly subvert that reciprocal arrangement by

16   giving the alien the unilateral and automatic ability to

17   extend the substantive terms of the immigration relief

18   the --

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Kneedler, I think, I

20   think that your, your opposing counsel gave a good

21   answer to that.    I also thought it was a quid pro quo,

22   but it's a very strange quid pro quo.                    I could

23   understand the government saying, look, if you accept

24   voluntary departure your reopening is dead; you have to

25   choose between asking for reopening or voluntary

 1   departure.   But that's not the quid pro quo you're

 2   saying that the government is adopting.                   The quid pro

 3   quo is if you accept voluntary departure you roll the

 4   dice as to whether your reopening petition will be

 5   decided in time.     It isn't dead.              It's still there, but

 6   you just have to hope that it will be decided before you

 7   get deported.

 8                MR. KNEEDLER:           Well, let me make one --

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  That's a very

10   strange statutory quid pro quo, it seems to me.

11                MR. KNEEDLER:           Let me make one point clear

12   at the outset.     Petitioner's motion to reopen was not

13   dismissed because he was not able to file one.                  It was

14   denied because he was not eligible for the underlying

15   substantive relief that he requested in this motion.

16   Overstaying a voluntary departure period does not, for

17   example, bar an alien from obtaining asylum or

18   withholding of removal on a motion to reopen.                  It's only

19   the particular substantive form of relief that he

20   requested in his motion to reopen that is at issue, and

21   that was denied.

22                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, that may be.      But

23   Congress passed a statute that grants a statutory right

24   to file a motion to reopen no matter what the relief is.

25   And the thing that seems strange to me, I guess to carry


                                         26

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Justice Scalia's question one step further, is what

 2   seems strange to me is that Congress would have granted

 3   that right in effect across the board, regardless of

 4   what the reason for the reopening might be and yet would

 5   have done so knowing that the, that the time for

 6   adjudication before the IJ is likely to take longer than

 7   the period of the, prior to the moment of required

 8   departure.   It sounds as though Congress on your view

 9   would be -- would have been giving a right to reopen

10   that in practical terms in most cases will avail the

11   alien absolutely nothing because he'll have to get out

12   before there can be an adjudication.

13                MR. KNEEDLER:         With all respect, that's not

14   correct.

15                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Why?

16                MR. KNEEDLER:         Again, both prior to 1996 and

17   after 1996 Congress specified that an alien who

18   overstays the voluntary departure period is ineligible

19   for three forms of discretionary relief.                Now it's

20   voluntary departure, cancellation or removal, or

21   adjustment of status.      That was true both beforehand and

22   afterhand.   Before 1996, there was no statutory

23   limitation on the time for either a motion to reopen or

24   voluntary departure.      Congress was concerned about

25   abuses on both of those fronts, and what it did in 1996


                                       27
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   was to compress the voluntary departure time for 60 days

 2   because it was concerned about how long the agency was

 3   allowing agents -- aliens to remain in the country under

 4   orders of voluntary departure.                And what it did with

 5   respect to motions to reopen was very modest.                      It just

 6   put in statutory form a limitation that the agency had

 7   put in place pursuant to a statutory directive to place

 8   time and number limitations on motions to reopen because

 9   of Congress's concern about abuse.

10              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Okay, but isn't the

11   question in this case whether what Congress did was as

12   modest as you say?      Because if it is as modest as you

13   say, then in at least a substantial category of cases in

14   which a motion to reopen will be filed, it will in fact

15   be no time in the real world to act on that motion

16   before the voluntary departure date.                      And the question

17   is did Congress really intend a right to reopen that is

18   as modest as that.

19              MR. KNEEDLER:             Well --

20              JUSTICE SOUTER:               And it seems strange that

21   it would have.

22              MR. KNEEDLER:             Two responses to that.              With

23   respect to the voluntary departure, Congress anticipated

24   that the alien was going to leave under the order of

25   voluntary departure, not remain here.                     And prior to


                                         28

 1   1996, just to --

 2                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, it was -- was the

 3   regulation -- was the current regulation in place at the

 4   time of the '96 Act, that the -- that the departure of

 5   the alien, whatever the term is, waives the motion to --

 6                MR. KNEEDLER:         That regulation has been a

 7   fundamental part of motions to reopen going back at

 8   least until the 1960s.

 9                JUSTICE SOUTER:           So, we assume that Congress

10   knew that.

11                MR. KNEEDLER:         Yes.      Yes, we do have.   And

12   that's part of the arrangement.              The only thing -- and

13   that regulation was repromulgated as part of General

14   Motion to Reopen Regulation in 1995.

15                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Okay, then Congress knew at

16   the time of the '96 Act that, if in fact the motion to

17   reopen was filed in the normal course, it probably

18   couldn't be heard prior to the date at which (a) the

19   alien either will overstay and be in trouble for that or

20   (b) will have departed and, under the existing

21   regulatory regime, have forfeited his right to reopen.

22   And it's the strangeness that Congress would want --

23   would have wanted to extend the right to reopen to a

24   statutory level under these circumstances unless it

25   contemplated some kind of a tolling scheme that would


                                       29

 1   avoid this sort of Kafka-esque result.

 2                 MR. KNEEDLER:          No.      Again, if I may, the --

 3   what Congress had in mind with the deal of granting

 4   voluntary departure was it greatly constricted the time

 5   to leave.     You have to leave in 60 days, and if you

 6   don't leave in 60 days, you're not going to get

 7   voluntary departure adjustment of status or cancellation

 8   or removal.     It didn't affect the eligibility for other

 9   substantive relief that an alien might file for in a

10   motion to reopen, such as asylum, such as if he has new

11   evidence going to the ground of removal.                  But Congress

12   was particularly concerned not to allow these three

13   forms of discretionary relief to remain available.                  And

14   so I think Congress necessarily would have been

15   unconcerned about whether, if an alien did file a motion

16   to reopen within that greatly constricted 60-day period

17   -- in fact, in this case the Board gave 30 days --

18   Congress wasn't concerned about preserving the

19   underlying substantive eligibility for those forms of

20   discretionary relief, because it made that part of the

21   deal, that alien was giving up if he left -- if he

22   didn't leave the country, he was giving up that.                  Those

23   were lesser order forms of relief that Congress was

24   making available, but it did did not take away, for

25   example, the right to apply for asylum or withholding.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Mr. Kneedler, why did the

 2   Government advise this Court not to grant cert on

 3   question number 1, which was:               I want to apply to reopen

 4   and simultaneously, I want to withdraw my voluntary

 5   departure and be just like any other removable alien,

 6   take my chances just like anyone else?                     The Government

 7   said don't present that -- Court, don't consider that

 8   question.   Why?

 9               MR. KNEEDLER:            Because that had not been --

10   led to widespread litigation in the courts.                     This

11   automatic tolling rule is -- was what we were

12   fundamentally concerned about.                In fact, we told the

13   Court not to take the case at all because the new

14   regulations were under consideration.                     But that

15   particular provision -- issue has not generated that

16   much litigation.     This automatic tolling rule has, and

17   more than --

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               And it seems that this

19   litigant said, number one, I don't want to take

20   advantage of the status of I have to get out, but I can

21   do so voluntarily.      The first thing I want to do is to

22   move to reopen, withdraw my voluntary departure.                       And

23   then the second thing was, if I can't do that, please

24   extend my voluntary departure time while I move to

25   reopen.   It seems that this litigant is being put in a

 1   bind by not allowing this Court to consider what was the

 2   alien's first preference, that is, to withdraw the

 3   voluntary departure.

 4              MR. KNEEDLER:           But the Court rewrote the

 5   question presented so as not to -- not to address that,

 6   so I think it's not before the Court right here.                  But --

 7   but beyond that, the deal, the arrangement -- the

 8   Attorney General has a lot of discretion how to

 9   implement the voluntary departure provision.                  In fact,

10   he has the authority to eliminate voluntary departure

11   for additional categories of people who are not eligible

12   under the statute itself.          So whether to --

13              JUSTICE ALITO:           What is the basis for the

14   rule that an alien can't withdraw, can't seek to

15   withdraw a request for voluntary departure?

16              MR. KNEEDLER:           The regulations do not

17   provide for it, and it's inconsistent with the --

18              JUSTICE ALITO:           There is no regulation that

19   prohibits it.   Is that right?

20              MR. KNEEDLER:           As far as I'm aware there is

21   no regulation that prohibits it, but the order is a

22   grant of voluntary departure, and the Board of

23   Immigration Appeals order says you're granted permission

24   to depart voluntarily within 30 days; if you do not, the

25   following consequences flow from that.                  Nothing in the


                                       32

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Board's order would allow the alien to avoid those

 2   consequences by saying on the 28th day, after all I

 3   don't want to do that.       And this matter of implementing

 4   the voluntary departure agreement is part of a general

 5   scheme of a quid pro quo between the alien and the

 6   United States.   The voluntary departure is granted under

 7   circumstances where the alien doesn't have that option.

 8   So unilaterally -- allowing the alien unilaterally to do

 9   that now is not provided for.             Now, that doesn't -- that

10   doesn't take away from the Attorney General's

11   discretionary authority in implementing the Act to

12   provide for that, which is what he has proposed in the

13   new rule.   But this case has to be decided under the --

14   under the rules that are now in effect.

15               JUSTICE BREYER:            I'm having a lot of trouble

16   understanding the case, because it's so complicated.                 If

17   you -- could you track it through for a minute?                 I mean,

18   as I understand this, this probably doesn't concern

19   people who want to voluntarily depart before their case

20   is finished, right?     Where they don't reopen because

21   there is nothing to reopen?

22               MR. KNEEDLER:          Right, but the people --

23               JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay.       So we're at a person

20   say go, good-bye, and we'll give you some good deals

21   here if you'll really go, but you pursue your appeals.

22                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Does not he lose his right

23   to have the motion to reopen ruled upon?

 1              JUSTICE BREYER:               So you lose all your

 2   appeals, not just your motion-to-reopen appeals if you

 3   leave the country?

 4              MR. KNEEDLER:             Your administrative appeals.

 5   You do not -- the statute has been amended to allow you

 6   to petition for review in a court if you leave the

 7   country.

 8              JUSTICE BREYER:               Oh.     Okay.       So you say --

 9              MR. KNEEDLER:             Yes.      Which was a change from

10   what was before this Court in Stone.                      In 1996 Congress

11   amended the Act to allow an alien to continue to

12   challenge the final removal order after he leaves the

13   country in court.

14              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Yes, but you can't get to

15   court if you haven't been to the BIA, right?

16              MR. KNEEDLER:             I believe -- I believe that's

17   true unless --

18              JUSTICE SOUTER:               And, again, we are talking

19   about a short period of time, like 30 days.                      In

20   practical terms there's no way he is going to get

21   through the BIA in 30 days.              And, therefore, when he

22   leaves the country, he cannot then try to get or

23   complete his BIA review, and he therefore will have no

24   chance to get into court, right?

25              MR. KNEEDLER:             I think that -- I think that


                                         36

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   would be correct unless -- I don't think this has ever

 2   come up that I'm aware of, about whether you could go to

 3   court from an immigration judge's decision where you've

 4   left the country and therefore can't appeal to the BIA.

 5              JUSTICE SOUTER:            There's no reason to assume

 6   that you could.

 7              MR. KNEEDLER:          I just don't know the answer

 8   -- I just don't know the answer to that, because I'm not

 9   sure that scenario has come up, because usually, if

10   somebody wants to contest, they're not going to leave

11   the country before they have to, and if you appeal from

12   the immigration judge to the Board of Immigration

13   Appeals, that suspends the finality of the order of

14   removal or the order of voluntary departure that the

15   immigration judge has entered.             So if you appeal -- if

16   you want to stay in the country, all you have to do is

17   file an automatic appeal with the Board of Immigration

18   Appeals and that suspends the finality of the departure

19   time.

20              JUSTICE SOUTER:            And by doing that you do

21   preserve your right to appeal; and you will preserve

22   your -- will you also preserve your right to go to court

23   if you lose in front of the BIA.

24              MR. KNEEDLER:          Yes.      Yes.       You do.

25              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       We got that

 1   straight.

 2               MR. KNEEDLER:           Yes.      I'm sorry.     I'm not --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:             So why, if you want to have

 4   a petition for reopening, why don't you just file an

 5   appeal and then file a petition for reopening and the

 6   appeal will enable you to stay in the country until your

 7   -- your petition for reopening is --

 8               MR. KNEEDLER:           If you appeal to the Board of

 9   Immigration Appeals, a motion to reopen arises only

10   after the Board has issued a final order on your appeal.

11   So if you appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals, if

12   the Board rejects your claim on the merit, and

13   reinstates the voluntary departure period to allow you

14   to enter again --

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:             You're appealing the

16   immigration judge's decision.

17               MR. KNEEDLER:           Right.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:             The immigration judge's

19   decision, you're appealing that to the BIA.

20               MR. KNEEDLER:           Right.

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:             And that -- that enables

22   you to stay in the country --

23               MR. KNEEDLER:           Yes.      Until the --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:             And at the same time you

25   file a petition to reopen the -- the administrative law

 1   judge's --

 2                MR. KNEEDLER:           With the immigration judge.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Yes.

 4                MR. KNEEDLER:           I -- I suppose you could do

 5   that, but the -- but the appeal -- it would be like a

 6   motion to reopen in the district court while you've got

 7   an appeal to the -- to the BIA.                 I -- I think once the

 8   appeal goes to the Board -- this case involves motions

 9   to reopen filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals,

10   not with the immigration judge, and so -- the alien here

11   conceded his deportability, sought a continuance, and

12   that was denied.     He had no other substantive grounds of

13   relief.    He asked for voluntary departure.              That was

14   granted.    He took an appeal to the BIA arguing he should

15   have been granted a continuance; the Board affirmed;

16   reinstated a 30-day departure period; and then he wanted

17   to seek reopening.

18                And one question that Justice Breyer asked

19   about, what if reopening is denied would the automatic

20   tolling rule continue?         I suppose the alien could file a

21   motion to reconsider the denial of the motion to reopen,

22   and if you had an automatic tolling rule, it would -- it

23   would last as long as it took the Board to act on the

24   motion to reopen, which is -- which 60, 90, 120 days.

25   In this past Fiscal Year the Board on motions to reopen


                                         39
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   resolved I think only about 55 percent of those within

 2   90 days.   The Board has a huge backlog, and we're

 3   talking -- and so we are talking about the very kind of

 4   abuse of the immigration system that this Court was

 5   concerned about --

 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:               May I ask one question?

 7   And I'm not sure the progression in which Justice Breyer

 8   was going to begin.       I take it that the motion to reopen

 9   has -- shows new evidence, new factors, new

10   circumstances; and that would be unavailable on the

11   appeal, because the record hasn't been supplemented.                 Or

12   am I wrong about that?

13               MR. KNEEDLER:            That -- that's true.      It has

14   --

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              While you have an appeal

16   -- while you have an appeal from what was in the record.

17               MR. KNEEDLER:            Right, although --

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              If you don't have the

19   motion to reopen then the -- then the new material is

20   not subject to the appeal, or am I wrong?

21               MR. KNEEDLER:            No.      It's not subject to the

22   appeal as such but the Board procedures take account of

23   developments that happen while the case is on appeal,

24   which is that you can file with the Board while your

25   appeal is pending and ask for a motion to remand on the


                                         40

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   ground that new evidence has come up.                   For example, in

 2   the case of adjustment of status, where -- the alien's

 3   wife has filed a petition for immediate relative status

 4   to let the alien get a visa, if while the case is

 5   pending on appeal that petition has been granted, then

 6   -- then it would -- then all the alien has to do is file

 7   a motion with the Board and say there is new

 8   information; please remand it back to the immigration

 9   judge.   So a lot of times what has happened is -- maybe

10   intervening things have happened but the alien doesn't

11   do anything about it during the year that the appeal is

12   pending with the Board of Immigration Appeals; then

13   there is a final order and the alien rushes in with the

14   -- with the new information at that point, where if you

15   had only brought it to the attention of the Board while

16   the appeal was pending, it could have been remanded.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:            So your basic is -- don't

18   tell me if I'm right if I'm wrong, please.                  The --

19   the -- what I'm thinking your basic problem or position

20   is and why you've got into this, is because you think

21   any really meritorious case where there should be

22   reopening will be pointed out to the Board before there

23   is a final order in effect and before voluntary

24   departure becomes an issue?

25               MR. KNEEDLER:          That -- that --


                                       41

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:           And if we decide against

 2   you, then you're thinking, well, what will happen in

 3   every case is after there is a final order, the alien

 4   will move for a motion to reopen because he will get a

 5   few extra days.

 6                 MR. KNEEDLER:         It's more than a few extra

 7   days.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:           He gets a -- several --

 9                 MR. KNEEDLER:         It's an automatic tolling

10   period.

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Have I got it right, what

12   your point is?

13                 MR. KNEEDLER:         Yes.      That is correct and I

14   -- and I think it's fair to say if you're talking about

15   changed circumstances or new evidence that arises after

16   the IJ has rendered his decision, that's a period that

17   might be a year; it might be a year and a half.               New

18   developments or changed circumstances are far more

19   likely to have happened during that period of time than

20   they would during a 30-day period of voluntary departure

21   that -- that the Board reinstates at the conclusion of

22   the appeal.

23                 So an alien in this position who has been

24   granted voluntary departure and knows that a motion to

25   reopen may not be a realistic option, if he wants to

 1   seek adjustment of status or cancellation of removal,

 2   the solution to that is to be alert and attentive and

 3   file something with the Board, if there are in fact --

 4              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Why isn't the solution to

 5   withdraw, relinquish the voluntary departure?

 6              MR. KNEEDLER:             That would be -- that would

 7   be one -- as the Attorney General said in his proposed

 8   regulations, that would be one way to administer the

 9   program, but the Act does not compel that.                   The Act does

10   not compel --

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    If you do that, the

12   alien is still subject to deportation, right?

13              MR. KNEEDLER:             Yes.      The alien is still

14   subject to deportation.

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                With the provision that

16   he can get a stay.

17              MR. KNEEDLER:             Yes, he could get -- he could

18   get a stay of removal, and the same -- same thing is

19   true here, if the -- if the alien remains in the

20   country, his voluntary departure period expires, he

21   could file for a stay of removal with the Board or he

22   could file for a stay of removal with the court of

23   appeals if he wants to file a petition.

24              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                But then because he would

25   then be back -- if he stays here after the period is


                                         43

 1   run, then he has relinquished the voluntary departure.

 2   He is like any removable --

 3              MR. KNEEDLER:             Right.        Right.   But -- but

 4   like any person, he could file a motion for a stay with

 5   the court of appeals to prevent his deportation.

 6              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                But not to stay -- but he

 7   would not be hanging on to his voluntary departure.

 8   That's gone.

 9              MR. KNEEDLER:             No, that -- that is correct.

10              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Is there any reason he

11   could not unilaterally relinquish the voluntary

12   departure status as distinct from having to get approval

13   from the Board or bureaucrat?

14              MR. KNEEDLER:             Well, as I say, the way that

15   -- the Board's order grants him permission to voluntary

16   depart and says the following consequences will attach

17   if you do not.     Nothing in the Board's order allows him

18   to withdraw.     It grants him that permission.

19              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Well, I know it doesn't --

20   it doesn't address the issue, and my question is --

21              MR. KNEEDLER:             Well, I think it probably

22   forecloses it.

23              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Why?

24              MR. KNEEDLER:             Because it's the -- it's the

25   content of the Board's order that -- that says you have

 1   60 days to depart and if you do not, the following

 2   consequences attach.

 3                JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, but the Board is

 4   saying, look, I'm granting your request -- we are

 5   granting your request for a voluntary departure status

 6   and there are certain consequences that that status

 7   carries.    He is saying, on my hypothesis, I relinquish

 8   that status.    Why are conditions that attach when he has

 9   the status an indication that he cannot voluntarily

10   relinquish that status without further action by the

11   Board?

12                MR. KNEEDLER:          I -- I -- the statute and

13   regulations just don't provide for it.

14                JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, if they don't provide

15   for it, and they don't say you can't do it, why isn't it

16   arbitrary not to let him do it?               I mean -- what -- if

17   it's -- if it's arbitrary --

18                MR. KNEEDLER:          He -- he requested it at the

19   outset.    The case has proceeded on the sense that that

20   is -- that that is the arrangement, that -- that the

21   reciprocal benefits and burdens that the Government and

22   the alien have undertaken --

23                JUSTICE BREYER:            It sounds almost arbitrary

24   to say to a person, look, if you think you have some new

25   evidence and want to reopen, do it.                      But Congress wanted

 1   you to get out of here in respect to this 60 days, so

 2   you have to give up that.            You're not getting those

 3   benefits.     Now, it's a tough bargain, but it seems

 4   reasonable.

 5                 MR. KNEEDLER:          Yes, I --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:            What I don't see is to say

 7   once you ask for this you can never get status

 8   adjustment.

 9                 MR. KNEEDLER:          Yes.      I'm not standing here

10   defending the contrary position as an overarching policy

11   matter, because after all the Attorney General's

12   proposed regulations provide for that.                    My --

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:            So why not apply them to

14   this person?

15                 MR. KNEEDLER:          As they are now drafted they

16   would apply prospectively.            But my only point is that

17   voluntary departure and motions to reopen are

18   administered under the statute and the regulations and

19   the BIA orders that are entered under the current

20   regulatory framework, which has a different sort of deal

21   between the alien and the government in mind, and that

22   --

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Which you say -- you say

24   that under the current regime, the voluntary departure

25   application, granted, is irrevocable.                     That's --

 1                 MR. KNEEDLER:          I think essentially -- I

 2   think essentially yes.         I --

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The regulations don't say

 4   that.     The regulations are just blank.                    It doesn't say

 5   and if you do this it's irrevocable.

 6                 MR. KNEEDLER:          Yes.      And I want to qualify

 7   my answer in a further respect -- that regulations with

 8   respect to voluntary departure being granted by the

 9   Board don't say anything like that.                       But I am informed

10   by the executive office of immigration review that if

11   the immigration judge grants voluntary departure and the

12   alien appeals to the Board, the ordinary course would be

13   for the Board to reinstate voluntary departure if it

14   rejects the alien's appeal.              But if on appeal the alien

15   requests that voluntary departure not be reinstated once

16   the Board's order is entered, then the Board will omit

17   that from its final order of removal.

18                 But Petitioner here did not request on his

19   appeal to the Board that the Board not reinstate a --

20   order a voluntary departure if it had affirmed on the

21   merits.    And so the Board went forward on the assumption

22   that the alien had requested voluntary departure,

23   entered an order on that assumption, and once it's

24   entered, it's a final order that would require some

25   amendment of the order, in order to -- in order to be

 1   changed under the current regime.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBERG:            But the order didn't say

 3   he couldn't withdraw?

 4                 MR. KNEEDLER:         No, it didn't.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So what about this?    I'm

 6   just trying this out.       You don't have to respond if you

 7   don't want to.    But you say, look, the AG in his rules

 8   here, really tried to reconcile the two interests that

 9   we talked about in our prior conversation.               Now

10   hypothetically, I suppose you say that was a reasonable

11   way of going about this, and we remand for consideration

12   about whether this prior situation that you couldn't do

13   that was arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion, or

14   your failure to apply it retroactively to a certain

15   class of people was arbitrary, capricious, abusive

16   discretion?

17                 MR. KNEEDLER:         I think -- I think if the

18   Court wants to get into the question of whether he could

19   withdraw it, the proper thing for the Court to do would

20   be to reject the Petitioner's argument that there is an

21   automatic tolling rule, because that's fundamentally

22   inconsistent with Congress' deliberate intention to

23   impose a short deadline and not let the agency extend

24   that, but to remand to the Board of Immigration Appeals

25   for an explanation as to whether he could withdraw his

 1   request for voluntary departure.

 2                 I don't think the Court should decide that

 3   question on its own.        I think that should be remanded to

 4   the Board.     If in the meantime the Attorney General

 5   issues regulations that provide for withdrawal of the

 6   request, maybe because his case would be back before the

 7   Board, those new regulations could be applied.                But

 8   whether that -- the alien should be allowed to do that

 9   is fundamentally a question for the Attorney General in

10   the first instance.

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            In one of your -- in one

12   of your arguments earlier you said the whole idea of

13   voluntary departure is to expedite the proceedings and

14   so forth.     I assume that voluntary departure is never

15   elected as an option before the Board rules.

16                 MR. KNEEDLER:          It is --

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            In other words, it -- or

18   am I wrong?

19                 MR. KNEEDLER:          No.      It was elected before

20   the immigration judge.         That's where you request it.           If

21   the immigration judge rejects your arguments against

22   removability, grants you voluntary departure --

23                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Yes, but the removal -- at

24   the outset, you don't elect voluntary departure at the

25   outset of the hearing?

 1                MR. KNEEDLER:         You can.             And you can get 120

 2   days of time to depart.        You can do that.               People who

 3   don't want to contest the removability at all --

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           No, no, no.           I mean in a

 5   contested case.

 6                MR. KNEEDLER:         Right.        In the contested

 7   cases, you would ask for that at the conclusion of the

 8   hearing before the immigration judge.                    That gets

 9   suspended if you appeal to the BIA because the order is

10   not final.   It doesn't become final until the Board of

11   Immigration Appeals affirms.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Mr. Kneedler, do you

13   know what percentage of these motions to reopen are

14   granted?

15                MR. KNEEDLER:         I do not.            I asked that

16   question, and I do not know the answer to that.

17                I would like to come back to the fundamental

18   automatic tolling rule that -- the fundamental

19   inconsistency of that automatic tolling rule with what

20   Congress did in 1996, because it shortened to 60 days

21   the time limit in which an alien can depart.

22                It also eliminated a prior exception that

23   had been the law that allowed an exception to the

24   consequences for somebody who overstayed even the much

25   longer voluntary departure period for exceptional


                                       50

 1   circumstances.   Congress repealed that exception.

 2                Prior to 1996, the Board in the case we cite

 3   in our briefs called Matter of Shaar, held that if an

 4   alien is granted voluntary departure and files a motion

 5   to reopen, it rejected two arguments.                   One is that the

 6   filing of a motion to reopen was itself exceptional

 7   circumstances that eliminated the deadline.                   It rejected

 8   that.   It also in an en banc decision rejected the

 9   automatic tolling rule that Petitioner is arguing for

10   here under a situation in which Congress had granted a

11   long time for aliens to voluntarily depart.

12                We think it defies common sense to suggest

13   that when Congress compressed the time to 60 days, it

14   meant to at the same time reverse what the Board had

15   done in Matter of Shaar and granted an automatic tolling

16   rule, not even one under the control of the immigration

17   authorities, but an automatic tolling rule as a matter

18   of law simply by the unilateral act of filing a motion

19   to reopen.

20                And the Board in Matter of Shaar addressed

21   all of those things.      The Board of Immigration Appeals

22   has filed, followed Matter of Shaar, in the intervening

23   years since 1997 -- and importantly, I would like to

24   point this out, too, when Petitioner sought a motion for

25   reopening, he relied on a Board decision called


                                       51

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Villarde, which recognized that in some circumstances an

 2   alien may file a motion to reopen to try to get

 3   adjustment of status if there has been intervening

 4   development with respect to an immediate relative

 5   petition filed by a spouse.

 6              The Board adopted that rule in this en banc

 7   published decision Villarde, but said one of the

 8   qualifications for being eligible for that relief is

 9   that you not be barred under Matter of Shaar, which

10   means you not be barred by having overstayed your

11   voluntary departure period.

12              So, in the very procedure that Petitioner

13   invoked in this case, there is a published Board

14   decision post-1997 that relies on that -- that relies on

15   that rationale, and the Board has followed that

16   consistently.   It is at the very least a reasonable

17   interpretation of the act for the Attorney General not

18   to allow the undermining of this tightened voluntary

19   departure system by providing for reopening.

20              I should also point out that this is not

21   tolling in the normal sense.            Tolling usually arises

22   where a person has a claim and there is a statute of

23   limitations for filing a claim before a forum.

24              Petitioner here was already granted

25   voluntary departure.      The 60-day time limit is not a

 1   procedural statute of limitations.                 It is a limitation

 2   on substantive immigration relief.                 And we think it's

 3   particularly odd that the filing of a procedural motion

 4   to reopen would have the effect of changing the

 5   statutorily limited time in which an alien could

 6   voluntarily depart the United States.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

10            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE

11                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12                MR. MEADE:      The government's arguments on

13   the statutory interpretation in this case are undermined

14   by its own proposed rule for at least five reasons.

15                First, their proposed rule makes clear that

16   the government agrees that the statute can be read to

17   have multiple meanings.

18                Second, the proposed rule makes clear that

19   Congress did not intend voluntary departure recipients

20   to waive the motion to reopen in accepting voluntary

21   departure.

22                Third, the rule stresses the importance of

23   motions to reopen and their importance in bringing

24   changed facts to the agency's attention.

25                Fourth, the proposed rule turns on

 1   unilateral action of the alien and permits that

 2   unilateral action to terminate the voluntary departure

 3   grant.

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Do you agree with counsel

 5   for the government as to how long it typically takes for

 6   these motions to reopen to be disposed of?                 He said

 7   something like 55 percent take, what, more than --

 8              MR. MEADE:       My understanding is that the

 9   time, that the time is actually relatively short, that

10   they are generally decided within 90 days.                 They're

11   procedures passed by the -- by regulation which indicate

12   that they go to the same Board member.                 There has been

13   streamlining procedures by the agency in the early 2000,

14   2001, 2002 period which helped expedite these.                 And

15   actually, the time --

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Do you have any

17   estimate about how many more motions to reopen will have

18   to be considered if your client prevails in this case?

19              MR. MEADE:       I do not think that there will

20   be many additional motions to reopen, if that happens.

21   Certainly, if the government has a -- if the proposed

22   rule is adopted, the number of motions to reopen will

23   not be affected, because prospectively, the solution --

24   the problem will have been solved, and this case we'll

25   only be dealing with people in the pipeline, people who


                                      54
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   have already made decisions about whether to file a

 2   motion to reopen or not.

 3               So assuming that the government's proposed

 4   rule is enacted in anything like its proposed form, then

 5   there will be no problem going forward.

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  No, I don't

 7   understand that, because my -- as I understand it, it

 8   would in every case grant an effective extension of the

 9   time which you would have to depart if you had filed a

10   motion to reopen.

11               MR. MEADE:        No, that's not correct, with

12   respect.   Under the government's proposed rule, the

13   alien would be placed in the same position as other

14   aliens and would be -- and there would be no additional

15   incentive to file a motion to reopen.

16               Under the government's proposed rule, the

17   period would not toll, the voluntary departure grant

18   would expire, and the alien would be placed in the same

19   position as otherwise --

20               JUSTICE ALITO:           Isn't it your position that

21   the statute requires tolling?

22               MR. MEADE:        Our interpretation is the

23   statute is subject to multiple interpretations.                   But the

24   one thing that the statute does not permit is the

25   solution, the construction that's being proposed by the

 1   government in this case.           The government -- the statute

 2   would permit tolling.        The statute permits reconciling

 3   the provisions as the government proposes going forward.

 4   But the one thing that the statute does not permit is

 5   the government's position in this particular litigation.

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You answered my

 7   question with respect to the government's proposed

 8   regulation.     But under your position that would allow

 9   the voluntary departure option to remain open, then

10   anyone who exercised that option would want to file a

11   motion to reopen because it would extend their time?

12                 MR. MEADE:       The motions to reopen are

13   subject to statutory and regulatory limits.                   Moreover,

14   the time period --

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 The answer is yes?

16                 MR. MEADE:       I'm saying that there -- aliens

17   could choose to do so, but I disagree that there would

18   be a -- many additional motions to reopen.

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Your answer is yes, but the

20   Attorney General's rule would prevent that -- proposed

21   rule would --

22                 MR. MEADE:       Yes.       That's part of the answer,

23   yes, Justice Scalia.

24                 But in addition, the length of time of

25   adjudication is entirely within the agency's control.

 1   It can take two days, two weeks, two months, or if it

 2   takes longer --

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Not if it has 10,000

 4   of these a year, as you told me in your opening

 5   argument.   I mean, it takes some time to address them.

 6   You can't say all they have to do is decide them all

 7   within two days.

 8               MR. MEADE:       No.       But the answer is that

 9   there -- it is within their control, so the length of

10   tolling under any tolling rule is not within the control

11   of the alien.   It's within the control of the agency.

12               This Court -- as to your question, Justice

13   Alito, on the -- with the regulations with respect to

14   withdraw in this case, the agency is silent on that.

15   It's unclear to me why the agency -- may I finish --

16   it's unclear why the agency did not give my client the

17   request he requested, and we ask that this Court either

18   grant tolling or interpret the statute consistent with

19   the government's proposed rule.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

21   The case is submitted.
