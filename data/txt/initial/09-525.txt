 7                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. PERRY

 8                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9                 MR. PERRY:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                 Affirming the judgment below would authorize

12   private securities fraud class actions against every

13   service provider that participates in the drafting of a

14   public company's prospectus.            It is, therefore, nothing

15   less than a frontal assault on this Court's decisions in

16   Central Bank and Stoneridge.

17                 In those cases, Your Honors, this Court held

18   that service providers may not be sued primarily in

19   private class actions and left that matter for Congress

20   to resolve.    And Congress did respond, not once, not

21   twice, but three times, to those decisions.

22                 First, in the PSLRA, the Congress authorized

23   a Federal action, a government action, only against

24   aiders and abettors, leaving the question of private

25   class actions for this Court's resolution.

 1                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Counsel, is -- who's the

 2   violator alleged here?       Not in the complaint, but in the

 3   briefs?    As I read the briefs, they claim that Janus

 4   itself did not make the false statement, that the two

 5   appellants did, that they are the actual speakers

 6   because they were talking about their activities, and

 7   they used Janus as a conduit to deceive the market.

 8   That's, I think, what they're alleging.

 9                 MR. PERRY:     Justice Sotomayor, the

10   challenged statements appear in the prospectuses for the

11   Janus Funds, separate legal entities not parties to this

12   lawsuit.

13                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          So how do we sustain the

14   intermediary cases when the company, through market

15   analysts, divulges misleading statements?            We don't talk

16   about the market analysts' falsity; we talk about the

17   company's falsity, because the market analysts didn't

18   have scienter.

19                 MR. PERRY:     Your Honor, the company -

20   excuse me -- the conduit or analyst cases fall under two

21   categories, neither of which is met here.

22                 First, they are a scheme between the

23   company -- orchestrated by the company to distribute its

24   information through the analysts to the market, and they

25   are brought under 10b-5(a) as scheme cases.            That is

                                     4
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   most of the analyst cases.          There is no 10b-5(a) claim

 2   in this case.    This is only a 10b-5(b) "making" claim.

 3                Second, those few cases, the analyst cases,

 4   that are brought under (b) involve an omission; that is,

 5   the company has failed to correct a statement made by an

 6   analyst where there is a duty to do so.             There is no

 7   omission claim in this case because there is no duty -

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           But what's the

 9   difference between an omission or a commission if a

10   company purposely divulges a falsehood to an analyst,

11   knowing it's going to be distributed in toto?              So who's

12   making the false statement, the analyst or the company?

13                MR. PERRY:      Your Honor, the company makes

14   the statement to the market.            Under Basic, the analyst

15   is the market.    It is the ears of the market that takes

16   information -

17                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So why isn't -- why

18   aren't the two appellants, on their theory, on -- we can

19   talk about whether the complaint does or does not

20   adequately allege their theory.             That's a different

21   issue.   I accept that.

22                But under their theory, why isn't the

23   appellants the primary violator, not even a secondary?

24   Because they -- they claim, I think -- and I'm going to

25   find out from them -- that Janus had no scienter, that

                                     5

 1   it didn't make the false statements, that all of this

 2   was done in secret by the appellants, so they were the

 3   only violator.

 4                 MR. PERRY:     Your Honor, the analyst cases,

 5   the issuer speaks to the market directly.             Here, there

 6   is an intervening legal entity, the Janus Funds.

 7   Scienter or no scienter, that is a separate

 8   corporation -

 9                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Do you mean to say to me

10   that puppets become a legal defense for someone who

11   intentionally manipulates the market information?

12                 MR. PERRY:     Justice Sotomayor, the Congress

13   has drafted two statutes that deal with puppets.

14   Section 20(b), which these plaintiffs have not invoked,

15   makes it unlawful for one party to do indirectly what it

16   would not be permitted to do directly.             That's the

17   puppet statute, the ventriloquist dummy statute.

18                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           That's the control

19   person statute?

20                 MR. PERRY:     No.        There's also 20(a), which

21   is the control person statute, also not invoked by these

22   plaintiffs.

23                 Those are forms of secondary liability, Your

24   Honor.   In fact, the Court's questions go to the

25   distinction between primary and secondary liability.

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            But I -- but if Janus

 2   had no scienter, if its board of directors did not know

 3   that the statements were false, they had no way of

 4   knowing, because as I understand the complaint -- and

 5   this is alleged -- the deal was secret.                 So Janus itself

 6   could not be a primary violator.              Who is?

 7                MR. PERRY:       Justice Sotomayor, our position

 8   is nobody had scienter, and every adjudicator to look at

 9   these facts -- Judge Motz in the district court, the ALJ

10   of the SEC -- has found that there was no scienter

11   anywhere up and down the line.             So the fact that

12   somebody didn't have scienter doesn't answer the problem

13   here.    The question -

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Well, somebody deviated

15   from what was the announced policy, that there was to be

16   no market timers investing in this -- in these Janus

17   funds.   Somebody made the decision that certain hedge

18   funds would be allowed to engage in that activity.                 Who

19   was that somebody?

20                MR. PERRY:       The adviser personnel made the

21   determination, Justice Ginsburg, that the policy was

22   discretionary, that when it said we may refuse trades,

23   the funds may refuse trades, that there are -

24   discretion -

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Well, the statement

                                      7
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that's alleged to have been -- the conduct that is

 2   alleged to have been in opposition to the announced

 3   policy, that is attributable squarely to -- what you -

 4   this is the entity you called JCM?

 5                MR. PERRY:       That's correct, Your Honor -

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So it made the decision

 7   that violated the policy?

 8                MR. PERRY:       That's correct, Your Honor.       And

 9   the SEC -

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Nonetheless, it's not a

11   primary actor?

12                MR. PERRY:       Not as to these plaintiffs, Your

13   Honor.   The SEC -

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But can -- can we discuss

15   the case, and -- and perhaps you don't think so.             Can't

16   we discuss this case, must we not discuss this case, on

17   the theory that JCM's scienter, JCM's knowledge of a

18   false statement, is a given in the case?

19                Now, maybe you'll be able to prove

20   otherwise.   You say that they're not liable anyway.

21                MR. PERRY:       Justice Kennedy, you're exactly

22   right.   That is the theory pleaded in the complaint.

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And it seems to me that's

24   what the argument here is mostly about.

25                MR. PERRY:       And the question that is before

 1   this Court, we would submit, is whether, scienter or no

 2   scienter, JCM can be held liable for the statements in

 3   another company's prospectus.            This Court has never

 4   held -

 5                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Even though there was no

 6   scheme with another actor?          Even though it was the only

 7   violator, which is a -

 8                 MR. PERRY:     No -

 9                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          -- fair reading of the

10   complaint.

11                 MR. PERRY:     They chose not to bring a scheme

12   case.    And remember, there is a second set of investors

13   here:    the fund investors.        The SEC brought an action,

14   secured $100 million on behalf of them.            There was a

15   series of private litigation that has been resolved,

16   brought by those investors.

17                 These investors did not purchase the

18   securities offered by the -- the prospectus they

19   challenge.    And, again, there's a fundamental disconnect

20   between the defendant in the case and the challenged

21   misstatements.

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:          But, once again -- once

23   again, if the complainants in the case, the plaintiffs

24   in the case -- hypothetical case, not this case,

25   hypothetical case -- were injured shareholders in the

                                     9

 1   fund, I take it you say still they could not sue JCM?

 2                  MR. PERRY:     Your Honor, for different

 3   reasons.     They can sue JCM for -- for an omission,

 4   because there's a duty that runs from JCM to the funds.

 5   That was the theory advanced in that separate lawsuit

 6   accepted by the district court, which has since been

 7   resolved.

 8                  They can't -- these plaintiffs can't bring

 9   an omission case, because there's no duty that runs from

10   JCM out to the JCG shareholders.              The district court

11   held that.     They didn't appeal that to the Fourth

12   Circuit.     They didn't present that in their cert

13   petition.     So they can't bring that omissions case.

14                  Any wrongdoing in this case -- Justice

15   Ginsburg, to finish my answer to your question, the

16   policy says funds are not intended for market timing.

17   The adviser allowed 12 traders to trade frequently.                The

18   only wrongdoing, if there is any wrongdoing, was the

19   failure of the adviser to disclose to the trustees the

20   deviation from the policy.           That is a State law breach

21   of contract.     It may be a breach of fiduciary duty.

22                  JUSTICE KAGAN:        Well, Mr. Perry, who wrote

23   the relevant statements?

24                  MR. PERRY:     Your Honor, the funds made the

25   statements to the public.          They were drafted -

 1                JUSTICE KAGAN:         I understand that they were

 2   in the fund's prospectus, but who wrote them?

 3                MR. PERRY:      They were drafted by lawyers for

 4   the funds, lawyers representing the funds.

 5                JUSTICE KAGAN:         Who paid those lawyers?

 6                MR. PERRY:      The adviser paid the lawyers'

 7   salaries.

 8                JUSTICE KAGAN:         So JCM paid the lawyers?

 9                MR. PERRY:      Correct, Your Honor.

10                JUSTICE KAGAN:         And so it was JCM's lawyers

11   who wrote the prospectus, including the relevant

12   statements here, the asserted misrepresentations?

13                MR. PERRY:      I -- I disagree with that,

14   Justice Kagan.    They don't allege that in the complaint,

15   and the facts show that the lawyers, when -

16                JUSTICE KAGAN:         Well, suppose the complaint

17   had alleged that.    Suppose the complaint had simply

18   said:   JCM's lawyers authored the relevant statements in

19   the prospectus.

20                MR. PERRY:      One would have to -

21                JUSTICE KAGAN:         Would that be enough to

22   survive a motion to dismiss?

23                MR. PERRY:      No, Your Honor.     One would have

24   to further look at who those lawyers were representing.

25   The truth in the real world is -

 1               JUSTICE KAGAN:        They're paid by JCM.

 2               MR. PERRY:     Every prospectus is written by

 3   lawyers, Justice Kagan.      Lawyers write prospectuses.

 4               JUSTICE KAGAN:        These are in-house counsel

 5   for the investment adviser.

 6               MR. PERRY:     In-house counsel, outside

 7   counsel, once they draft materials and present them to

 8   their client, it becomes the client's statement when

 9   adopted by the client.

10               The board of trustees of the funds has to

11   review every policy, is responsible for every policy

12   drafted by inside counsel, outside counsel, consultants.

13   It's not unusual for companies to retain outside service

14   providers to provide any number of policies:         Employment

15   policies, investment policies, everything else.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:         Mr. Perry, you -- you

17   said that it was the fund's lawyers who drafted the

18   prospectus, but, in fact, it was JCM's lawyers, the

19   lawyers -- they were in-house lawyers for JCM.           And they

20   served -- and they served the funds in doing this

21   prospectus, but they were on the payroll of JCM, and

22   they were JCM's legal department.

23               MR. PERRY:     Your Honor, like all lawyers,

24   they wear multiple hats.      I represent multiple clients.

25   These lawyers represent multiple clients.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I thought they were

 2   in-house lawyers?

 3               MR. PERRY:       They are in-house lawyers at

 4   JCM, but they also represent the funds, and the SEC has

 5   specifically recognized in the context of investment

 6   companies that where an adviser counsel is representing

 7   the funds, his client or her client, for those purposes,

 8   is the funds.   And here, these lawyers are very careful

 9   to separate who their -- their clients are for various

10   purposes.

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, let's say that JCM's

12   principal officers and managers wrote the statement.

13   You still say there's no liability?

14               MR. PERRY:       Absolutely, Justice Kennedy,

15   because when the statement is adopted by the issuer, it

16   becomes the issuer's statement.             Only an issuer can make

17   the statement -

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Yes.     It's not

19   attributable, at least publicly, to JCM.

20               MR. PERRY:       That's -

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Is there an alternate

22   theory that JCM is really the day-to-day managers in

23   day-to-day active control of the fund, and, therefore,

24   it should be chargeable as if it and the fund are the

25   same for purposes of making the statement?

 1                 MR. PERRY:     Your Honor -

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:          And we would say that

 3   that's different from, say, an outside law firm or an

 4   auditor?

 5                 MR. PERRY:     Your Honor, the word "control"

 6   appears more than a hundred times in the briefs on the

 7   plaintiff's side of this case in this Court, and the

 8   Congress has dealt with control.             Section 20(a) provides

 9   a separate cause of action against those who control

10   another entity.

11                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Except that I, as I read

12   your brief -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong -- you

13   were arguing that because there was an independent board

14   of directors, presumably because there are two

15   corporate -- different corporate funds -- two different

16   corporate forms, that there couldn't be control person

17   liability under 20(a).       You seem -- that -- I thought,

18   reading your brief, that's what you were alleging.

19                 So you can't have your cake and eat it, too.

20   Either the independence of the board makes no difference

21   or it does.    So which is your position?

22                 MR. PERRY:     Our position, Your Honor, is

23   that the Congress has dealt with the situation where you

24   have two separate companies, and to make a claim against

25   the second company, you have to prove control.             Whether

                                    14

 1   or not they could in this case, none of us knows,

 2   because they never brought that claim.              They

 3   represented to the district court -

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Under what theory would

 5   you defend an allegation that the investment manager who

 6   had control over the everyday affairs of the company,

 7   drafted or helped draft the prospectus, hired the

 8   lawyers who helped draft it, wouldn't be a control

 9   person?   How would you defend that?

10                MR. PERRY:     Your Honor, the investment

11   company, the mutual funds, are separately owned,

12   separately governed.

13                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Exactly.     So you -

14   you're -- if they can't be control persons because

15   they're separate companies, then how do they escape

16   being primary violators?

17                MR. PERRY:     Well, Your Honor, then -- then

18   we're just saying that the investment adviser is a

19   service provider like every other service provider.

20   They are like the -

21                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          But it's not in this

22   case, because the allegation is that it -- not the

23   company, that it chose to deceive the market.

24                MR. PERRY:     Your Honor, with respect, the

25   allegation is that the adviser wrote a certain policy,

                                   15

 1   but the very document cited for that in the complaint

 2   says that the trustees are responsible for the policies

 3   of the funds.     The trustees, when they adopt them, it

 4   becomes the corporate policies of them.              I mean, on the

 5   plaintiff's -

 6                JUSTICE KAGAN:          Mr. Perry, does the fund

 7   have employees?

 8                MR. PERRY:       Yes, Your Honor.        The fund

 9   has -

10                JUSTICE KAGAN:          Who are the fund's

11   employees?

12                MR. PERRY:       Are the officers of the fund,

13   the chief executive officer, the chief financial

14   officer -

15                JUSTICE KAGAN:          And are all of those people

16   also employees of JCM?

17                MR. PERRY:       Not the president, Your Honor,

18   but the others are joint -- serve in joint capacities.

19                JUSTICE KAGAN:          And could you just run

20   through a little bit how one of these prospectuses

21   gets -- gets issued eventually?              The JCM lawyers start

22   the process by drafting, and then what happens?

23                MR. PERRY:       The lawyers representing the

24   trusts, both in-house and external, draft the underlying

25   document -

 1                JUSTICE KAGAN:        Well, here, I believe that

 2   there was a statement in your interrogatories that it's

 3   JCM's lawyers, in-house lawyers, who drafted the

 4   relevant statement.

 5                MR. PERRY:     The particular prospectus,

 6   answered in that prospectus.           That's exactly right.

 7                JUSTICE KAGAN:        And then what happens?

 8                MR. PERRY:     They are presented to the board

 9   of trustees, which holds a meeting.             The board of

10   trustees is -- the funds are represented by outside

11   counsel, and the independent trustees are represented by

12   outside counsel.

13                JUSTICE KAGAN:        And was there any change to

14   these statements made by the board of trustees?

15                MR. PERRY:     These particular statements?

16                JUSTICE KAGAN:        Yes.

17                MR. PERRY:     Yes, Your Honor.         There were

18   changes to the market timing policy throughout the class

19   period.   In fact, earlier in the class period, there was

20   an express disclosure that market timing might be

21   permitted pursuant to a -- a written contract.             That was

22   revised later.

23                The trustees asked multiple questions.               They

24   were back and forth with their lawyers.             Outside counsel

25   was always involved, and there are other consultants

                                   17
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   involved periodically as well.             The -

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Do the outside

 3   counsel you're talking about represent the fund only?

 4                 MR. PERRY:      There's two separate sets of

 5   outside counsel.     One law firm represents only the fund.

 6   It does not represent the adviser; only represents the

 7   funds, Your Honor.     There's a second law firm in this

 8   case that represents the independent trustees.

 9                 Six of the seven trustees determined that to

10   secure their independence, because the chairman of the

11   board at that time was an interested person under the

12   statute, they have a separate law firm.                There are two

13   law firms that have nothing to do with the adviser.

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But the law firm that -

15   the lawyers who drafted the prospectus were in-house

16   counsel for JCM on JCM's payroll.

17                 MR. PERRY:      They were paid by JCM, and at

18   the time they drafted, they were representing the funds,

19   again, as allowed by the SEC, as disclosed in the

20   documents -

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But they weren't the

22   independent outside lawyers who were representing the

23   board or the funds; they were the in-house counsel?

24                 MR. PERRY:      Those outside counsel reviewed

25   every policy.    In fact, if you look at the -

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I guess my question was

 2   simply:   The drafters of the prospectus were the

 3   in-house counsel for JCM?

 4                MR. PERRY:       The -- the paragraph being

 5   challenged in this case, that's correct, Your Honor.

 6   The interrogatory response doesn't speak more broadly

 7   than that, but I agree with that.

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               I suppose if the

 9   lawyers for the trust did an inadequate job of reviewing

10   the JCM drafts, they would be subject to a malpractice

11   action by the trust?

12                MR. PERRY:       Correct, Your Honor.          And then

13   the trust, of course, has contractual and other rights

14   against the adviser that it has enforced, you know, in

15   this very case.   The trustees made a claim against the

16   adviser for all of this underlying conduct.

17                JUSTICE BREYER:             What -- what happens if the

18   president of the oil company, knowing that the statement

19   is false, says:   We have discovered 42 trillion barrels

20   of oil in Yucatan.     He writes it on a piece of paper; he

21   gives it to the board of trustees; they think it's true

22   and they issue it.     Joe Smith buys stock and later loses

23   money.

24                Can Joe Smith sue the president of Yucatan,

25   of the oil company, for having made an untrue statement

 3   the same company that issued the statement?

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:           What he is, is he didn't

 5   issue it.    What he did was he gave it to the board of

 6   trustees, who issued it.

 7                 MR. PERRY:     If the board of trustees of his

 8   company, so that the statement -

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:           He's the president of the

10   company.

11                 MR. PERRY:     And -- and the distinction here,

12   Justice Breyer, is -

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:           No, no.     I'm asking what

14   happens.    Is there recovery?

15                 MR. PERRY:     If he is an authorized agent, he

16   may be sued as -

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:           He is running the business,

18   the daily affairs, of the company.                Of course, the

19   president of a company is an authorized agent of the

20   company, and so, yes.

21                 MR. PERRY:     He may be subject to liability,

 2                 MR. PERRY:     Your Honor, they run the

 3   management of the fund.        The investment operations -

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes, that's what a

 5   president does.    The president of a company manages the

 6   company.

 7                 MR. PERRY:     And where -

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:           And if the president is

 9   liable, why isn't the group of people who do everything

10   for the company -

11                 MR. PERRY:     Because, Your Honor -

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           -- why aren't they liable?

13                 MR. PERRY:     -- the corporate form has

14   meaning in the Federal law and in State law, and

15   where -

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:           No, you have to explain it

21   That's an obvious, naive question, and I'd like an

22   answer that anyone could understand.

23                 MR. PERRY:     The answer is, Your Honor:

24   These funds are managed -- "governed," excuse me, is a

25   better word -- by the trustees.             That is disclosed in

 1   these documents.   In fact, the documents say -- it's at

 2   page 258a of the Joint Appendix -- the trustees are

 3   responsible for all the policies.

 4                They have outsourced, if you will, certain

 5   functions, operational functions:               Which stock to buy,

 6   which stock to sell, which transfer agent to hire.

 7   Those are functions that could be kept in house or could

 8   be outsourced.

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:           I get it.     In other words,

10   you're saying, on the papers here, it's -- it's the

11   trustees that manage everything.

12                MR. PERRY:     That govern everything.

13                JUSTICE BREYER:           That govern everything, and

16                JUSTICE BREYER:           They do a lot as helpers.

17   Now, let me suggest to you, if that's one possible

18   distinction, what about this distinction:               That the

19   managers of a fund, even though they are outsourced

20   people brought in, are liable as principals, not aiders

21   or abettors, if -- following criminal law here -- if -

22   they are principals if they get the false statement to

23   the public through a conduit, the conduit being an

24   entity or person that is unaware of the falsity of the

25   statement.

 1                  That's LaFave on criminal law.            What is -

 2   what about that?

 3                  MR. PERRY:     Three answers.         First, that's

 4   dealt with in section 20(b), which is the ventriloquist

 5   dummy statute that these plaintiffs didn't invoke.

 6                  Second, the Congress looked at this very

 7   question in 1938 and 1939, when there were proposals to

 8   merge the management, the adviser function, with the

 9   funds, to make them one unitary entity.               And in the

10   Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment

11   Advisers Act of 1940, the Congress elected not do that.

12                  As this Court has recognized, it chose not

13   to require compulsory internalization of the management

14   function.     It allowed this separate entity.            And,

15   therefore, when you have separate companies, under State

16   law -- again, my client is a Delaware limited liability

17   corporation.     The funds are Massachusetts business

18   trusts.     They have nothing in common.            There's no joint

19   ownership, no joint governance -

23   are you, that they did this for purposes of protecting

24   your client from a lawsuit?

 1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          When it -- no, they did

 2   it for a business reason, that having separate entities

 3   was economically more useful for the market, correct?

 4               MR. PERRY:     And every fund, or virtually

 5   every fund in -- in the United States, is set up this

 6   way.

13   didn't do it for that reason, what does it mean?

14               MR. PERRY:     My -- my third answer is that

15   extensive regulatory involvement in the two Acts enacted

16   in 1940 specifically to regulate this industry, the

17   Congress never made the decision to hold the adviser

18   liable for the fund's conduct.

19               In fact, no statute says that, and the SEC

20   has never taken that position.          There is no case cited

21   in any of the briefs -- they have 234 pages, 138 cases.

22   Not one holds an investment adviser liable for

23   statements of the fund's prospectuses.          When the -

 1   hypothetical you gave where the president gives an

 2   innocent board of directors false information and the

 3   prospectus goes out, is the company liable because their

 4   agent -- is the company liable under 10b-5?

 5                 MR. PERRY:     The company may be sued under

 6   10b-5.     It has got to meet all the elements -

 7                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.

 8                 MR. PERRY:     -- but, yes, if it's an

 9   authorized agent making a statement on behalf of the

10   company.    But proving -

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So what you're saying is

12   that the -- the agency relation that the president of

13   the company holds is different that than the agency

14   relation that JCM holds?

15                 MR. PERRY:     Absolutely right, Your Honor,

16   and that's a distinction -

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Why is that?

18                 MR. PERRY:     It's grounded in State law, and

19   it differs between one company and two companies.                Where

20   Congress has looked at issuers, for example -

 3   that?   For purposes of -- at issue here?

 4                 MR. PERRY:      No, Your Honor, for -- not for

 5   drafting a prospectus.        For carrying out the investment

 6   function.     They are laid out in the contract -

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yes.     Okay.

 8                 MR. PERRY:      It's attached as an appendix to

 9   our brief -- which sets forth the things that JCM is an

10   agent for investment operations, not an agent

11   specifically for registering the fund's securities for

12   sales, complying with the Federal securities laws,

13   preparing and issuing the prospectus.                 All those things,

14   by contract -

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So even though they did

16   those things, they acted in excess of their authority?

18   Your Honor.

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But that's the allegation.

20                 MR. PERRY:      No, it's not the allegation.

22   proven that they did do those things.                 Suppose it were

23   proven that they did 100 percent of the prospectus work.

 1   that, Justice Kennedy, since it's so far beyond what

 2   they could possibly prove here.              What happened here -

 3                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Well, this case -- this

 4   case went off on -- in the district court, it was -- was

 5   it 12(b)(6)?

 6                  MR. PERRY:     Yes, Your Honor.

 7                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Okay.     And all that the

 8   Fourth Circuit said is it goes beyond; it has to go

 9   further.    And the -- the impression that I got from the

10   Fourth Circuit's opinion is -- and it could be reduced

11   to a very simple statement.              They say:     JCM was in the

12   driver's seat.     It was running the show.              And if that

13   can be proved, they thought that they would have a good

14   case under -

15                  MR. PERRY:     And, Your Honor, no court, no

16   case from this Court or any court of appeals has ever

17   held that the driver's seat exception to Central Bank

18   exists.    And that is an expansion.

19                  The second issue in the case, of course,

20   which is attribution:       Even if there's making by JCM,

21   none of these statements were attributed to JCM.                 The

22   prospectus is very clear that -

23                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But that was -- I mean,

24   before you started out with a statement that sounded

25   like the sky is falling because lawyers would no longer

 1   be safe, banks would no longer be safe, but the Fourth

 2   Circuit was -- was a much narrower view.             Its view was

 3   this -- JCM was the manager.             It was controlling

 4   everything.

 5                 MR. PERRY:     Justice Ginsburg, the Fourth

 6   Circuit's view was the manager helps the funds.               That -

 7   nobody even defends the Fourth Circuit's ruling.              The

 8   Government now comes in with a theory that they admit,

 9   on page 22 of the Government's brief, does apply to

10   every lawyer, every accountant, every -

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I thought that the question

12   on which we granted cert was very clear:             whether the

13   Fourth Circuit erred in concluding that a service

14   provider can be held primarily liable in a private

15   securities fraud action for, quote, "helping," close

16   quote, or, quote, "participating in," close quote,

17   another company's misstatements.

18                 Now, is -- is that an accurate description

19   of the Court's holding?        It was not objected to by the

20   Respondent here.

21                 MR. PERRY:     Absolutely, Justice Scalia.            And

22   that question can only be -

24   we granted.    We weren't talking about control here.

16   in -- in your -- in your opposition?

17                  MR. FREDERICK:        We -- we did object, in the

18   sense that we described the complaint's allegations as

19   JCM writing and preparing and being responsible for the

20   prospectus.     And the question of -

 1   didn't you say that in your brief in opposition?

 2                MR. FREDERICK:          We did say it in our brief

 3   in opposition, Justice Scalia, and the Solicitor

 4   General, when you called for the views of the Solicitor

 5   General, also said in the invitation brief that this

 6   case was not an appropriate vehicle for deciding just

 7   simply "help" and "participate," because what the Fourth

 8   Circuit was saying in other parts of its opinion was

 9   that JCM was responsible for the prospectuses in all

10   their various aspects:        in writing, preparing, et

11   cetera.   And so we -

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               How can -- I'm

13   sorry.    Please -

14                MR. FREDERICK:          So we would submit that for

15   the reasons we stated in our opposition and we've stated

16   in our red brief, as the case comes to this Court on

17   reviewing a motion to dismiss of a complaint's

18   well-pleaded allegations -- and I can go through the

19   complaint's allegations, if you like, that explain how

20   JCM wrote and prepared the prospectus and the policies

21   for the funds and then implemented them falsely -- we

24   representation, that means presenting the representation

 2               MR. FREDERICK:         In the prospectus, there is

 3   a section on management that explains that Janus Capital

 4   Management engages in the day-to-day functions.               There

 5   are no employees of Janus Funds themselves.               All of this

 6   is outsourced management -

 8   when they review material going in the prospectus.

 9               MR. FREDERICK:         But that -

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Then they have

11   independent representation by outside counsel.

12               MR. FREDERICK:         Right.       What they don't

13   have, Mr. Chief Justice, and where the falsity is here,

14   is the ability of any of those outsiders to determine

15   whether or not implementing the policy will be done

16   fraudulently, and that's where the culpability is here.

17   JCM runs these funds, and although the statement might

18   get accepted by the board of trustees -

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I don't

20   understand -- I don't understand your answer.               The

21   outside counsel reviews what the policy is going to be.

22               MR. FREDERICK:         Yes.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Our question is the

24   validity of that statement, whether that's deceptive in

25   the prospectus.   That seems to me to be an entirely

 1   different question.    I understood your theory of the

 2   case to be that JCM is liable, basically, because they

 3   put it in the prospectus.

 4                MR. FREDERICK:        And what they did was to

 5   falsely represent what they would do with that

 6   statement.   I would direct the Court to paragraph 5.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Well, that's the

 8   question, I guess, that -- your response seems to beg

 9   the question -- is that they falsely represented.              The

10   issue is whether or not something happened between their

11   drafting and its appearance in the prospectus that makes

12   it appropriate to say that that's a statement of the

13   trust rather than a statement of JCM.

14                MR. FREDERICK:        It is a statement of both,

15   in the sense that the fund is attracting investors, but

16   the fund is managed and controlled by the investment

17   manager; here, JCM.    If -

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:           But if JCM falsely

19   represented what it would do, it made that false

20   representation to the fund, and the fund, as has been

21   acknowledged, would have a cause of action against JCM.

22                MR. FREDERICK:        No -

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:           But that's not what's going

24   on here.

25                MR. FREDERICK:        No.     In fact, paragraph 5 of

                                   33

 1   the complaint says that Janus is representing that its

 2   mutual funds -- Janus Capital Management, its mutual

 3   funds -- were designed to be long-term investments.                It

 4   then says in paragraph 6:         As recognized in the

 5   prospectuses, JCM purported market timing policy was

 6   designed to protect long-term investors.

 7                So, if you read the prospectus and you read

 8   the complaint, it is absolutely clear what Janus Capital

 9   Management is telling all the mutual fund investors of

10   the world:   If you invest in Janus, we will protect your

11   long-term investments.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:            What isn't clear from all

13   of those things is that -- is that JCM made any

14   representation to the public.             The representation was

15   made in the prospectus issued by the fund, not by JCM.

16                Now, the fund may have a cause of action

17   against JCM, but what's crucial here is whether -

18   whether you can establish that it is JCM who made the

19   representation to the public -

16   manager if they had any question about the funds.

17                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           If I carry a letter over

18   and file it on behalf of some principal, does it become

19   my letter?     Have I made that representation?             Sure, they

20   filed it.     What does that prove?

21                  MR. FREDERICK:        Because it's -

22                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           As you say, they have no

23   other agents, unless the trustees themselves were going

24   to walk over and file it.          JCM was functioning in that

25   capacity as an employee of the fund in the filing.                   They

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           On their own behalf?

 4                 MR. FREDERICK:        Absolutely.       They created

 5   the fund, Justice Scalia.         That's how mutual funds work.

 6   Managers create them, they lure investors to them, they

 7   get money by having a percentage of assets under

 8   management.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             And the SEC has

10   recognized that they remain two separate entities,

11   despite this interconnected relationship.

12                 MR. FREDERICK:        Certainly, but there are

13   many cases -- in fact, I don't think it's ever been

14   disputed in the courts of appeals that if one company

15   outsources its management function and those outsourced

16   managers make lies on behalf of the company -

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             The one -- the one

18   activity -

19                 MR. FREDERICK:        -- they are also liable

20   under section 10b-5.

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             The one activity

22   that we know they did not outsource was review of the

23   materials submitted by JCM.             They had independent

24   counsel that conducted that review.

25                 Would it have been a breach of the trustees'

 4   not to have independent counsel review what they're

 6               MR. FREDERICK:        Mr. Chief Justice, my answer

 7   to your question is:    That's actually a very difficult

 8   question under fiduciary duty law, because here the

 9   fiduciaries have been duped themselves.

10               They, when they got the wording of the

11   prospectus and the policy that JCM was purporting to

12   implement -- JCM didn't tell the board that there are 12

13   secret deals with hedge funds, pursuant to which we're

14   going to make money by attracting long-term investors

22   an action from the fund represented by their trustees

23   against -

 1   instance that I'm aware of where a mutual fund

 2   investment adviser is a publicly traded company would

 3   that cause of action run on behalf of the manager's

 4   shareholders.     What we're talking about here is a

 5   company with a product, and they lie about the product.

 6   And in that instance, it's no different from the Vioxx

 7   case last year with Merck or the difference from the

 8   cold remedy case you are going to hear argument in next

 9   term.

10                  The mutual funds happen to be the product of

11   the company.     They make misstatements about the product,

12   and that -

13                  JUSTICE ALITO:        Well, suppose this case

14   didn't involve a mutual fund.            Suppose it involved a

15   corporation with thousands of employees, and the

16   prospectus is drafted by outside counsel.            It's adopted

17   by the directors of the company without changing a word.

18                  Now, would that case come out the same?           And

19   if not, what would -- what exactly would you have us say

20   to distinguish the two?

21                  MR. FREDERICK:        Well, the outside lawyers, I

22   think, are distinguishable in a number of different

23   ways.   One is that they are reacting on information

24   provided by the company.         That information is typically

25   not subject to an independent investigation by outside

                                     38

 1   counsel to determine the truth or veracity of that

 2   information.

 3                  JUSTICE ALITO:        Well, what if it's alleged

 4   they knew exactly what was going on?

 5                  MR. FREDERICK:        If there is scienter, where

 6   the lawyers knowingly act in a way that helps or that

 7   contributes to that fraud, they may well be subject as

 8   aiders and abettors.       It depends on whether you can

 9   establish that the lawyers have met all of the elements.

10   I mean, you'd have to show reliance.                You'd have to show

11   lost causation.     You'd have to show the primary

12   violation of the part of the lawyers.

13                  JUSTICE ALITO:        They would be liable as

14   aiders and abettors?       I thought there wasn't aiding and

15   abetting liability.

16                  MR. FREDERICK:        Sorry.       The SEC would be

17   able to proceed against the lawyers for aiding and

18   abetting.     Whether or not there would be a private

19   action would depend on whether the lawyers -- it could

20   be pleaded under the heightened pleading requirements

21   that they had met all of the elements of the 10b-5

22   claim.     I would submit that's extremely difficult.

23                  JUSTICE BREYER:           What is it that -- I'm

24   unclear on this.     That's why I use the oil company

25   example.     Plain, ordinary -- the top executives in the

                                     39

 1   oil company write the false statement.               They give it to

 2   a board that doesn't know it's false, and the board puts

 3   it out in its name.

 4               Now, it seems to me it ought to be clear at

 5   this point in securities law whether those -- the

 6   president and vice president are or are not liable under

 7   this 10-b, the (B) part.

 8               MR. FREDERICK:          Yes, and we cited those

 9   cases -

10               JUSTICE BREYER:             And they are liable.

11               MR. FREDERICK:          -- I believe at page 37.

12               JUSTICE BREYER:             You're saying they are

13   liable?

14               MR. FREDERICK:          At page -

15               JUSTICE BREYER:             All right.    Then their

16   response to that is:      This is not like the president of

17   the oil company, and the reason that it's not is

18   something to do with the nature of the -- the obligation

19   that runs between the managers and the fund, which is

20   somehow different between -- you understand it better

21   than I.

22               Can you say what it is and what you think

23   your response is?

24               MR. FREDERICK:          Yes.     What I will say is

25   that they don't have a principal distinction between

 2   outsource management where those management functions of

 3   the company are resulting in false statements issued by

 4   the company shouldn't make -

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.   So you're

 6   saying -- you're saying it shouldn't matter that if they

 7   issued -- it's worse if they run the whole company than

 8   if they're just the president?

 9               MR. FREDERICK:        That's correct.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.   Now, at that

11   point, we get into a problem, and the problem is how do

12   we distinguish an aider or abettor from a principal?

13               MR. FREDERICK:        An -

14               JUSTICE BREYER:           At that point, I am

15   uncertain indeed, and that's why I put out this for

16   comment, this suggestion that you follow criminal law

17   here and say at least they're a principal if they have a

18   high position, they participate in it, they do all these

19   things you say, and the entity that they're fooling in

20   the first instance is simply a conduit, and, therefore,

21   you cannot say it's a scheme, because this other part of

22   the scheme wasn't part of it.

23               MR. FREDERICK:        Well, to be a primary

24   violator, you have to have met all of the elements of

 5               MR. FREDERICK:          -- SEC purposes, you simply

 6   have to provide substantial assistance to one who is a

 7   primary violator.

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:             What's the difference

 9   between substantial assistance and -- and doing it?

10               MR. FREDERICK:          You would not have to make

11   the statement.   You would do something to assist the

12   person making the statement.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Mr. Frederick, I thought we

14   had held -- I was sure we had held that there is no

15   aiding and abetting liability -

19   we're discussing here.

20               JUSTICE BREYER:             There's a distinction.    You

21   want to say what the distinction is.               So I would -

 2   view of the facts here, because they met all of the

 3   elements of the 10b-5 action, and they had a motive do

 4   it, and they made -

 5                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Is your claim premised

 6   on Janus being duped or not?             If Janus was not duped, if

 7   its board knew and JCM was doing the activity with

 8   either the consent or acquiescence of the board, would

 9   you have a claim here?

10                  MR. FREDERICK:        We would.    It would be

11   somewhat different because we would plead multiple

12   violators, as the Court in Central Bank and in

13   Stoneridge -

14                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Then go back to Justice

15   Breyer's question, because I can see when there's one

16   primary violator who uses another entity as a dupe or as

17   a puppet, but I can't, and I don't know how to,

18   distinguish what you're proposing from aiding and

19   abetting.     There has to be something to differentiate

20   the two.    So what is it?

21                  MR. FREDERICK:        It's the failure on the part

22   of the person who would not have met all of the elements

23   of the 10b-5 claim.      You have to have someone -- you -

24   two people, okay?     Both of them have to have satisfied

 2   satisfied with respect to that person, that person is

 3   only an aider and abettor and not subject to private

 4   remedies under section 10(b).            They would be subject to

 5   aiding and abetting liability under the SEC's

 6   enforcement -

 7                  JUSTICE ALITO:        But the distinction you're

 8   drawing is between making the statement and assisting in

 9   making the statement.       Isn't that -- isn't that what you

10   just said?

11                  MR. FREDERICK:        Well, no, in the sense that

12   we believe, and we assert in the complaint and the

13   complaint is adequately pleaded, is that JCM made the

14   statements.     Now, to be -

15                  JUSTICE ALITO:        Yes, and aiding and abetting

19                  JUSTICE ALITO:        But what is the difference,

20   the distinction in -- in this context?            Now, one

21   possible distinction is who formally makes it, in whose

22   name is it made, but that's obviously not your -- your

23   position.     So, what -- what is it to distinguish a

24   principal here from an aider and abettor?

 1   over the content of the message.              That kind of

 2   substantive control, as -- as the Court in the Utah Ten

 3   Commandments case pointed out, the government can have

 4   speech attributed to it on the basis of it putting up a

 5   monument on public land.         There can be multiple speakers

 6   with respect to one message, and the question of how

 7   much substantive control you attribute to a particular

 8   speaker, we believe, is the appropriate way to view -

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Do you deny that the fund

10   had substantive control?         Couldn't the fund have stopped

11   this statement from being placed in its prospectus?

12   Didn't it have outside lawyers who advised it whether it

13   should allow this statement to be included in its

14   prospectus?     How can you say that they -- they didn't

15   have control?

16                 MR. FREDERICK:         Well, they did not have a

17   knowledge of the falsity of these statements.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, that may mean that

19   they're duped, but it doesn't mean that they don't have

20   control.   They had control, but you say they -- they

21   were duped.     But that's quite a different theory from

22   saying that they had control -

 2   didn't have substantive control over the content of the

 3   message, because if they did, they would not have

 4   allowed these false statements to have been issued.                And

 5   that's the whole point -- that's the theory here.             JCM

 6   was luring long-term investors with the promise if you

 7   park your money with the Janus Funds, it will be safe

 8   in -- from the kinds of market timing problems.             They

 9   were then secretly going out and luring money from the

10   hedge funds to allow them to make short trades -

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But there was -- there is

12   nothing in the record to indicate that that statement

13   was attributed to JCM.

14               MR. FREDERICK:           The public understood it

15   that way.

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             You can -- you can play

17   with the words "make" as you choose, but do we take the

18   case on the assumption that you can show that it was

19   attributed to JCM?     I -- I see nothing in -- in the

20   record that would justify that.

21               MR. FREDERICK:           Well, JA 275a, Justice --

22   Justice Kennedy -- excuse me -- says that Janus Capital

 5   page 275a -- if for some reason Janus Capital

 6   Management's contract is terminated, the funds can no

 7   longer use the Janus name.           They were intending to

 8   trademark and get the name out there to attract

 9   investors to the investment adviser's method of

10   investing.    And it was that type of usage that brought

11   all of this together.       The fund and the management, they

12   are in function essentially one entity.           The fact that

13   they have contractually outsourced the management

14   function should not alleviate the securities fraud that

15   is alleged here.

16                 JUSTICE KAGAN:         Mr. Frederick, a substantial

17   part of the power of your argument comes from this

18   notion, as Justice Ginsburg said, that JCM was in the

19   driver's seat, that JCM had control, that they were --

20   Janus was at most an alter ego of JCM and maybe

21   something more, that it was just a creature of JCM.              But

22   the securities legislation seems to deal with that in

23   section 20.     And your case is not brought under section

24   20 and, because of the relationship between mutual funds

25   and their investment advisers, presumably could not be

                                     47

 1   brought under section 20.

 2                So, why should we think relevant the kind of

 3   controlled relationship that you're talking about?

 4                MR. FREDERICK:          Because you don't want to

 5   create a road map for other people to commit fraud,

 6   Justice Kagan, and that's what their theory does.                What

 7   their theory does is it says, if we set up shell

 8   companies or if we dupe people to make statements, we

 9   can commit securities fraud with impunity, because we

10   won't be held liable to having made the statement, even

11   though we wrote it, we had substantive control over it,

12   et cetera.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Except -- except to

14   the SEC, right?    Because they can pursue it under aiding

15   and abetting.     It's kind of a big -

16                MR. FREDERICK:          Well -

18   trying to say we're safe from actions for security

19   fraud.

20                MR. FREDERICK:          Well, Chief Justice Roberts,

21   this Court on numerous occasions has said that the

22   private securities action is a complement to the

23   enforcement efforts of the SEC, and in this instance,

24   the shareholders of the investment manager -

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, I know, but

 1   you were just responding by saying the problem is that

 2   this will give people a road map.                But they're going to

 3   hit a pretty big bump in the road when the SEC brings an

 4   action against them, including potential criminal

 5   actions.

 6                 MR. FREDERICK:        But, no, the problem,

 7   Mr. Chief Justice, is that under their construction of

 8   the facts, there's no primary violator.                Mr. Perry said

 9   this morning -

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              The SEC -

11                 MR. FREDERICK:        -- there's no primary

12   violator.    And so, if there's no primary violator, there

13   can be no control person and there can be no aiding and

14   abetting.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you,

21                 MR. GANNON:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

22   please the Court:

23                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Counsel, could you start

24   by taking your brief and distilling it down to three

25   sentences?    Define what a primary violator is, what a

                                    49

 1   secondary violator is who aids and abets, and who a

 2   control person is?     And then tell me how that definition

 3   would exclude lawyers, auditors, investment -- general

 4   investment advisers, et cetera.

 5                  I've read your brief, but I've been trying

 6   to distill it down to three sentences.             So try to do

 7   that for me.

 8                  MR. GANNON:      A primary violator must be

 9   somebody who has actually committed all the elements of

10   a 10b-5 cause of action -

11                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Give me an example of

12   that.   What do you see as all of the elements?

13                  MR. GANNON:      Well, the elements for the

14   private cause of action are the ones that this Court has

15   repeated.   They're -- were cited on page -

16                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          I understand.   But -

17                  MR. GANNON:      In -- in this case the key one

18   that we're talking about is that you would need to be an

19   actual maker of the statement, and -- and -

20                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          And that becomes -- how

21   is that different from aiding and abetting the making of

22   a statement?

23                  MR. GANNON:      It -- we think that somebody

24   can make a statement if they create the statement, and

25   the statute and the rule both expressly apply to those

 1   who make statements directly -

 2               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          But that's every

 3   lawyer -

 4               MR. GANNON -- or indirectly.

 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          -- who writes the false

 6   statement knowing it's false.         So, are you saying that

 7   every lawyer who writes the statement knowing it's false

 8   is a primary violator?

 9               MR. GANNON:      Scienter is another element,

10   and so a lawyer who just reviews the policy, JCM in this

11   case -- when JCM submitted false statements to the

12   funds, if the funds were unaware, this is where Mr.

13   Frederick concluded for the Chief Justice that if

14   there -- if the person who actually releases the

15   statement to the world has been duped and doesn't have

16   scienter, then there is -- they are not going to be -

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             So, just to get -

18               MR. GANNON:      -- a primary violator.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             -- to get back, so

20   you are conceding that if you lose this case, you will

21   be unable to bring any aiding and abetting case in a

22   situation such as this?

23               MR. GANNON:      Under sections 20 -- it depends

24   on what the situation -

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             It seems like a yes

 1   or no question.

 2                MR. GANNON:       Yes, if the situation here is

 3   one in which the funds ultimately cannot be proved to

 4   have scienter.    If they did not know about the falsity

 5   of the statements in the prospectuses that they released

 6   to the public, then there would not be a primary

 7   violator.   Under section 20(e) for aiding and abetting

 8   liability, the Commission can bring an aiding and

 9   abetting claim against somebody who provides substantial

10   assistance, recklessly or knowingly -- recklessly or

11   knowingly provides substantial assistance to a primary

12   violator, but the Court has repeatedly made clear that a

13   primary violator needs to have violated all of the

14   elements of a 10b-5 cause of action, which includes -

15                JUSTICE ALITO:         I'm still not clear what

16   your distinction is between making the statement and

17   aiding and abetting in the making of the statement.

18   Now -

19                MR. GANNON:       If it -

20                JUSTICE ALITO:         -- could you explain that?

21                MR. GANNON:       Well, I think that -

22                JUSTICE ALITO:         Is it necessary that the

23   person in whose -- the entity in whose name the

24   statement is made is an empty shell?             It's simply a

25   puppet that's controlled by somebody else?             Is that -

 1   is that necessary or does it go beyond that?

 2                 MR. GANNON:      No, I don't think that that's

 3   necessary.    If -- the position -- the position that the

 4   Commission has taken is that somebody who makes a

 5   statement, if he writes the statement or provides the

 6   false information that's used to construct the statement

 7   or allows the statement to be attributed to him.                And we

 8   think that that's a reasonable construction of the term

 9   "make," because the statute and the rule both apply to

10   persons who make the statement directly or indirectly.

11   And so, they could be using a conduit, whether the

12   conduit is witting or unwitting.             They would be a

13   primary violator if they had -

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't think that's a

15   reasonable interpretation of -- of make a statement

16   indirectly.    I mean, you can make it indirectly by not

17   issuing it yourself but having somebody else make it in

18   your name.

19                 MR. GANNON:      Well, if -

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           But I would not say that

21   I'm making a speech indirectly if I have drafted the

22   speech.

 1                  MR. GANNON:      Well, that may be true in the

 2   case of a speech, Justice Scalia, but in a classic

 3   boiler-room situation, where somebody has written the

 4   scripts for salespersons to -- to use in order to make

 5   calls to sell stocks, the person who actually writes the

 6   scripts may never speak the words to a customer, he may

 7   never have his own name spoken on the phone, and,

 8   therefore, the statements have not been attributed to

 9   him -

10                  JUSTICE BREYER:           He may just be some poor

11   associate, his first day at work.                 The law firm sent him

12   over there, and there he got stuck down in the boiler

13   room.    And somebody said why don't you write something

14   that will get everybody to sell things, and -- and why

15   don't you say we're a thousand tons of oil instead of

16   only a ton?     There he is.       He writes it out.         You think

17   he's liable?

18                  MR. GANNON:      If he writes it out and he

19   doesn't know, he obviously isn't liable -

20                  JUSTICE BREYER:           No, no, he knows.     He

21   knows.

22                  MR. GANNON:      -- because he doesn't have

23   scienter.

24                  JUSTICE BREYER:           At some level he knows:     I

 1   when they only found 50.         Okay?       And four people told

 2   him to go do something like that, but he's the guy who

 3   wrote it.     I'd say he didn't behave well, but I don't

 4   think he's the principal.

 5                  MR. GANNON:      In that instance, because he

 6   was acting specifically at the direction of superiors -

 7                  JUSTICE BREYER:           They didn't say what words

 8   to write.

 9                  MR. GANNON:      But they -

10                  JUSTICE BREYER:           They gave him the general

11   idea, and then he did it.          He created the words, to use

12   your phrase.     When you say "creating the words," he's a

13   great writer.

14                  MR. GANNON:      It -- we do, on page 22,

15   acknowledge that somebody needs to be sufficiently

16   involved in the creation or dissemination of the

17   statement in order to be -- in order to be deemed its

18   maker or its author.       And so, it's -

19                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Ah, now we have

20   "sufficiently involved."         Once we're into sufficiently

21   involved, we're back into what is sufficient to make the

22   person the principal rather than the aider and the

23   abettor, and apparently creating or writing the

24   statement is not clear whether it is or is not

25   sufficient.     So we're back into the problem.

 1   disseminating the statement.              And I think it's very

 2   important to recognize that scienter is an important

 3   limiting -- limiting principle for the 10b-5 cause of

 4   action to be brought by a private -

 5                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, that will always be

 6   charged.    It's the simplest thing in the world to charge

 7   scienter.

 8                  MR. GANNON:      It would be -

 9                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           And you've bought yourself

10   a big lawsuit.

11                  MR. GANNON:      It's not simple, Justice

12   Scalia, in light of the PSLRA, which requires it to be

13   alleged with particularity.              There need to be facts

14   sufficient to give rise to a strong inference that the

15   defendant acted with scienter.              And -- and there are

16   penalties beyond Rule 11 that are -- that are imposed if

17   the -- if the plaintiff is -- is mistaken in doing so.

18                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You think attribution to

19   the actor is not necessary for the actor's liability for

20   a statement?

21                  MR. GANNON:      That's correct.       We think that

22   -- and any other rule would immunize falsely attributed

23   or anonymous statements.         And if the whole purpose of a

24   fraud was to convince somebody that this statement came

25   from Warren Buffett, so that I could turn a quick buck

 1   before the market realized that it wasn't actually from

 2   Warren Buffett, the fact that it was not attributed to

 3   me would not change the fact that I had made the

 4   statement and that the market had relied upon it.

 5                The truth is that reasonable investors -

 6   and that's the test for purposes of reliance -- can rely

 7   on anonymous and falsely attributed statements.            In this

 8   instance, there's no reason to doubt that an investor

 9   would have relied on statements in the prospectus about

10   the fund's purported anti-market timing and excessive

11   trading policies.    And so, we think that there -- in

12   general, there doesn't need to be an attribution

13   requirement, but in this instance, it's quite clear that

14   a reasonable investor could have relied on

15   these statements in the prospectus.

16                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Counsel, could you have

17   -- you just admitted if there -- if the company was

18   duped, you couldn't have aiding and abetting liability.

19   Could you impose a 20(a) or 20(b) control person

20   liability?

21                MR. GANNON:       The control person liability

22   also needs to have a primary violator under the terms of

23   20(a).

24                JUSTICE KAGAN:         Mr. Gannon, suppose that we

25   think that this test that the SEC is using and that you

 1   recite on page 13 is really pretty broad and that it

 2   might apply to a range of factual situations that are

 3   not before us.   Is there a way to confine our holding

 4   just to the mutual fund situation, and if there is, how

 5   would you do that?

 6               MR. GANNON:         Well, I think the easiest way

 7   would be to analogize it to the cases involving

 8   corporate employees.       As Petitioners acknowledge, there

 9   are cases where a corporate employee drafts a statement

10   that's issued in the company's name.              In this instance,

11   the investment adviser is management for the company,

12   and the fact that they happen to be management by virtue

13   of contract rather than just the internal arrangements

14   of the corporation shouldn't change that arrangement.

15               It -- it's also the case that if the Court

16   were -- were looking for a way to narrow its holding, it

17   could do so by talking about the elements of the 10b-5

18   cause of action, which -- which would apply only to

19   private suits and -- and not to enforcement actions

20   brought by the Commission or by the Department of

21   Justice.

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Your point is that -

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, it should change

24   that, because Congress has made it very clear that

25   investment advisers are not to be treated like

                                     59

 1   employees.    You -- you want us to undo a clear

 2   distinction that Congress has made.

 3                 MR. GANNON:       Well, the -- the statute says

 4   that if somebody -- any person makes the false statement

 5   directly or indirectly -- and in this instance, the SEC

 6   sought -- got a cease-and-desist order that's reprinted

 7   at -- on page 407 in the joint appendix that was

 8   predicated on a provision of the Investment Company Act,

 9   section 34(b), that -- that tracks 10(b) and makes it

10   unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of

11   material facts.    And the Commission believed that they

12   were chargeable with that violation.

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, Mr.

14   Gannon.

15                 Mr. Perry, you have 4 minutes remaining.

16                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. PERRY

17                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

18                 MR. PERRY:      Justice Kennedy, in response to

19   your attribution question, Mr. Gannon said something

20   about falsely attributed or anonymous statements.                  We

21   have neither here.     We have a correctly attributed, non

22   anonymous prospectus that under Federal law says, on the

23   first page of the document, who it's attributed to, the

24   Janus Funds, who have their own trustees.

25                 Justice Ginsburg, who is in the driver's

                                     60

 1   seat?     Page 258a of the joint appendix, quote:                "The

 2   trustees are responsible for major decisions relating to

 3   each fund's objectives, policies, and techniques.                   The

 4   trustees also supervise the operations of the fund by

 5   their officers and review the investment decisions of

 6   the officers."

 7                  There is no misdirection here about who's in

 8   charge.     The trustees are in charge.

 9                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         But the -- the whole

10   arrangement was made possible by JCM.                JCM wants

11   long-term investors, so it puts this provision in the

12   prospectus.     The board of directors have no reason to

13   believe that JCM is dissembling and it's going to go out

14   and seek hedge funds.

15                  MR. PERRY:     If it is a dupe case, Justice

16   Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor, it's dealt with by

17   20(b), which Justice -- Mr. Gannon did not answer.

18   You'll notice 20(b) does not require a primary

19   violation.     It allows the Commission to proceed directly

20   against any person who acts indirectly where it can't

21   act directly.     So 20(b) answers this problem.

22                  The Commission also -- the 34(b) of the

23   Investment Company Act is broader.                There's also section

24   206 and 215 of the Investment Advisers Act, which

25   regulate the conduct of investment advisers.

 1                  Congress has dealt in a very reticulated

 2   way, and all of the questions today I would submit show

 3   the absence of bright lines being proposed by my friends

 4   on this side of the table.           They can't articulate the

 5   distinction between primary and secondary, between

 6   principal and agent, between aiders and abettors and

 7   anyone else.

 8                  This is an area that needs bright lines.               It

 9   needs to be resolved on motions to dismiss.               Scienter

10   can't be resolved on a motion to dismiss.               And the

11   Congress, in the Dodd-Frank act, which the plaintiffs

12   said, in their opposition in this Court to this

13   certiorari petition, was going to solve the problem by

14   enacting a new statute -- turns out Congress didn't

15   enact that statute.

16                  Instead, Congress referred this issue to the

17   General Accounting Office, to the Comptroller General,

18   and said take a year, take all the resources of the

19   Federal Government, study the problem of the distinction

20   between companies that issue securities on the one hand,

21   -- the funds here -- and those who provide services on

22   the other hand -- the adviser here.               And tell us, come

23   back to the Congress and tell us whether we need to

24   solve the problem.     If the government -

25                  JUSTICE ALITO:        Well, just to sum up, if

 1   there are -- if investors in a mutual fund are duped by

 2   a false statement that is made in fact, is written by -

 3   by the management company and issued by the fund without

 4   knowledge of its falsity, is there any place they can

 5   get -- look to for relief?

 6               MR. PERRY:      The investors in the mutual

 7   fund, Justice Alito -

 8               JUSTICE ALITO:         In the mutual fund, yes.

 9               MR. PERRY:      -- got $100 million through the

10   SEC action and resolved all the civil litigation.

11   They're a separate class of investors, a whole different

12   set of securities laws problems, because they were the

13   recipients of the prospectus that offered these

14   securities and that contained the false statements.

15   These plaintiffs' fundamental problem -- they didn't

16   purchase or sell the securities that were offered by the

17   prospectus they complain about.            They can't find any

18   false statements in anything -

19               JUSTICE KAGAN:         Mr. Perry, on the

20   allegations of this complaint, these plaintiffs were

21   harmed by the misrepresentations, the alleged

22   misrepresentations from JCM to the fund.            So if the fund

23   was duped, would these shareholders, JCM's shareholders,

24   have any relief?

25               MR. PERRY:      These shareholders -- JCG's

                                   63

 1   shareholders have no relief.             And, Justice Kagan, I

 2   would point out in the 70 years since the Investment

 3   Company Act was enacted and the modern mutual fund

 4   industry was built, I'm not aware of any case -- and

 5   they certainly haven't cited one -- in which the

 6   investors in the parent company have ever recovered a

 7   dime in an SEC action, in a private action, or

 8   otherwise, for statements in the funds' prospectuses.

 9                  There is a -- there is a line between

10   corporate entities, and the liability runs up different

11   channels.     This is a totally novel, unprecedented theory

12   that they're presenting.

13                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          What was the theory of -

14   of the fund shareholders?          You said the fund

15   shareholders recovered -- there was a settlement.

16                  MR. PERRY:     Right.

17                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          What -- what was that

18   action?

19                  MR. PERRY:     Their theory was that there was

20   an omission.     The adviser owned a duty to the fund.             The

21   statements were correctly made, Justice Ginsburg.                There

22   was no market timing.       When the -- when the adviser

23   later allowed certain traders in, it owed a duty to

24   correct those statements in the prospectuses to the

25   fund.     That was the liability theory of the investors.

                                     64

 1                These plaintiffs can't pursue that liability

 2   theory because the duty doesn't run the other way.              It

 3   doesn't run from JCM to JCG's investors.              That's the law

 4   of this case.   And, therefore, they can't bring an

 5   omissions case; they have to bring an affirmative

 6   misstatements case for statements that were not directed

 7   to this group of investors.

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Thank you,

 9   Mr. Perry.
