 6                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARGARET A. KATZE

 7                          ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8              MS. KATZE:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10              The issue in this case is whether DWI is a

11   violent felony for purposes of an Armed Career Criminal

12   Act sentencing enhancement.              Sentencing enhancement

13   takes the statutory sentencing range from zero to 10

14   years and raises it to 15 years to life.                 The intent of

15   the Armed Career Criminal Act is to punish most severely

16   that category of recidivist violent offenders who are

17   disproportionately responsible for the violent crimes

18   and who, when they possess a weapon, are more dangerous.

19              The government is trying to expand the reach

20   of the statute by so broadly reading the residual clause

21   as to include any crime that presents a serious

22   potential risk of injury to another.

23              Such a reading of that residual clause would

24   swallow the entire statute.              Congress had no intention

25   of including DWI within the ambit of the Armed Career


                                         3

 1   Criminal Act.   As Justice Breyer, writing for the First

 2   Circuit in Doe, said, "there is no reason to believe

 3   that Congress meant to enhance sentences pursuant to the

 4   Armed Career Criminal Act based on convictions --

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:             If you're quoting that,

 6   then this is what's now bothering me.                    I'm not saying I

 7   have an answer one way or the other.

 8               Let's take two crimes and imagine that the

 9   same number of people injured or killed is identical for

10   the two.   One let's say is burglary and the other is

11   driving under the influence.            Now, let's imagine exactly

12   the same number are put at risk, exactly the same number

13   hurt, exactly the same number killed.

14               When I wrote that opinion, it seemed to me

15   that there still is an important difference between the

16   two crimes that is controlling here.                    But if you look at

17   what I wrote, I didn't articulate that difference very

18   well.   So I would like you to tell me what I should have

19   said in order to have said very clearly just what that

20   intuitive difference was.

21               MS. KATZE:       Your Honor, I think what you

22   said was sufficient, but you might have added that there

23   are other attributes to the -- the crimes in the -- the

24   enumerated crimes, those being burglary, arson,

25   extortion, use of explosives.             There are certain


                                        4

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   attributes that they share in common that DWI does not

 2   share, and those would include those, as you stated, an

 3   active violent crime.       But in addition to that, they're

 4   all property crimes, as this Court said in Taylor.

 5                They are also all acts that have the intent

 6   of causing harm.    DWI does not have that.                    They are all

 7   more dangerous when committed with a gun.                      And they're

 8   all typical of crimes that would be committed by career

 9   criminals.

10                JUSTICE ALITO:          Some of those

11   characteristics don't seem to apply to all of the

12   specific crimes that are mentioned.                      Take somebody who

13   sends a series of letter bombs for the purpose of

14   injuring other people.        Now, that would fall within a

15   crime involving use of explosives.                  But it's not really

16   a property crime and it's not a crime that's more

17   dangerous when done with a gun.

18                So how -- how can you say that those

19   characteristics apply to every crime in the list?

20                MS. KATZE:       Your Honor, arguably they might

21   not apply to everyone every time.                 But I think the vast

22   majority of them do.       And what we're looking at are in

23   ordinary cases.    And the example that you gave of the

24   letter bomb, I believe that would be a property crime.

25   When we're talking about a property crime as with arson


                                         5

 1   or use of explosives, it's the destruction of property.

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I think you can say that

 3   all of the crimes that are listed require mens rea and

 4   DUI doesn't; does it?

 5               MS. KATZE:      Absolutely.                Absolutely.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's a big different,

 7   isn't it?

 8               MS. KATZE:      I think it's a huge difference.

 9   DUI -- DUI in New Mexico is a strict liability crime.

10   It has no mens rea whatsoever.             An individual doesn't

11   even have to have the intent to drive.                   And, in fact, we

12   have a case in New Mexico where a woman had taken Ambien

13   and was driving, and she didn't even know she was

14   driving, but she still was convicted because she merely

15   was in control of the vehicle.             So in New Mexico, a

16   strict liability crime where you don't even have to know

17   you're driving, as opposed to the four enumerated

18   offenses, where there is clearly some intent to cause

19   some harm --

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Would you have the same

21   answer if you had a State statute which defined felony

22   drunk driving, as many do, as felony drunk driving which

23   causes serious death or serious physical injury to

24   another?

25               MS. KATZE:      I think it would -- the analysis


                                       6

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   wouldn't be different.       There would be an additional

 2   element, an additional piece of harm.                    But the --

 3              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             You would still say that

 4   that statute does not qualify?

 5              MS. KATZE:        Not unless there is a definition

 6   of -- if there is an actual intent to cause harm.                       If

 7   there is just merely harm that's caused --

 8              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             No, there isn't in the

 9   usual felony drunk driving statute, there is --

10              MS. KATZE:        And I agree.               I think in that

11   case, then that also would not fall within the statute.

12   There is not the intent to cause harm.

13              JUSTICE ALITO:           What if the crime is

14   vehicular homicide, defined as causing the death of

15   another person while driving intoxicated?                    Would that be

16   a crime that creates a serious potential risk of

17   physical injury to another?

18              MS. KATZE:        That would not fall under

19   paragraph 2, because it would not meet any of the other

20   attributes of the enumerated crimes.                    Possibly could it

21   fall under paragraph 1, the use of force?                    It would

22   depend how the elements described what the definition of

23   use of force.   This Court has previously defined use of

24   force as an intentionality that I think normally in that

25   type of vehicular homicide would not be included.

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    You are assuming, of

 2   course, that the canon of ejusdem generis applies to the

 3   statute, as opposed to Congress just singling out a

 4   couple of things it wanted to be sure were covered.                      And

 5   we left that issue open in James, didn't we?

 6              MS. KATZE:          Yes, you did.               In James you were

 7   dealing with a clearly analogous case, and DWI is not

 8   analogous in any way, shape, or form with those four

 9   enumerated crimes.      And I think that it's pretty

10   clear --

11              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Well, in one way -- in

12   one way it is, in that like those other crimes it

13   presents a serious risk of potential injury to another.

14   That's what they all have in common.                      It's a residual --

15   one argument that was made was when the statute was

16   first drafted all it had was the residual, "presents a

17   serious risk of potential injury to another."                      So

18   that's, the argument is, that's what drives this

19   statute, and then these, these specific crimes, were

20   added just to be sure they would be covered.

21              MS. KATZE:          Your Honor, answering your

22   question and the Chief Justice's question, I think it's

23   important to remember that the first version of this

24   statute came out in 1984, and that just involved

25   burglary and robbery.        And then in 1986, we have the


                                          8

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   version that we have now.

 2                 What we are discussing is the debate in

 3   Congress that occurred between then and how the actual

 4   wording was made up.       But I submit that if Congress

 5   wanted to use those four enumerated crimes merely as an

 6   example, they would have structured the paragraph

 7   differently.    They would have made a third paragraph

 8   under definition of violent felony and they didn't.

 9                 There are two paragraphs.                  The second

10   paragraph, the one that we're dealing with, clearly

11   there's a substantive connection between the four

12   enumerated crimes and it says, "or otherwise crimes that

13   present a serious potential risk of injury."

14                 It seems clear to me if we look at this

15   under the rules of statutory interpretation -- and this

16   is a statutory interpretation case -- that Congress

17   added those four crimes as a means of limiting the

18   residual clause.

19                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Then why did it use the

20   word "otherwise"?    Why didn't it use the word

21   "likewise"?

22                 MS. KATZE:      I would agree, "likewise" would

23   have been a more artful way to have written it.

24                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            It would have meant

25   something different, wouldn't it?

 1                 MS. KATZE:       I think, in fact --

 2                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            "Otherwise" means in some

 3   other way.

 4                 MS. KATZE:       That's the dictionary

 5   definition, Your Honor.

 6                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, yes.

 7                 (Laughter.)

 8                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            That's usually the best way

 9   to understand each other is by, you know, assuming that.

10                 MS. KATZE:       I would agree that's one thing

11   that we look at.     But under -- this is a statutory

12   interpretation case, not a dictionary case, and we have

13   to look at the plain meaning.               And that involves looking

14   at this turn of the phrase in context, in the whole

15   text.     What was -- what was the intent of this statute?

16   What's the term to be defined, "violent felony."

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            You've run away from me on

18   "otherwise."     I think the "otherwise" ties the last

19   paragraph to the -- to the preceding four enumerated

20   crimes.    And if -- if it had just gone on to say "or

21   presents a serious risk of injury" without the

22   "otherwise," then I don't think you'd have any argument

23   that you have to somehow look to the degree of injury,

24   the -- the manner of injury that the four enumerated

25   crimes have.     The "otherwise" ties it together, "or


                                         10

 1   otherwise presents a risk of serious injury."

 2                 And I think the implication is that the --

 3   that the -- the injury must be similar to the -- at

 4   least in degree to the enumerated crimes beforehand.                  I

 5   wouldn't run away from the "otherwise."

 6                 MS. KATZE:       Your Honor, and I'm not running

 7   away from the "otherwise."            While I don't agree that

 8   it's the dictionary meaning, I do agree with you, Your

 9   Honor, that it is the substantive link.                   It's the

10   connection.    It's a word and we have to give meaning to

11   every word in the statute --

12                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            But in -- in doing that,

13   you've got, in other words, to understand what

14   "otherwise" means.      You've got to look at the language

15   that follows "otherwise."            And that's -- that then

16   refers to "risk of serious injury to a person."                  And in

17   effect, it is saying the common element is risk of

18   injury to the person.        How that risk is raised may be in

19   different ways from the way the risk is raised, say, in

20   a burglary case or what-not.              And if that is the proper

21   analysis, then it seems to me you've got a tough row to

22   hoe here.

23                 MS. KATZE:       I believe the correct

24   analysis -- and I do believe that ejusdem generis does

25   apply here, because here we have a list of four specific

 1   offenses followed by a general term, and we have to read

 2   that general term narrowly so as not to give additional

 3   breadth to acts of Congress.             And we have to remember

 4   that we're defining the term "violent felony".                     And

 5   those four violent felonies that have the certain

 6   attributes in common then are followed by "or

 7   otherwise."    And in looking at it all in context, there

 8   has to be some --

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, but then I was

10   wondering about that as well, that as a violent felony

11   whether that gives you any traction.                     But extortion, you

12   don't normally think of that as a violent felony and yet

13   it's clearly included in the definition.

14                 MS. KATZE:      It's violent in the sense that

15   extortion is trying to get something from somebody of

16   value.   It's the idea that --

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Yes, but you don't

18   say, give me that or I'll break your legs all the time.

19   You may say, give me that or I'll release this

20   embarrassing letter.       That's extortion.                It's not

21   violent, though.

22                 MS. KATZE:      I think it is violent in the

23   sense of the terms that this Court used in Leocal and

24   that Justice Breyer used in Doe, the idea of some kind

25   of violent act or more closely related action.

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But then, releasing

 2   the letter is not violent and it may cause embarrassment

 3   rather than physical injury.             Yet it would qualify as

 4   extortion.

 5                MS. KATZE:       It absolutely would, and this

 6   Court in Taylor said that the four crimes all have those

 7   -- basically, in general, have those attributes.

 8                But I think we have to look at the ordinary

 9   case.   I believe even in the hypothetical that you have

10   given, Your Honor, is that -- that that does involve an

11   act of violence against an individual's reputation, that

12   reputation in the common law sense --

13                JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, but it says "person,"

14   not -- it says "person," not "reputation."

15                MS. KATZE:       I'm sorry, Your Honor?

16                JUSTICE SOUTER:            You're saying the violence

17   can be against the reputation.               That's not what the

18   statute is talking about.           I mean that is -- that's

19   inconsistent with the plain language of the statute.

20                MS. KATZE:       But the statute does talk about

21   violence.    If we look at the --

22                JUSTICE SOUTER:            It doesn't talk about

23   violence in the abstract.           It talks about physical force

24   against the person of another in number 1; and in number

25   2, where we are here, "a risk of physical injury to

 1   another."

 2                 MS. KATZE:       Yes, Your Honor.           And in the

 3   second paragraph it deals with property crimes.                  And the

 4   whole -- it all comes under the rubric of violent

 5   crimes.     That's what Congress was concerned about.                  Even

 6   the serious drug offenses, the reason those were added

 7   to the statute is the concern about violence with drugs.

 8   So it all has to do with the idea of violence, and so,

 9   initially, it was --

10                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, it has to do with the

11   idea of risk of violence.            A burglar when he commits

12   burglary does not want violence.                 He wants to get the

13   silver out of the sideboard and get back down the

14   ladder.   He doesn't want any violence with anybody.

15                 MS. KATZE:       I would agree with you, Your

16   Honor.

17                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            And the problem is that, by

18   being in the situation he's in, he creates a risk that

19   violence will occur.        Somebody may show up.

20                 And the person, likewise, who commits DWI

21   doesn't want to hurt anybody, but he has placed himself

22   in a situation in which, if somebody shows up driving

23   another car in front of him or walking across the street

24   or maybe even in apprehending him for his DWI, a risk of

25   violence is raised.       The two cases in that respect are

 1   parallel.

 2               MS. KATZE:       I would disagree, Your Honor,

 3   and here's why I don't think they're parallel.            In a

 4   burglary, I agree with you, The individual doesn't want

 5   to get caught, but goes with the fear or the knowledge

 6   that they may be apprehended.             They may arm

 7   themselves -- again, the concern with those violent

 8   activities and being armed.

 9               JUSTICE SOUTER:            When the drunk leaves the

10   bar, doesn't he have the realization, unless he is just

11   blind at that point, that he may be apprehended?

12               MS. KATZE:       It is just --

13               JUSTICE SOUTER:            He's not going to throw

14   himself into the arms of the nearest cop.

15               MS. KATZE:       Absolutely not, but here's the

16   big -- the big difference.          If somebody is drunk and

17   gets in a car, at most their intention is to get from

18   Point A to Point B.     They have no intention of hurting

19   an individual.   They don't even have the intent of

20   driving.

21               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Right, but when a guy goes

22   up the ladder for the silver in the sideboard, at most

23   what he wants is the silver.

24               MS. KATZE:       But he intentionally goes to

25   somebody else's property to commit this act that will

 1   cause harm.

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, the driver

 3   intentionally drives the car knowing that there's a

 4   risk.

 5                 MS. KATZE:      With all due respect, Your

 6   Honor, in DWI there is no intention to drive.               It's a

 7   strict liability offense, as the example I gave in --

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But that -- that is

 9   because everybody knows there are -- there are two

10   conditions:    One in which he just is reckless and he

11   doesn't care, in which case he has the intent; the other

12   one, he's so drunk he can't form the intent.              Both of

13   them are covered, and the latter is simply because we

14   don't want an excuse to exonerate the more culpable of

15   the two.

16                 MS. KATZE:      Your Honor, in New Mexico, DWI

17   is a strict liability.        There is no intent.        There is

18   not even negligence.       It's merely being in control of a

19   vehicle.

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           That's true in almost

21   every State, for the reasons that I've indicated,

22   because many people have the intent, and those that

23   don't shouldn't be exonerated because they're more

24   drunk.

25                 MS. KATZE:      If I may just add as well, in

 1   some of the discussions about the actions of DWI and

 2   running into people, it's important to note, if we're

 3   looking at this with a categorical analysis, just to

 4   look at the elements of the offense.                     DWI in New Mexico

 5   would necessarily -- there would have to be another

 6   element.   If somebody --

 7               JUSTICE ALITO:          The residual clause is a

 8   difficult problem, but I still have not heard what

 9   characteristic the enumerated offenses have in common,

10   all of them, that provides a basis for limiting the

11   residual clause.

12               They're not all property crimes.                     A lot of

13   crimes involving explosives:            Illegal possession of

14   explosives, illegally manufacturing explosives,

15   obtaining explosives by making false statements.                       None

16   of those are property crimes and none of them involve

17   injury to a person -- I mean involve the threat of the

18   use of force against a person.              So what is the

19   characteristic that all of the enumerated crimes have in

20   common that would provide a limitation on the residual

21   clause?

22               MS. KATZE:       At their very least, they all

23   are acts that intend to cause harm.                     They all are

24   property crimes.   This Court reiterated --

25               JUSTICE ALITO:          No, they're not.             In 18

 1   U.S.C. 842, explosives, unlawful -- "It shall be

 2   unlawful to engage in the business of importing,

 3   manufacturing, or dealing in explosive materials without

 4   a license issued under this chapter."

 5                 MS. KATZE:      Your Honor --

 6                 JUSTICE ALITO:         There's no intent to cause

 7   harm there.

 8                 MS. KATZE:      Your Honor, the term in the

 9   Armed Career Criminal Act is the "use of explosives."

10   This Court has defined "use" as having an

11   intentionality, and intent -- and I think it's fair to

12   say that that intent to use those explosives -- and,

13   from a practical point of view, people who -- and we

14   could talk about the ordinary case.                      People who use

15   explosives, they blow up property.                  They blow up houses.

16   They blow up bridges.       At the very least, they're

17   blowing up explosives.        That certainly -- that certainly

18   is an act to cause some type of harm to property.

19                 And, with respect to whether they are

20   property, I submit all four are property crimes.                      This

21   Court said in Taylor all four of them are property

22   crimes.   This Court interpreted the congressional -- the

23   legislative history.       Those were four property crimes

24   that Congress specifically wanted to add to the concern

25   about violence --

 1              JUSTICE SCALIA:             I don't -- I don't

 2   understand this line of argue.              You would exclude, let's

 3   say, physical assault from -- from this, I mean assault

 4   with intent to kill, because it's not a property crime?

 5              MS. KATZE:        Yes.

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:             That wouldn't be included

 7   in the "otherwise involved"?

 8              MS. KATZE:        No, Your Honor, that would not

 9   fit under paragraph 2.       That would fit under paragraph

10   1, the use of force against an individual.

11              Congress carefully crafted this statute.

12   They dealt with serious drug offenses and they dealt

13   with offenses against people, and then they dealt with

14   offenses against property where there was --

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  It's kind of odd,

16   when the catch-all is phrased in terms of physical

17   injury to another, to say that it's concerned only with

18   property crimes.

19              MS. KATZE:        Property crimes with the

20   potential for physical injury to another, not just

21   purely property crimes.        The four enumerated crimes all

22   have the potential for physical injury to another.

23              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, it seems to me that

24   your argument gives us greater reason to treat the last

25   clause as independent just so that we can be sure that


                                       19
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   it doesn't include only property crimes, because, as the

 2   Chief Justice just pointed out, "physical injury" is

 3   really the term that does the work in the second clause.

 4               So it seems to me that you're almost giving

 5   us a reason to make that clause more independent, more

 6   forceful, more significant.

 7               MS. KATZE:       Absolutely not, Your Honor.          You

 8   wouldn't be able to make that interpretation, which is

 9   basically what the government is suggesting, which would

10   read "otherwise" out of the statute and therefore either

11   make it tantamount to a third paragraph, which there is

12   not a third paragraph, or would basically make the

13   residual clause so broad it would swallow the entire

14   statute.   And we can't believe that Congress would have

15   so carefully delineated the different areas of violent

16   felonies and then eviscerate it all with this residual

17   clause.

18               JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask this question

19   about your interpretation of the word "otherwise."            Do

20   you think it is the equivalent of the statute that

21   omitted that word, but added in "conduct that presents

22   an equally serious potential risk of physical injury"?

23   Do you think -- in other words, do you think that the

24   four examples define the risk of physical injury that,

25   the risk of potential physical injury the statute

 1   contemplates?

 2                 MS. KATZE:       Your Honor, I don't know that I

 3   would agree "equally serious" would be the exact correct

 4   equivalent.     I think that that would be in keeping with

 5   Justice Scalia's, more or less, my impression of Justice

 6   Scalia's dissent in James, because I would submit that

 7   there has to be even more than just an equal balance of

 8   risk.   I do think that is an issue that needs to be

 9   compared, as this Court did in James.                     The Court

10   compared the risk of attempted burglary to burglary and

11   found that they were similar.

12                 I think in a non-analogous case there are

13   other attributes that we'd have to look at, and that's

14   why we suggest --

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, doesn't that

16   suggest that "otherwise" in the statute is in fact used

17   to mean "likewise"?       I mean, if we said "attempted

18   burglary" in James it's obviously included because

19   burglary is -- attempted burglary doesn't present a risk

20   in a different fashion from burglary.                     It presents it in

21   the same fashion.

22                 MS. KATZE:       And that was this Court's

23   analysis in James, and I think that that's reasonable to

24   --

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 That was a helpful

 1   question.

 2               (Laughter.)

 3               MS. KATZE:       I think it's important not to

 4   lose sight of the term that we are defining, "violent

 5   felony," and that -- as well as the purpose or intent of

 6   the statute was to punish a very small percentage, as

 7   this -- as this Court said in Taylor, a very small

 8   percentage of very serious offenders.                   This isn't a

 9   statute that is written to say any individual who has

10   three felony convictions that may cause serious

11   potential risk of injury to an individual is going to

12   get 15 years.   That simply wasn't the purpose.                 The --

13   the intent of the statute was to punish this small

14   population of individuals.

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, particularly

16   when you look at subsection (i) in the broad reading of

17   serious potential risk of (ii), why would -- why would

18   Congress mean to exclude a particular category of

19   physical injury from the reach of the statute?

20               MS. KATZE:       Because if it -- if it did

21   include absolutely everything, then it would swallow the

22   whole statute, because certainly --

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No, not everything;

24   everything that presents a serious potential risk of

25   physical injury.

 1                 MS. KATZE:       I think it -- if it -- for

 2   example, if it could include DWI, it would be hard to

 3   imagine what kind of crime wouldn't be included in

 4   there.    Under that type of reading, if we look at the

 5   structure --

 6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Filling out a false income

 7   tax return.    I mean, I thought of one.

 8                 MS. KATZE:       Other than maybe some

 9   white-collar crime.

10                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, there is a whole

11   category of those.      So --

12                 MS. KATZE:       But the -- the problem with that

13   analysis is that Congress was very clear who these --

14   who this statute was geared at; and as Judge McConnell

15   said in his dissent, the name of the statute, the Armed

16   Career Criminal Act, is not just window dressing.

17   There's a -- I mean, that just reinforces our

18   interpretation that there is this very small percentage

19   of individuals.    It's not supposed to be a general catch

20   phrase.   And --

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What do you think

22   presents the most serious potential risk of injury to

23   all of us, that we are going to be a victim of arson or

24   that we are likely to get hit by a drunk driver?

25                 MS. KATZE:       Here's why it's hard to answer

 1   that:   I wouldn't argue with you that there are more

 2   people driving drunk than there are people burglarizing

 3   houses, but the relevant analysis is what's the risk in

 4   an individual incident?         And in that case statistically

 5   there is a greater risk of injury in a burglary, under

 6   this Court's -- in Tennessee v Garner, it said 8.3

 7   percent, as opposed to a quarter of a percent in an

 8   individual episode of drunk driving.                     So we can't put

 9   the cumulative drunk driving on the back of Mr. Begay.

10   We look at the individual incident, doing categorical

11   analysis, looking at the elements in that individual

12   incident.

13                 Congress was very concerned about issues of

14   federalism.    The reason for the Armed Career Criminal

15   Act was to support law enforcement efforts on the part

16   of States, not to federalize crime, not to federalize

17   criminal investigation and prosecution.                    We are

18   suggesting that keeping that in mind and looking at the

19   -- the plain meaning of the phrase that we were

20   discussing, and looking at the way the statute is

21   actually structured and the fact that there are not

22   three different paragraphs, as well as the fact that

23   Congress could have picked to just say "or" as opposed

24   to "or otherwise," and we have to give "otherwise" a

25   meaning; and we suggest that our meaning of "likewise"

 1   is one that this Court has adopted previously.

 2               Previously this Court has said "or otherwise

 3   qualified for a position" and found that people were

 4   qualified in a similar way than other people; "otherwise

 5   qualified to vote," found that individuals were as

 6   qualified or similarly qualified as individuals of

 7   another race.   One other example, bringing a -- by

 8   certiorari "or otherwise" was found to be found to mean

 9   to be by similar means as certiorari.

10               And, Your Honor, if I may reserve the

11   remainder of my time?

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, Counsel.

15               ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER

16                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

17               MS. KRUGER:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

18   please the Court:

19               Drunk driving is an act that by its nature

20   endangers people's lives.           It is precisely for that

21   reason that it is a crime under the laws of all 50

22   States.   When a person is repeatedly convicted of that

23   offense and therefore becomes subject to punishment as a

24   felon, he has committed a violent felony as Congress

25   defined that term in the Armed Career Criminal Act, that


                                        25

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   is because he has committed a crime that in the words of

 2   the statute involves conduct that presents a serious

 3   potential risk of --

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How about a habitual

 5   speeder?

 6                MS. KRUGER:        Well, speeding isn't a felony

 7   offense under the laws of any State, to my knowledge.

 8   And we have to recall that the ACCA contains two

 9   requirements for treatment for prior conviction as a

10   violent felony that would support enhanced sentencing

11   under that act.    The felony requirement is not a trivial

12   requirement.    It was in fact a focus of congressional

13   debate, and it was intended to capture only serious

14   crimes.    As a general matter, crimes of ordinary

15   negligence, simple carelessness, or totally blameworthy

16   acts don't merit felony punishment.

17                As this Court recognized in Staples, to

18   label a criminal act as a felony is indeed a serious

19   thing and something that legislatures, by long

20   tradition, reserved for truly serious acts.

21                JUSTICE ALITO:          And what is the -- if the

22   legislature made it a crime to send text messages on a

23   cell phone while driving, and the punishment were severe

24   enough to qualify here?         Would that be treated the same

25   way?

 1               MS. KRUGER:         Well, it would present a harder

 2   question, Justice Alito, and that's because, for one

 3   thing, we don't have the uniform judgment of

 4   legislatures that helps us know in this case that drunk

 5   driving does in all cases present a serious risk of

 6   injury.   And also because the conduct that's defined by

 7   the DUI statute of New Mexico, as well as other States,

 8   by definition defines conduct that is unsafe.                 You only

 9   violate the statute if you are impaired to such a degree

10   that your faculties and motor skills are such that you

11   are unable to drive a car safely.                 With text messaging

12   there isn't quite that categorical mapping on of the

13   risk to the conduct that's proscribed.

14               JUSTICE BREYER:             So there is no State where

15   speeding -- even if maybe you hurt somebody or something

16   -- there is no State where speeding is under a statute

17   that you could be imprisoned for more than a year?

18               MS. KRUGER:         To my knowledge, there is no

19   State in which speeding itself is a felony offense.

20               JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, a felony as defined

21   here.   I just wanted to be sure you're focusing -- it's

22   defined here as "subject to by imprisonment for a term

23   exceeding one year."       Now is --

24               MS. KRUGER:         To my knowledge, at least,

25   Justice Breyer --

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:             Okay, I just want to be

 2   sure we're on the same wavelength.                  Fine.

 3               MS. KRUGER:         Reckless driving, on the other

 4   hand, when it does result in serious physical injury to

 5   another, is often punished as a felony.                      But there is

 6   obviously a difference between speeding by itself and

 7   reckless driving.

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Ms. Kruger, what I don't

 9   understand about this statute as you're interpreting it

10   is why you need any of it except the last phrase?                      Once

11   you give the last phrase, "involves conduct that

12   presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to

13   another," all of the rest of it is automatically

14   included.   "Has as an element the use, attempted use or

15   threatened use of physical force against the person of

16   another" -- that obviously presents a serious potential

17   risk of physical injury to another.                      Or is burglary,

18   arson, extortion, the use of explosives?                      Congress could

19   have saved itself a lot of trouble by simply erasing all

20   the rest of the statute and simply saying any conduct

21   that presents a serious potential risk of physical

22   injury or not.   That can't be what they meant.

23               MS. KRUGER:         Well, what this Court said

24   about the structure of the statute in Taylor is that

25   Congress's purpose was first to identify crimes that do


                                        28
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   have as an element the use force, but also to capture a

 2   category of crimes that do not have as an element the

 3   use force but nevertheless present a potential harm to

 4   another human being.

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why -- why would Congress

 6   go through that trouble, unless they wanted to suggest

 7   what other kind of crimes they need to include by this

 8   residual category of "any conduct" that presents a

 9   serious potential risk of physical injury?

10              MS. KRUGER:        Well, indeed as the Court said

11   in Taylor and I think as the Court reiterated in James,

12   it included the examples of four enumerated offenses in

13   clause 2 to provide examples of the kinds of crimes that

14   they believed to present a serious --

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:            The degree of risk -- the

16   degree of risk, for example?

17              MS. KRUGER:        Yes.

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:            So if it doesn't come up to

19   the degree of risk that any of those four would, it

20   would not be included?

21              MS. KRUGER:        Well, I don't know that the --

22              JUSTICE SCALIA:            No.

23              MS. KRUGER:        -- that the enumerated crimes

24   set an absolute four.     Congress could have written a

25   statute that said that --

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, then what did it do?

 2   What's it do?

 3                 MS. KRUGER:        They do provide examples of the

 4   kinds of crimes that Congress thought did present a

 5   serious risk.

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            How?      How?     How does it

 7   limit the latter part?         Is it because they are all

 8   crimes that require mens rea, intent?                     So should we

 9   limit it by saying it has to be a -- a conduct that's

10   intentional conduct that presents a serious risk?

11                 MS. KRUGER:        Well, I think, as the Court

12   said in James, all of these crimes are quite different

13   offenses that don't share very many characteristics in

14   common, including incidentally intent to cause harm.

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But you say it does limit

16   it.     So tell me how it limits it?

17                 MS. KRUGER:        Well, what it does is it

18   provides a useful benchmark against which to assess the

19   risks that are associated with any other crime.

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's nice.        Benchmark of

21   what?     Of intent, of degree of risk?

22                 MS. KRUGER:        Of degree -- it's degree and

23   kinds of risk.     Yes.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay.       So the degree of

25   risk has to be pretty much similar to those four?

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              MS. KRUGER:         It has to be comparable, which

 2   is what the Court said in James --

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Comparable --

 4              MS. KRUGER:         And in this case we do think

 5   that the risks associated with DUI are comparable to the

 6   risks --

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  How do we know that?

 8   I guess this is a question I asked your friend.                 I mean,

 9   degree of risk.   I mean what are the odds that we're

10   going to -- that if there's a burglary, some physical

11   injury might result as opposed to an episode of drunk

12   driving.

13              MS. KRUGER:         Well, Your Honor --

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  In other words, I

15   guess -- do we really look at how -- what percentage of

16   drunk drivers are involved in accidents as opposed to

17   what percentage of burglars are involved in violent

18   confrontations?

19              MS. KRUGER:         No, Your Honor.           I don't think

20   that the answer to the question can turn on statistical

21   comparisons of the likelihood that harm will result in

22   any given episode of any of these crimes.                 I think that

23   that is a proposition that the Court underscored in

24   James, when it decided whether attempted burglary

25   qualified without reference to hard statistics.                 And the


                                       31
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   fact of the matter is that hard statistics in most of

 2   these crimes are simply unavailable.                      So to make the

 3   answer in any case turn on the availability of

 4   statistics would lead to fundamentally arbitrary

 5   results.

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               One of the anomalies

 7   about this, and we start out -- this is an armed career

 8   criminal.   And you can say, well, burglary -- burglary

 9   and arson, if you're apprehended, you're the career

10   criminal; you commit these kinds of crimes.                      Congress

11   doesn't want you to have a gun, or if you do, you're

12   going to get the book thrown at you.                      But there doesn't

13   seem to be much of a connection.                 I mean how -- how is

14   it going to make the dangerous -- the drunk driver more

15   or less dangerous if he happens to have a gun in the

16   glove compartment?

17               MS. KRUGER:          Well, we think that it's clear

18   from the enumeration of the offenses in clause 2 in the

19   definition of "violent felony" that Congress wasn't

20   intending to capture only a set of crimes that are made

21   more dangerous when they're committed with a firearm.

22   It is, in fact, the kind of statute that Congress wrote

23   in 18 U.S.C. 942(c), which concerns the use or carrying

24   of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of

25   violence.   But here what Congress was concerned about


                                         32
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   was capturing a set of offenders who, by their criminal

 2   history, have demonstrated an inherent disregard for the

 3   value of human life and therefore should not only be

 4   prohibited from possessing firearms but should face

 5   particularly severe sanctions for failure to abide by

 6   that prohibition.    Our --

 7              JUSTICE BREYER:              Then they could have turned

 8   it just on dangerousness.           I'm back to Justice Scalia

 9   and Justice Ginsburg's question, and I'm simply sort of

10   repeating those in a sense that make it quite specific.

11   Imagine a universe of crimes.              Every member of that

12   universe we concede has precisely the same degree of

13   danger as arson, explosives, burglary.                   So there's no

14   argument about the risk to human life.                   It is identical.

15   And now we write a statute, and the statute's object is

16   to take people who are felons in possession of a gun and

17   those persons whom it is particularly bad that they have

18   a gun are going to go away for 15 years minimum.                   So

19   what we're looking are people who are particularly bad

20   that they have a gun.       Now go back to our universe, and

21   in that universe we have some things on the one hand

22   like arson, but on the other hand -- I have to name a

23   few, environmental crimes committed by negligence or

24   recklessness, where somebody flushed a toxic substance

25   down the drain or -- here's a good one I found -- if you

 1   are a steamboat captain or an executive of a steamboat

 2   company and you fail through negligence or simple

 3   inadvertence to stop somebody from not inspecting a

 4   lifeboat, well, felony or worse.              And there are quite a

 5   few dozens of these things:           Failing to stop at an

 6   inspection station if you are a trucker.               You know?

 7   There are quite a few, where what's at issue is

 8   negligence, thoughtlessness, and maybe even

 9   recklessness, but it seems to have nothing -- and it's

10   dangerous -- but has nothing to do with whether, when

11   later on you want a gun, you are a greater risk for

12   having a gun, you're more likely to pull the trigger,

13   you're more likely to aim it at somebody and shoot him.

14   Now, that's I think what we are trying to drive at.

15               MS. KRUGER:       Well, Your Honor, I think that

16   the initial response to that question is that the

17   statute that Congress wrote unequivocally focuses the

18   inquiry on the risk of harm to other human beings.

19   Congress could very well have written a statute that

20   required intent to harm.        It could have written a

21   statute that required intentional use of force, as it

22   did in --

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Oh, but it didn't mean that

24   -- you said it didn't mean that because they could have

25   said that and nothing else.           If that's what they meant,


                                      34

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   they could have eliminated everything else that they

 2   said.   They obviously meant to tie that to the preceding

 3   portions.    And when you tie it to the preceding

 4   portions, you come up with some limitations of the sort

 5   that Justice Breyer was suggesting.

 6                MS. KRUGER:        Well, I think you don't, Your

 7   Honor, because I think the most obvious way to tie it to

 8   the preceding sections is, again, to import a kind of

 9   use-of-force requirement such as the 18 U.S.C. 16(b)

10   requirements that would look at the risk of force

11   intentionally will be used in the course of committing

12   the offense, and --

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 How much of a

14   limitation is the point Justice Breyer was making?                  I

15   mean, let's say you've got a habitual drunk driver.

16   Everybody in town says he always drives drunk.                  I mean,

17   how would they greet the news:               Guess what?     He's just

18   got a gun.   I mean, that raises the level of risk

19   significantly, doesn't it?

20                MS. KRUGER:        Well, indeed, I think that it

21   does, and I think the facts of this case bear out that

22   Congress's concern about possession of firearms by

23   people who have committed crimes of a character that

24   present a serious risk in a serial manner was indeed

25   well-founded.

 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Can you tell me what test,

 2   what conclusion, you want me to come to in your

 3   argument?    Drunk driving is within the last clause

 4   because --

 5                MS. KRUGER:         It is because, first of all,

 6   the risks of drunk driving are commonly understood.

 7   They're supported by the uniform legislative judgment of

 8   the 50 States.     And also because those risks are

 9   comparable in both kind and degree to the kinds of risks

10   that are associated with crimes that Congress

11   specifically enumerated in the statute as meeting the

12   test.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:             She says not at all.   Your

14   friend on the other side says that it's something like,

15   what, two and a half percent for burglary and point

16   something for the chances of hurting somebody if you're

17   driving DUI?

18                MS. KRUGER:         Well, I think, again, the

19   statistical inquiry, while it can be helpful and

20   relevant in individual cases, is not dispositive.               I

21   think if you look at the statistics, the chances of

22   injury resulting from a given arson fire are also well

23   below 1 percent.    What Congress wasn't concerned about

24   was the statistical likelihood of any injury in a

25   particular episode --

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, I suppose you say

 2   most legislatures think this is dangerous.                 That's

 3   enough?

 4                 MS. KRUGER:        Well, I think that Congress was

 5   entitled to look at --

 6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I'm not trying to be

 7   captious, but I -- it's difficult to find out what the

 8   standard is.

 9                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Isn't the significance of

10   Justice Breyer's point that each of the listed crimes is

11   more dangerous when a criminal is carrying a gun, but

12   driving drunk isn't made any more dangerous whether or

13   not there's a gun in the car?

14                 MS. KRUGER:        Well, Justice Stevens, it's

15   difficult to see how arson, for example, or explosives

16   use is made more dangerous when the criminal is carrying

17   a gun.     Presumably in those cases the criminal's use --

18   weapon of choice is fire or explosives rather than a

19   gun.     The only risk that would inhere would be the risk

20   that any criminal would pose when apprehended by the

21   authorities, and it's the same risk that a presumably a

22   drunk driver would pose to others when apprehended by an

23   officer who pulls them over.

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Is a person who

25   deliberately burns down buildings, is a person who if he


                                         37

 1   had a gun might pull the trigger?                  And I will suggest

 2   that's a reasonable inference.                I also will give you

 3   this:   That a person who's so careless as to go drunk

 4   driving is a person whose gun might go off carelessly or

 5   he might leave it around the house.                       So I'll give you

 6   that one.     But my instinct is that Congress, in this

 7   Act, is not worried about guns going off carelessly

 8   around the house.     They are worried about a person being

 9   the kind of person who will point a gun at somebody and

10   pull the trigger.     Now, is there something you can say

11   that disabuses me of that instinct?

12                 MS. KRUGER:        Well, I think one way to start

13   to answer that question is by looking specifically at

14   what Congress likely meant when it referred to "arson"

15   in the statute.     Under 18 U.S.C. 844(i), arson is

16   defined as maliciously damaging property by means of

17   fire or explosives.       But the way courts have interpreted

18   that language is not to require intent to damage

19   property in all instances.            It also covers situations in

20   which the fire is set with willful disregard for the

21   likelihood that damage will occur; in other words, in

22   situations in which the fire has occurred and recklessly

23   poses harm.    And we think that that is the kind of

24   injury that is at issue in this case; that is,

25   fundamentally the same kind of risk that DUI poses.

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            You don't think this is

 2   just limited to intentional arson?                   You think negligent

 3   arson?     Wow.

 4                 MS. KRUGER:        Well, it's certainly true that

 5   --

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Negligent extortion,

 7   negligent use of explosives?              I mean, it's in a list of

 8   things that are talking about, you know, intentional

 9   crimes that armed career criminals would be likely to

10   do.

11                 MS. KRUGER:        Well, I think that Congress was

12   more than likely aware of the fact that 18 U.S.C. 844

13   did treat arson in this manner, particularly considering

14   that --

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't think Congress had

16   the slightest idea.

17                 (Laughter.)

18                 MS. KRUGER:        Well, the definition of -- the

19   reach of the Federal arson statute came to encompass use

20   of fire in 1982, only shortly before the ACCA was

21   enacted.    And certainly it's true that most State

22   legislatures have also defined arson offenses to include

23   similar kinds of intentional setting of fire with

24   reckless disregard to the likelihood of damage or injury

25   that would result.

 1                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Could you comment on one

 2   other point that Judge McConnell made in his opinion?

 3   Is there significance in the title of this statute,

 4   "Armed Career Criminal Act."             Does this statute intend

 5   to identify career criminals?

 6                 MS. KRUGER:       Well, I think it's difficult to

 7   see how it would support a limitation to the kinds of

 8   crimes that are normally committed as a means of

 9   livelihood in that sense of "career."                    It certainly does

10   refer to career criminals in the sense that they are

11   habitual offenders, that they are recidivists.                   But

12   certainly not all the enumerated offenses, nor even the

13   offenses that are encompassed by the definition that's

14   contained in clause 1 of the statute, are normally

15   committed as a means of violent --

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, I'm not so sure.           It

17   seems to me that the burglary, arson, extortion,

18   explosives involves at least the stereotype of the armed

19   career criminal that you see in movies and hear about in

20   organized crimes testimony and so forth.                   I don't -- I

21   don't think it's completely far of the mark.

22                 MS. KRUGER:       Well, it is certainly true that

23   the kind of --

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Obviously -- obviously

25   incomplete.

 1              MS. KRUGER:        Well, it's certainly true that

 2   the kinds of crimes that are encompassed by clause 1 of

 3   the definition, sort of traditional crimes of violence

 4   like murder, assault, rape, are not ordinarily committed

 5   as a means of livelihood.         People rarely make a

 6   profession of those types of careers.

 7              And it's also true that ordinarily arson is

 8   not committed for insurance fraud, but is committed for

 9   a large number of other purposes that have nothing to do

10   with the profit motive, including covering up evidence

11   of other crimes, including simple vandalism.

12              So I think it's implausible to think that

13   Congress was really focused here on the kinds of crimes

14   that are normally committed for profit.

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What else -- what else

16   would be in this catalogue?           You rejected my speeder,

17   but I think you said something about a reckless driver

18   might, habitually reckless driver.                What else would fit

19   the description "conduct that presents a serious

20   potential risk of physical injury to another"?

21              MS. KRUGER:        We think the category of crimes

22   of recklessness that pose an injury, reckless disregard

23   of the risk of injury to others, would qualify because

24   in those cases juries have necessarily found that there

25   was objectively a serious risk and that failures to


                                      41

 1   appreciate that risk and to act accordingly constitutes

 2   a gross deviation from the ordinary standard of care

 3   that a reasonable person would exercise.

 4              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                I'd like to know

 5   specifically.    You said reckless driving; and what else?

 6              MS. KRUGER:           Reckless driving that results

 7   in serious bodily injury or death to another, which is a

 8   felony under the laws of many States, would qualify.

 9              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                That has the potential of

10   doing that, not --

11              MS. KRUGER:           Yes, but reckless driving

12   simple is ordinarily, not punishable as a felony under

13   the traffic laws.     We think, similarly, reckless

14   homicide would qualify.

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                But wouldn't that come in

16   in the first, the violent crime, the first part?

17              MS. KRUGER:           Well, presumably it wouldn't,

18   because by definition a reckless homicide does not

19   involve the intentional use of force, the threatened use

20   of force, or attempted use of force.                      And the definition

21   relates solely to the killing of another, whether or not

22   by intentional use of force, in situations that

23   disregard the great dangerousness to human life and

24   those actions.

25              The other things that would qualify would be

 1   cases like DUI, where recklessness need not be proved as

 2   such, but that are underscored by legislative

 3   determinations that the conduct that is proscribed is by

 4   definition reckless, by definition poses a serious risk

 5   that a person should appreciate and should accordingly

 6   conform their conduct to a different standard.

 7              Petitioner's argument suffers from the

 8   fundamental flaw that it describes a statute that

 9   Congress didn't write.      Congress did indeed consider

10   incorporating the definition of "crime of violence" that

11   is set forth at 18 U.S.C. 16 when it redrafted the

12   statute in 1986 and it decided against it, instead

13   making the inquiry turn on the potential for risk to

14   human life as opposed to the potential that -- the risk

15   that force would be used or on the intentional use of

16   force.

17              We think that that decision is one that

18   needs to be given effect in interpreting the statute.

19   As this Court recognized in Leocal, the risk of

20   intentional use of force is simply not the same thing

21   that a risk of -- the risk that an accident will occur

22   that will cause serious injury to another.

23              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             May I ask about something

24   in your brief on page 37?         You said:            "Congress settled

25   on this language because it had two other proposals, one


                                      43

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that it considered too narrow and one that it considered

 2   as potentially too broad."           And the one that it

 3   considered potentially too broad is "any felony that by

 4   its nature involves a substantial risk that physical

 5   force against a person or property of another may be

 6   used in the course of committing an offense is the" --

 7   this is on page 37 of your brief.

 8                MS. KRUGER:        Yes, Your Honor.         That is the

 9   definition of "crime of violence" that's contained at 18

10   U.S.C. 16.   And it is, indeed, unquestionably broader

11   than the definition of "violent felony" at

12   924(e)(2)(D)(ii) in at least two respects.               One is that

13   it would cover misdemeanors involving use of force as

14   well as felonies.    And the second is that it would cover

15   crimes that involve a risk that force would be used

16   against property, rather than focusing exclusively on

17   the risk of harm to a human being, as the definition of

18   "violent felony" in the ACCA does.

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It would, in the case of

20   drunk driving - though, it seems this would be a better

21   case for the Petitioner if we were operating under this

22   statute.

23                MS. KRUGER:        Well, indeed, I think that that

24   is the thrust of the court's decision --

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It's narrower in that

 1   sense as applied to this case.

 2               MS. KRUGER:        That's correct.

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            May I ask you this

 4   question?   If the government were not to prevail in the

 5   first case, Rodriguez, should we remand in this case,

 6   because -- because then he -- the fourth felony would

 7   have been improperly found if we rule against the

 8   government in Rodriguez?

 9               MS. KRUGER:        Well, if the Court decided to

10   reach that issue in this case, even though the issue was

11   not pressed or passed on in the court of appeals and

12   wasn't raised in the cert petition, we do think the

13   Court's analysis of the issue in that case applies

14   equally to its analysis of the issue of whether or not

15   the felony prong of the definition of "violent felony"

16   is applicable in this case.

17               So were the Court to decide that the

18   applicable maximum term of imprisonment that applies to

19   a recidivist is the term of imprisonment that would

20   apply to a hypothetical first-time offender, then that

21   decision would control in this case as well.            And the

22   Court should dispose of this case accordingly.

23               But it bears noting that that would not

24   dispose of this question entirely, because there are, of

25   course, other reasons why States treat drunk driving


                                       45
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   offenses as felony offenses, particularly in situations

 2   in which they result in serious bodily harm or death to

 3   another, as Your Honor previously noted.

 4              The issue in this case comes down to the

 5   interpretation of the statute that Congress wrote, not a

 6   hypothetical statute that Congress could have written.

 7   And that statute identifies one criterion for

 8   determining whether or not a felony offense qualifies as

 9   a violent felony under the ACCA, and that is its

10   potential for harming other human beings.

11              Drunk driving is commonly understood to

12   present a serious potential risks of injury.                The

13   potential risks of injury are the only reason why it's a

14   crime under the laws of 50 States.                And the risks

15   associated with drunk driving are comparable in both

16   kind and degree to the risks associated with arson and

17   explosives use, two crimes that Congress specifically

18   identified in the statute as satisfying its definition.

19              For that reason, we think that the court of

20   appeals correctly determined that Mr. Begay was

21   sentenced properly under the Armed Career Criminal Act

22   and would urge the Court to affirm its determination.

23              If there are no further questions, thank

24   you.

 3              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARGARET A. KATZE

 4                      ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 5              MS. KATZE:          The problem with the

 6   Government's interpretation is that it offers no

 7   limiting principle whatsoever.                It's merely open to say

 8   absolutely any offense that would present a serious

 9   potential risk of injury to another would fall within

10   the statute.   And that clearly does not take Congress's

11   intent to heart.

12              And there has to be some other limiting

13   principle, something more than just the words in the

14   residual clause, especially when we are giving every

15   word in the statute meaning.              We suggest that our test

16   of analyzing those four enumerated crimes which were

17   intentionally put there by Congress, to look at the

18   attributes of those four crimes.                 That they are active,

19   violent property crimes more typical of crimes committed

20   by career offenders, more dangerous when committed with

21   a gun --

22              JUSTICE ALITO:             Why wouldn't drunk driving

23   be property crime?      Doesn't it cause an enormous amount

24   of property damage?

25              MS. KATZE:          Under a categorical analysis,


                                         47

 1   there is no element that has anything to do with

 2   property whatsoever in DWI, which brings me to my next

 3   point that recidivism is not an element of DWI in New

 4   Mexico.

 5              The elements to commit DWI in the first

 6   offense are exactly the same as the fourth offense.

 7   There is no difference.          And there is -- certainly,

 8   Congress, intended that there would be a distinction

 9   between violent, intentional felonies and accidental or,

10   at worst, negligent crimes.

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Extortion doesn't

12   involve property as an element.

13              MS. KATZE:          I believe it does.            It's trying

14   to get something of value from another person.                   That

15   thing of value is property.

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Something of value

17   -- something of value could be, you know, a confession

18   in a related case or something.                It doesn't necessarily

19   have to be property.

20              MS. KATZE:          In the ordinary case, it's

21   property even if we think of it as reputation; property

22   in the sense of the common law, life, liberty, and

23   property; that that includes more than just physical

24   property, I think.      In addition, this Court has said

25   that those four offenses are --

 1                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I don't understand

 2   that.    Yes.    Life, liberty, and property include more

 3   than property, but --

 4                   MS. KATZE:      "Property" includes more than

 5   tangible, physical property.               Reputation is considered

 6   property under that definition.                 Merely stating that --

 7                   JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I thought you said that

 8   you -- you look at the generality of cases.                    In most

 9   extortion cases what they want is money.

10                   MS. KATZE:      That is correct, and money is

11   property.     And that is exactly what -- in addition to

12   the fact that this Court said in Taylor that those four

13   offenses are property offenses.                   And, again, in James

14   this Court again referred to those four offenses as --

15                   JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, if you look at the

16   generality of drunk-driving offenses, those that result

17   in physical injury almost always involve, or in the

18   great majority of cases involve, property damage, too;

19   don't they?

20                   MS. KATZE:      But that's not an element of the

21   crime.   We can --

22                   JUSTICE ALITO:         It's not an element of some

23   of these other crimes, either.                 Is it an element in

24   burglary?     Is there a property element in burglary?

25                   MS. KATZE:      Yes, Your Honor.           There is a

 1   breaking and entering into a building, in some type or

 2   respect a property.

 3                 JUSTICE ALITO:         That's an entering.           An

 4   unlawful entering --

 5                 MS. KATZE:      Right.

 6                 JUSTICE ALITO:         That's a property element?

 7                 MS. KATZE:      Yes, sir.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What about --

 9                 MS. KATZE:      You have to enter a property.

10   It's this something -- property --

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, we know that

12   attempted burglary is covered, and you don't have to

13   enter the house in an attempted burglary.

14                 MS. KATZE:      I think that's exactly the

15   situation when there are analogous crimes.                   It's clear

16   to see that --

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Yes.   Well, you are

18   saying this is an analogous crime to the four that are

19   listed, or it is not an analogous crime to the four that

20   are listed?

21                 MS. KATZE:      That's correct, but this Court

22   has said that the four offenses that were enumerated by

23   Congress are, in fact, property crimes.                    This Court has

24   said that in Taylor and again referred to those four

25   crimes as property crimes in James.

 1               But even if this Court doesn't believe they

 2   are property crimes, the bottom line is DWI is so far

 3   afield of the four enumerated crimes, the attributes

 4   that they had, at the very least the intent to do crime,

 5   that it's clearly outside the scope of what Congress

 6   could ever have intended.

 7               Thank you.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, Ms.

 9   Katze.   The case is submitted.
