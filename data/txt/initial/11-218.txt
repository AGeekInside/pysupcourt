 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Case 11-218, Tibbals v. Carter.

 5                 Ms. Schimmer.

 6            ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDRA T. SCHIMMER

 7                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                 MS. SCHIMMER:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10                 This case is here from the Sixth Circuit,

11   which held that habeas claims can be stayed indefinitely

12   because prisoners have a statutory right to competence

13   to assist in their case, but even Mr. Carter now disowns

14   the circuit's rationale, and the court's indefinite stay

15   order was wrong for two other reasons.

16                 First, habeas claims cannot be stayed

17   indefinitely.   Doing so is fundamentally incompatible

18   with the timeliness concerns underlying AEDPA.

19                 Second, while we readily acknowledge that

20   limited stays will be appropriate in some situations,

21   this is not one of them.       All of Mr. Carter's claims are

22   record based and, therefore, resolvable without his

23   assistance.

24                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       What situations would they

25   be appropriate in?


                                      3

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1                 MS. SCHIMMER:      Limited stays, we think, Your

 2   Honor, would be stay -- appropriate in situations where

 3   the prisoner's ability to effectively communicate with

 4   his counsel or to disclose evidence would be necessary

 5   to his claim.    And we think that would be true in a

 6   case, potentially, where AEDPA does not restrict Federal

 7   review to the state court record.

 8                 So here, for instance, we think that the

 9   prisoner's assistance would not be necessary, and

10   therefore, even a limited stay would not be appropriate

11   because all of Mr. Carter's claims were vetted before

12   the state courts and decided on the merits.             And

13   therefore, under 2254(d), in this Court's decision in

14   Pinholster, the Federal court is limited to reviewing

15   the state court record.

16                 We don't think that the prisoner's

17   assistance in that case is necessary.             We don't think

18   Mr. Carter has made a case for why his assistance would

19   be necessary in this specific case.

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, why -- why shouldn't

21   the rule be that an indefinite stay is -- is never

22   necessary?    You just proceed based on the evidence you

23   have?

24                 Sometimes, we have evidence where a witness

25   is missing.    We have to go on with the case.           Then it


                                      4

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   could be open to argue in a later case that there was


 2   new evidence that was not available.


 3                 MS. SCHIMMER:      Well, we absolutely agree,


 4   Justice Kennedy, that indefinite stays are never


 5   appropriate, regardless of the circumstances; that

 6   indefinite stays contravene AEDPA's timeliness concerns.

 7   And to the extent that all of the parties in this case

 8   agree now that, to the extent district courts have some

 9   power to issue stays -- we say only limited stays -- in

10   these cases, that power is grounded in equitable

11   discretion.

12                 And we do not think that it comports with

13   equitable discretion to allow a prisoner essentially to

14   win his case, to obtain a suspension of his capital

15   sentence, the ultimate end relief that he seeks --

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What about the second part

17   of -- of the equation?      So, suppose that there's no

18   stay, that the habeas proceeding is adjudicated against

19   the petitioner.   He then becomes competent and claims

20   there's new evidence.      Would -- would that be grounds to

21   reopen, you think?

22                 MS. SCHIMMER:      Well, we think in those

23   situations -- certainly, the State of Ohio wouldn't

24   contest, for instance, under 2254(b), that if you were

25   incompetent before, that that would be a legitimate


                                      5

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   basis, potentially, for not having been able to

 2   reasonably discover a new claim, if one had a new claim.

 3               So we do think that -- moving forward, that

 4   no indefinite stay should be permitted.                And when the

 5   courts move forward, yes, if someone's competency is

 6   later restored, there are backstops.                The person,

 7   certainly in Ohio, can always go back to state court

 8   and --

 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:               And would the backstop be

10   newly discovered evidence?

11               MS. SCHIMMER:          The backstop would be a newly

12   discovered claim, I would say.              I think that would be

13   what --

14               JUSTICE KAGAN:           Ms. Schimmer, if you are

15   right that no stay was appropriate in these

16   circumstances, we would never reach the question of how

17   much of a stay is appropriate in other circumstances;

18   isn't that right?

19               MS. SCHIMMER:          I think that's right because

20   I think -- to the extent that, using this case as a

21   springboard, the Court could draw the boundary line --

22   could -- could draw one bright boundary line and say

23   indefinite stays are never permitted, but limited stays

24   might be permitted in cases where the claims are not

25   record based.   I --

 1               JUSTICE KAGAN:       I'm saying the exact

 2   opposite.

 3               MS. SCHIMMER:      Oh.

 4               JUSTICE KAGAN:       In other words, if there was

 5   one bright line, which says that stays are not

 6   appropriate in a record-based claim because there's

 7   really nothing that the client can contribute, then we'd

 8   have no need or cause to reach the second question of

 9   what happens, in a case where a stay might be

10   appropriate, how long that stay should be.

11               MS. SCHIMMER:      That's correct, Your Honor.

12   I'm sorry, I agree -- I agree with you that the Court

13   could rule on that ground.

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Alternatively, we could --

15   we could rule that indefinite stays are never

16   appropriate; in which case, it would be unnecessary to

17   decide whether any stay is appropriate where -- for a

18   record-based claim, right?

19               MS. SCHIMMER:      That is true, too.     That

20   is --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:         We can do it from either

22   end.

23               MS. SCHIMMER:      That is true, too --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Or we could decide both, I

25   suppose.

 1                  MS. SCHIMMER:      I suppose, yes.            I mean, we

 2   would -- we would -- we would urge the Court to, I

 3   think, do both, to say --

 4                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Am I -- am I

 5   understanding that your position, in response to the

 6   question from Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy, is

 7   that, for you, indefinite is any stay whatsoever?

 8                  It sounds like what you are proposing -- or

 9   in response to them, is that no stay for purposes of

10   determining competence, whether it's short or long, is

11   permissible.    Is that your argument?

12                  MS. SCHIMMER:      That is not our argument,

13   Justice Sotomayor.     Our -- our definition of an

14   indefinite stay is a stay that is imposed until the

15   prisoner is restored to competence.                That --

16                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Like -- like the stay in

17   Rees?

18                  MS. SCHIMMER:      Like -- like the stay in

19   Rees, or, really, like the stay the Sixth Circuit has

20   issued.

21                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          You would have to -- to

22   maintain your position, the Court would have to qualify

23   Rees, or at least the interpretation that says the stay

24   should be indefinite once the petitioner is found

25   incompetent because that's what has happened there.                  The


                                       8

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   court said, find out if he's competent.            The answer was,

 2   he is incompetent.     And then the court just let it sit

 3   until the man died.

 4               MS. SCHIMMER:         Well, Your Honor, we don't

 5   think that Rees really has any force or provides any

 6   guidance in this case.       That, of course, was a case

 7   where a prisoner was seeking to abandon his further

 8   appeals.

 9               There are multiple reasons why we -- why we

10   think that Rees does not endorse the power of Federal

11   courts to indefinitely stay habeas proceedings.

12               One is the fact that the Court's stay order

13   was completely unexplained and very terse.            It didn't

14   announce any rule of law.

15               Second, the historical record shows that the

16   Court's stay in Rees was, at most, a judicially

17   negotiated settlement, meaning far from a demonstration

18   of the Court's inherent power.            It seemed to be a very

19   carefully orchestrated exercise of consented-to power.

20               The third point is that --

21               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            I could take objection

22   to that characterization because the clerk of the court

23   told the court that neither party was happy with what

24   was happening, and the court still entered the order.

25               But let me go back to my question a moment.

 1   Amici say that most competency issues are resolved

 2   within months and that many individuals -- the vast

 3   majority, are restored to competency with proper

 4   medication within months.         Are you opposing those kinds

 5   of stays?

 6                 MS. SCHIMMER:       For -- not in -- not where

 7   it's appropriate, no, Your Honor.             And again, Your

 8   Honor, our definition of an indefinite stay is --

 9                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          But under your

10   definition, it's never appropriate, really.

11                 MS. SCHIMMER:       No.

12                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          You argue -- you argue

13   two things.   You say, under Pinholster, they -- courts

14   always have to rely on the record.

15                 MS. SCHIMMER:       Correct.         We would -- here's

16   how we would taxonomize the appropriateness of stays:

17   We would say indefinite stays are never permitted,

18   meaning a court can never premise a stay exclusively on

19   the restoration of the prisoner's competency, in saying

20   however long it takes --

21                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Even though a doctor

22   says, it can be done, we have to try?

23                 MS. SCHIMMER:       If -- if a doctor says, it

24   can be done, we have to try, and it's a situation where

25   it's appropriate --

 1                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Well, they can never


 2   say, it can be done.      They can say --

 3                  MS. SCHIMMER:      Right.


 4                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- we have to try.


 5                  MS. SCHIMMER:      There is a reasonable

 6   probability that it can be done.             We would say,

 7   Your Honor --

 8                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         That -- that's also --

 9   I'm not sure how they can do that until they try.

10                  MS. SCHIMMER:      Right.      So we would say, in

11   certain situations, yes, that would be perfectly

12   appropriate.

13                  The State of Ohio certainly agrees that

14   having a competent prisoner is a desirable thing in a

15   habeas case and that courts do have some discretion to

16   try to vindicate that goal.

17                  Our point, though, is simply that it cannot

18   come at all cost, meaning --

19                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         Rees -- Rees was not an

20   indefinite stay in -- in the absolute sense, was it?

21                  MS. SCHIMMER:      No.

22                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         Because the trial

23   proceeded.   There -- there was going to be an end,

24   right?

25                  MS. SCHIMMER:      Well, the court -- the court

 1   in the end held up the cert petition for several decades

 2   without deciding the case.          So -- and in the end,

 3   Mr. Rees died and then the cert petition was ultimately

 4   later dismissed.

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I don't understand

 6   how your approach works.        We, the defendant, the habeas

 7   petitioner, the allegation is made, I'm incompetent,

 8   there is support for it.        The district court says, okay,

 9   I can't enter an indefinite stay, but you are going to

10   be treated; I want you to come back in 6 months, okay?

11   And we will look at it then.

12                He comes back in 6 months, and there's been

13   no change.   What happens then?           Another 6 months?      At

14   what point does it become indefinite?

15                MS. SCHIMMER:        Right.      Well, since we are

16   playing on the field of equitable discretion,

17   Your Honor, it's going to be difficult to put forward a

18   hard and fast rule.

19                But Justice Sotomayor rightly points --

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, give me a

21   loose and soft rule.      I mean, is it --

22                (Laughter.)

23                MS. SCHIMMER:        Sure.      A loose and soft rule.

25   is it ten years?

 3   from Mr. Carter's own amici.              The brief of the American

 4   Psychiatric Association, pages 19 to 21, and especially

 5   footnote 30, talks about how most prisoners who are

 6   ultimately successfully restored to competency, that

 7   does happen in a matter of months, 6 to 9 months at the

 8   longest end.    About 90 percent of them are restored

 9   within 6 to 9 months.

10                  So we think, presumptively, a year would be

11   an appropriate period of time for --

12                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, Ms. Schimmer, why

13   would that be?    I mean, assume a case where you say a

14   stay would be appropriate.          So it's not a closed record

15   case.    It's a case where the client might be expected to

16   provide information that's -- let's -- let's assume it's

17   necessary to a full and fair adjudication of the habeas

18   claim.

19                  Why would you cut it off at a year?           Why

20   wouldn't it be still true in 2 years, that a full and

21   fair adjudication couldn't take place in those

22   circumstances.

23                  MS. SCHIMMER:      Well, we think, Your Honor,

24   at the point at which you say that the test for a

25   limited stay is however long it takes to restore

 1   somebody's competency is the point at which we have

 2   returned to the definition of saying that indefinite

 3   stays are proper.

 4                And the bottom line is that we think that --

 5                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, it's not an indefinite

 6   stay.   I think the judge would do what the Chief Justice

 7   suggested, that -- you know, it's not for ever and ever.

 8   We're just going to come back to it periodically.                 But

 9   if the answer is the same, which is that the client's

10   participation is necessary for a full and fair

11   adjudication, then the court's answer should be the

12   same, too.   Why isn't that right?

13                MS. SCHIMMER:      Because we do think that

14   there comes a point, given the finality concerns

15   underlying AEDPA, that a limited stay, when that window

16   expires -- the person has a reasonable period of time to

17   be restored to competency; that when that window

18   expires, at some point, the proceedings do have to

19   continue.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, it's really -- it's

21   really not the same question when it comes back, is it?

22   Because there are two questions:           Is -- is reasonable

23   competence useful for his defense?               But, also, the

24   second question, is there a reasonable probability that

25   he can be restored to competence?

 1                  The first time, there obviously is that, and

 2   you give him a year.      When you come back a second time,

 3   you say, well, it's been a year, they usually come back

 4   within 6 to 9 months, there is no longer a reasonable

 5   probability.

 6                  MS. SCHIMMER:      That's exactly right,

 7   Justice Scalia.    And to the extent that we are balancing

 8   different parties' interests in these cases, after the

 9   preliminary limited stay expires, we believe at that

10   point the prisoner's interest in a continued stay has

11   diminished, and the state's interest in the proceedings

12   continuing and moving forward has then increased, and

13   that the court should then move on.

14                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          And there'd be no stay at

15   all, unless it's necessary for just adjudication of the

16   claim, so that would be a threshold question.

17                  MS. SCHIMMER:      That would be the threshold

18   question, and there seems to be a good amount of

19   consensus on that point.        It's the test articulated by

20   the Sixth and Ninth Circuits and by my colleague here

21   today.   And we're -- we're willing to accept that as the

22   test for when limited stays can be imposed.

23                  And with that, if there aren't further

24   questions, I'll reserve the remainder of my time.

25                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

 2               ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT MICHELMAN

 3                 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 4               MR. MICHELMAN:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 5   it please the Court:

 6               Ohio and the United States have agreed today

 7   that courts have the authority to stay habeas

 8   proceedings when the petitioner is mentally incompetent.

 9   So then the questions for this Court are when may such

10   stays issue and how long may such stays be?

11               The Court's answers should reflect the

12   important principle that no individual should lose

13   potentially meritorious claims because of mental

14   illness.

15               I'd like to begin by addressing --

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Petitioner says they

17   won't because they can come back with new evidence after

18   habeas is closed.   Why is that inadequate?

19               MR. MICHELMAN:        I -- I think that's --

20   that's a crucial question, Justice Sotomayor, that

21   Justice Kennedy asked as well, and -- and it goes to the

22   limits on second or successive petitions.         They can't

23   come back if they are later competent, if they first

24   lose their claims, because they didn't have the evidence

25   they needed and then try again later.


                                    16

 1                  They are subject to the bar on second or

 2   successive petitions, which requires, not only that they

 3   have new facts, but also that they have new law.                   So

 4   that's a very restrictive standard that would not allow

 5   them to simply pick up where they left off.

 6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm sorry.   I -- I

 7   didn't follow that exactly.              What -- what prevents them

 8   from picking up where they left off?

 9                  MR. MICHELMAN:         Mr. Chief Justice,

10   Section 2244(b), the bar on second or successive

11   petitions.

12                  Imagine Mr. Carter has a potentially

13   meritorious claim now that he can't speak to because of

14   his incompetence, it's adjudicated without him, he loses

15   it.

16                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Oh, it's

17   adjudicated.    Okay.      Sorry.

18                  MR. MICHELMAN:         Imagine it's adjudicated

19   without him, he loses it.           And then he can't simply

20   waltz back into court and say, I'm here, I'm competent,

21   hear me out.

22                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           I'm presume -- I presume

23   that the one claim among your many -- yours is the

24   defendant who was excluded from trial, correct?

25                  MR. MICHELMAN:         Yes, Justice Sotomayor.

 1                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So that if he comes back

 2   and says, I told my attorneys I would behave, and I

 3   wanted to come back earlier, and they never let me back

 4   in, this would not be a new claim, this would be part of

 5   the old claim that has been adjudicated, correct?

 6                  MR. MICHELMAN:       Yes, Justice Sotomayor.

 7                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         But without his

 8   information?

 9                  MR. MICHELMAN:       Yes.     And, in fact, the --

10   the record lends some support to this suggestion by

11   showing that counsel frequently put their own safety and

12   their own concerns ahead of my client's interests, for

13   example, stating on the record -- and I'm quoting here

14   from trial counsel -- "I am still worried about him

15   behaving during this phase, so the bottom line is he

16   wants to stay where he is."            So there is a question of

17   whether trial counsel was -- was really looking out for

18   Mr. Carter's interests at that time.

19                  There's also the question of whether --

20                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Well, that, you could

21   see from the record.      The question in my mind would be

22   whether he told counsel he would behave, and counsel

23   ignored that information, correct?

24                  MR. MICHELMAN:       Yes, Justice Sotomayor.

25   There is strong support in the record to suggest that


                                      18

 1   Mr. Carter has additional information to provide, both

 2   about his desire to return to the courtroom and about

 3   his competence once he was removed from the courtroom.

 4   Was he hallucinating during the trial?               Could he see it?

 5   Could he communicate with counsel?

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Could -- could you help me

 7   with your discussion of 2244(b)?            I have it in front of

 8   me.   And the hypothetical was that he's incompetent, the

 9   claim is adjudicated, then he becomes competent, and he

10   says now is there some new evidence, which could not

11   have been discovered.

12                I thought you told us that you not only have

13   to have new evidence, but new law.                That's not the way I

14   read --

15               MR. MICHELMAN:       I'm -- I'm sorry.

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- (b)(2)(B)(1), unless I

17   misunderstood you.

18                MR. MICHELMAN:        You're -- no, you're right,

19   Justice Kennedy.    I misspoke.          He needs new law or new

20   facts, but the new facts have to come with a showing of

21   actual innocence.    I misstated that.             I apologize.

22                But, either way, new law is --

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            No, no, no.

24                MR. MICHELMAN:        -- new facts are not enough.

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            No, no.     This says, "or

 1   the factual predicate for the claim could not have been

 2   discovered previously through the exercise of due

 3   diligence," period.

 4                  MR. MICHELMAN:       And --

 5                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes?

 6                  MR. MICHELMAN:       And (b)(2) --

 7                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes?

 8                  MR. MICHELMAN:       -- "the facts underlying the

 9   claim, if proven, would show that, but for the

10   Constitutional error" --

11                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes, clear and convincing,

12   that's true.

13                  MR. MICHELMAN:       Right.         So he needs not only

14   the new facts, but needs to meet that higher standard,

15   showing that no reasonable factfinder would have found

16   him guilty.

17                  But one of his claims, his ineffective

18   assistance of counsel in mitigation, goes to not his

19   guilt, but his punishment.          So that claim would be

20   barred under 2254.     Additionally, his competence doesn't

21   go to his guilt either.

22                  JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, is it your position

23   that any time a petitioner raises an ineffective

24   assistance of counsel claim, the habeas proceeding can

25   potentially be stayed indefinitely?

 1                MR. MICHELMAN:         That's potentially correct,

 2   Justice Alito.   But I would emphasize the role of the

 3   district courts as gatekeepers for only potentially

 4   meritorious claims that are -- are truly suggested on

 5   the record that someone --

 7   finish your answer to Justice Alito.

 8                MR. MICHELMAN:         It's -- where it's truly

 9   suggested on the record that the petitioner could help,

10   if competent, so that we wouldn't be engaging in

11   imaginative speculation or claims that were purely

12   record based.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So what -- it's a

14   truly suggested by the record standard?

15                MR. MICHELMAN:         Well, I would say that --

16   that it would be suggested by the record.                I'm not sure

17   the adverb "truly" is necessary, but -- you know.

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well -- well, how is

19   it compared to a motion to dismiss standard?

21   Court's decision --

23   stringent?

 1   Honor.   Probably the plausibility standard would

 2   actually be somewhat analogous, although --

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, now we've gone

 4   from plausible to truly -- plausible -- well, truly

 5   suggested by the record.      I mean, suggested by the


 6   record might be plausible.


 7                It seems to me that it's a pretty loose


 8   standard that entitles the defendant to a stay.


 9                MR. MICHELMAN:       Well, that -- but that --

10   that's not the only criterion, Mr. Chief Justice.              It

11   would be not only that it was suggested by the record

12   that it was a potentially meritorious claim, as the --

13   as the district court found and the standard this Court

14   endorsed in Rhines, but also that the petitioner is

15   genuinely incompetent.     This doesn't happen very often.

16                In fact, in the state's amicus brief

17   discussing how, in -- in their characterization, this

18   type of litigation has exploded in the Ninth Circuit, in

19   their characterization, they pointed only to nine cases

20   in the past nine years, so -- and not all of those

21   resulted in --

22                JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, why isn't what you're

23   proposing just a mechanism that will permit stays in

24   virtually every capital case, if that's what the

25   petitioner wants -- if that's what petitioner's counsel


                                    22

 1   wants?

 2                Let's say you have a case where there is a

 3   small amount of mitigating evidence about the

 4   petitioner's childhood, but not enough to -- to sway

 5   the -- the sentencing authority.           It's alleged that if

 6   the petitioner had been -- if the petitioner was

 7   competent, the petitioner could provide a lot more

 8   information about what went on during his childhood

 9   years; and, therefore, the -- the proceeding has to be

10   stayed indefinitely until the petitioner is restored to

11   confidence or he dies, as happened in Rees.

12                What do you do with that situation?

13                MR. MICHELMAN:       Justice Alito, I think

14   district courts have a wide amount of discretion in that

15   matter, and they could say, well, it looks like there is

16   a little evidence here, but based on what I think you

17   could tell me, I don't think there is enough.

18                Here, by contrast, the district court did

19   find that Mr. -- Mr. Carter's competent assistance was

20   necessary.   So I think we have to trust the district

21   courts to be gatekeepers --

22                JUSTICE ALITO:       So if the -- if the district

23   court says, well, there's a little bit here, and I can't

24   rule out the possibility that there might be a lot more

25   that's locked in the petitioner's mind, but he is unable

 1   to provide it because he is incompetent, then I'm going

 2   to grant a stay until he is restored to competence; and

 3   then that would be insulated from being overturned on

 4   appeal by abuse of discretion standard.           That's what

 5   you're arguing?

 6                MR. MICHELMAN:        That's -- that's correct,

 7   Justice Alito.    That would be something --

 8                JUSTICE ALITO:        Do you think that is

 9   consistent with AEDPA?      That Congress, knowing, in

10   particular, that a lot of district judges and a lot of

11   court of appeals judges don't like the death penalty and

12   will go to some length to prevent the imposition of that

13   sentence, that we're just going to leave that all to the

14   discretion of every individual district judge?

15                MR. MICHELMAN:        I think it is consistent

16   with AEDPA, Your Honor, because of this Court's recent

17   jurisprudence in Martinez, in Holland, in Rhines, which

18   make clear that AEDPA did not pursue finality at all

19   cost.   It did not eliminate the discretion, the

21   traditionally enjoyed, as this Court stated in Holland.

22                And as this Court stated in Martinez, the

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Mr. Michelman, we -- we

 2   have established a different standard for the degree of

 3   competence that has to exist in order to prevent

 4   execution, right?   The -- the prisoner has to be aware

 5   of what is being done and why it's being done.

 6                MR. MICHELMAN:       Yes, Justice Scalia.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:         And that's a much lower

 8   standard than the standard of competence required for

 9   deciding whether he can assist counsel, right?

10                MR. MICHELMAN:       It's a different standard,

11   Justice Scalia.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, it's -- no, it's a

13   much -- it's a much easier standard for the state to

14   establish.

15                MR. MICHELMAN:       Well, it could be easier in

16   some cases, but harder than others.              Mental -- mental

17   health science is complex, so one might be competent

18   to because --

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, wait.      All he has to

20   know to prevent -- to prevent execution is he has to

21   know that he's being executed for a crime, right?

22   And --

23                MR. MICHELMAN:       And he has to understand

24   why.

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:         -- in order to assist

 1   counsel, doesn't he have to know a lot more than that?

 2                MR. MICHELMAN:       That's -- that's true,

 3   Justice Scalia.   The test --

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, just make believe

 5   that I'm right about that, okay?

 6                (Laughter.)

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:         That there are two

 8   standards, and one is really quite more difficult than

 9   the other.   Why isn't the difference between the

10   standards utterly eliminated?           Because whenever there is

11   a capital case, a habeas petition is filed, and counsel

12   says, my -- my client cannot -- cannot -- cannot assist

13   me.   Oh, yes, he understands why he's being executed,

14   but he may have a new claim, he may be able to tell me

15   stuff, so we have to stay the execution indefinitely

16   until he can assist -- assist me in -- in continuing his

17   defense.

18                You've just converted the standard for

19   proceeding with the execution from an easier one to a

20   much more difficult one.

21                MR. MICHELMAN:       I -- I don't think that's

22   true, Justice Scalia, because the -- the two standards

23   are different and for different purposes.          So there

24   could be individuals who meet one and not the other.

25   It's not -- it's not an either/or choice.

 1                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But then -- but then you

 2   are fighting the -- the arguendo assumption.

 3                  Let's assume that the Ford standard -- the

 4   standard for competence should be executed, is more

 5   lenient, less -- less forgiving than competence to

 6   assist counsel.    Let's assume that.              Then Justice Scalia

 7   has to be right.    You've -- you've simply eliminated the

 8   Ford standard altogether.

 9                  MR. MICHELMAN:       Not necessarily, Your Honor,

10   because even if one is easier --

11                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           At least only -- only in

12   cases where the competence -- the claim of incompetence

13   is genuine.    I mean, if anyone says, oh, I want to

14   make -- take advantage of the more defendant-friendly

15   standard, all I have to do is allege I'm incompetent.

16                  But that's not the case.             He has to be --

17   there has to be a hearing that determines he is, indeed,

18   incompetent.    So - and -- and most defendants I don't

19   think would be able to establish that they are, indeed,

20   incompetent.

21                  MR. MICHELMAN:       That's right,

22   Justice Ginsburg.    We -- our standard builds in the

23   assumption that there will be mental health experts that

24   will testify to the condition of the petitioner.

25                  So the petitioner can't simply select a


                                      27

 1   standard and declare that he meets it.          He would have to

 2   satisfy mental health professionals that he meets that

 3   standard, whether it's competency to be executed or

 4   competency for these purposes.          And so that will --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Mental health experts

 6   always agree, don't they?      Those provided by the defense

 7   always agree with those provided by the prosecution.

 8   Yes.

 9               (Laughter.)

10               MR. MICHELMAN:       I understand sometimes

11   that's not true, Justice Scalia, but that's -- that's

12   why we rely on the district courts to do what they do

13   every day in the trial competency context and adjudicate

14   conflicting claims about a petitioner's mental

15   competence --

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Am I -- am I -- is it

17   correct that the petitioners in both cases -- pardon me,

18   that the criminal defendants in both cases here, the

19   Respondents, have all but conceded that there is no

20   Constitutional basis for the right to competency during

21   habeas, or am I overstating that?

22               MR. MICHELMAN:       I don't think you are,

23   Justice Kennedy, though I won't speak for Mr. Gonzales.

24               Mr. Carter does not press a Constitutional

25   argument here, only the argument that a district court's


                                   28

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   discretion, which the State of Ohio recognizes, to stay

 2   habeas proceedings should cover --

 3                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But once you concede the

 4   Constitutional point, so that there's no fundamental

 5   unfairness, then it seems to me that -- that you have

 6   all but given away your case.

 7                  MR. MICHELMAN:       Well, I don't think there

 8   needs to be Constitutional unfairness for there to be

 9   unfairness.    For instance, this Court's opinion in

10   Martinez --

11                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, it's fairness that's

12   not fundamental -- or --

13                  MR. MICHELMAN:       Well --

14                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It's unfairness that's not

15   fundamental.

16                  MR. MICHELMAN:       I think Martinez v. Ryan is

17   an excellent illustration of that point,

18   Justice Kennedy, because, there, the Court held -- not

19   that there was a Sixth Amendment right to effective

20   assistance of counsel at the habeas stage, but that

21   ineffective assistance on initial review collateral

22   proceedings could provide cause and prejudice to

23   overcome a procedural default, in order that the

24   petitioner would not lose his claim, and that -- to

25   prevent a situation where no court would hear the claim

 1   before he was executed.

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, but in that

 3   case, the -- the whole basis of the analysis was that,

 4   although it was collateral, it really was the first

 5   opportunity to raise a particular claim.

 6               You say that, earlier, that trial judges do

 7   this all the time in the trial context.               It's an

 8   important distinction in our jurisprudence if there's a

 9   difference in terms of the rights to which you are

10   entitled preconviction and post-conviction.

11               MR. MICHELMAN:         That's -- that's correct,

12   Mr. Chief Justice.    But if the facts haven't been

13   presented -- and here what the district court found was

14   there were facts missing, facts that were exclusively

15   within Mr. Carter's knowledge.

16               They weren't presented to the state court,

17   they haven't been available to either the state court or

18   the Federal court, so it's possible this man could be

19   executed and no one could have fully heard these

20   potentially meritorious claims.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What is your -- what

22   is your limit?   You think there is no limit on the

23   inherent authority, that these things can go on and on?

24   Or as -- I mean, your -- your friend on the other side

25   suggested, 1 year as a presumption?               Do you have any

 1   limit?

 2                 MR. MICHELMAN:       Well, we -- we would leave

 3   it, in the first place, to the district court's

 4   discretion.   We -- as far as the question of indefinite

 5   stays go, we agree with the State of Ohio that most

 6   competency issues are resolved within a matter of

 7   months.   So we can expect --

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But not this one because

 9   the claim is he was never competent; isn't that so?           He

10   wasn't competent to stand trial, and he never --

11                 MR. MICHELMAN:       That's --

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          And his mental condition

13   never improved.   So this person, if -- if the -- the

14   standard is he's got to be competent, the likelihood is

15   he will never be competent because he wasn't even,

16   according to him, competent at the time he was tried.

17                 MR. MICHELMAN:       Yes, Justice Ginsburg.    And

18   this -- this would be a rare case in which a stay might

19   need to be more than 6 months, 9 months, a year.           But

20   because most -- most situations, the competency issue

21   will resolve in a short period of time, this Court

22   shouldn't fear that it's opening the floodgates to long

23   stays in many, many cases.

24                 There -- this is a rare case with a very

25   severely ill man, with potentially meritorious claims

 1   that require his assistance.              That's not something

 2   that --

 3                  JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, why can't the

 4   competency -- why can't the issue of competency at trial

 5   be resolved?

 6                  MR. MICHELMAN:       Well, because the issue --

 7                  JUSTICE ALITO:       You have to be competent

 8   during the habeas proceeding in order to assist in

 9   proving that he was -- that he was incompetent at the

10   time of trial?

11                  MR. MICHELMAN:       Yes, Justice Alito.         And

12   that's because the competency question at this point is

13   retrospective.    We're not talking -- it's not a matter

14   of simply examining Mr. Carter today and saying, How do

15   you feel?   What do you experience?                Are you hearing the

16   voice of the devil?

17                  But it's a question of was he doing that

18   during his trial 14 years ago?              And that's why it's

19   important that he be able to participate now.

20                  What the Sixth Circuit ordered in this case

21   was a remand for a narrow stay with appropriate

22   monitoring by the district court, to make sure that this

23   didn't become -- just sit around on the docket for years

24   with nobody looking at it.

25                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Did you say that the

 1   question is whether or not -- not whether he is


 2   competent today to assist his counsel, but whether he


 3   was 14 years ago?


 4                 MR. MICHELMAN:        Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.


 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               How in the world --

 6   I mean --

 7                 MR. MICHELMAN:        With respect to the

 8   underlying claim.    That's the question.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Right.   How is a --

10   do mental health professionals make those determinations

11   on a regular basis?

12                 MR. MICHELMAN:        I understand that they do,

13   Your Honor.   I understand it is possible for a person

14   with a psychosis to recover and have memories of

15   experiences during that psychosis.                 Now, I admit that's

16   not a fact in -- in the record, but that's something

17   that, if we're dispositive, could be established on

18   remand in this case.

19                 So it's because of the -- the rarity of

20   these claims, because they are not going to come up

21   every day, and because district courts exist as strong

22   checkpoints to prevent non-genuine claims of competence

23   or not potentially meritorious claims for which the

24   petitioner's assistance is necessary, a narrow stay

25   authority should be preserved and should be applied to

 3   everything, according to the Sixth Circuit.               The Sixth

 4   Circuit said that -- that there are issues or may be

 5   issues that can go forward right away.               And as to that,

 6   is there any issue that could be argued, despite the

 7   incompetence?

 8               MR. MICHELMAN:         Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And what -- what are

10   those?

11               MR. MICHELMAN:         Well, in this case -- and I

12   think it really illustrates the narrowness of -- of the

13   Sixth Circuit's order.      In this case, he had, for

14   example, claims about the jury instructions.               He had

15   claims about prosecutorial misconduct.               He has a claim

16   about the method of execution that the State of Ohio

17   uses.

18               These claims may go forward because they

19   don't require his assistance.            And it's -- it's a

20   measure of the Sixth Circuit's moderation and discretion

21   that they held that only the claims that genuinely

22   require his assistance should be stayed; the others may

23   go forward with the help of the next friend.

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That's a pretty

25   inefficient system, isn't it?            That the judge has to

 2   9, when he knows that he's not going to be able to

 3   dispose of the petition until -- until the petitioner is

 4   competent, maybe a year later, then he has to go through

 5   the whole thing again?

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I don't see a

 8   district court saying, well, I'm not going to get into

 9   this until I can dispose of the whole thing.

10                 MR. MICHELMAN:       Well, I -- I suppose there

11   would be some appeal to the notion that the district

12   court might stay the rest of it, simply waiting, Your

 3   finality of the proceedings.           I --

 5   the value is to wait for the Ford analysis or the Ford

 7               MS. SCHIMMER:      We think there are a few

 8   values, Justice Sotomayor.       First of all is that the

10   don't concede that Mr. Carter is Ford incompetent.

13               MS. SCHIMMER:      Putting that aside, though,

14   the State's interest is that it still has a powerful

15   interest in the finality of its conviction and sentence.

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           "At all costs" is what

17   you seem to be saying.

18               MS. SCHIMMER:      No.       But even if the

19   implementation of that sentence is ultimately

20   forestalled by a Ford ruling, that's true in a dignitary

21   sense, but it's also true in a practical sense, meaning

22   the State should not -- if somebody regains competence

23   many years down the line, the whole point of AEDPA is

24   that the State at that time should not have to be

25   litigating a stale case.

 1               And to wait potentially 5 and 10 and

 2   15 years until someone's competency is restored on this

 3   total speculation that something might happen runs --

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Well, your adversary has

 5   not said it's total speculation.          He suggests that, if

 6   we set a standard that requires -- we can talk about

 7   what the terms are, suggestive in the record, plausible

 8   in the record, typical sort of situation -- but assuming

 9   that there is some basis to believe that the defendant

10   can provide information of importance to the claim, why

11   should that be -- that door be shut?

12               MS. SCHIMMER:      Well, again, Your Honor --

13               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         And how do you deal with

14   his answer that, if the claim is not a new claim, but

15   just new information about an old claim, that he will be

16   barred from a successive petition?

17               MS. SCHIMMER:      Right.      Well, we still don't

18   see how that has any traction in a case like this where,

19   whether competent or not competent, 2254(d) and

20   Pinholster say this claim -- all of these claims were

21   adjudicated on the merits in state court and, therefore,

22   no new evidence can be considered by the Federal court.

23   So that, we think, resolves that.

24               And in terms of how do you deal with limited

25   stays and then going on, we would say simply that the

 1   State of Ohio's experience in this case has been that

 2   the State of Ohio has been standing ready for 10 years

 3   to defend the judgment of its state courts in this case,

 4   even though all of Mr. Carter's claims are record based.

 5               There is no right to competence.             Everybody

 6   seems to now agree on that.         Indefinite stays contravene

 7   AEDPA, and we don't think that any stay is justified

 8   here because of the record-based claims.

 9               Thank you.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

12   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
