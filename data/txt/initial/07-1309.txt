 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 We will hear

 4   argument in Case 07-1309, Boyle v. United States.

 5              Mr. Fernich.

 6                ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARC FERNICH

 7                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8              MR. FERNICH:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 9   and may it please the Court:

10              This is a case about a defendant's right to

11   an independent jury determination of each essential

12   element of a RICO offense, specifically a pattern of

13   racketeering and a separate enterprise that is more than

14   just a duplication of the pattern.

15              To keep the elements apart, ensure their

16   distinct consideration, and give the enterprise

17   independent meaning, juries must be instructed, as in

18   the Seventh Circuit and elsewhere, that an "enterprise"

19   requires a structure separate from the commission of the

20   predicate acts forming the pattern.

21              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Fernich --

22              MR. FERNICH:         Yes, Your Honor.

23              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- are we talking just

24   about the instruction to the jury?                I know you think

25   that the instruction given here was incorrect.                But is


                                       3

 1   it just a question of charge error or are you saying

 2   that there was insufficient evidence of enterprise for

 3   this case to go to the jury?

 4              MR. FERNICH:         I am not suggesting, Your

 5   Honor, that there was insufficient evidence of -- of

 6   enterprise to go to the jury.            My primary point is with

 7   respect to the charge.      We do contend --

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You're saying if a proper

 9   charge had been given, this jury on this evidence still

10   could have convicted the defendant?

11              MR. FERNICH:         We contend, to be sure, that

12   the evidence was legally insufficient under Rule 29.

13   But we are pressing principally the first -- the jury-

14   argument claim here in this Court.                We do contend that

15   the evidence was legally insufficient.

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Did you make that -- did

17   you make that objection in the trial court?

18              MR. FERNICH:         Yes, we did, and we preserved

19   it in the court of appeals as well.                    And there was, as

20   Your Honor knows, no published opinion with respect to

21   either issue, so both issues are preserved.

22              Now, Your Honor, under the Second Circuit

23   rule that functionally conflates the two elements, that

24   is enterprise and pattern, the jury in this case was not

25   so instructed as to the need for an enterprise with an


                                       4

 1   existence separate and apart from the racketeering acts

 2   forming the pattern.        For that reason we contend that

 3   the judgment below must be vacated.

 4              JUSTICE ALITO:             The -- the error was the

 5   failure to give the instruction that appears on page 95

 6   of the joint appendix?         Is that the error that you are

 7   complaining about?

 8              MR. FERNICH:            Not merely so, Justice Alito.

 9   That is why the entire relevant excerpts from the jury

10   charge are included in the joint appendix.                We objected

11   to the entirety of the charge, in addition to requesting

12   specific language of our own.               To be sure, the principal

13   error of which we complain in this Court is the failure

14   of that instruction anywhere to require, as this Court

15   required in the United States v Turkette, and as 18

16   U.S.C. 1962(c) itself requires, an entity with a

17   structure separate and apart from the pattern of

18   racketeering.

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:                What -- what do you mean by

20   that precisely?   Suppose you have a group of people, the

21   ringleader goes and gets a safecracker, he gets a

22   wheelman, and so forth, all the people he needs for the

23   crime; and he says we are going to call this the -- the

24   Brinks Job Group, okay?          We are the Brinks Job Group.

25   But that's the only thing that he has put the group


                                          5

 1   together in order to do.           But it's still a group.          He

 2   calls it a group and he gets all these guys together and

 3   they -- they meet and have lunch together, and do a lot

 4   of stuff together.

 5                Would that meet your -- your condition of a

 6   separate association from the predicate acts?

 7                MR. FERNICH:          To be sure, we would contend

 8   that it would be a question in the first instance for a

 9   properly instructed jury, but without more on the

10   hypothetical that Your Honor has posited, the answer to

11   that question is no.        There is no ongoing decisional

12   apparatus, no continuing directional mechanism.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:              Except insofar as it is

14   directed to the Brinks job.

15                MR. FERNICH:          Except the degree of

16   organization, I should say, inherent in each individual

17   predicate act.

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But you -- you imported --

19   I'm looking at your quotation from Turkette, at page 5

20   of your brief.    It doesn't seem to me conclusive of your

21   point.    In order to answer Justice Scalia, you had to

22   interpolate, to add various words.                   You had to say --

23   you said an ongoing organization with directions or

24   something to that effect.            That is not what Turkette

25   says.    Turkette says "as proven by evidence of an


                                          6

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   ongoing organization, formal or informal, that is

 2   continuing."   That's all it says.

 3               MR. FERNICH:           To be sure, Your Honor, we

 4   don't contend that Turkette is directly controlling of

 5   the issue and we go through a lengthy textual exegesis

 6   in our brief of why we think that implicit in the

 7   factors of ongoing organization and continuing unit is a

 8   structure requirement.         But what Turkette did

 9   unequivocally say is that there must be an entity

10   existing separate and apart from the pattern of

11   racketeering activity.         There was no such instruction

12   given in this case -- and the word "entity," which

13   appears in section 1961(4) itself and appears twice in

14   the Turkette decision, surely connotes an ascertainable

15   structure with an existence separate and apart from the

16   pattern of racketeering.

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               What does "structure"

18   mean?   I think you said it doesn't mean that this has to

19   be an organization with a president, a treasurer; it

20   doesn't mean that.

21               MR. FERNICH:           It could mean that in an

22   appropriate case, Your Honor.               It surely would be

23   probative --

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               What is -- what is the

25   minimum to qualify as having a structure?


                                          7

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                MR. FERNICH:        The minimum is a separate,

 2   ongoing, continuing existence apart from the commission

 3   of the predicate acts themselves, and the members

 4   necessary to commit those predicate acts, because that

 5   by definition, I should say, is the pattern of

 6   racketeering activity; and moreover, it is also inherent

 7   in any criminal conspiracy that extends over time.

 8                To be more specific, the bare minimum

 9   requisites for a structure would be:                    an ongoing

10   directional mechanism; a continuing decisional-making

11   unit -- decisionmaking unit, I should say -- and some

12   sort of coherent existence between the commission of the

13   racketeering acts themselves.             Those are the main

14   ingredients.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So all you have to

16   do, to pick up on Justice Scalia's hypothetical, is just

17   not the Brinks job, but you have to have one more crime,

18   and that's it; then everything you've talked about is

19   satisfied?

20                MR. FERNICH:        No, that is, respectfully, not

21   what we contend, although in an appropriate case it is

22   conceivable that a properly instructed jury may find

23   structure on those facts.          The point that we are

24   conveying here is that this is principally a jury

25   question, and a jury that is properly instructed will


                                        8

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   make findings, presumably, as to what the -- whether the

 2   structure was extant, and those findings would command

 3   substantial deference on appeal, as they do in the

 4   circuits that have applied a structure requirement; and

 5   it would be a relatively easy task for an appellate

 6   court to defer to the jury's findings in such a case.

 7   There is a --

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               The jury -- the words

 9   that you asked for, what was it?                "Ascertainable

10   structural hierarchy."        And suppose the judge gets

11   questions from the jury:          "Your Honor, what do you mean

12   by ascertainable structural hierarchy?"

13              MR. FERNICH:           I'm -- I'm sorry,

14   Justice Ginsburg.

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Those are the words that

16   you wanted the judge to include in the charge --

17              MR. FERNICH:           To be sure.

18              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               -- and it's your

19   requested charge, as to say to have an enterprise you

20   need to have -- the group has to have an ascertainable

21   structural hierarchy.       Those are the three words in your

22   requested charge.

23              MR. FERNICH:           Well, respectfully, Your

24   Honor, it goes beyond that, because the end of --

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But those -- but you did

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   ask for those.

 2              MR. FERNICH:          I did, and --

 3              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And now I'm asking you,

 4   what does that mean?      The judge gives your charge, the

 5   jury is puzzled:   Your Honor, we don't understand what

 6   you mean by "ascertainable structural hierarchy"; would

 7   you please tell us specifically?

 8              MR. FERNICH:          Yes, Your Honor.              First of

 9   all, the charge that we are asking for specifically is a

10   charge that is given in the Seventh and Eighth Circuits

11   which says a structure separate from the commission of

12   the predicate acts themselves.              If a jury were puzzled,

13   in that instance the judge could, as spelled out in

14   pages 31 through 35 of our reply brief, give examples,

15   any number of examples that have been spelled out by the

16   lower courts in -- that have adopted a structure

17   requirement.

18              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And some of those

19   examples it seems are present here.                     One you gave was

20   longevity, well, this has been going on for 10 years;

21   another was a unique way of operating, and they are

22   specialists in deposit boxes and they have look-out

23   people and they have people who actually break into the

24   bank, and they have a certain amount of skill.

25              So we have longevity, modus operandi, and a


                                       10
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   division of labor.      They have some people being their

 2   lookouts and other people doing other things.                       So I was

 3   looking at your list in the reply brief, and it seems to

 4   me that this organization, this association of

 5   individuals, has some of those characteristics.

 6                 MR. FERNICH:         Your Honor, first of all, to

 7   get right down to the nitty-gritty of the verdict in the

 8   case, it's important to focus on what the jury actually

 9   found.   The enterprise as charged was a 10-year

10   enterprise.    There were three predicate acts found by

11   the jury ranging in date from late December of 1998

12   through early January of 1999.                So the longevity aspect

13   is certainly something that we dispute here.

14                 Again, to answer Your Honor, to go back to

15   the beginning of our argument, to be sure the thrust of

16   our argument in this Court is directed to the jury

17   instruction in this case.            It may be conceivable, we

18   don't for a minute concede that the evidence was legally

19   sufficient under rule 29.            That said, had a jury been

20   properly instructed and made such a finding, i.e., to

21   find a separately structured enterprise, that would be a

22   finding that would command significant deference, and

23   I'd be hard-pressed --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why -- why do you need a

25   hierarchy?    Why do you need a boss?                     Why can't it be a

 1   democratic mob?    I mean, there is no boss and they agree

 2   that all of their decisions will be taken unanimously?

 3                 MR. FERNICH:        We don't contend before this

 4   Court that it must be hierarchical per se.                     Certainly --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, that's what you

 6   requested.    Isn't -- isn't that the instruction you

 7   requested?

 8                 MR. FERNICH:        On the facts of this case,

 9   consistent with the examples that are spelled out

10   comprehensively in both the opening brief and the reply

11   brief, that is the one that we focused on.                     But to be

12   sure -- to be sure, I also objected to the charge as

13   given in its entirety.        In this Court we don't press the

14   contention that a hierarchical structure -- hierarchical

15   structure is an irreducible minimum.                     We do --

16                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, you couldn't, could

17   you, because the -- an organization can consist of an

18   individual.    And it seems to me that all of the

19   requirements that you have been specifying would in an

20   individual case be met simply by showing that there was

21   -- there was an individual in business who had a brain.

22                 MR. FERNICH:        An individual, Your Honor, is

23   -- is a legal entity under the first clause of 1961(4).

24   It means a sole proprietorship in this context.                     And an

25   individual, a legal entity, as set forth in the first

 1   clause of 1961(4), by definition --

 2                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, but, if I set up a

 3   newsstand, it's a sole proprietorship and that's all I

 4   have to do.    And if I have a functioning brain, I have a

 5   decisionmaking mechanism.           I remember from day-to-day

 6   what I did, so I have continuity.                 And -- and it seems

 7   to me that all of these requirements are -- are

 8   virtually satisfied as a matter of course by an

 9   individual who engages in any kind of business that

10   might have interstate-commerce implications.

11                 MR. FERNICH:        And that is not an absurd

12   result.   It is a -- and it is a result that squares with

13   the primary purpose of the statute as enacted, which was

14   to prevent the subversion and infiltration of legitimate

15   business by criminal elements.

16                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Oh, absolutely.     But it

17   seems to me that it -- it puts you in sort of a -- a

18   difficult position to -- to be calling for or -- or

19   requiring jury instructions that call for, as necessary

20   conditions, findings of structure, continuity, decision-

21   making, capacity and so on, when in fact on -- on at

22   least one variety of enterprise, these conditions are --

23   are met virtually automatically simply by having

24   somebody doing business in any way.

25                 MR. FERNICH:        To be sure, Your Honor, we are

 1   only calling -- and the problem only arises in the

 2   context of an association-in-fact enterprise.               The great

 3   weight of authority and the plain language of 1961(4)

 4   does not define an individual as an association-in-fact

 5   enterprise.    And it does not square with the plain

 6   language of the statute to call an individual an

 7   association-in-fact enterprise.               And, moreover, doing so

 8   would create a whole set of other problems,

 9   distinctly --

10                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Oh, I agree, but an

11   individual can be an -- an enterprise.

12                 MR. FERNICH:        A legal enterprise.

13                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           And -- and an association,

14   in fact, can be an enterprise.               And if we accept those

15   two propositions, then I think you've got a tough row to

16   hoe in saying that any enterprise which is not an

17   individual has got to have all the formal

18   characteristics that you talk about, given the fact that

19   those characteristics are automatically satisfied by an

20   individual.

21                 MR. FERNICH:        We don't -- we don't press

22   that contention, Your Honor.             We specifically press it

23   for the phrase "any union or group of individuals

24   associated in fact, although not a legal entity."               The

25   "individual" portion appears in the first clause of the

 1   statute.   The distinctness problem simply does not arise

 2   in the context of a legal-entity enterprise.

 3                 And it's important to note, as this Court

 4   said in Salinas -- recognized in Salinas ---virtually

 5   every criminal prosecution that is brought under 1962(c)

 6   is brought against an illicit association-in-fact

 7   enterprise.    The -- the scenario of an individual being

 8   an association-in-fact enterprise, I don't think it's a

 9   valid association-in-fact enterprise as a matter of law.

10   There is a line of cases from the Seventh Circuit that

11   says it's not.

12                 And this structural problem, having a

13   structure that is distinct from the pattern of

14   racketeering activities so that the two elements, I

15   should say, are kept separate and apart, only arises in

16   the context of an association-in-fact enterprise, which

17   is, of course, a very, very wide swath.

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Would it include, let's

19   say, a street gang?      How about -- this may be before

20   your time, but "The Lavender Hill Mob"?

21                 MR. FERNICH:        I'm sorry, Your Honor?

22                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The Alec Guiness movie,

23   "The Lavender Hill Mob."

24                 MR. FERNICH:        Oh, well, certainly we don't

25   have any quarrel with the proposition of street gangs,

 1   and many of them are cited in our briefs.               The great

 2   preponderance of typical RICO prosecutions are

 3   hierarchical, drug-type street gangs which have

 4   regimented structures.      And again, to answer

 5   Justice Scalia's question, we don't contend that that is

 6   a strict necessity, but certainly they are not going to

 7   have a problem establishing a structured enterprise with

 8   a regimented drug gang.

 9              JUSTICE ALITO:          If hierarchy is not

10   required, then I'm not clear what more -- what you think

11   needs to be shown beyond the fact that there was an

12   association in fact and whatever continuity needs to be

13   shown in order to establish the pattern.               What -- what

14   needs to be shown beyond that?

15              MR. FERNICH:         Well, Your Honor --

16              JUSTICE ALITO:          What needs to be charged to

17   the jury that they must find beyond that?

18              MR. FERNICH:         We contend that they must be

19   charged that there has to be a structure separate from

20   the commission of the predicate acts themselves.               The

21   Seventh and Eighth Circuits use pattern jury

22   instructions that give that precise charge.               And there

23   has been, to my knowledge, no reported difficulties --

24              JUSTICE ALITO:          But What does that mean?

25              MR. FERNICH:         It means -- and -- and I would

 1   take the test most prominently from Your Honor's own

 2   home circuit as spelled out in the Riccobene case:                      A --

 3   an ongoing decisional-making apparatus to guide the

 4   affairs of the enterprise, a directional mechanism.

 5               The Third Circuit in Riccobene said an

 6   overseeing, clearinghouse and coordination function, and

 7   -- and a cohesive existence between predicate acts.

 8               JUSTICE ALITO:            I -- I just --

 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Basically, you described

10   this -- this gang.      One -- one person is a guard.                  The

11   other person brings the hook to pull the -- the box off.

12   Another person scouts it out.               Another person's got the

13   scanner.   It seems to me to fit precisely what you have

14   just described.

15               MR. FERNICH:           The gang has no structure

16   aside from that which is a necessary incident to the

17   commission of each racketeering act.                      We don't contend

18   there has to be a formal organization, but there is no

19   evidence of any continuing, ongoing organization other

20   than that when they get together to commit the predicate

21   crimes.

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Isn't it pretty clear that

23   if the -- the person who is supposed to be the lookout

24   doesn't perform his job, he is not going to be included

25   in that next heist?

 1               MR. FERNICH:         There is no evidence of that

 2   in the record to my knowledge, Your Honor.

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Isn't there a record that

 4   this is a more or less steady group that hangs out

 5   together, except when one of them gets caught and put in

 6   jail, and then they replace him with someone?                    But this

 7   is -- this was explained as a group that meets regularly

 8   in the Brooklyn Social Club?

 9               MR. FERNICH:         Your Honor, the testimony

10   about the Brooklyn Social Club is -- is a little bit

11   overdrawn, I would say.        And I would direct the Court to

12   pages 58 and 74 through 75 of the joint appendix, and

13   this is the testimony of the witness Gerard Bellafiore,

14   whose testimony, by the way, is the only testimony we

15   know for a fact that the jury credited.                 Quote:    "Just a

16   club to hang out in, not for any type of anything."

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But one of the members

18   owned the club, right?

19               MR. FERNICH:         Yes.       That -- that's true.

20   But that -- there is no evidence in the record that they

21   would do anything other than, for example -- and this is

22   not in the record -- for example, shoot pool at the

23   club.   And -- and Bellafiore himself was careful to

24   qualify it in that way so that he wasn't gilding the

25   lily.

 1                JUSTICE ALITO:          Suppose you have a gang that

 2   gets together every Friday afternoon and by democratic

 3   means they decide what crime they are going to commit

 4   that weekend.    And they are multi-talented so they --

 5   they look at the whole list of RICO predicates, and they

 6   choose a different one each -- you know, each weekend to

 7   commit.    And they do that over some period of time, and

 8   in doing that they perform different roles at different

 9   times.    Is -- is that an enterprise?

10                MR. FERNICH:         It sounds to me like a jury

11   could -- if they are having regular Friday meetings and

12   they are using sophisticated means to canvas the RICO

13   statute with a degree of complexity and sophistication

14   to figure out what they are going to do or maybe even

15   try to evade the statute, it probably --

16                JUSTICE ALITO:          We will take that part out

17   of it.    They don't look at the statute.                They just --

18   whatever crime comes to somebody's mind.                 They -- they

19   want to commit a crime every weekend to -- to make some

20   money.    But it is a different thing, done by different

21   means, different roles.

22                MR. FERNICH:         If the jury --

23                JUSTICE ALITO:          Does that have an

24   ascertainable structure?

25                MR. FERNICH:         If the jury were properly

 1   instructed that there had to be a structure separate and

 2   apart from just that which is inherent in the commission

 3   of each act, a properly instructed jury probably could

 4   well find the requirements satisfied on -- on the

 5   hypothetical that Your Honor has posited.

 6                The cases say -- the cases out of the

 7   Seventh Circuit say it is not a high hurdle.              They say

 8   it's a low hurdle, and there has to be some structure,

 9   but not much -- not much to distinguish between --

10                JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, what structure would

11   there be there?    What characteristics of that group

12   would satisfy the structural requirement?

13                MR. FERNICH:         The ongoing existence, the

14   regular meetings, and the degree of sophistication

15   employed.    And it implies that they are not just sort of

16   getting together on an impromptu basis as opportunities

17   arise, but they are sitting around on a regular basis

18   for a -- a continuing period of time and planning things

19   out.    What are we going to do this weekend?            What are we

20   going to do next weekend?

21                Let's twist the hypothetical a little bit.

22   Maybe they project our three or four weeks ahead of

23   time.    That's what RICO is -- is getting after, some

24   kind of sophistication, some kind of coordination.              This

25   is the crux of the statute.

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How about during the

 2   period that this man -- what was his name, Mangia --

 3                MR. FERNICH:         Mangiavillano, Your Honor.

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Yes.          When he was running

 5   the show, it seems that he was a leader, and that the --

 6   and that the group wasn't quite as democratic before he

 7   got sent to prison.

 8                MR. FERNICH:         Your Honor, the testimony in

 9   the record is that -- again, what was found by the jury

10   here.    The testimony is that Mangiavillano and Boyle and

11   Bellafiore never committed any crimes together.                     It is

12   -- it is very extensively briefed in -- in the lower

13   court.   The Second Circuit never addressed it.                    There is

14   a long multiple-conspiracies argument.                     We are not going

15   to get into that in this Court.

16                The fact is that Mangiavillano had nothing

17   to do, nothing to do with the bank burglaries found in

18   this case.    There were three burglaries found as RICO --

19   I shouldn't say "burglaries" --

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That wasn't what I meant.

21                MR. FERNICH:         Okay.

22                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I meant, would the

23   organization, as it was described to exist at the time

24   Mangiavillano was there, would that have satisfied the

25   definition of "structure" because it had a leader?

 1              MR. FERNICH:         It may have at that point, but

 2   there was no evidence -- and -- and because it's outside

 3   of the time frame of what the jury has found, there is a

 4   lot more diversity in the criminality that was alleged

 5   during that period.

 6              A properly instructed jury may have found

 7   that there was an enterprise existing at that time,

 8   Although I'm not even sure a jury could so find under

 9   Turkette because the core of the membership changed very

10   dramatically over a period of time.                    But the leadership

11   would be one -- to be sure, leadership is something that

12   a jury could take into account and could permissibly

13   find if they were properly instructed.                   On the facts of

14   this case, I cannot answer that question definitively.

15              JUSTICE BREYER:            Could you try something out

16   in your mind, and maybe you can't react to it.                    I'm

17   trying to figure out how the structure requirement, what

18   to say, and a thought was occurring to me which I am not

19   wedded to, I would like some reactions to it:                    Is to say

20   that there is a structure means that among this

21   association of people there must be rules,

22   understandings, or behavior that tend to keep the

23   association together over time, other than those which

24   would be essential to allow them to commit the

25   particular crimes at issue.

 1                 MR. FERNICH:         Certainly the defense would

 2   take a ruling like that, but what --

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, I know, but I'm

 4   trying to work out in my mind, is that a sensible thing

 5   to say?     The trouble with the word "structure" is

 6   everything in the universe has a structure, and so it's

 7   awfully vague?     I'm trying to make it a little bit more

 8   specific.

 9                 MR. FERNICH:         A structure -- the structure I

10   don't think entails necessarily rules, regulations, et

11   cetera.     I don't think the word "structure" --

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:            That isn't what I said.      I

13   said:     Rules, understandings, forms of behavior that

14   tend to keep the association together over time, other

15   than those rules, understandings and associations and

16   behaviors that would be necessary -- "necessary" meant

17   strongly -- to commit the particular crimes at issue.

18                 MR. FERNICH:         Is Your Honor's question is

19   that a sensible definition of "structure"?

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.

21                 MR. FERNICH:         Yes, it is a sensible

22   definition of "structure."

 3                   ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG

 4                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 5                 MR. YANG:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 6   please the Court:

 7                 An association-in-fact enterprise need not

 8   have an ascertainable structure distinct from the

 9   predicate act of racketeering committed by one of its

10   associates, whatever that means.                 RICO's statutory text,

11   its surrounding context, and this Court's construction

12   of the statute show that RICO's definition of

13   "enterprise" is broad and contains no such limitation.

14                 Petitioner's primary argument, that the term

15   "enterprise" is rendered superfluous and merges with the

16   charged pattern of racketeering acts, is wrong for at

17   least three reasons:        First, it's wrong as a formal

18   matter.    The enterprise is a group of individuals.               The

19   pattern is a series of acts.              Second, it fails to

20   account for the fact that the relevant pattern of --

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Wait, wait, wait, wait,

22   wait.     I assume that he was responding to the argument

23   that you can establish the enterprise from the mere

24   existence of the pattern of the acts, from the separate

25   acts.     And if indeed it takes nothing more than the acts

 1   to constitute the enterprise, it seems to me he has a

 2   point.

 3              MR. YANG:      That goes to my second reason.

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Oh, so we'll forget about

 5   your first one.

 6              MR. YANG:      Well, let me go to -- which I

 7   think it addresses the second reason.                  It's distinct as

 8   a formal matter, which is that have you to have find a

 9   group of individuals versus a series of facts.                  You can

10   infer the group from their actions, just as can you

11   infer, you know, a relationship between individuals by

12   the way they act together.         But --

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:            So --

14              MR. YANG:      My first point is a formal one.

15   The second point goes straight to the statute:                 That the

16   relevant pattern of racketeering acts that is at issue

17   in RICO -- this is 1962(c) -- is a pattern of acts

18   committed by an individual defendant, not a group.                 In

19   fact, in H.J. this Court explained that the premise that

20   the pattern has to be performed by a group or an

21   association -- this is at page 244 of the Court's

22   opinion there -- was wrong and that the pattern can be

23   fully the work of an individual acting alone.

24              It's also wrong because an enterprise

25   remains wholly distinct and pertinent in numerous RICO

 1   contexts under the government's interpretation.

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            When you say "individual,"

 3   the first part of the definition of "enterprise" speaks

 4   about any individual partnership, corporation,

 5   association, or other legal entity.

 6                 MR. YANG:      That's correct.

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:            So then, I've read

 8   somewhere that people feel that where that individual is

 9   involved, the individual is acting as an -- a legal

10   entity such as a sole proprietorship.                     Is that right?

11                 MR. YANG:      An individual can be an

12   enterprise as a sole proprietorship, if that's the

13   question.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:            I'm talking about a legal

15   entity.     And in the second clause, what we are talking

16   about here, specifically, it is "a corporation, a union,

17   or a group of individuals associated in fact although

18   not a legal entity."

19                 MR. YANG:      That's correct.               I think there

20   may be some miscommunication on my part.                     I would direct

21   the Court to page 5a of the appendix which reproduces

22   section 1962(c).     It states:           "It shall be unlawful for

23   any person" -- it doesn't say "group," "enterprise" or

24   an "association" -- "that is employed or associated with

25   an enterprise" --

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             What appendix?        Not the

 2   joint appendix?

 3                 MR. YANG:       Excuse me.            The appendix to our

 4   brief.   I'm sorry.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             All right.

 6                 MR. YANG:       The gray brief.              So what's

 7   relevant for purposes of showing an element of a 1962(c)

 8   violation is that the defendant alone, perhaps with

 9   others, but the element is the defendant has to commit a

10   pattern of racketeering.            There are other elements.             For

11   instance, the defendant has to do so in a manner that

12   participates in the conduct of the affairs of the

13   enterprise.    But, of course, that embraces a wholly

14   distinct concept, that is the enterprise.

15                 Now, in many cases, as you have here, the

16   pattern of racketeering activity of this defendant is

17   proved by evidence that that defendant was also working

18   in concert with others.           And so in that case, the

19   pattern element, which, again, is the individual's

20   pattern of acts, is proved by the same type of evidence

21   that would prove the --

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So then you'd have

23   an easy time before the jury.                And same thing with

24   respect to the individual.             All that's saying is that

25   when you are dealing with one person, it's pretty easy

 1   to prove that he, you know, directs himself or, you

 2   know, has an ongoing plan, but that doesn't mean that

 3   it's not a separate element that the jury should have to

 4   find.

 5                 MR. YANG:     We don't say that it's not a

 6   separate element, and we also don't say that a pattern

 7   necessarily would --

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, you say that

 9   it's not distinct from the underlying offenses.

10                 MR. YANG:     No, I don't believe so.                 I think

11   what we have said is that the evidence regarding the

12   pattern of activity allows the jury to infer the

13   existence of an enterprise because an enterprise --

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But they don't have

15   to be separately instructed that they have to find that,

16   do they?

17                 MR. YANG:     No, they do.                 And in fact the

18   jury can --

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What is the

20   instruction that the Seventh Circuit and the Eighth

21   Circuit give that you don't think is necessary?

22                 MR. YANG:     The instruction is pertaining to

23   an ascertainable structure distinct from the pattern of

24   racketeering.    Here you still have to show an

25   enterprise, and the jury may not infer an enterprise


                                        28

 1   from the pattern, but certainly it's open to the jury.

 2   When that pattern -- again, a pattern is an individual's

 3   conduct -- but when that pattern is shown through

 4   evidence that the individual is acting with others over

 5   a long period of time -- to either establish that it's a

 6   pattern of racketeering activity, if that same evidence

 7   not only shows that the individual committed a pattern

 8   of racketeering activity, but it was done in concert

 9   with others and that the -- that evidence shows that a

10   group of individuals had associated in fact for the

11   common purpose of engaging in criminal conduct.

12              JUSTICE ALITO:          Would you agree there could

13   be a situation in which an individual engages in a

14   pattern of racketeering activity together with other

15   people and yet is not participating in the affairs of an

16   enterprise through the pattern of racketeering activity?

17              MR. YANG:      Well, I think that's the case

18   that we gave -- an example that we gave in our brief,

19   which is saying an individual commits a very long string

20   of bank burglaries and -- actually, make it robberies.

21   Robbery is a predicate act; burglary is not.            Bank

22   burglaries with individuals, but each time he does it,

23   it's with a different group of individuals.            There you

24   -- the individual would be established -- you could

25   establish a pattern from, say, the relatedness of the


                                      29

 1   crimes to an M.O. or a -- and in the long continuous

 2   string of crimes, more than a few months, perhaps years.

 3   But it would not establish an enterprise.

 4                 JUSTICE ALITO:         And what is -- why would it

 5   not?     What --

 6                 MR. YANG:     Because there would be -- you

 7   would --

 8                 JUSTICE ALITO:         What's lacking there?

 9                 MR. YANG:     What would show is that the

10   individual is not working in concert with others to

11   achieve an end.    There's no parallel identity between

12   any two of the crimes except for the individual acting

13   alone.

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I thought an

15   individual -- I thought an individual could be the

16   enterprise?

17                 MR. YANG:     One -- he could be --

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                An independent

19   contractor rather than an employee.

20                 MR. YANG:     He could be an enterprise but not

21   one -- when an individual acts an alone as an

22   enterprise, the individual is not liability for

23   racketeering acts under 1962(c) under this Court's

24   decision in Cedric Kushner, because there's a

25   requirement in 1962(c) that the individual has to be

 1   employed by or associated with the enterprise.                  And this

 2   Court has explained that you have to have some

 3   distinctiveness between the enterprise itself and the

 4   individual.

 5                 So with respect to the individual, there

 6   would be no -- there might be an enterprise.                  It is

 7   conceivable that he could be deemed an enterprise, but

 8   not one that has any relevance for RICO purposes under

 9   1962(c).

10                 JUSTICE ALITO:         What if he has a list of 25

11   people who may, on various occasions, want to

12   participate with him in bank robberies?                  So whenever he

13   gets the urge to commit a bank robbery, he gets out his

14   rolodex and he picks one or more of them and calls them

15   up and they commit the bank robbery?

16                 MR. YANG:     I guess it's unlikely that the

17   government, if that were the only fact, could show an

18   enterprise.    If there was some additional evidence that

19   the individuals had gotten together and said, yeah, you

20   know what, call me, let's work together, when I'm

21   available call me, but it just happens he never called

22   me twice.

23                 JUSTICE ALITO:         What is the element, then,

24   that is missing?

25                 MR. YANG:     Well, what's required under this


                                        31

 1   Court's decision in Turkette, which we think flows

 2   directly from the language, any group of individuals

 3   associated in fact, is that the group of persons must be

 4   associated together for a common purpose of engaging in

 5   a course of conduct.      And that could be shown, as

 6   Turkette explained, by evidence of some kind of ongoing

 7   organization, formal or informal, that -- whose

 8   associates function as an ongoing unit.

 9              And in order to prove through one's actions

10   with others that there is an entity -- some agreement

11   and continuing unit behind it, you are going to have to

12   show some identity in the group.               If there is no

13   identity except for one person, it would be very

14   difficult to show an enterprise.

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Why -- I guess that's where

16   I'm losing the argument.         Why is it difficult?

17              MR. YANG:       It would be difficult to prove an

18   association in fact.      I'm sorry.           It would be difficult

19   to prove an association in fact of more than one person

20   as the enterprise in that context, because it would be

21   difficult to show that that person had joined with

22   others for the common purpose of engaging in a course of

23   common conduct.   It would just be a series of distinct

24   crimes.

25              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Then why don't you dispense

 1   with the association-in-fact category and simply go with

 2   the individual?

 3                 MR. YANG:      That was my answer to the Chief

 4   Justice's question, because under 1962(c), there has to

 5   be distinctiveness in that context.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Two people -- two people

 7   walk along the street and know each other, suppose

 8   that's the example, and one of them says I have a great

 9   idea.     Let's go in and take some money out of the post

10   office.    The other says, what happens if a policeman

11   comes?    The first one says, we'll bribe him.              Okay.

12   Then they do it.    That's it.            Period.

13                 Now, of course that's illegal.              But is RICO

14   supposed to catch that?

15                 MR. YANG:      No.

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:            What is it that keeps them

17   out of it?

18                 MR. YANG:      Well, RICO requires, among other

19   things, a pattern of racketeering.

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, here we have two --

21   two -- two related crimes.

22                 MR. YANG:      Well, they can be related, but

23   under this Court's decision in H.J. you also have to

24   show continuing criminal conduct.

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:            There was between the two.

 1              MR. YANG:        Well, no.           That has a particular

 2   meaning under H.J., which is that it has to extend over

 3   an extended period of time.

 4              JUSTICE BREYER:              That is the bribery.     What

 5   happens if three months from now the postal inspector

 6   comes to catch us, we will bribe him.

 7              MR. YANG:        Well, again, I'm not sure that

 8   that would meet the continuing aspect, either because

 9   it's a threat of continuing activity or because it would

10   satisfy the closing continuity.

11              JUSTICE BREYER:              You are quite right, I

12   agree with you that these are different efforts to try

13   to catch the same problem.           And the problem is that I

14   don't think anyone sees that the simple conspiracy in

15   carrying out of two criminal offenses by several people

16   together without more -- without something more should

17   violate RICO.    I think your answer to that would be you

18   agree with that, but tell me if you don't.

19              And then if you do agree with it, the very

20   difficult problem is to figure out how to get the people

21   to clearly show a pattern or not.

22              MR. YANG:        I think I agree with that

23   proposition.    But what needs to be shown is that there

24   needs to be an enterprise.           Sometimes the enterprise in

25   cases are lawful enterprises; sometimes in cases it

 1   involves an unlawful organization or unlawful

 2   association in fact, like we have here.                   And that is

 3   shown -- the statutory requirement, as explained in

 4   Turkette, is simply that this group of people associate

 5   together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of

 6   conduct.

 7                 Now, when you have a long -- a series, like

 8   we have here of racketeer -- of crimes.                   These sets of

 9   crimes went on for almost a decade, involved dozens and

10   dozens of bank heists.

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 In fact, your friend

12   said that the period the jury found was just a couple of

13   months.

14                 MR. YANG:      Yes, that concerns the predicate

15   acts of racketeering.        This is -- this raises another

16   important issue, which is, the group largely was

17   committing bank burglaries.              Those are not predicate

18   acts.     The predicate acts here under RICO involve the

19   interstate transportation of stolen funds.                  There were

20   three of those that were charged as the predicate act,

21   and the jury found those to constitute a pattern.

22                 But what this group of individuals were

23   doing, is they were associating in fact for a very long

24   period of time, committing dozens of bank -- bank

25   burglaries, and did so sometimes with the interstate

 1   transportation -- that's what brought --

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:               And -- and were they shown

 3   to the jury, all of those bank burglaries?

 4              MR. YANG:         Oh, there were many things shown

 5   to the jury.

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:               So it is not at issue in

 7   this case whether -- whether the entity can be --

 8              MR. YANG:         I have to say --

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:               -- derived simply from the

10   predicate acts?

11              MR. YANG:         I have to say I'm a little

12   perplexed at this stage in the litigation based -- how

13   we got here based on the objection that was made to the

14   district court.   The objection that was made, which was

15   a J.A. 95, was that there was an ascertainable

16   structural hierarchy which seems to be abandoned at this

17   point, distinct from the charged predicated acts of

18   racketeering, that was repeated at 103, 108, and 109.

19   And then there was also an objection that the entity has

20   to have a particular or formed structure, and that has

21   been abandoned and also inconsistent with Turkette,

22   which recognized that this could be an informal

23   association.

24              And, in fact, there was not an objection to

25   the entire charge.      Counsel at page J.A. 97, after --

 1   when the court explained that it was going to address

 2   his proposed charge at J.A. 95 said, you know, I have

 3   some specific objections to the charges written, and

 4   then went through them, and raising those two objections

 5   as we've just discussed here.

 6                So, we've kind of evolved in terms of what

 7   this case is all about.          And even if the Petitioner were

 8   right, I don't think he could prevail, even under the

 9   charge he wants in this case.

10                But let me turn to a few anomalies with

11   respect to Petitioner's interpretation of a structure.

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Before you do that, Mr.

13   Yang, could you give us a sense, if you know it, about

14   the practical results of the different formulas that --

15   there are at least three formulas, I take it that the

16   different circuits have approved.                  In the result of the

17   RICO prosecution, does it really make a difference which

18   one of these is charged or do they could out the same

19   way, anyway?

20                MR. YANG:       It will make a difference in some

21   cases.   There is a case called Bagaric that this Court

22   cited in its National Organization for Women Against

23   Scheidler.     In there, there was a -- the -- involved a

24   group of Croation nationalists, loosely knit, who agreed

25   to promote their anti-Yugoslavian through a series of


                                         37

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   acts they committed over a series of years, extortion,

 2   murder, bombings.    There was no structure, it would be

 3   very difficult to fit into the ascertainable structure

 4   distinct from the predicate act of racketeering that

 5   Petitioner espouses.

 6                There are other cases involving loosely knit

 7   gangs such as neighborhood thugs.                 The Nascimento case

 8   involved a neighborhood group of thugs that protected

 9   each other, and that was their common -- common bonding

10   element through killing rivals or intimidating

11   witnesses.   There's no hierarchy there.                  There were no

12   colors, no initiation rights.              But this went on for over

13   a long period of time.

14                But beyond the classic cases that might fall

15   outside RICO, if the Court were to adopt an

16   ascertainable structure requirement, I think as

17   Petitioner's laundry list of -- of examples -- unless

18   my -- his reply brief illustrates, that is going to

19   involve a long course of case-by-case adjudication.

20                JUSTICE BREYER:            What did you think -- what

21   did you think of the -- probably not much of it, but

22   what did you think of my effort there?                   And I am trying

23   to point out, as you see, I am open to anything that

24   will deal with what I think of as a functional problem

25   and the functional problem is exhibited by that Posner

 1   example I gave you or by two investment companies that

 2   decide, what we will do is we will issue a letter that

 3   is going to be shown to two different people; that is

 4   their only association; or maybe 100 people, but they

 5   know who they are, and they are going to be shown this

 6   letter over a period of five or 10 years, and someone

 7   later comes back and says there is a false statement in

 8   the letter.    Well, they shouldn't issue a false

 9   statement, but is that RICO?

10                 I mean, so -- so the object -- the object is

11   to find a way of not overextending RICO where there is

12   nothing there but a conspiracy to commit two crimes.

13   Pattern is one help.       The pattern is pretty vague, so

14   all the courts but one have come along, I take it, with

15   this other help, which is playing on the word structure.

16                 Now you have heard what I said as a weak

17   effort to try to do something.               What is your best effort

18   to do something to deal with the problem?                Or what's

19   wrong with my effort?       Whatever you want to say.

20                 MR. YANG:     Let me first address what is your

21   underlying concern, that there is a problem.                Turkette

22   addressed that; Turkette addressed that it doesn't

23   matter that the evidence used to establish these

24   separate elements may in case of --

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:           That's different.

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   That's -- of course the same evidence can establish two

 2   separate elements.

 3                 MR. YANG:      The --

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:            The problem will be

 5   conflating the elements so that every single case that

 6   you have the first set, you also have the second set.

 7                 MR. YANG:      That problem does not exist as

 8   well, because the relevant pattern of racketeering

 9   activity that is the element of the crime is something

10   committed by individuals.

11                 For instance, let's take a group of

12   individuals who commit a long string, of, for instance,

13   burglaries, they do so over a series of years.                Bank

14   burglary is not a predicate act of racketeering; it's a

15   wholly criminal organization; all they do is commit bank

16   burglaries.    One individual is given the money at the

17   end of the -- of each burglary.                What we would have

18   there is a RICO violation after the individual, because

19   the individual, the element is that the individual has

20   transported the money in interstate transportation -- or

21   across State lines, and that is a RICO predicate; but

22   the other things that the group was doing, those are not

23   RICO predicates.

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:            No, no.

25                 MR. YANG:      So the -- so the element, it

 1   doesn't change, if the individual then does it with some

 2   other people -- let's say he brings his buddy along, two

 3   of them do it, that just shows the evidence necessary to

 4   show that the individual -- the evidence showed that the

 5   individual committed a pattern of racketeering, also

 6   happens to show he did it with a group, but it's the

 7   evidence, not the element.           The element of the crime in

 8   section 1962(c) always turns on the defendant.

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Always, in a case where you

10   sue the investment company because of their one letter

11   used four times, it's the act of the individual.                  In the

12   case that Posner used, it's always the act of the

13   individual.    There's always a criminal act of an

14   individual.

15                 MR. YANG:     But if you have --

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:           And he has to be

17   associated, however, with an enterprise for it to fall

18   within RICO, and there also has to be a pattern.

19                 MR. YANG:     If we take --

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:           That's going back --

21                 MR. YANG: -- my hypothetical with the

22   individual transporting the money alone across State

23   lines, you have a pattern.           If you just looked at that,

24   individual taking money across State lines, by himself,

25   that doesn't establish enterprise.                  What would -- so the

 1   pattern exists independently.

 2                 What would show the enterprise is the fact

 3   that the evidence might also show that he is doing it

 4   with other people.      That would show that he -- the

 5   element that is, that he is committing a pattern of

 6   racketeering activity and he is doing it in concert with

 7   others, but that goes to the separate element of

 8   enterprise.    That is --

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:            That's right, and our

10   problem is he is doing it with one other person whom he

11   met once, and they agreed to do it, and it's a common

12   law conspiracy; and now suddenly he has done it twice

13   with another person who helped him and they said they

14   would do it, and now we have RICO; and my belief is --

15   which you may not agree with -- that that common

16   garden-variety conspiracy to say, rob a bank and then

17   transport the money a few months later, that that's all

18   that's at issue.     That shouldn't be within RICO.

19                 MR. YANG:      Let me --

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:            You might come back and

21   tell me it should be.

22                 MR. YANG:      Let me try to approach that in

23   two separate ways.      One, Turkette in footnote 5 was very

24   clear.   The Court explained even if the pattern of

25   racketeering activity and the enterprise are established


                                         42

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the same way, it doesn't matter, if enterprise has

 2   function -- some function, there is no such thing as, in

 3   other words, partial superfluidities of an element, or

 4   partial superfluidity of a word.

 5                Secondly, the concern about conspiracy

 6   exists in any conspiracy.           Conspiracy is an inchoate

 7   act.    You are liable for conspiracy as soon as you made

 8   the agreement, and under 371 commit an overt act or

 9   under RICO conspiracy agree to all the necessary

10   elements of a substantive RICO offense.

11                Congress has -- and not only that, you can

12   be charged for conspiracy and charged for completing the

13   conspiracy as separate crimes.               That's the normal rule.

14   That's the normal rule here.             You can be charged for a

15   conspiracy to commit RICO offenses, and RICO offenses,

16   the pattern element I don't think can be overestimated

17   here.

18                The pattern element is where RICO has --

19   plus the list of predicate acts of racketeering -- is

20   really where RICO gets most of its limiting structure,

21   and I think the Court recognized that in H.J.

22                It's the pattern which requires related

23   criminal acts that can be related in a number of ways,

24   and the -- the Court gave kind of a list of that in

25   H.J., which I think I won't go through now, but as well

 1   as continuity, and that could be long-term criminal

 2   activity, not just a single or two, but long-term

 3   criminal activity, or the threat of criminal activity.

 4   Interestingly enough --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I am -- I am really

 6   confused now.    I don't -- I am not sure I know what your

 7   answer to the question presented is, which is quite

 8   simply must an association-in-fact enterprise under RICO

 9   have some ascertainable structure beyond that inherent

10   in the commission of predicate crimes by its members and

11   associates?

12                 And you -- your answer is no?

13                 MR. YANG:     No.      I mean, I guess it depends

14   on what you mean -- ascertainable structure --

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes.

16                 MR. YANG:     It's very -- I have to say it's

17   difficult for me to understand what is being proposed by

18   the other side, particularly once you have lost

19   hierarchy.    Hierarchy is something which is an

20   understandable term.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Right.

22                 MR. YANG:     But if you are talking about

23   structure, structure could mean relationship between

24   individuals that enable them to --

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Right, right.

 2   the case --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes.

 4                 MR. YANG:     -- I don't see why a jury cannot

 5   infer from the fact that over a long period of time the

 6   alleged members of this group have operated as a unit

 7   and have committed acts of racketeering, from that

 8   coordinating conduct that you were not able to infer

 9   that they had a means of acting as a group.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes, but you would have to

11   tell the jury -- you would have to tell the jury you

12   would have to find it.        Of course the jury can find it,

13   but the issue is must the jury be told that it has to

14   find it?   I think he's conceding --

15                 MR. YANG:     Must the jury --

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Be told it's not enough,

17   ladies and gentlemen of the jury, for you to find that

18   these predicate acts occurred; you must find -- and you

19   can find it just from the predicate acts, if you think

20   the evidence will justify that -- you must find an

21   organization separate from the mere commission of the

22   predicate acts.

23                 MR. YANG:     What does that mean?

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't know.

 1               MR. YANG:        Because Turkette makes very clear

 2   that an association-in-fact enterprise can exist for

 3   wholly criminal acts.        So if for instance, take a few

 4   hypotheticals.    Let's say a group forms for the basis of

 5   committing just only predicate acts of racketeering,

 6   they do that.     Nothing else, just predicate acts, over a

 7   10-year period.

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Right.

 9               MR. YANG:        All right?            One formulation of

10   petitioners is you have to look at the charged pattern

11   of racketeering acts, presumably because then the jury

12   has to find the charged pattern and then that has to be

13   distinct from the enterprise.               If that is the case --

14   let's say there is 100 predicate acts of racketeering.

15   All that does is say that the government has to show 99

16   and leave the last one uncharged.                  That makes no sense.

17               To the extent that Petitioners say that

18   okay, there has got to be some -- something other than

19   racketeering activity, take for instance, the group that

20   does wholly legal, but does criminal non-racketeering

21   acts as well as racketeering acts; that's in fact this

22   case.   Bank robberies and -- excuse me, bank burglaries,

23   which is not a predicate act, and interstate

24   transportation of funds.           It would be wholly anomalous

25   to exclude a group that only did bank robberies, which

 1   are predicate acts, but include a group that was only

 2   partially racketeering but wholly criminal.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Not at all; not at

 4   all.   That would make a lot of sense, because RICO is

 5   not intended just to bring in the crimes.                   They are look

 6   for something else.       They are looking for an

 7   organization that is involved in these types of things.

 8                 MR. YANG:      But there is nothing -- there's

 9   -- in order to find an organization, you are not going

10   to see any more from criminal acts that are not

11   racketeering versus criminal acts that are.                  Both of

12   them show --

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But -- but you -- you

14   would instruct the jury that if these three thefts that

15   are covered by RICO occurred over a period of a year,

16   and they involved lookouts and scanners and so forth,

17   you may infer from these acts an enterprise as defined

18   by the statute?

19                 MR. YANG:      They might.

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You would allow that

21   instruction?

22                 MR. YANG:      You -- yes, but there would have

23   to be more.    You have to explain what would be necessary

 2   briefs or in the materials do we find the definition of

 3   what the enterprise is, other than in the statute, other

 4   than the terms of the statute itself?

 5                MR. YANG:       I believe page 17.

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I mean, in other -- what

 7   do I refer to in order to supplement the instruction

 8   that I just noted -- that I just suggested?

 9                MR. YANG:       Page 17 of our brief reiterates

10   the standard, I believe it's Turkette, it comes from

11   Turkette and in the appendix to petition -- or excuse

12   me, to the joint appendix, the charge is at pages 111

13   through 113.   That's the charge.

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             That's at the bottom of

15   111 where it said you can look to see what it does and

16   make the inference rather than have -- I forget -- an

17   abstract analysis?

18                MR. YANG:       But it goes on to say that you

19   must -- the government must prove that there is an

20   ongoing organization with some similar framework, formal

21   and informal, for carrying out its objectives and

22   various members and associations of the association

23   function as a continuing unit to achieve a common

24   objective.

25                The government must prove that in every

 1   case.   In this case, this is not in the J.A., but it is

 2   in the court of appeals appendix at page 8770, the

 3   district court specifically charged the jury that they

 4   must find five separate elements of a RICO offense,

 5   including the existence of an enterprise as one; two,

 6   that the enterprise engaged in or its activity affected

 7   interstate or foreign commerce; three, that the

 8   defendant was associated in it.

 9               Eventually you get down to five, that the

10   defendant knowingly participated in the conduct of the

11   affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of

12   racketeering.

13               So the district court explained you have to

14   define an enterprise.        And to find an enterprise, what's

15   a necessary element, it said you may infer an enterprise

16   from what the --

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   You say enterprise.

18   I mean, the objection is that the enterprise is no

19   different than the various predicate acts.

20               MR. YANG:        It is different in the sense that

21   you can have a series of predicate acts without an

22   enterprise, you can have an enterprise without a series

23   of predicate acts.      Now what, the objection seems to be

24   ultimately that the evidence needs to show the predicate

25   acts of racketeering may also prove that the enterprise

 1   exists, because when you show predicate acts of a

 2   defendant, which is the only element, he doesn't have to

 3   work in concert with others to commit the predicate acts

 4   of racketeering, but when you show the predicate acts

 5   with evidence that individual is acting with others, you

 6   can also show that they have -- there is an association

 7   in fact of individuals who joined together to pursue a

 8   common course of conduct.           Thank you, Your Honors.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you Mr. Yang.

10                Mr. Fernich, you have four minutes

11   remaining.

12                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARC FERNICH

13                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14                MR. FERNICH:         Thank you, Your Honor.

15                Very briefly, nobody disputes the

16   proposition that a properly instructed jury would be

17   able to find that racketeering acts committed by an

18   individual is a distinct element from the

19   association-in-fact enterprise.               The government is

20   absolutely right and we agree on that score.                 The

21   problem is the lower courts have misread Turkette.                 They

22   are not focusing on the pattern of activity committed by

23   the individual; they have -- and the instruction as

24   Justice Kennedy himself quoted in this case encapsulate

25   it -- encapsulates the problem.

 1                 Comments -- and this is at the bottom of

 2   J.A. 1111.     Common sense suggests that the existence of

 3   an association in fact is oftentimes more readily proven

 4   by what it does -- it does, not rather than what an

 5   individual member does -- rather than by abstract

 6   analysis of its structure.

 7                 So it only raises a further vagueness

 8   problem.     We agree that patterns of racketeering

 9   activity are properly committed by individuals.                    If you

10   are going to define the enterprise solely or principally

11   by virtue of the pattern, whose pattern would you define

12   it by?   It doesn't even make any sense.                  And in

13   Turkette, it -- with respect to what occurred in

14   Turkette -- and this is at page 5 of my brief, the

15   latter -- and this is a quote from Turkette, and it is

16   referring to a pattern:          "The latter is proved by

17   evidence of the requisite number of acts of racketeering

18   committed by the participants in the enterprise."

19                 We agree in the abstract that a properly

20   instructed jury, that the pattern and the enterprise are

21   totally different things.            The problem is it's a giant

22   circular argued by the government.                   Juries are not being

23   properly instructed in that regard, and that only

24   compounds the vagueness of the statute.

25                 The second point I would like to make:                 the

 1   government presses its principal definition of an

 2   enterprise in its brief, and what I hear here from the

 3   government is its common purpose.                 Common purpose.   And

 4   I would like to direct the Court to the Salinas opinion

 5   which discussed RICO conspiracy.                It's at 522 U.S. --

 6   well, I will give you the -- let's try 118 S. Court 477.

 7                 It looks like common purpose is the hallmark

 8   of a conspiracy.    This is in the discussion of a

 9   conspiracy:    "We rejected argument X because it would

10   erode the common law principle that so long as they

11   share a common purpose, conspirators are liable for the

12   acts of their co-conspirators, which is the Pinkerton

13   doctrine which collapses 1962(c) into a general

14   conspiracy statute, if you are going to define an

15   enterprise principally by virtue of its common purpose.

16   My second point.

17                 As far as the claim that somehow we didn't

18   object sufficiently to a charge, I am not going to

19   address that in any depth.           I would just direct the

20   Court to pages 97 through 109 of the joint appendix.                  It

21   -- it spells out exactly what we objected to, and we

22   objected to virtually every sentence of the instruction

23   that defines or purports to define an

24   association-in-fact enterprise.

25                 As far as the definition of the enterprise,

 1   we would certainly agree with Justice Breyer's

 2   formulation that something to differentiate it as a

 3   long-term, goal-directed, decisionmaking apparatus that

 4   continues in the intervals between the predicate acts

 5   would do it, but we contend that structure is largely,

 6   it's a plain English word, it's not

 7   antidisestablishmentarianism or something like that; the

 8   jury should be instructed as in the Seventh and Eighth

 9   Circuits that there has got to be a structure separate

10   from the pattern.     If the jury has questions, we have

11   lots of faith in district judges, as Justice Ginsburg

12   pointed out; that if the jury comes back with a question

13   the judge could list examples tailored to the

14   appropriate case.

15              And I just want to hit the common -- the

16   purpose underlying RICO here.               It's very significant in

17   my view that bank burglaries are not in fact RICO

18   predicate acts, and if you were to look -- if this Court

19   were to look at my court of appeals brief in this case,

20   bank burglary is not a RICO predicate act for a reason.

21   Congress made the judgment that bank burglaries are

22   adequately handled by the States, that the States can

23   prosecute them.     And the reason why the three bank

24   burglaries had to be addressed up as interstate

25   transportation of stolen money is this is not really a

 1   case in which RICO is properly invoked.

 2                 It's fully briefed in my court of appeals

 3   submission.    These are State crimes that a State is

 4   perfectly capable -- capable of handling on its own.

 5   And unless there are any further questions, I would

 6   waive any further rebuttal.

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel,

 8   the case is submitted.
