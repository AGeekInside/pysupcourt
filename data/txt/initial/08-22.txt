 7            ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9                MR. OLSON:      Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10   and may it please the Court:

11                A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a

12   fundamental constitutional right.                That means not only

13   the absence of actual bias, but a guarantee against even

14   the probability of an unfair tribunal.                   In short --

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Who says?        Have we ever

16   held that?

17                MR. OLSON:      You have said that in the

18   Murchison case and in a number of cases, Your Honor.

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:            A guarantee against even --

20                MR. OLSON:      Yes, the language of the

21   Murchison case specifically says so.                    The Court said in

22   that case:   "A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic

23   requirement of due process.             Fairness, of course,

24   requires an absence of actual bias in the trial of

25   cases, but our system of law has always endeavored to

 1   prevent even the probability of unfairness."

 2                 And in that paragraph, the Court goes on --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             "Has always endeavored."

 4                 MR. OLSON:       Pardon?

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             "Has always endeavored."

 6   "Has always endeavored."

 7                 MR. OLSON:       Yes, but that's --

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             And there are rules in the

 9   States that do endeavor to do that.

10                 MR. OLSON:       But the Court has said that

11   frequently, not only the probability of bias, the

12   appearance of bias, the likelihood of bias, the inherent

13   suspicion of bias.      The Court has repeatedly said that

14   in the context -- a series of contexts or cases.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 "Probability" is a

16   loose term.    What -- what percentage is probable --

17                 MR. OLSON:       Well --

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 If you've a 50

19   percent chance of bias, a 10 percent chance?                   Probable

20   means more than 50?

21                 MR. OLSON:       It's probable cause, Mr. Chief

22   Justice.   The Court frequently decides questions

23   involving due process, equal protection, probable cause,

24   speedy trial, on the basis not of mathematical

25   certainty, but in this case where an objective observer

 1   would come to the conclusion -- knowing all of the

 2   facts, would come to the conclusion that a judge or

 3   jurist would probably be biased against that individual

 4   or in favor of his opponent, that would be sufficient

 5   under the Due Process Clause, we submit.               The Court --

 6              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Does it mean the same

 7   thing as likelihood of bias?

 8              MR. OLSON:       The Court -- the Court, Justice

 9   Ginsburg, has used the changes interchangeably.              We

10   think the probably -- the "probable" standard is the one

11   we would advance to this Court.             But the -- but the

12   seminal case, the Tumey case, said that even if there

13   was a possibility -- any procedure where there would be

14   a possible temptation for the judge not to hold the

15   balance nice, clear, and true, would be the standard.

16   But -- and the Aetna -- in the Aetna v. Lavoie case not

17   very many years ago, the Court repeated that standard,

18   and that standard has been repeated again and again.

19   The likelihood or the possibility or even the temptation

20   --

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:             And you claim that there is

22   such a temptation here because of gratitude?

23              MR. OLSON:       Well --

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:             You've been around

25   Washington a long time.       How far do you think gratitude

 1   goes in -- in the general political world?

 2              MR. OLSON:         Well, let me put it this way,

 3   Justice Scalia.    If -- an ordinary person would say that

 4   it would be very difficult for a judge to hold the

 5   balance nice, square, and true when that judge has just

 6   been put on the bench during the pendency of the trial

 7   of the case by his opponent's contribution of $3 million

 8   to his election.

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Yes, but that -- that

10   person contributed money to my election because he

11   expected me to be a fair and impartial judge.              And I

12   would be faithful to that contributor only by being a

13   fair and impartial judge.           That is showing gratitude.        I

14   should do what he expected me to do, and I have no

15   reason to think he expected me to lie and distort cases

16   in order to come out his way.              What I expected he wanted

17   me to do was to be a good judge, and I'm being faithful

18   to him and I'm -- I'm showing my gratitude by -- by

19   being a good judge.

20              MR. OLSON:         Well, I would go back to the

21   words of this court in the Tumey case, the seminal case:

22   "Due process is not satisfied by the argument that men

23   of highest honor and greatest self-sacrifice could carry

24   it out without danger of injustice."

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:               It isn't a matter of honor


                                         6

 1   and sacrifice.   You talk as though what gratitude

 2   consists of is coming out in favor of this fellow, but

 3   that is not necessarily what gratitude consists of.

 4   Gratitude consists of performing the way this person

 5   would like me to perform.          Now, in this case, I will

 6   acknowledge that you seem to have a contribution based

 7   upon more.   This contributor never even met the judge,

 8   did he?

 9                MR. OLSON:      Well, it's not clear.           There is

10   a --

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:            They're certainly not good

12   buddies.

13                MR. OLSON:      We're not claiming that there is

14   a basis based on personal relationship, Your Honor.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:            And his contributions, as I

16   understand it, were mainly based upon his opposition to

17   the incumbent, who he thought was an activist judge that

18   -- that was distorting the tort law of the State, all in

19   favor of the plaintiffs' bar.             And if -- if the

20   contribution were to engender any gratitude, it seems to

21   me it would simply be that this other candidate would do

22   what he promised in his campaign and that is not be an

23   activist judge and not distort the tort law of the

24   State.

25                MR. OLSON:      Well, if I can address part of

 1   the premise of your question and invite the Court to

 2   look at page 188a of the joint appendix.                   This addresses

 3   the point that you just made that he was contributing

 4   his money to defeat Justice McGraw as opposed to

 5   supporting Justice Benjamin.              On page 188a is one of

 6   those financial disclosure reports that's required by

 7   West Virginia law.      It's filed by Mr. Blankenship and it

 8   says on that page:      "Expenditures made to support or

 9   oppose," and he underlines the word "support," and then

10   he types in the word "Brent Benjamin."

11              Then if you'll turn over to page 200a, which

12   is the last page of that report, that shows that he

13   directly spent $508,000 of his own money to support

14   Justice Benjamin.

15              Now, to the larger part of your point, the

16   context of this case suggests that, while the appeal was

17   going to be coming to the -- to the West Virginia

18   Supreme Court, Mr. Blankenship, who was the CEO,

19   chairman, major stockholder and a -- the prime mover in

20   the case that gave rise to liability in this case,

21   decided to unseat Justice McGraw, who he thought would

22   be unfavorable to him, and elect Justice Benjamin, who

23   he thought would be favorable to him.

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    What if, instead of

25   having the focus on one, we're dealing with a trade

 1   group that's making the donation.                Ten companies form a

 2   trade group.   Is the judge recused in the case of every

 3   one of those companies?

 4              MR. OLSON:        I think that -- I think the

 5   answer probably is not, Chief Justice Roberts, but this

 6   is, like your cases involving reasonable search and

 7   seizure, it's going to require an analysis of the

 8   complex of circumstances.

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, let's just

10   take this case, the same amount of money, except it's

11   not from an individual, not from that individual's

12   company, but from ten different ones, and divide it up

13   by ten.

14              MR. OLSON:        I think the Court would -- a

15   reasonable objective observer knowing all of the facts

16   would not feel that that -- that trade group was not a

17   party to the case, who is not personally involved in

18   having a personal stake in the election or the outcome

19   of that particular case, but may be interested in a

20   panoply of cases or judges that approach things in a

21   certain way; that would not give rise to what you're

22   concerned about here.

23              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, okay.   Now,

24   I'm sure you know where I'm going next.                 What if it's

25   five companies in the trade group?                 When do you decide

 1   that there's a probability?            I take it if there are two

 2   companies, under your theory there would be a

 3   probability of bias?

 4               MR. OLSON:       If those are the companies that

 5   are a party to the case, if it's when their case is

 6   pending, if it's a vast magnitude -- the magnitude --

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, can I stop you

 8   right there, "When their case is pending."                 The Massey

 9   Company has a lot of cases pending, so is it only those

10   cases that were pending on the day of the election?

11               MR. OLSON:       No, I think that that --

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, then we

13   shouldn't talk about pending cases.

14               MR. OLSON:       Well, no.           I think that that is

15   -- I answered your question whether it's only those

16   cases.   That is a part of the circumstances that would

17   give rise -- you have decided, this Court has decided

18   that the possibility that a $12 benefit, the Tumey case,

19   might ultimately come to the judge is a disqualifying

20   interest.   You've decided in the Monroeville case that

21   because the adjudicator was the mayor of a town who

22   might receive some fines --

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, but that's the

24   whole distinction that your friend on the other side

25   makes.   Those cases involve financial interest and the

 1   recusal rules are, you know, if you have one share of

 2   AT&T stock and it's in AT&T, you have to recuse.                 But

 3   this is different.      This is a probability of bias, not

 4   financial interest.

 5                 MR. OLSON:       Well, I would submit that your

 6   cases say that when the judge has an interest in the

 7   case and that interest leads to the likelihood of --

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            No, they don't say that.

 9                 MR. OLSON:       Yes.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            There are only two

11   categories of cases, only two categories.                 One -- one is

12   where the judge is almost the aggrieved party in

13   conducting contempt proceedings against someone who is

14   contemptuous of that very judge, and the other one is

15   cases where the judges have a financial interest.

16   That's far from this broad category of whenever there is

17   a possibility of bias.

18                 I was appointed to the bench by Ronald

19   Reagan.    Should I be any -- should I have been any less

20   grateful to Ronald Reagan than -- than the judge here

21   was grateful to the person who spent a lot of money in

22   his election?

23                 MR. OLSON:       Well, let me -- let me answer

24   that.     There's more parts, there's more than one part to

25   that question.     Let me answer the first part first.              The

 1   Court hasn't said that there are only two categories of

 2   disqualifying bias.      I submit the Court has said that

 3   it's an interest in the outcome.                That interest in the

 4   outcome might be financial --

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Two categories are the only

 6   categories in which it has applied that.

 7              MR. OLSON:         I respectfully submit, Justice

 8   Scalia, that in the Monroeville case the judge didn't

 9   have a personal financial interest.                      He had what the

10   Court called a partisan interest because the money that

11   might have been assessed in the way of fines might have

12   come to the city.    In the Lavoie case, the judge didn't

13   have a direct financial interest.                 He had an indirect

14   potential financial interest.              In the Johnson v.

15   Mississippi case, the judge had been named in an

16   institutional suit about racial bias and whether juries

17   should be -- those -- there's a panoply of

18   circumstances, all of which add up, Justice Scalia, I

19   submit, to a situation where a judge is -- a reasonable

20   person would suspect that the judge would have a hard

21   time, in the words of this Court, "holding the balance

22   nice, clear, and true."

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Nice, clear, and true.             Are

 1                 MR. OLSON:      And I was going to --

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           And he had a lot of, a lot

 3   of issues coming before me while his presidency

 4   continued.

 5                 MR. OLSON:      In the first place, there is a

 6   -- there is a significant difference with respect to the

 7   framers of the Constitution who gave the members of this

 8   Court and the Federal Judiciary life tenure for the very

 9   purpose of ensuring the independence of the judiciary.

10   There is a separate consideration that this Court has

11   mentioned because of the fact that judges and justices

12   of this Court cannot be replaced if they feel that they

13   must recuse themselves.         There is -- another interest is

14   institutionally presidents appointing justices all of

15   the time for a variety of reasons, but not to attempt to

16   affect the outcome in their case.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What about the

18   United Mine Workers.       If they give a contribution to

19   somebody's campaign, is that judge then recused in every

20   labor case?    Or I don't know if they give contributions

21   or not, but a group like Mothers Against Drunk Driving,

22   because they think the other judge is too lenient in DWI

23   cases, so they give contributions.                  Is their preferred

24   judge recused in every DWI case?

25                 MR. OLSON:      No, Chief Justice Roberts.

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Or are those all

 2   factors and circumstances we have to look at?

 3              MR. OLSON:       Well, of course they're factors

 4   and circumstances, but the -- when -- when an individual

 5   or a group of individuals makes contributions in the

 6   context of elections -- and we are going to have State

 7   elections of -- of judges.         We have them in 40 -- 39

 8   States, and there's no sign that those are going to be

 9   discontinued any time soon.

10              But when a group of individuals or an

11   individual is -- is making contributions because they

12   think the jurist is going to be sensitive to -- to the

13   rights of criminals or sensitive to the rights of

14   victims of criminals, those are generic concerns that

15   people participating in the electoral process --

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, also, if there

17   is a big -- a big United Mine Workers case, or not even

18   United Mine Workers, involving particular union members,

19   and the UMW gives large contributions to a judge, that

20   -- that judge is recused?

21              MR. OLSON:       I can't -- I can't rule out a

22   situation where there is a potential litigant who has a

23   stake in front of a case.         The amounts here have to be

24   taken into consideration, too.

25              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, then, my -- my

 1   question in this case is this:               In your petition for

 2   certiorari you said that, well, by the time you came

 3   here you would have a standard for us that we can work

 4   with.   You know, all of us know, that a ruling in your

 5   favor means that law and motion practice will -- could

 6   -- could change drastically in States all across the

 7   country.   Disqualification for bias will now become a --

 8   a part of the pretrial process, and I'm asking you what

 9   your standard is.

10               Your standard is an unacceptable risk of

11   impropriety or perception of bias, but I -- I need some

12   more specific standards within which to fit this case.

13   You give a general standard, and then we hear about the

14   amount of the contribution.             We hear about the fact that

15   it was a contested election, et cetera.

16               MR. OLSON:        It would be --

17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But your -- your standard

18   of -- of impropriety doesn't, it seems to me, give

19   sufficient -- or "unacceptable risk of bias" doesn't

20   give sufficient guidance to the courts to implement this

21   rule unless it's just -- it's just going to be one case.

22   Now, I know the law evolves on a case-by-case system.                I

23   understand that, but it doesn't seem to me that the

24   standard you offer us is specific enough.

25               MR. OLSON:        Well, there are several answers


                                        15

 1   to that.     In the first place, the Conference of Chief

 2   Justices of all of the States of the United States filed

 3   a brief in this case and said that we need a standard

 4   with respect to recusals for extraordinary campaign

 5   contributions in cases.          They also said that --

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Was their standard the same

 7   as yours?     I mean, that's frankly one of the problems in

 8   this case.     The various amici and -- and you come up

 9   with, you know, a wide divergence of standards.              And all

10   of them say:    By the way, these seven factors or five

11   factors or six factors, whatever they say, are not

12   exhaustive; There may be others as well.

13                 MR. OLSON:       That's --

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Right?

15                 MR. OLSON:       That's because, Justice Scalia,

16   the -- the jurisprudence of this Court in connection

17   with standards like due process or probable cause or

18   speedy trial or equal protection can't be nailed down

19   with levels of specificity.              It would be very inviting

20   --

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I want you to articulate

22   some substandards that have -- that are general in

23   nature, that apply to this case, substandards that are

24   more specific than the probability of bias.

25                 MR. OLSON:       Well, I -- I -- the reason we --

 1   we approached it from that standpoint, Justice Kennedy,

 2   is the probability of bias is something that this Court

 3   has said repeatedly.        But let me answer your question

 4   this way:     When the circumstances, including the timing

 5   of the contribution, the magnitude and proportion of the

 6   contribution, are such that it would lead a reasonable

 7   person in possession of all of the facts -- these are

 8   all words from these courts' decisions -- to believe

 9   that the judge would have a difficult time being other

10   than biased in favor of one of the parties, that would

11   be the standard that would be applied.                    It's a general

12   standard, but --

13                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             To what --

14                 MR. OLSON:       -- the Conference of Chief

15   Justices --

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             To what extent do you

17   rely on -- and this is a very unusual situation -- that

18   you have a defendant in the ongoing litigation who is in

19   fact a prime culprit from the point of view of the

20   plaintiff?     That is, Blankenship, who made all these

21   contributions, is charged with driving Caperton out of

22   business.    So he is not simply the CEO of the company

23   that's named as the defendant, but he is targeted as the

24   perpetrator.     So that's an -- an additional factor.

25                 Is that just one of a laundry list, or is


                                         17

 1   that central to your view that there is really an

 2   appearance of impropriety here?

 3              MR. OLSON:       It is very much central, but

 4   it's not exclusively central.            If the -- and -- and that

 5   is absolutely correct, Justice Ginsburg.                On pages 63

 6   through 65a of the joint appendix, for example, are the

 7   specific post-trial motion findings of the judge saying

 8   that the prime mover in the -- in the conduct that was

 9   declared to be fraudulent and a deliberate effort to

10   drive this company out of business was Mr. Blankenship.

11   So factually that's correct.

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel --

13              MR. OLSON:       That is a central factor.           If he

14   had given one dollar --

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:            But not the only central

16   factor.

17              MR. OLSON:       It's not --

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:            You said it's one central

19   factor.

20              MR. OLSON:       Well, that's --

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:            You really have no test

22   other than probability of bias.             We can't -- we can't

23   run a system on -- on such a vague standard.

24              MR. OLSON:       I submit, Justice Scalia, you're

25   going to have to wipe out a lot of jurisprudence from

 1   this Court that uses terms like "appearance of bias,"

 2   "likelihood of bias."

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Not -- not for situations

 4   that have such an infinite variety as -- as the

 5   appointment of judges and the election of judges and --

 6   and as funding your opponent or -- or declining to fund

 7   or joining some agglomeration of -- of other

 8   institutions that fund.

 9              The -- the variety is immense, and you give

10   us nothing to hang onto except, you know, case by case

11   we're going to have to decide whether there's a

12   probability of bias.

13              MR. OLSON:       Well, it would be -- it would be

14   -- I would be delighted to say that the standard was 50

15   percent of the contributions in an election, and we

16   would come along in a case where there would be a very

17   small amount of money, and someone -- that -- that all

18   of those situations are distinguishable.

19              I admit this is not easy, but the Conference

20   of Chief Justices specifically said, to get back to

21   Justice Kennedy's question, what did they propose and

22   are they proposing something comparable to us?               They are

23   -- they are -- and this is on page 4 of the Conference

24   of Chief Justices' brief.         They are the judges who would

25   have to live with this decision.              They said:   (A), we

 1   need it, extraordinary, out of line campaign support

 2   from a source that has a substantial stake in the

 3   outcome of the proceedings where those extreme facts

 4   create a probability of actual bias.

 5                 And then they go on to say, to answer the

 6   floodgate problem that my opponent raises -- this is

 7   going to open the floodgates, and you will have nothing

 8   but recusal motions.        They explicitly state that concern

 9   is not -- is unfounded.          No bright line rule can or

10   should be attempted.        These are the judges --

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Don't you think it would be

12   easier to solve the problem, as some States have done,

13   not by having this -- this raffle for -- for whatever

14   judge gets -- gets stricken from the case or not, but

15   simply limiting the amount of contributions that can be

16   made?     Isn't -- isn't that a much more sensible

17   solution?

18                 MR. OLSON:       Well, the States are perfectly

19   free to do that.     But let me --

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            And some of them are doing

21   that.

22                 MR. OLSON:       Let me make this point, Justice

23   Scalia.     The contribution limit in West Virginia is

24   $1,000.     Mr. Blankenship contributed $1,000, and then he

25   put up three million additional dollars, three thousand

 1   --

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Are the States --

 3   are the States really free to do that?                       We have

 4   recognized First Amendment interests in participating in

 5   the electoral process before.               I mean, would your

 6   approach constitutionalize McCain-Feingold at a State

 7   level?

 8              MR. OLSON:          I -- I think that this Court's

 9   -- this Court's campaign finance jurisprudence

10   acknowledges the appropriateness of campaign

11   contribution limits, the very point that Justice Scalia

12   just made, and other limits.              And in -- and, in fact,

13   States have limits against corporate contributions,

14   limits against union contributions.                       I think the United

15   Mine Workers incident came up.

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, this -- this

17   --

18              MR. OLSON:          But -- but the -- and -- and the

19   States do have limitations with respect to what

20   litigants can do.

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:               All right.           Mr. Olson, the

22   very fact that they do raises what I think is one of the

23   difficult issues in this case, and it's raised by --

24   specifically by the -- the brief of the nine States,

25   Alabama and so on.      And -- and I would put it this way.

 1   It's not exactly the way that brief did, but I see the

 2   problem that you are -- that you are addressing as -- as

 3   not only a procedural, but certainly to a degree a

 4   substantive due process kind of problem.

 5               One of the factors that goes into the

 6   recognition of at least a substantive limitation when

 7   there has been none before is -- is the issue of timing.

 8   Is the political process in fact working now toward a

 9   solution?   Because if it is, that kind of ethos of total

10   unreasonability is -- is still being worked out, and --

11   and the courts ought to stay their hands.                  So my

12   question is, what do you say to the argument that there

13   is a political process going on addressing this issue?

14   And I forget the details, but my recollection is that it

15   may well have been that brief pointed out that the State

16   of West Virginia itself has enacted some legislation

17   since these events began to transpire.

18               So the nut of the question is, is

19   the political process in process and is that a good

20   reason for us to stay our hand in recognizing a new

21   procedural or substantive due process right at this

22   point?

23               MR. OLSON:       I think there are -- there are

24   more than one answer to that question.                  One, the

25   political process to which you refer is spiraling out of

 1   control.     There is a financial arms race in judicial

 2   elections in various States throughout the country, and

 3   the briefs --

 4                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Oh, I think we all

 5   recognize that.     Is there -- is there a

 6   counter-political process going on?

 7                 MR. OLSON:       It hasn't done the job so far,

 8   and the trend seems to be in the opposite direction, but

 9   even if it --

10                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            What happened in West

11   Virginia?

12                 MR. OLSON:       Pardon me?

13                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Is my recollection correct

14   that West Virginia has, in fact, enacted some kind of

15   limiting legislation?

16                 MR. OLSON:       I believe that is correct, but I

17   don't think that would have addressed the problem in

18   this case.

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I thought they closed the

20   527 loophole that allowed him to contribute so much

21   above the individual limit.

22                 MR. OLSON:       Irrespective of that, I was

23   going to go on and answer this in response to Justice

24   Souter's question.      The Conference of Chief Justices, I

25   think, provide a second answer to that question.                 They

 1   are the ones where the rubber meets the road, so to

 2   speak.     They are saying, and the entire conference is

 3   saying, we need some guidance here with respect to a

 4   constitutional limit --

 5                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, they propose a

 6   seven-factor test, and all of the other amici, who know

 7   a lot about this subject, propose multifactor tests.

 8   Public Citizen has ten factors, the ABA has four

 9   factors.     In an effort to see if this can be put in more

10   concrete terms, I wonder if you would be willing to say

11   categorically that your -- the holding that you're

12   proposing would not apply under any of these situations:

13   Where the judges are appointed, where there are massive

14   contributions and a hotly contested election, but the

15   issue is not an economic issue, it's a social issue;

16   where there isn't any specific issue headed for the

17   court but there are massive contributions by, let's say,

18   the plaintiffs' bar and the defense bar?                  Could you say

19   categorically in any of those situations that your rule

20   would not apply?

21                 MR. OLSON:       I would hesitate -- I would

22   hesitate to do so, Justice Alito.                  I think you've put

23   your finger on some of the circumstances that would take

24   it out of the context of the appearance of justice for

 1              I'm going to reserve, if I may, the balance

 2   of my time, but finish with a reference to the principle

 3   that we're articulating here is not new to the

 4   jurisprudence of the western world and the legal

 5   jurisprudence that we come from.                In the Magna Carta the

 6   king promised:   "To no one will we sell justice."                   And

 7   Blackstone repeated that and restated it and stated:

 8   "For injury done to every subject, he may take his

 9   remedy by the course of law and have justice freely

10   without sale."

11              This circumstance in this case involves the

12   appearance of judges being bought.                  Now, we're not

13   saying that there's actual bias because there's actual

14   -- as this Court has repeatedly said, that's impossible

15   to prove, and that's why the appearance of probability

16   of bias is so important to the respect that we need to

17   have for the judicial system.

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

19              Mr. Frey.

20             ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY

21              ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

22              MR. FREY:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

23   please the Court:

24              First of all, just on the West Virginia

25   statutory amendment, they did, as Justice Scalia


                                        25

 1   suggested, close the 527 loophole and limit

 2   contributions by individuals to 527 groups to $1,000

 3   after the 2004 election in response to the concern about

 4   the amount of money that was being spent through 527

 5   groups in that election.          So I think this is a situation

 6   where the States are dealing with it legislatively and,

 7   and as I hope to get to in a minute or two, the Court

 8   has recognized that this is -- repeatedly recognized

 9   that this is something that is meant to be dealt with

10   through legislative or canons of judicial ethics or

11   codes.

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            How is it -- is it --

13   this Court's decision in the Republican Party of

14   Minnesota said that judges could say anything, just as a

15   legislator.    Are you extending that notion that an

16   election is an election to this area of the appearance

17   of impropriety?    I mean, is it your position that the

18   judge is elected just like a legislator is elected, and

19   legislators all the time are beholden to interest

20   groups?

21                 MR. FREY:     Well, of course I don't agree

22   that Justice Benjamin was in the least beholden to

23   anybody in this case.       But the Republican Party case was

24   a case about the First Amendment right of candidates in

25   an election to speak their position on issues.             I'm not


                                        26

 1   sure that I follow what this has to do with this case.

 2   But I will say that this is not a case about

 3   appearances.   The petition was about appearances.

 4   They've -- the other side has withdrawn or it has

 5   abandoned an appearance argument, and with good reason

 6   because the Due Process Clause --

 7                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Mr. Frey, is it your

 8   position that the appearance of impropriety could never

 9   be strong enough to raise a constitutional issue?

10                MR. FREY:     Well, we might have appearance of

11   impropriety overlapping with conditions that would

12   justify --

13                JUSTICE STEVENS:           I'm assuming appearances

14   only.   Are you saying that appearances without any

15   actual proof of bias could never be sufficient as a

16   constitutional matter?

17                MR. FREY:     I think we are.

18                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Is that your position?

19                MR. FREY:     We are saying that the Due

20   Process Clause does not exist to protect the integrity

21   or reputation of the State judicial systems.

22                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Why --

23                JUSTICE STEVENS:           That's not an answer to my

24   question.

25                MR. FREY:     Well, I thought I said --

 1              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Supposing, for example,

 2   the judge had campaigned on the ground that he would

 3   issue favorable rulings to the United Mine Workers, and

 4   the United Mine Workers campaigned, raising money

 5   saying, we want to get a judge who will rule in our

 6   favor in all the cases we're interested in.            Would that

 7   create an appearance of impropriety?

 8              MR. FREY:      Well --

 9              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Or take another example.

10   The Chief Justice asked what if there are ten members of

11   a trade association and would all -- and they all

12   contributed to get a judge to vote in their favor in a

13   case that involved a conspiracy charge among the --

14   charged the ten of them for violations of the Sherman

15   Act, something like that.         And if all ten of them raise

16   money publicly for the very purpose of getting a judge

17   who would rule favorably in their favor, that would

18   clearly create a very extreme appearance of impropriety.

19   Would that be sufficient, in your judgment, to raise a

20   constitutional issue?

21              MR. FREY:      If you were -- if -- if you

22   thought there was no basis for believing there was

23   actual bias, but it looked bad --

24              JUSTICE STEVENS:            No, it would meet the test

25   in the -- in the judges' brief of an average judge would


                                      28

 1   be tempted under the circumstances.                     That's the test

 2   that the Conference of Chief Justices judges --

 3              MR. FREY:       That I don't --

 4              JUSTICE STEVENS:             And do you think that

 5   could ever, just appearance, could ever raise a due

 6   process issue?

 7              MR. FREY:       No, I don't think just appearance

 8   could ever raise a due process issue.

 9              JUSTICE STEVENS:             No matter how extreme the

10   facts?

11              MR. FREY:       The question is whether there is

12   actual bias of a kind that is recognized as

13   disqualifying.   The Court has recognized --

14              JUSTICE STEVENS:             The whole point of this

15   case is it has not been recognized.                     We have never

16   confronted a case as extreme as this before.                     This fits

17   the standard that Potter Stewart articulated when he

18   said "I know it when I see it."

19              (Laughter.)

20              MR. FREY:       I would take exception to the

21   characterization of this case.

22              JUSTICE SCALIA:             I don't think we adopted

23   his principle, did we, in the obscenity area?

24              JUSTICE STEVENS:             The question is not

25   whether we have, but whether we should.

 1               MR. FREY:        I hope to address that question.

 2   Let me start off by pointing out, as Justice Benjamin

 3   said in his opinion on discussing the recusal issue, his

 4   July opinion, which I commend to the Court, he is being

 5   asked to recuse on the basis of activities of a third

 6   party over which he had no control, in a case whose

 7   disposition offers him no current or future personal

 8   benefit, and where he has no personal connection with

 9   the parties or their counsel, has expressed no opinion

10   about any of them.      He has done nothing that would call

11   into question his objectivity, his impartiality.

12               I think that's a very important point.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               What about the view that

14   Benjamin should not be the judge of his own cause?

15   Wasn't -- wasn't it -- it was either Massey, the

16   company, or Blankenship that brought a 1983 action

17   insisting on that very point, that in recusal matter --

18   -

19               MR. FREY:        Well, that --

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               -- it wasn't -- well,

21   maybe you can tell me what that 1983 suit was.               It was a

22   charge --

23               MR. FREY:        Yes, it challenged the procedure.

24   That's not an issue that's before the Court here, and

25   our -- our position today is that this Court has


                                         30
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   consistently allowed recusal matters to be decided by a

 2   -- the single justice who is challenged.                I don't think

 3   the Court thinks it's unconstitutional to do that.

 4                I understand the -- the concerns about

 5   having the judge making the decision about whether

 6   recusal is required, but that is not the practice of

 7   this Court, and if it's not the practice of this Court I

 8   frankly doubt it's unconstitutional.

 9                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But it was the position

10   that Blankenship took?

11                MR. FREY:     Well, it was -- no, not

12   Blankenship.   Massey.

13                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, it may not be per se

14   unconstitutional, but it is certainly one contributing

15   factor, it seems to me, to the argument that the system

16   that we have depended on up to this point is not working

17   very well.

18                MR. FREY:     Well, I don't think -- I don't

19   think the system -- I don't -- I don't agree that the

20   system is not working well.            I mean, of course there are

21   adjustments --

22                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, I -- as I understand

23   it, although you never directly, I don't think you ever

24   directly answered it, I -- I understood you to imply in

25   response to Justice Stevens that there would be no

 1   appearance problem that would ever justify a

 2   constitutional standard.

 3               MR. FREY:       Yes, but --

 4               JUSTICE SOUTER:            And in fact --

 5               MR. FREY:       -- but appearances, but

 6   appearances -- I don't mean to interrupt you.                If I'm --

 7   sorry.

 8               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Go ahead.

 9               MR. FREY:       Appearance is a standard for

10   recusal, a nonconstitutional statutory standard for

11   recusal in virtually every State, so we already have --

12   and in the Federal system, so --

13               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes.      And we have -- and we

14   have an appearance standard under the ABA Canons, but I

15   think it would be difficult to make a very convincing

16   argument that that standard was effective in this case.

17               MR. FREY:       Well, that -- that's a matter of

18   opinion.   I -- I --

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, it's -- it's the

20   matter of opinion that brings the case before us.                And

21   would you agree -- I am not -- I am not asking you to

22   agree that the ABA standard was violated.                That's not

23   what you're here for.       But would you agree that the ABA

24   standard is certainly implicated by the facts of this

25   case, whatever the ultimate recusal decision should have

 1   been?

 2                MR. FREY:       I think I would agree that

 3   reasonable people could have a different view one way or

 4   the other about whether there is an appearance of

 5   impropriety for Justice Benjamin sitting.                   I would agree

 6   with that.     I don't think I would go further than that

 7   because my personal view is that there was no

 8   impropriety, that it was reasonable, and if you read his

 9   opinion I think you'll see a -- a fair, balanced,

10   thoughtful statement of the reasons why he feels he

11   could sit.

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I want you to be able to

13   elaborate your full theory of the case, but just so you

14   know, it -- it does seem to me that the appearance

15   standard has -- has much to recommend it.                   In part it

16   means that you don't have to inquire into the actual

17   bias; it's -- it's more objective.                   Now, of course it

18   has to be controlled, it has to be precise.                   But I just

19   thought that you know that I -- I do have that

20   inclination.

21                MR. FREY:       But -- but we're here on the

22   question of constitutional requirements and the

23   Constitution --

24                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And we're asking -- we're

25   asking what substance we can give to the constitutional

 1   protection.

 2                 MR. FREY:     Well, what you're really asking

 3   is whether you should abandon what is a fairly clearly

 4   stated rule and practice of this Court, dating back to

 5   the common law, that questions of bias in general as

 6   opposed to interest are matters for legislative

 7   resolution and not for -- not for constitutional --

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Of course the appearance

 9   standard is -- is wonderfully ratchetable.               Once it is

10   clearly established that a certain -- certain set of

11   facts creates the appearance of impropriety, that is

12   solidly established, then the set of facts right next to

13   that suddenly acquires the appearance of impropriety

14   because it's so -- it's so close to what is obviously

15   improper.   And -- and so we go down and down and down.

16   And I -- I personally don't favor a constitutional rule

17   that is a sliding scale like that.

18                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Of course, you can stop at

19   what is obviously improper.

20                 MR. FREY:     I don't -- I think, first of all,

21   the Petitioner has not advanced on the merits in this

22   case an appearance standard.             A lot of the --

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Would you please clarify

24   that?   Because I was taking appearance, likelihood,

25   probability as all synonyms, and I think of Justice

 1   Marshall's decision in Peters and Kiff, involving a

 2   grand jury, and he said that due process is denied in

 3   circumstances creating the likelihood or the appearance

 4   of bias.   And there are other decisions, too, that use

 5   those terms interchangeably.              So I don't know that

 6   probability of bias, likelihood of bias, appearance --

 7   that -- those seem to me synonyms.

 8               MR. FREY:        All right.            Well, if you're

 9   viewing them as cinnamons -- synonyms, then the question

10   is whether that kind of standard is a -- is the

11   constitutional standard; and let me say about the Tumey

12   case which -- the "possible temptation" language in the

13   Tumey case, which is of course a wide open standard:

14   That was discussed only after the Court said questions

15   of bias are not constitutional, they're for the

16   legislature; questions of interest, pecuniary interest

17   in the Tumey case, are.          And then the language that Mr.

18   Olson quoted came in the discussion of the question of

19   whether the pecuniary interest was substantial enough to

20   create a disqualification, constitutional

21   disqualification.

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I -- I think you're quite

23   right in the way you describe Tumey, but I wonder why is

24   that the reason -- why is appearance never

25   constitutional?     Why should that be?                   Can you talk about


                                         35

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that?

 2               MR. FREY:      Because it seems to me to be --

 3   if we're talking about appearance as distinct from

 4   actual bias or probable -- you know, I can understand a

 5   rule that says the probability of bias is enough.               I

 6   think it would be a very ill-advised rule without

 7   historical foundation, without foundation in the Court's

 8   precedents, and open-ended and creating all kinds of

 9   problems; but I can understand that rule.               That at least

10   is addressed to the right of the party to get a fair

11   trial.

12               Appearance is addressed to a different

13   thing.   It's addressed to the reputation of the judicial

14   system, which is not, I think, the function of the Due

15   Process Clause to address.

16               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Why not?

17               MR. FREY:      Because I think the Due Process

18   Clause is concerned with the fairness of the --

19               JUSTICE STEVENS:            You don't think the

20   community's confidence in the way judges behave is an

21   important part of due process?

22               MR. FREY:      No, I think it's -- it may be a

23   systemically important value.             But I think as long as

24   the judge is impartial in the -- in the case at hand, I

25   don't think there's a problem.

 1               JUSTICE SOUTER:            But --

 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But our whole system is

 3   designed to ensure confidence in our judgments.

 4               MR. FREY:      Well, I don't -- I think this is

 5   a side point.

 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And it seems -- it seems

 7   to me litigants have an entitlement to that under the

 8   Due Process Clause.

 9               MR. FREY:      Well, I don't think so, but I

10   don't think it -- I don't think it really essentially

11   matters.   We're -- we're dealing with a semantical

12   quibble here, where the real question is, is possibility

13   of bias, a temptation of bias, a subconscious effect

14   that -- even a probability of bias, whatever -- there's

15   a lot of different standards that have been put

16   forward -- is that a constitutional basis for

17   disqualifying a judge, A?          B, if it is sometimes a

18   constitutional basis for disqualifying a judge, is it a

19   basis under the debt of gratitude theory?               And, C, if

20   the debt of gratitude theory is a viable theory -- for

21   reasons I hope to have a minute or two to address, I

22   think it's not viable -- does it apply on the

23   circumstances of this case?

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             May I ask you -- I mean,

25   there were a few recusal motions in this case.               Judge, I

 1   think it was Matthew, moved to disqualify Judge

 2   Starcher, and Justice Starcher did indeed recuse

 3   himself.   He had spoken out against what went on here.

 4   If he had refused to recuse after speaking out as he

 5   did, would that be compatible with due process, the due

 6   process owed to the Massey Company?

 7               MR. FREY:      That would raise an interesting

 8   question and I think a much closer question than this

 9   case, because that would involve the question of whether

10   -- there is --   the Court has recognized that where a

11   judge is embroiled with a litigant, and has a personal

12   animosity arising out of the relationship with the

13   litigant, that is a -- that is possible ground for

14   recusal.   So it's a -- it's a stronger case.             I'm not

15   sure it's strong enough.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought the animosity

17   was directed at Judge Benjamin?

18               MR. FREY:      No, no.          The animosity is

19   directed at Massey and Mr. Blankenship, who were --

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So you think the

21   Constitution might have been violated if Starcher -- you

22   think due process might have been violated if that judge

23   had remained on the bench?

24               MR. FREY:      I think it's a closer case.          I'm

25   not prepared to say that it would have been violated

 1   even then.

 2                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Mr. Frey, you've tried a

 3   couple of times to -- to get to your -- your point that,

 4   even if we assume probability of bias is the standard,

 5   the debt of gratitude would not qualify.                 I'll be candid

 6   with -- to say that I don't see why probability of bias

 7   is necessarily an inappropriate constitutional standard,

 8   whether we should adopt it or not.                 But would you give

 9   your argument on why the debt of gratitude could not

10   qualify?

11                MR. FREY:     Of course.            I'd be happy to.

12                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Because that may illustrate

13   the point.

14                MR. FREY:     Let me say just one point about

15   probability of bias, which is conceptually -- the rule

16   is quite clear at common law, as the Court knows, that

17   that was not a ground for disqualification of a judge.

18   Now --

19                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, but I don't know what

20   common law -- how much help common law is.                Common law

21   didn't have elected judges.

22                MR. FREY:     No, but it had --

23                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Common law did not have

24   this contribution system, which your colleague referred

25   to as spiraling out of control.

 1                MR. FREY:      That's the point I wanted to

 2   make, that while common law did not have elected judges,

 3   it had the issue of bias.           After all, elected judges are

 4   not really the issue here.           The issue is not whether

 5   judges should be elected; the issue is whether --

 6   whether there should be disqualification for bias.                 That

 7   is an issue that the common law confronted.              This is not

 8   like some novel situation that has arisen that the

 9   common law didn't deal with.

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             We don't deal with an

11   abstract setting.    We have the setting of elections, of

12   elections of judges and millions of dollars spent on

13   them.   That's the context in which this case arises.

14                MR. FREY:      Yes, I understand, and the

15   question is whether that -- that gives rise to bias.                So

16   let's -- let's turn -- let's turn to the question of

17   whether the debt of gratitude theory, which I take it is

18   the principle that would underlie disqualification in

19   the election context --

20                JUSTICE SOUTER:            I don't take it as the

21   principle, but I take it as an application of the

22   principle.   And I thought if you get to responding to

23   the application, I may understand your position better

24   on the principle.

25                MR. FREY:      Debt of gratitude I think is a

 1   principle.   You have to ask yourself what is the reason

 2   why somebody would conclude -- why a court would

 3   conclude that Justice Benjamin is -- is not biased.

 4                And let me say that one of the key elements

 5   which is not mentioned by the other side which is very

 6   important is the presumption of impartiality.                It goes

 7   back to Coke and Blackstone.             Judges are clothed with a

 8   presumption of impartiality.             There has to be something

 9   that overcomes that presumption.                And let me say that, I

10   ask the Court to ask yourselves if you were in Justice

11   Benjamin's situation, do you really think you would be

12   incapable of rendering an impartial decision in a case

13   involving Massey?    Because if the answer to that is no,

14   if the answer to that is you would not be incapable of

15   rendering an unbiased decision, then there's no

16   justification for saying that Justice Benjamin would --

17                JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask you on your

18   challenge to the probability of bias as a standard.               Do

19   you think it's an unworkable standard or that even if

20   there is a probability of bias, that should not be

21   constitutionally disqualified?

22                MR. FREY:      I think it's an unworkable

23   standard, and -- and I ask the Court to look at --

24                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Why is it any more

25   unworkable than probable cause in a Fourth Amendment

 1   case?

 2               MR. FREY:        Well, the Fourth Amendment has

 3   reasonableness as a standard, and reasonableness is a --

 4               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Well, it has probable

 5   cause as a standard.

 6               MR. FREY:        If there was a standard that said

 7   judges should recuse themselves when it would be

 8   reasonable to suppose that there was bias, if the

 9   Constitution said that, we wouldn't be here today or we

10   would be here arguing about whether --

11               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Let me get back to the

12   question.   Why is probability in this context any more

13   difficult to figure out than probability in the Fourth

14   Amendment context?

15               MR. FREY:        I'm not --

16               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Or is it?

17               MR. FREY:        I'm not sure of the answer to

18   that.   What I am sure is that if you start down the road

19   of debt of gratitude, which I think is the animating

20   principle if there is going to be a probability of bias.

21               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Well, I'm not -- I'm not

22   asking you about debt of gratitude.                       I'm asking you why

23   isn't the probability standard perfectly administerable,

24   just as it is in the Fourth Amendment?                      And surely you

25   would agree --

 1               MR. FREY:      Well, you could --

 2               JUSTICE STEVENS: --             that if there is a

 3   probability of bias, he ought to get out.

 4               MR. FREY:      You could certainly have a series

 5   of cases in which you would -- which you would decide

 6   and provide standards.       I think that could be done.

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:           We have no choice with

 8   regard to the reasonableness standard.                 We -- it's not a

 9   standard we made up.

10               MR. FREY:      It's in the Constitution.

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- as we would have been

12   making up this one.     It's there in the Constitution.

13               MR. FREY:      Yes.

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:           We have to make the most of

15   it, do the best we can do with it.                 But here we're being

16   urged to adopt out of nowhere a new standard of

17   probability of bias.      That's not in the Constitution,

18   and it's perfectly valid to ask, is that a sensible

19   standard?

20               MR. FREY:      Well, I don't think it's a

21   sensible standard, and as --

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Are you going to finally

23   get to discussing the debt of gratitude point?

24               MR. FREY:      Yes.       That's -- yes.

 1   waiting.

 2                 (Laughter.)

 3                 MR. FREY:      I've been trying to get to it,

 4   but I was answering Justice Stevens's question.

 5                 The problem with debt of gratitude is that

 6   it's not a principle with any reasonable limit.                        If you

 7   apply it here, if you say there's a debt of gratitude

 8   here, then you have the question about all the other

 9   circumstances.     The plaintiffs' lawyers gave a million

10   and a half dollars to Justice McGraw to support his

11   reelection.     Suppose he had won?              What do you do?        It's

12   true that no one individual gave a lot of money, but

13   it's -- if you're looking at it in terms of what is the

14   probability of bias, it's at least as great, if not

15   greater than here.      The doctors gave $750,000 to

16   Benjamin.

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:            But that isn't the only

18   theory.     That is, in my own mind -- I don't know if you

19   want to call it "probability" or "possibility," you

20   don't manacle a defendant in a courtroom even though

21   this jury may not have been affected.                     I read the

22   opinion Justice Benjamin wrote, it was a very good

23   opinion.     I sympathized with his problem.                  Okay?    So I'm

24   not talking about him.         I'm talking about we don't

25   manacle defendants because many jurors, maybe not this

 1   one, would have been adding affected, and that seems the

 2   problem here.

 3                 The debt of gratitude I think, no, that

 4   isn't the theory that underlies it, though it may in

 5   part.     It's that you have here the largest amount by a

 6   factor, an order of magnitude perhaps, I mean hugely

 7   greater than any other contribution given to a judge by

 8   a single person.     It doesn't just affect the fast

 9   through gratitude.      A normal human being also thinks, if

10   I play my cards right, maybe it will be repeated, and

11   they'll want to keep me in office.                   And we have the fact

12   of how it looks, and we don't have a situation where the

13   something like this is inevitable, where you appoint

14   judges.    It's inevitable that there will be an

15   appointment.    I mean, hey, but that isn't true of

16   sitting on this kind of case.

17                 So we have all those things that make it

18   extreme.    So what is the problem?                If we say there is an

19   envelope that the Due Process Clause doesn't touch, and

20   that envelope is greater, and we touch less, if the

21   States are regulating it themselves.                      Where they're not

22   -- and this is way outside the envelope -- at that point

23   the Due Process Clause comes into play.                      Now, end of

24   opinion.    Now, what terrible mess will the Court get

25   into if they write just that?

 1               MR. FREY:      Well, if you have a -- you have

 2   to have a logical principle.            I'm sorry, I --

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:            A logical principle or, I

 4   thought, if I was mentioning all those things that might

 5   lead a judge in the future, because of the size, in the

 6   past, because of the size, in the fact that it's a

 7   single individual, in the fact that there's a case

 8   coming up that's likely that the judge will decide --

 9   all those things that are listed by the chief justices

10   in their brief, all those things together make it a

11   serious risk that there will be bias, even though an

12   individual might not be.         There is a serious risk.

13               Call it a "probability"; call it an

14   "appearance."   Use the language that you want, but put

15   them together, and they spell "mother."

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:            It doesn't matter what

17   language you use because it's pretty vague anyway --

18   "probability," "likelihood," "appearance" -- it doesn't

19   really --

21   mean?   I'm not worried about what you call "probability"

24   you take a shot at answering it?

 1                MR. FREY:      I don't agree with you, Justice

 2   Breyer.    I think you have to -- you have to have a

 3   reason.    You don't have a decision that's good for this

 4   case only.    You have to have a decision that's

 5   principled, and when -- and when you ask what is the

 6   principle, what is it that would cause Justice Benjamin

 7   -- and by the way, let me say that I think if Justice

 8   Benjamin was moved to do anything, it's to vote against

 9   Massey or to recuse himself to avoid the controversy

10   that would attend a vote for Massey that he knew was

11   going to happen.   And if you look at page 692 of the

12   joint appendix, he actually discusses that problem.

13                So I don't think you can even predict which

14   way these circumstances would cause him to go, but I do

15   think you need a principle, and the principle is either

16   debt of gratitude or hope of future benefit.

17                As to the hope of future benefit in this

18   case, that is totally not viable for a couple of

19   reasons.   One is Justice Benjamin's not running for

20   another eight years.

21                JUSTICE SOUTER:            How long has Massey been in

22   business, eight years?

23                MR. FREY:      A long time.                 Sure.   A long time.

24                JUSTICE SOUTER:            I mean --

25                MR. FREY:      But you wouldn't --

 1                JUSTICE SOUTER:           If one is going to go into

 2   that calculation, one is going to assume that in eight

 3   years, there's going to be another three million dollars

 4   waiting to be spent.

 5                MR. FREY:     That -- well, there's several

 6   problems with that, Justice Souter.                     The first is

 7   there's no more likely to be spent on Justice Benjamin

 8   than on any other member of the court who might be

 9   sympathic.

10                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, one has hopes.

11                (Laughter.)

12                MR. FREY:     Excuse me?

13                JUSTICE SOUTER:           One has hopes.

14                MR. FREY:     A lot of members of the Court

15   would have the same exact hopes, with another reason,

16   they might be running sooner, they might end up with an

17   opponent who is more distasteful to Mr. Blankenship.

18                By the way, Mr. Blankenship is not Massey.

19   They are two separate things.

20                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, you say that and I

21   say that because we took corporate law.                    But in -- in

22   terms of my brother a moment ago spoke of we've been

23   around Washington for a while, and I don't think that

24   fine distinction counts very much on the issue that

25   we've got.

 1                MR. FREY:     But why would -- why would

 2   Blankenship be more likely to support Benjamin than to

 3   support Justice Davis or justice --

 4                JUSTICE SOUTER:           We'll have to see when the

 5   next election comes along.          An expectation has been

 6   created that if there is an interest, the money will be

 7   spent, and it seems to me that underlies Justice

 8   Breyer's analysis just as it does mine.

 9                MR. FREY:     Where that takes you is all the

10   judges have to recuse themselves because they all have

11   the possibility of garnering support.

12                JUSTICE SOUTER:           They all have not had the 3

13   million.

14                MR. FREY:     But either you look to the past

15   and you look at debt of gratitude, and in our brief we

16   have indicated a number of circumstances where the same

17   debt of gratitude rationale would apply.                There are a

18   lot of things that led to Benjamin's election, and

19   Blankenship's money is not necessarily the main thing at

20   all.   And if you're looking forward --

21                JUSTICE SOUTER:           No, but with respect,

22   Justice Breyer disassociated his question from debt of

23   gratitude.   I understand you -- you are arguing against

24   a debt of gratitude theory, but if I recall his

25   question, it was not based upon the debt of gratitude

 1   theory.

 2                MR. FREY:      Right, but what I'm saying is you

 3   can't.    If -- if you're looking at -- at where -- where

 4   would the bias come from, and I'm assuming now that some

 5   probability of bias standard is accepted by the Court,

 6   and I'm asking where would the bias come from.                     It

 7   either would come from a debt of gratitude for past

 8   contributions or an expectation of future benefits.                      If

 9   it's an expectation of future benefits, it is not

10   reasonable to assume that Benjamin has any stronger

11   expectation than other members of the court.                     So it

12   seems to me you're in a position where if he has to

13   recuse, they all have to recuse.

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And then debt of

15   gratitude -- we keep asking but your time is running

16   out, have you said what you need to say on debt of

17   gratitude?

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I'm really anxious to hear

19   what you have to say on debt of gratitude.

20                MR. FREY:      Well, okay.

21                (Laughter.)

22                MR. FREY:      I don't know.                Some of the ground

23   is covered already by questions during Mr. Olson's

24   argument.    I think the debt of gratitude cannot be

25   limited consistent with neutral principles to large

 1   individual campaign contributions.                   You have newspaper

 2   endorsements.     Clearly you could have a debt of

 3   gratitude there.     Newspaper could be a party in the

 4   case.

 5                You have the plaintiff lawyers and the

 6   doctors which we've talked about.                  You have labor unions

 7   getting out the vote.        You have political figures

 8   endorsing.   And you have appointed judges and -- and to

 9   say that there's no -- to say that you're going to carve

10   out the gratitude that the judges feel toward the

11   president who appointed them -- I mean, the fact is in

12   the Nixon tapes case, and in Clinton --

13                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Mr. Frey, there is

14   obviously a difference between appointed judges and

15   elected judges.     But why do we have to rest on just one

16   factor?   The Conference of Chief Justices suggested

17   their seven factors should be taken into account.                   Why

18   is that totally unworkable?              Why does it have to be just

19   one theory, debt of gratitude and nothing else?

20                They don't -- the chief judges who are

21   elected don't think that's the way to do it.

22                MR. FREY:       I think you're mixing up two

23   different things.     What is the -- one question is what

24   is the wellspring of the bias?                Why do we think the

25   judge has bias?     And the second question is how do we

 1   measure that?

 2                 And what I'm saying is if you think that

 3   Justice Benjamin would be biased in this case, which I

 4   certainly don't, and I think his track record has shown

 5   no bias in favor of Massey, then why would -- why would

 6   an appointed justice, appointed by a president in a case

 7   where the president's personal interests are at stake

 8   not have the same feelings of bias, and yet justices sit

 9   in those circumstances.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

11                MR. FREY:      Thank you.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Mr. Olson, five

13   minutes.

14              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

15                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

16                MR. OLSON:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

17                Justice Scalia, you mentioned that the words

18   "reasonable search and seizure" are in the Constitution.

19   The words "due process" are in the Constitution, and

20   that is what we're talking about today.                  This Court has

21   repeatedly said, and I don't think my opponent objects

22   or disagrees that due process means a fair trial in a

23   fair tribunal.

24                So what are we talking about today?                 What is

25   a fair tribunal?    He said ask yourself, could you be

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   fair if you were in Justice Benjamin's position?            That,

 2   I submit, is not the question, because this Court has

 3   repeatedly said actual bias is something that's

 4   virtually impossible to prove, the counsel of -- the

 5   Conference of Chief Justices said don't go there.            We

 6   can't ever determine that.

 7              And so the question is what is -- is someone

 8   likely to be biased, likely to be unfair?

 9              And, Justice Kennedy, one of the factors

10   that led us to the conclusion that an objective

11   standard, that a reasonable person knowing all of the

12   facts would probably be biased is language from a number

13   of these court -- this Court's decisions, including your

14   concurrence in the Liteky case -- I think it's Liteky,

15   L-I-T-E-K-Y -- in which you said the objective observer

16   would entertain reasonable questions about the judge's

17   impartiality.

18              Now, that's a case involving section 455 and

19   not the Due Process Clause, but I think the logic with

20   respect to the application of the test and the ability

21   of this Court and other courts to apply it, as the

22   Conference of Chief Justices said they could, is the

23   same.

24              JUSTICE ALITO:          What is the difference

25   between this situation and a situation where a justice


                                      53

 1   or a judge is appointed by an executive and then hears a

 2   case that is of critical importance to the executive?

 3                MR. OLSON:       The -- the -- there's a number

 4   of questions.    In the first place, there's life tenure

 5   for federal judges.

 6                Secondly, was that appointment made --

 7                JUSTICE ALITO:          Specifically if Justice

 8   Benjamin were term limited, would this case be

 9   different?

10                MR. OLSON:       No, I think it wouldn't be

11   different because of all the confluence of

12   circumstances.   If a detached observer, again to use

13   Justice Kennedy's words --

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Wait, you can't have it

15   both ways.   I mean, if your response to the first

16   question is judges have lifetime tenure, you then can't

17   respond to the second question would it make a

18   difference if he was term limited by saying, no, it

19   wouldn't make a difference.

20                MR. OLSON:       He might be running for another

21   court, he might need the benefits.                  This was $3 million

22   in a race in which that amounted to more money than

23   everybody else collectively put into this race while

24   this case was pending.

25                Now, the language that I think is important

 1   is from the Tumey case, might not a defendant with

 2   reason say that he would fear he would not get a fair

 3   trial.   So instead of the question that my opponent

 4   asks, would you be fair, which is not the standard

 5   because actual bias isn't the test, would there be a

 6   perception, likelihood, probability appearance of bias,

 7   to use the language used by this Court over and over

 8   again.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   What about --

10               MR. OLSON:         Ask yourself this question --

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   What about

12   protective donations?        You actually give, not three

13   million, but a couple hundred thousand to somebody you

14   don't want deciding your case.                And it comes up, and you

15   say, you have to recuse yourself because --

16               MR. OLSON:         As this Court has said, I think,

17   in one of the cases that you can't allow a litigant to

18   try to game the system in that way.                       What I was getting

19   to instead of the question --

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   How do you know?      I

21   mean, are you saying it's going to be clear in every

22   case that the judge is going to rule against the

23   particular entity?

24               MR. OLSON:         It's not going to be clear in

25   every case, Mr. Chief Justice.                It's going to be would a

 1   detached observer conclude that a fair and impartial

 2   hearing would be possible?         So instead of the question

 3   that Mr. Frey was asking whether you, yourself, could be

 4   -- I would like to ask you to ask this question.                    If

 5   this was going to be the judge in your case, would you

 6   think it would be fair and would it be a fair tribunal

 7   if the judge in your case was selected with a $3 million

 8   subsidy by your opponent?

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Is that a reasonable

10   person that's making that inquiry, is that the standard?

11              MR. OLSON:       That is the standard that

12   this --

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Okay.   Would a

14   reasonable person think it's a ground for recusal if the

15   lawyer and the judge were very close friends?

16              MR. OLSON:       No, I don't think so.

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You don't think so?

18   A reasonable person comes up and says I socialize all

19   the time, you know, they were at each other's weddings,

20   whatever it is, we know that that's not a basis for

21   recusal.

22              MR. OLSON:       Then if it was a basis for a

23   recusal, you would have to be recusing all the time,

24   because that is a standard that's reasonable question of

25   impartiality is in section 455, it is in many of the

 1   State codes.   The courts handle these decisions all of

 2   the time.   These are factors, and I think I would go

 3   back to Justice Stevens' and Justice Breyer's question,

 4   this is a situation where there has got to be some

 5   limits.

 6               Our opponents say there's -- bias tribunals

 7   are not prohibited by the Due Process Clause nor

 8   probably biased or the appearance of bias.                 We think

 9   there has to be some constitutional limit.
