 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                            IN NO. 07-1059

10              MR. STEWART:           Mr. Chief Justice and may it

11   please the Court:

12              The question presented in this case is

13   whether the provision of enriched uranium under

14   separative work unit or SWU contracts is covered by the

15   Federal antidumping duty law.              The resolution of that

16   question turns on whether the performance of SWU

17   contracts results in merchandise being sold in the

18   United States.    The Department of Commerce, which is the

19   Federal agency entrusted by Congress with the

20   administration of the antidumping duty law, concluded

21   after an extensive investigation that SWU contracts do

22   result in sales of enriched uranium.                     That determination

23   was reasonable and should be sustained by this Court.

24              Now, the fundamental bargain in a SWU

25   contract is that the customer, the utility, provides a


                                         3

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   combination of feedstock or feed uranium plus cash, and

 2   receives in return a specified quantity and assay of

 3   enriched uranium, and by "assay" I mean the percentage

 4   of weight of U-235 within the final product.                      Now, the

 5   customer has discretion to choose among varying

 6   combinations of feedstock and cash in order to complete

 7   the transaction for a particular quantity and assay of

 8   enriched uranium; but the enricher has its own

 9   discretion.    That is, having received the consideration

10   paid by the utility, the enricher is free to make its

11   own determination based on economic considerations as to

12   the relative proportions of feedstocks and SWUs that

13   should be used to make a given quantity of enriched

14   uranium.

15                 So the overall -- the character of the

16   overall transaction is comfortably characterized as a

17   sale, because it involves the acquisition by the utility

18   of a product, merchandise, that it didn't own at the

19   outset of the transaction in exchange for consideration.

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:            I can imagine you could

21   have a grain mill and they have lots and lots of grain

22   absolute identical one to the other.                     And the farmer

23   takes his grain up and they operate on it, and then he

24   drives away with the grain, milled.                      Now, it may make no

25   difference to anybody whether the identical molecules


                                         4

 1   are the same; and I think in such a case you'd say they

 2   are processing it; they are not buying and selling it.

 3              MR. STEWART:         Well, indeed, as we've

 4   explained in our opening brief, at common law the

 5   distinction between a bailment and a sale in that type

 6   of circumstance depended upon whether the miller or the

 7   equivalent processor was under an obligation to return

 8   the very same thing in processed form.                 And if that

 9   was --

10              JUSTICE BREYER:             You are saying if we have

11   that, in fact, if the -- if the exact situation, if some

12   farmers up in North Dakota send their grain just to be

13   milled -- it's their grain -- up in Canada, and they

14   come back, and it -- you know, it may not be the

15   identical molecule, but it's identically the same; they

16   have done this for 100 years -- now suddenly this -- the

17   Commerce Department is going to say, that's a sale, and

18   the antidumping statutes apply?

19              MR. STEWART:         We are saying that Commerce

20   could treat it as a sale.         And --

21              JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, would it or not?

22              MR. STEWART:         I think Commerce in that

23   hypothetical -- again, if we were talking about grain

24   being provided by the customer to a miller overseas --

25   overseas, and then the finished product being brought


                                       5

 1   back into this country, I think the logic of the

 2   Commerce determination here would suggest that it would

 3   be a sale.

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:             I agree with you, and I

 5   just wonder, what I would like to know, is if any

 6   businessman involved in any of these or related things

 7   before this decision of the Commerce Department would

 8   have thought that that is how the Commerce Department

 9   would have treated such a transaction?

10                 MR. STEWART:         Well, I don't think that

11   Commerce had before this incident dealt with exactly

12   this type of situation.

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, but common law would

14   have treated it that way, you say?

15                 MR. STEWART:         Common law would have treated

16   it --

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             That's pretty good

18   authority.

19                 MR. STEWART:         It certainly suggests that

20   Commerce could permissibly treat it as a sale.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:             I don't know.   I'm

22   asking -- the question is the same as the last case, to

23   me:     Not whether they could have done it; sure they

24   could have done it.       My question is based on my question

25   of whether they had a rule that any reasonable person


                                          6

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   would have thought that is how they treated it --

 2              MR. STEWART:         I --

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:             Because after all, you have

 4   three precedents in related areas, not the direct area

 5   but in related areas, that suggest that they wouldn't

 6   have treated the millers that way.

 7              MR. STEWART:         I'm not sure exactly which

 8   precedents you mean.     If -- the one that is -- the

 9   administrative determination that is cited most

10   frequently is SRAMS from Taiwan, in which the design

11   house provided, I believe it was a design mask to the

12   foundry, and the foundry manufactured the finished

13   equipment and in concluding that it was the design house

14   rather than the foundry that was properly treated as the

15   producer of the goods, the Commerce Department relied in

16   part on the fact that the design house had intellectual

17   property rights in the design mask.

18              JUSTICE BREYER:             You know what, I'm thinking

19   of those things, they're something called "tollers."                     I

20   don't know exactly what tollers are.                   They seem to be

21   like people who give haircuts.             They're sort of

22   servicers of some kind.       They're talking about tollers

23   and -- and subcontractors.         And that is a related area.

24              MR. STEWART:         That's correct.             And the SRAMs

25   cases is one of the toller or subcontractor cases.                   And


                                       7

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the Department of Commerce relied in part on the fact

 2   that the design house had intellectual property rights

 3   in the design mask.     So it was not fungible property, it

 4   was not an input that the foundry could have gotten from

 5   another source.

 6              The other thing we would say about the grain

 7   hypothetical is that when you hear about the farmer

 8   providing grain to the miller or the utilities providing

 9   feedstock to the enrichers, it may conjure up images of

10   a tangible good that is in the physical possession of

11   the farmer or the utility that is then physically

12   transferred to the enricher.            In the case of the miller

13   that is correct.

14              But the way that a utility provides

15   feedstock to an enricher is not by taking physical

16   possession of the feedstock and then by transporting it.

17   Rather, the utility simply makes financial arrangements

18   with the supplier of feedstock, basically cuts a check

19   or transfers funds --

20              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Mr. Stewart, can I ask a

21   question about the scope of discretion involved here?

22   Assume the facts were not exactly as they are here, it

23   is not a fungible product, but that each shipment was

24   separately identified and each shipment was processed as

25   a different batch in France and then sent back.            That I


                                        8

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   assume would not normally be treated as a sale of goods?

 2               MR. STEWART:           Well, I think that Commerce's

 3   determination suggests, without squarely holding, that

 4   it would treat that as a sale of goods because it would

 5   involve substantial transformation of the original item.

 6               JUSTICE STEVENS:              That's really what I

 7   wanted to ask you.      Even if the facts were more extreme,

 8   just as in the example I gave, do you think the Commerce

 9   Department would have discretion to treat that as a sale

10   of goods?

11               MR. STEWART:           We do.        And I think it's

12   important, to carry on with the thought I was sketching

13   out previously about the way in which the raw materials

14   are provided to the enricher.

15               If you imagine my buying a suit from a

16   tailor, and the tailor says:              The price is $600; $300 of

17   that accounts for the cost of the cloth; $300 is the

18   labor that's involved in sewing it into a suit.

19   Clearly, that's a sale of merchandise, even though the

20   price has been broken up --

21               JUSTICE STEVENS:              But then supposing they

22   send the suit back to a different person for

23   alterations, and they say, well, this is part of the

24   sale, so we want to treat it as a sale of goods?

25               MR. STEWART:           Well, the alterations would


                                          9

 1   just be a finishing process and that wouldn't involve

 2   substantial --

 3              JUSTICE STEVENS:             What is the difference

 4   between that and what we've got here?

 5              MR. STEWART:          But the point I was going to

 6   make about the suit, and it applies equally to the

 7   uranium enrichment process, is if I say to my tailor,

 8   rather than I pay you $600 and you pay your cloth

 9   supplier $300, how about I just give you $300 and I will

10   give $300 to your cloth supplier, and it will amount to

11   the same thing in the end, because you won't have to pay

12   for the cloth?   If the tailor accepts that arrangement,

13   the economic substance is exactly the same.                And it

14   would seem strange to say that it's a sale if I just pay

15   $600 to the tailor, but it's not a sale if I break down

16   the cost in the way that I've described.

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Could you articulate

18   precisely what your test is, because you have been going

19   back and forth between whether the raw materials are

20   fungible and whether there is a fundamental

21   transformation in the product?              So, how would you merge

22   those two in an articulable test so that business people

23   can know when they are going to be subject to this

24   regime and when they were not?

25              MR. STEWART:          I think that the Commerce


                                       10

 1   determination -- that Commerce did not purport to either

 2   promulgate a regulation or announce a test that

 3   precisely defined the term "sale".                I think the thrust

 4   of the Commerce Department's determination was that

 5   substantial transformation was enough, but that the case

 6   was much easier by virtue of the fact that the

 7   producer -- the enricher dealt with fungible goods and

 8   also had substantial discretion to decide how much of

 9   the feedstock would be used vis-a-vis --

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You would say your

11   ultimate touchstone is whether there is substantial

12   transformation, and whether it's a raw material or

13   discretion, those go into that determination?

14              MR. STEWART:         That's correct, although it

15   would certainly be appropriate for this Court if it

16   didn't want to address the situation in which only

17   substantial transformation was present, to say that at

18   least when both circumstances were present there was a

19   sale.

20              And again, to distinguish this somewhat from

21   the miller hypothetical, the miller in making grain into

22   flour may have discretion as to which individual grains

23   to use for a particular batch of flour, but it won't

24   typically have discretion as to what weight of grain

25   will be used to make what weight of flour.                And the


                                      11

 1   enricher has that discretion as well; that is, to

 2   produce a particular quantity and assay of enriched

 3   uranium, the enricher can either use more feedstock and

 4   fewer SWU's --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           What's a SWU?       You lost me

 6   on the SWU.    What's a SWU?

 7                 MR. STEWART:        A SWU is a unit of work and

 8   it's work in the sense of output; that is, it is the

 9   work necessary to separate out a particular quantity of

10   enriched uranium --

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           If you put in more time

12   with the uranium, with the same amount of 235, if you

13   put in more time you can get out more?

14                 MR. STEWART:        That's right.          The amount

15   of -- the separation process or the enrichment process

16   involves a separation of the original feedstock into the

17   enriched uranium and what is referred to as the tails,

18   which is the residue or the depleted uranium.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm sure you're

20   prepared for a wide variety of hypotheticals.                  What

21   about a diamond?    You have a chunk of rock that contains

22   a diamond.    You send it to Antwerp and they carve it

23   away into something that, I guess you could say it's

24   been substantially transformed.               It's not just a rock.

 1              MR. STEWART:         I'm not sure whether Commerce

 2   would treat that as substantial transformation.

 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Neither am I, and

 4   it's kind of -- it's sort of a bit of a concern.                  It's a

 5   fluctuating test that is hard to determine how it's

 6   going to be applied in a wide variety of cases.

 7              MR. STEWART:         Now, in this case -- in this

 8   particular case, Commerce noted that there was no

 9   dispute among the parties that the enrichment process

10   did result in substantial transformation.                  So that --

11   that uncertainly is not present here.

12              But I agree that there is a gray area with

13   respect to substantial transformation that isn't present

14   when you are trying to answer the question:                 Is the

15   customer getting back the same thing in modified form or

16   is he getting back a different thing?                  That is, although

17   the contracts between the utility and the enricher deem

18   the enriched uranium to have been produced with the

19   customer's own feedstock, everybody acknowledges that

20   that is not the fact in the real world.

21              And so, what the customer receives back is

22   not like your diamond hypothetical, in which he receives

23   an improved version of the original product.                  It is as

24   though you had a diamond company that said, we need

25   inventory all the time, and we're prepared to work out


                                      13

 1   an arrangement where if you send us a raw diamond plus

 2   cash, we will send you back a different cut diamond.

 3   That would be a sale, regardless of whether there was

 4   substantial transformation, because you would have

 5   payment of consideration for a product that you

 6   indisputably didn't own at the outset.

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Stewart, we're

 8   reviewing a decision of the Federal Circuit.              And the

 9   Federal Circuit relied dominantly on the Florida Power

10   case in which the same issue was presented, albeit under

11   a different statute.

12                 But I -- reading that Florida Power, where

13   the Federal Circuit adopted the Government's position,

14   the Government's position then was that this very same

15   transaction involved the rendition of services and not a

16   sale of goods.

17                 Does the Government have a distinction

18   between those two cases, or are you now saying in

19   hindsight you realized that the position that you took

20   before the Federal Circuit in the early case was wrong?

21                 MR. STEWART:        I don't think we have

22   disavowed the position we took in the Florida Power &

23   Light case.    Now, in all candor, I would have to say the

24   question of the Contract Disputes -- Disputes Act's

25   applicability to SWU contracts is of a lot less interest


                                        14

 1   to the Federal Government now than it was then, because

 2   the reason that arose in a case involving the Federal

 3   Government was that at that time USEC was a Government

 4   instrumentality and we were representing USEC in its

 5   governmental incarnation.

 6              Now that USEC has been privatized, the

 7   Federal Circuit is unlikely to confront the question

 8   whether the Contract Disputes Act applies to this sort

 9   of, because these are not -- this is not a Federal

10   entity, in any event.

11              The reason that we think the two cases are

12   reconcilable is that the Contract Disputes Act, as its

13   name implies, is a statute that governs the resolution

14   of disputes between contracting parties.               And in that

15   situation, it's much more appropriate to look to the

16   form of the parties' arrangement.               And the court -- the

17   Federal Circuit in Florida Power and Light placed a lot

18   of emphasis on the fact that the contract was styled as

19   one for enrichment services.           And that is an appropriate

20   consideration to take into account when you are

21   resolving disputes between the contracting parties, but

22   when the whole purpose of the antidumping statute is to

23   prevent contracting parties from entering into

24   arrangements that are mutually beneficial to themselves,

25   but that would and unfairly disadvantage domestic


                                      15

 1   competitors, it was appropriate for Commerce to look

 2   behind the form of the contract and to look at physical

 3   and economic reality.

 4                JUSTICE STEVENS:           But isn't it correct that

 5   the universe of transactions that is the subject of this

 6   Act is sales?   Is that not right?               Rather than service

 7   contracts.

 8                MR. STEWART:        Well, it is true that the

 9   antidumping statute requires that merchandise be sold in

10   the United States, and we don't contend that the statute

11   applies to price discrimination in services like

12   insurance or banking.

13                JUSTICE STEVENS:           But do you -- do you

14   contend the word "sold" is an ambiguous term, requires

15   construction by a particular agency?

16                MR. STEWART:        It is ambiguous at the

17   margins; that is, the classic arrangement, the classic

18   sale is an exchange of --

19                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Do you think Congress

20   intended the ambiguity to be resolved by an agency

21   rather than judges applying the rules of common law and

22   the rules of sales law generally?

23                MR. STEWART:        Yes, and I think this is a

24   statute that has been around for, I believe, close to

25   90 years now; and in order for it to remain efficacious


                                       16

 1   in this area, Commerce has to be able to adapt its

 2   principles to new forms of transactions.                  Again, that

 3   doesn't mean that Commerce's discretion is limitless,

 4   but it has some discretion at the margins.

 5               If I may, I would like to reserve the

 6   balance of my time.

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, Mr.

 8   Stewart.

10                ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR

11                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12                            IN NO. 07-1078

13               MR. FARR:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

14   please the Court:

15               I would submit, as the questions this

16   morning have indicated, one of the difficulties in this

17   case, obviously, is this is the kind of transaction that

18   can be thought about reasonably enough in different

19   ways.   It is possible to look at this very narrow set of

20   circumstances where a customer is providing raw

21   materials of the kind that the producer uses to make a

22   good, and to say in that circumstance we could look at

23   it as the customer providing two kinds of consideration

24   for the good it's receiving; or we could look at it, as

25   the Respondents do and as the Federal Circuit did, as


                                        17
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   saying, the other way to look at it is this is

 2   essentially the customer receiving a service on its own

 3   goods.

 4              Now it seems to me to begin with, the

 5   question that is before the Court properly is whether

 6   Commerce, which is undoubtedly the agency charged with

 7   enforcing this statute, has adopted a reasonable view

 8   when it's taken one of those two positions.

 9              JUSTICE BREYER:            What -- what do we do about

10   the question that is bothering me?                Maybe at some

11   point -- maybe it's not a relevant question -- but I

12   will assume for the sake of argument Commerce does have

13   the power to classify it either way.

14              What is bothering me, and maybe that's not

15   in this case, is that as the -- as your brother lawyer

16   just said, this statute has been around for 90 years.

17   There has been trillions of dollars worth of foreign

18   commerce during that time.         Yet I don't find cited here

19   any instance in which Commerce ever before said that

20   when you have title to a good, and you send it abroad,

21   for even a big change in it, and then it comes back,

22   that that is a sale.

23              Now, I might -- I don't know all the

24   Commerce cases; maybe they did.             But what I found here

25   is like a blank on that side, and on the other side the


                                      18

 1   tolling cases, Florida Power & Light, the pizza case, to

 2   the point where I thought, if I was a lawyer advising a

 3   client, and that client said if I keep title to the

 4   good, am I home free, I would have to say, yes, you are.

 5               MR. FARR:        Okay.

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:              Now that's the -- the

 7   question I want responded to in the legal context of,

 8   has Commerce made a significant change in its policy?

 9               MR. FARR:        Several things about that,

10   Justice Breyer.   First of all, as we have indicated in

11   our brief, Commerce did have a policy prior to the

12   tolling regulation, where it did treat these kinds of

13   transactions as sales of goods.

14               JUSTICE BREYER:              And I read -- at what page

15   do I find all these cases?

16               MR. FARR:        That is in our brief.         I'm sorry,

17   I don't have --

18               JUSTICE BREYER:              Well, roughly.   I'll find

19   it.   I will find it.

20               MR. FARR:        But it's in --

21               JUSTICE BREYER:              But I will see a lot of

22   cases where --

23               MR. FARR:        Where we discuss Commerce's

24   tolling precedent.      And then it went and it essentially

25   decided that what it had done in that precedent, it


                                         19
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   wanted to reexamine that, because it thought in the end

 2   what was happening in all of those cases is there was a

 3   resale of the merchandise; and it thought it would be a

 4   better practice to focus on that sale of the merchandise

 5   for purposes of applying the statute.

 6              When it did that, however, it found it had

 7   created a loophole in the case where there wasn't a

 8   further sale.   So it has gone back to that.            So at least

 9   in terms of the precedent, Commerce has been on

10   different sides of that, but they have been wrestling

11   with exactly the problem that I outlined at the

12   beginning, which is dealing with a question that

13   essentially has no ready answer to it and trying to pick

14   among the plausible answers that were available to it.

15              Secondly, just about the specific situation

16   here, I don't believe that there is any chance that the

17   utilities and the enricher in this case could claim

18   unfair surprise or unjust reliance; because they say in

19   their own briefs, they did not set their transactions up

20   in this way in order to try to comply with prior

21   decisions of Commerce.

22              They say -- they make a point in their brief

23   in saying we have perfectly innocent intentions here,

24   that they set their transactions up purely for

25   historical and commercial reasons.


                                       20

 1              So -- now, the other question that

 2   Justice Breyer raises is about the cases, and

 3   Justice Ginsburg I think mentioned earlier the Florida

 4   Power & Light decision.         And again, Florida Power &

 5   Light is a case in which there is no agency that is

 6   before the Court.

 7              So at that point there is no question of

 8   Chevron deference, no question of whether this is a

 9   reasonable position; all that the Court had to decide

10   was, given the possible choices, which did it think was

11   the better choice under those circumstances?               And

12   particularly I think it's important in that case, is the

13   Federal Circuit said, this is a case that doesn't fall

14   readily into either of the two categories.               So it went

15   ahead and had to decide it on its own.

16              But it seems to me that when you say in a

17   case with an agency involved, and the agency has made

18   one determination, that a case could fall within either

19   of categories -- of categories --

20              JUSTICE STEVENS:              Mr. Farr, are there

21   earlier cases that applied Chevron deference to the

22   Commerce's determination of what a sale is?

23              MR. FARR:        No, there are not, Your Honor,

24   that I am aware of.      But --

25              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              You agree that the Chevron


                                        21
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   case is not a substantial evidence case?

 2              MR. FARR:        I do think so, although I must

 3   say the line between the two is not enormously clear to

 4   me, to be honest.    But -- but the fact is if I were

 5   trying to figure out where on the side of the line it

 6   goes, it seems to me that this is a case in which you

 7   are talking about the application of a legal standard to

 8   a particular set of circumstances.                  I mean, in Chevron,

 9   you have the situation, is a certain kind of facility a

10   stationary source or whatever?               I mean that -- you could

11   say, well, that is a factual question in some way, but

12   it seems to me ultimately the better way to think about

13   it is Commerce's responsibility is to interpret the law

14   in the light of cases that come up.

15              I mean, an agency does not -- is not

16   expected by Congress just to sit back and imagine all

17   the possible situations that could be a sale of

18   merchandise.   I think what the agency is supposed to do

19   is, confronted with the circumstance in a particular

20   transaction, to apply its judgment on the statutory

21   language and say, yes, we do think this is a sale of

22   merchandise or no, we don't.

23              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   If we are to defer

24   to the agency's interpretation, what -- how would you

25   phrase its interpretation, apart from "this is a sale"?


                                        22
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                MR. FARR:       Well, I think -- the narrowest

 2   interpretation, and it seems to me the one that is most

 3   readily dealt with is, to say, in a situation where a

 4   customer provides raw material that is the type of, but

 5   not the precise raw material, used by a manufacturer to

 6   make the good that it then delivers to the customer, in

 7   that situation, we are going to treat the manufacturer

 8   as having made a sale of that good for the consideration

 9   of the cash and the raw material.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So it doesn't matter

11   whether there is a substantial transformation or not?

12                MR. FARR:       I think it does,

13   Mr. Chief Justice, in this sense, that we are talking

14   about the sale of the merchandise and that is a new

15   good.   So the substantial transformation is essentially

16   what moves the ball from -- from being the -- the raw

17   material supplied by the customer to something

18   different.   And the question would be in this case,

19   could Commerce reasonably think that the manufacturer

20   had sufficient control over the new good to be deemed

21   the owner of that?

22                And I think it's important to look, if you

23   look at the -- there are two different commodities that

24   are being talked about in the case of this transaction:

25   One is the feedstock, the raw material; the other is the


                                         23

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   LEU.   And the idea that the Respondents posit is, well,

 2   this is just a service performed on our material.                 All

 3   we are doing is getting our material back after a

 4   service has been performed on it.

 5               But as everybody agrees, as a matter of

 6   fact, that is simply not so.            They are not getting their

 7   material back with a service performed on it.                 They are

 8   getting a product that has been produced, manufactured,

 9   from raw material that is fungible and in the general

10   inventory of the manufacturer.              And in that case, it

11   seems to me, Commerce can say, we are going to disregard

12   the fiction of the parties' contracts that say this

13   really is made from our material, and say we are going

14   to look at the actual nature of the transaction.                 And in

15   the actual nature of the transaction, as I said, it is

16   not made from their material.

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So that -- so that

18   is the critical factor, whether it's made from their

19   material, regardless of whether there is a

20   transformation?   If the domestic entity provides wood,

21   wooden two-by-fours, and the foreign entity coats it in

22   a certain way, but they can use any two-by-fours, they

23   are indistinguishable, you would say in that case

24   there's still -- that's still subject to Commerce's

25   position?

 1                MR. FARR:      No, I don't think Commerce would

 2   say that.    I am to some extent speaking for them here.

 3   But I think what Commerce would say is, when you have a

 4   fungible raw material in substantial transformation

 5   without --

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So it's got to be

 7   both?

 8                MR. FARR:      I think that Commerce would say,

 9   if you have both, that clearly can be regarded as a sale

10   of merchandise, and we will regard it as a sale of

11   merchandise.   On the other hand, if you only have

12   substantial transformation but not fungibility, then I

13   believe Commerce would say, even in that situation,

14   because it's ultimately the effect on the domestic

15   competitor is exactly the same, we would retain the

16   discretion to treat even that as a sale of merchandise.

17                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Would you --

18                MR. FARR:      I would emphasize that's not the

19   case.

20                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Would you do that if you

21   thought it was clear as a matter of common law or under

22   the Uniform Sales Act, or something like that, that it

23   was not a sale?

24                MR. FARR:      I think because of the different

25   circumstances, under the common law, for example, I

 1   should make very clear -- but I should make first my

 2   answer to you, Justice Stevens.                Under the common law,

 3   the particular transaction we were dealing with here,

 4   where it is not made from the identical material, is

 5   clearly a sale under the common law.                      But if you -- if

 6   Commerce were going to say, in a situation where it is

 7   made from the identical material, we want to depart from

 8   the common law, I think they would have to justify that.

 9              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Under common law, you

10   don't need deference.

11              MR. FARR:         Pardon me?

12              JUSTICE STEVENS:               I'm sorry.         If it were

13   clearly a sale under common law, you wouldn't need to

14   rely on deference.

15              MR. FARR:         Well, in the end, I think, in the

16   commercial setting, there is a reasonable chance, not

17   necessarily certain because you do have the UCC and you

18   have the possibility, in those situations, the courts

19   might say, in a commercial setting, we are going to pay

20   more attention to the parties' efforts to structure

21   their contracts in a particular way, so that between

22   them, we are going to treat the contract differently.

23   All our position is, is that Commerce, in applying the

24   antidumping law to protect a third party doesn't have to

25   observe the fictions in the parties' contract.

 4                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAITLIN J. HALLIGAN

 5                     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 6                 MS. HALLIGAN:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 7   please the Court:

 8                 I would like to start with Justice Breyer's

 9   question about the way in which the Department of

10   Commerce has treated transactions for the processing of

11   goods and the uncertainty that their position in this

12   case will cause, not just in this industry but across

13   industries.

14                 As you suggested, Justice Breyer -- you

15   referred to -- the Department of Commerce has treated

16   processors who are called "tollers", in the language

17   that Commerce uses, as performing a service.                 And the

18   transaction for the sale of that service has not been

19   treated as a cognizable sale under the antidumping law.

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           And those have been cases

21   where the very same product is returned with value

22   added, right?

23                 MS. HALLIGAN:         Not necessarily.        Sometimes

24   that is the case, Your Honor, but not always.                 For

25   example, in the Taiwan Semiconductors case, which Mr.


                                        27

 1   Stewart referred to and which is cited in our brief,

 2   what the U.S. company provided was simply a design to

 3   for a chip.    The Taiwanese company, which was the

 4   processor in the case according to the Department of

 5   Commerce, manufactured the chip, provided the silica,

 6   used the design of the U.S. company, but no raw

 7   materials at all.    The Department of Commerce, in its

 8   explanation as to why it treated the sale for purposes

 9   of the antidumping law as the eventual sale by the U.S.

10   company and did not and could not treat the sale by the

11   processor as a cognizable sale, explained that the

12   statute itself requires Commerce to compare the U.S.

13   price, which is called the export price, the price at

14   which a good is sold or imported into the United States,

15   with the price at which the product is sold in the

16   company's home market.        And because a processor does not

17   and cannot either provide all the essential components

18   of the product, because it's only providing the

19   processing service and not the raw materials, and

20   because it does not and cannot set the price at which

21   the product is sold in the United States, it is

22   therefore not the appropriate sale to look at that in

23   terms of the antidumping statute.                 That's --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What do you do about

25   the substance versus formality question?                  I mean, if you

 1   do have fungible raw materials, why should it make a

 2   difference whether the domestic company supplies those

 3   to the foreign company or simply says -- gives them

 4   money and says, buy them yourselves?                     And in the latter

 5   case, you would say that's a sale, and in the former

 6   case you would say it's not a sale?

 7                 MS. HALLIGAN:         First of all, the Department

 8   of Commerce has not until this case suggested that

 9   fungibility of goods might make some sort of a

10   difference.    In fact, in one of the cases that we cite

11   regarding flanges which were, according to the

12   Department of Commerce, fungible, they concluded that

13   the processing service there was not the cognizable

14   sale, the downstream sale of that product was.

15                 But more importantly it doesn't change the

16   substance of the deal between the two parties.                    What the

17   utilities come to the table with is cash, and they

18   provide the feed.    It is fungible as a matter of its

19   physical properties.       It is a gas.             And when the feed is

20   put into the gaseous diffusion chamber, which is the

21   large installation that the enricher uses to concentrate

22   the two different molecular isotopes, it takes a month

23   for the gas to work its way through this plant.                    The

24   enricher cannot feasibly segregate different lots of

25   feed, just like you can't with a grain elevator.

 1                 The analogy would be, with respect to a

 2   grain elevator, you would have to run in one farmer's

 3   bag of feed, run it all the way through the elevator and

 4   through the mill, and wait until the product comes out

 5   at the end, and then run another farmer's bag of feed

 6   through.     That's economically impractical and --

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            No, old mills used to do

 8   that.   The farmer used to take his harvest to the mill,

 9   and it would be ground right there while he was waiting.

10                 MS. HALLIGAN:          But -- but there is nothing

11   about the economic transaction that requires that it --

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's absolutely true.

13                 MS. HALLIGAN:          -- that happen, and more

14   importantly, the enrichers don't end up at the end of

15   the day with any feed.         They are also --

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Your brief constantly

17   assumes that there has been no sale, that throughout the

18   entire transaction, the utility owned what ultimately

19   becomes the rods, as though it was indeed the same

20   feedstock that produced the rod that was ultimately

21   delivered.    And that is simply not true.                There is a

22   change -- there is a change of ownership.                  The feedstock

23   that somebody else put into the mix is now transferred

24   to the -- to the electric utility.

25                 MS. HALLIGAN:          It may be the same molecules;

 1   it may not be.     There is no way to know or to tell.            And

 2   there is --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's exactly right.    You

 4   don't know.     So, you had cannot say that there has been

 5   no transfer of ownership.

 6                 MS. HALLIGAN:          Respectfully, Your Honor, I

 7   disagree.     If you look at the contracts, and the

 8   substance squares with the contracts because, at the end

 9   of this transaction, what the enricher walks away with

10   is cash and what the utilities walk away with are the

11   same number of uranium molecules that they came to that

12   plant with.

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            No, we've got the same

14   molecules.     I mean, when you are talking about whether

15   there has been a transfer of ownership or a transfer of

16   title, you are talking about molecules; you are not

17   talking about whether you ended up the same in, you

18   know, in monetary terms.           You are talk about whether you

19   have the same thing that you delivered to the person

20   overseas.     And you don't, or at least you can't say that

21   you do.

22                 MS. HALLIGAN:          You can't say for sure

23   because the gas molecules can't be segregated that way.

24                 I think that you need to look at two things:

25   I think that you need to look at what each of the


                                         31

 1   parties to the transaction come to the table with and

 2   what they walk away with.            And with respect to the

 3   utilities, they come to the table with uranium.                 It's a

 4   very expensive commodity.            The contracts are clear that

 5   they hold title to it through the process until such

 6   time as they take possession of the concentrated

 7   uranium.     It is clear from the contracts that there is

 8   an intent to maintain a continuous stream of ownership.

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That makes no sense, what

10   you just said.     That contract makes no sense.              They hold

11   title to it until they get the uranium rods, right?

12                 MS. HALLIGAN:          No, they hold title to it

13   until -- just to provide a --

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Most of it is back

15   overseas.     It's still mixed with the other fungible U

16   235.

17                 MS. HALLIGAN:          Your Honor, the contracts

18   provide several things.          First of all, they provide that

19   the utilities will deliver their feed within a certain

20   number of days prior to the date on which they will have

21   the concentrated uranium product provided to them.                It's

22   60 to 90 days, depending on the contract.

23                 So, pursuant to the contract, they deliver

24   the uranium feed.     The utilities run it through their

25   system.     And at the end of that diffusion process, they


                                         32
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   take the concentrated isotopes out and they provide that

 2   to the utility.    The enrichers don't receive any amount

 3   of feed that they can then take on to the open market.

 4                 By distinction, if you look at a used car

 5   sale, for example, which is an analogy the government

 6   uses.   If I want to trade my car in, I come to the

 7   dealer and I bring with me two pieces of consideration.

 8   I bring the used car, which is payment in time and I

 9   bring cash.    I walk away with my wallet a little bit

10   lighter and a new car, and the used car dealer has cash,

11   but also has an item that he can then go out onto the

12   market and sell.

13                 That does not occur here.

14                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           That's only -- that's only

15   true because apparently they use up all the feed that

16   they get.   If, in fact, they found a way to manufacture

17   to enrich more efficiently so that some feed was left

18   over, I presume you would not be here arguing that they

19   could not sell that feed on the open market even after

20   they had delivered the enriched uranium to the buyer?

21                 MS. HALLIGAN:         The price terms of the

22   contract provide only for the utilities to pay for the

23   amount of energy that is expended.

24                 I would distinguish this from another kind

25   of contract per uranium feed, which we don't contest is


                                        33
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   covered by the antidumping laws.              There is a very small

 2   percentage of concentrated uranium, of low enriched

 3   uranium that is sold pursuant to what the parties call

 4   an enriched uranium product contract, an EDP contract.

 5   That sort of a contract is one in which the enricher

 6   goes out into the market procures feed and performs a

 7   processing service.     The utility comes to the enricher,

 8   pays them cash and walks away with the product.

 9               By comparison, in these contracts, the

10   utilities are providing something that is very valuable.

11   The feed company --

12               JUSTICE SOUTER:           Yeah, but why are they

13   providing something that is very valuable that, in fact,

14   could not be obtained by the enricher on the open market

15   if those were the contract terms?               The enricher buys it

16   in the -- in the -- I forget the acronym in the case

17   that you just described -- and we don't know -- we have

18   no reason to believe the enricher couldn't go out on the

19   market and buy it if, in fact, the utility didn't supply

20   the feed.

21               MS. HALLIGAN:         Those are very different

22   kinds of contracts, though, Your Honor.

23               The contract in which the enricher simply

24   provides some amount of enriched uranium for a price and

25   procures the feed, which is a sliver of the total


                                      34

 1   contracts -- it's 5 percent even for USEC -- is one in

 2   which the enricher is bearing the cost of the feed and

 3   the risk of those price fluctuations.

 4                 The reasons that the contracts are

 5   predominantly, almost exclusively structured as services

 6   contracts by distinction is that the utilities choose to

 7   manage the process of procuring fuel themselves.

 8                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Sure.       They would rather

 9   manage the risk of price fluctuation than, in effect,

10   pay the premium that the processor would have to charge

11   in order to hedge against price fluctuation --

12                 MS. HALLIGAN:          That's right.

13                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            That's why they are doing

14   that.

15                 MS. HALLIGAN:          And so, they go out into the

16   market and procure the feed pursuant to whatever

17   arrangements they have with their feed suppliers.                  By

18   comparison, all they are coming to the enricher for is

19   the service of concentrating that positional isotope

20   into the assay --

21                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            That is a way of looking at

22   it.     But another way of looking at it is because they

23   choose to, in effect, take the risk of price fluctuation

24   as preferable to paying a higher ultimate price, they

25   are simply, for that reason, choosing to pay both in


                                         35

 1   cash and in a -- a valuable commodity, i.e., unenriched

 2   uranium.   You can look at it either way.

 3               MS. HALLIGAN:           They are.            But they are

 4   choosing to pay two completely different entities in two

 5   unrelated and two unlinked transactions.                     So, it

 6   doesn't -- we are not disagreeing that there is a

 7   transaction for feed that the uranium -- that the

 8   utilities engage in to procure their feed.                     There has to

 9   be.   But that is not part of the distinct services

10   contracts for processing only, which is all that the

11   Department of Commerce is looking to shoehorn into this

12   statute here.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Ms. Halligan, try this

14   hypothetical, and it really gives you the benefit of the

15   doubt.   Let's assume a department store buys raw wool

16   from some sheep herder, sends it overseas.                    And it's

17   worth $1,000, this raw wool.             It is processed, spun and

18   knitted into sweaters, and then shipped back to the

19   department store.    The sweaters, all made from the same

20   wool, not even fungible, so that's why this is even

21   better than your example -- the sweaters when they come

22   back, are worth not $1,000, but $20,000.

23               Do you think it would be unreasonable for

24   the Commerce Department to treat that as a sale of

25   sweaters by the European knitting wool or -- or home


                                        36

 1   knitters who did the sweaters?

 2              MS. HALLIGAN:           It would be perfectly

 3   appropriate for the Department of Commerce to do what it

 4   has done in the past, which is to treat the sale of the

 5   sweater by the U.S. companies for $20,000 as the

 6   cognizable sale.

 7              The only thing that makes this case --

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Say it again?

 9              MS. HALLIGAN:           In your hypothetical --

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:             I'm talking about the --

11   I'm talking about the sale from the European mills to

12   the American department store.

13              MS. HALLIGAN:           That would be a processing

14   transaction.

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:             A processing transaction.

16   It has changed a value of $1,000 into a value of -- what

17   did I say -- $20,000?      And that's just processing?

18              MS. HALLIGAN:           Let me give you an example of

19   what the Department of Commerce has looked at.                 They --

20   they looked at the processing of pasta.                 And the --

21   there the manufacturer came to a company -- this is a

22   place called Certain Pasta from Italy -- it's referenced

23   in the brief -- the company came to the processor with

24   wheat and presumably whatever other products went into

25   the pasta, some milk or eggs.             The pasta was processed


                                       37

 1   and made into pasta from the wheat and given back to the

 2   U.S. company.

 3              The Department of Commerce concluded that

 4   the appropriate sales target was not the making of the

 5   pasta, the processing of the pasta, but the downstream

 6   sale of the pasta in the United States.

 7              And that is what the statute requires.

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:            They said there was no

 9   sale.

10              MS. HALLIGAN:          They said that --

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:            When the pasta was

12   imported, there was no sale into the United States.

13              MS. HALLIGAN:          No, they said that --

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:            But that's what we are

15   talking about here.

16              MS. HALLIGAN:          We don't disagree, Your

17   Honor, that there is a product that comes into the

18   United States, it's low enriched uranium.              But the

19   statute doesn't target the importation of products.              And

20   in that way it is distinct from the companion statute,

21   the countervailing duty statute.              What this statute, the

22   antidumping statute, covers is the sale of merchandise

23   into the United States.

24              That means that you have to have merchandise

25   as distinct from services, but by comparison to

 1   countervailing duty statute covers both, which is part

 2   of how we know that Congress means that distinction

 3   tolls.    And you have to --

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Get back to your pasta

 5   case.    Was the holding of that case that there was no

 6   sale into the United States?

 7                MS. HALLIGAN:          The question before Commerce

 8   was which transaction is the appropriate transaction for

 9   us to treat as -- as the one that establishes the price

10   all over the United States.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's a different issue.

12   We are not talking here about which transaction

13   establishes the price.        We are talking simply about

14   whether there was a sale into the United States.

15                MS. HALLIGAN:          It turns on the same issue,

16   Your Honor, and here's why.             In all of these processing

17   cases that the Department of Commerce has looked at,

18   they have explained that the reason why the cognizable

19   sale is the sale of the finished product in the United

20   States, the pasta, the sweater, or whatever it may be,

21   is because the statute gets at price discrimination.

22   And it instructs the Department to look at the price at

23   which the product is sold in the United States.

24                The price for the weaving of the sweaters,

25   even if it does add the sort of value that you are


                                        39

 1   talking about, is not the price at which the product is

 2   sold, nor does it reflect all of the components of the

 3   transaction, because there is some components that the

 4   wool request.    So to determine whether there is price

 5   discrimination, you have to look apples to apples at

 6   which the product is sold in the United States.

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Now, wait.       Suppose these

 8   knitting mills in my example, in fact, are selling their

 9   sweaters for a much higher price in Europe.                 Instead of

10   $20,000 for this batch of wool, in Europe they are

11   selling it for $40,000.         And they nonetheless sell the

12   wool back into the United States for only $20,000.

13              You are telling me that that transaction

14   doesn't -- doesn't count for purposes of our antidumping

15   law?

16              MS. HALLIGAN:            To the extent that it may --

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:              That you have to look at

18   the price at which the department store then sells to

19   individuals?

20              MS. HALLIGAN:            That's right.        Because that's

21   what the statute is intended to capture.                 The statute

22   was enacted --

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:              But the department store is

24   not dumping.    It's -- it's the knitting mills that are

25   dumping.

 1              MS. HALLIGAN:             But the question, Your Honor,

 2   is -- is the price at which the product is sold in the

 3   United States.     Section 1677(a) defines "export price"

 4   and "constructed export price" as the price at which the

 5   subject merchandise is first sold in the United States.

 6   And that is what you have to look at.

 7              It may certainly be true that you may be

 8   able to sell a product at less than its fair value to

 9   the extent that you are obtaining processing services at

10   a price lower than what you could obtain them in a

11   foreign country.    But the -- the bottom line is you have

12   to look at what the statute explicitly instructs, at the

13   price at which the subject merchandise is sold in the

14   United States.

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Okay.       And accepting that,

16   you -- you have to begin the whole thing, however, with

17   a sale, with a sale into the United States, right?

18              MS. HALLIGAN:             A sale and I --

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:               And I thought this is --

20   this is what you say fails in this case.                     That is the

21   link of the chain that doesn't exist.                     You say there is

22   no sale in the United States.

23              MS. HALLIGAN:             There is an importation of

24   LEU into the United States by the utilities.                     The

25   utilities consume that fuel in their reactors.                     They do

 1   not sell it onward as the company would sell a sweater

 2   or would sell a pasta or would sell Rya rugs.                  That is

 3   something that makes this case somewhat different and --

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:            That is pretty important.

 5   Tell me -- this is a hard area, obviously.                  But the --

 6   imagine -- think of all the toller cases that they've

 7   had.

 8               Now -- now, is this right:                  That in every

 9   one of those cases there were two companies, A and B;

10   and in every one of those cases A sells a finished

11   product into the United States.              And also A sends the

12   product to B to have some major thing done on it.                 In

13   every one of those cases the Commerce Department could

14   say:   We can take A as a Respondent; i.e. we think A

15   might violate the law, because maybe it's an Italian

16   company, or we think B might violate the law.                 Is that

17   true of all those cases?

18               MS. HALLIGAN:          It is true.

19               JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.       Now, if it's

20   true of all those cases, then I think what the opposite

21   position is, what Mr. Farr said, I think -- I think, you

22   know, I will -- he will say:            Look at page 40 and 41 of

23   their brief.   When I look at those pages, I am going to

24   see a lot of cases.     And I bet, when I look them up,

25   those Commerce cases are all going to use the word


                                       42
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   "substantial transformation."             And he will say:   You

 2   see, that's what they did here.

 3                Then he's going to add -- I don't mean to

 4   put words in his mouth if the words are wrong, but --

 5   but he's going to add:       Look at those tolling cases.

 6   Those are all cases where Commerce had a choice of which

 7   to consider the sale.      It could have considered the sale

 8   from the processor A to -- to B to A, the sale if it

 9   wanted to; or it could have considered the sale into the

10   United States if it had wanted to, to be the sale for

11   purposes of calculating the price.

12                And so in choosing between those two, either

13   of which it could have chosen, it chose the latter sale,

14   the final sale, because that's how they could calculate

15   the price.

16                But in your case there is no such person A,

17   because the utilities are not people who could be

18   respondents.   I mean they are not in the same position.

19   There is no sale onwards that they could choose.              So we

20   will go to the other guy, the party -- the person who

21   does the processing.      Are you following what I am

22   saying?

23                MS. HALLIGAN:         Yes.      And then it starts an

24   invidious --

25                JUSTICE BREYER:           And what is the answer to


                                       43

 1   that?

 2                 MS. HALLIGAN:         And here is why that's not

 3   sufficient.    It's the problem of the tail wagging the

 4   dog, right?    What the United States is saying is that

 5   because in this single circumstance we do not have a

 6   downstream sale of pasta, or a sweater, or whatever the

 7   item might be, and we can't go after that transaction,

 8   that, therefore, we are asking this Court to sign off on

 9   essentially rewriting the statute.

10                 The statute refers to a sale of merchandise.

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes.      But, remember, they

12   are saying in the tolling cases, in my words:                 Hey, we

13   could have gone after the processor if we wanted --

14                 MS. HALLIGAN:         But that's --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           -- if there had been a

16   substantial transformation, because the key to this

17   concept of "sale" is the word "substantial"

18   transformation.

19                 MS. HALLIGAN:         Two responses, Your Honor:

20                 First of all, the statute doesn't allow

21   that, and I would recommend to the court the remand

22   response that Commerce provided in the Taiwan

23   semiconductor case.

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:           In which --

25                 MS. HALLIGAN:         The Taiwan semiconductor case

 1   which is cited in the brief.              It explains why the

 2   definition of "export price" and "constructed export

 3   price" means you can't go after a processing

 4   transaction.

 5                 Secondly, in order to find for the

 6   government here and reverse the Federal circuit, you

 7   would effectively have to agree with the government's

 8   position that processing services where they are part of

 9   the manufacturing operation somehow are within the terms

10   of the statute.     And so that would mean that the

11   government can say in this case that because there's no

12   downstream sale that it can capture, it will choose to

13   go after the processing transaction.                      But there is no

14   way to gauge down the road whether it will make the same

15   choice.     And here --

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            What does -- what does the

17   government do with respect to these other transactions

18   where, indeed, the utility does not provide the feed

19   uranium but just pays for, you know, getting -- getting

20   the rods?

21                 MS. HALLIGAN:          In those cases --

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            There is no down -- you

23   know, there is no domestic sale there, either.                      Is it

24   conceivable that there, therefore, can be no dumping in

25   such a case?

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                MS. HALLIGAN:         No.      Those cases -- we -- we

 2   do not disagree -- are a sale of merchandise because the

 3   utility is paying for the entire commodity.

 4                What -- that is a substantial transformation

 5   point, Justice Breyer.       I would like to -- to return to

 6   that.

 7                There are many processing transactions which

 8   involve some kind of substantial transformation where

 9   you have a product like wheat and you turn it into

10   something else like pasta, or wool and you turn it into

11   --

12                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Isn't it true that in all

13   of those cases there is no transfer of ownership of the

14   basic product?   And here -- and I am not sure you have

15   really addressed it --it is a fungible product, and you

16   are assuming you can't tell whether -- when it is in

17   process or whether it is one party's or the other's.

18                But if you could tell and you had some way

19   of identifying just which one here, but they wouldn't

20   care because they are all equally valuable, and if it

21   developed that it was actually a third party's product

22   that was being processed, then there would be a transfer

23   of ownership, and there clearly would be a sale.             Isn't

24   that true?

25                MS. HALLIGAN:         I think not, Your Honor,


                                       46

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   certainly not for the same reasons that you would have

 2   that in -- in a grain elevator.                If the enricher goes

 3   out and purchases the feed and holds title to that feed

 4   while it is enriching it, then, yes, there would be a

 5   transfer of ownership.

 6                JUSTICE STEVENS:             But you have the same

 7   contract you've got here, but you are able to identify

 8   that, in fact, there is a difference in the -- in the

 9   commodity that -- that -- at least not a different raw

10   material that was sent to France and returned.               It is

11   just a substitute.      It seems to me that -- in that

12   context, within the meaning of your argument, that there

13   would have been the transfer of title to that -- that

14   commodity.

15                MS. HALLIGAN:           First of all, you can't tell

16   -- and I don't think there is any -- any dispute as to

17   that fact.    But, secondly, if you look at the common law

18   of --

19                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Well, isn't it true, if

20   you can't tell, the odds are that there is some product

21   the title to which has been transferred?

22                MS. HALLIGAN:           No, I -- I think you

23   certainly can't tell what molecules come out the other

24   end.    I think --

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Can't we assume -- let's

 1   assume that there is.

 2              MS. HALLIGAN:             Yes.

 3              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Assume that there are --

 4   are two sources for the uranium, A and B, and it goes to

 5   the enricher.     A gives it; B gives it.                 A ends up with

 6   B's uranium.     Justice Stevens is saying at some point

 7   there is a transfer of title.

 8              MS. HALLIGAN:             And that's -- that's the

 9   operative premise that I am disagreeing with, with all

10   due respect.

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               No.      We are asking you to

12   accept that hypothetical, so we can --

13              MS. HALLIGAN:             I mean the legal -- the legal

14   consequences is -- is what I am --

15              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Are you saying the utility

16   doesn't have title to what was formerly B's uranium?

17              MS. HALLIGAN:             The utility holds title to a

19              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               The enrichment is done.

20   It's back in the United States.                 The utility says:    This

21   is my uranium.    I have title.             Do you dispute that?

22              MS. HALLIGAN:             No, not at all.

23              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               How does he get the title

24   from -- to the uranium that was formerly B's uranium?

25              MS. HALLIGAN:             Because --

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            At what point did that

 2   title transfer?

 3                 MS. HALLIGAN:          It -- maybe the useful

 4   analogy is money -- is money in the bank, Your Honor.

 5   If I take $100 and I bring it to the bank, ten 10's, and

 6   I take away five 20's, I may not have the same dollar

 7   bills that I brought to the bank, but I don't think

 8   anyone would argue that, somehow, the bank takes title

 9   to my money.     I retain ownership of that, and there is

10   nothing in the contract which suggests that there is any

11   change of ownership that is --

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You don't -- you

13   don't retain ownership of that.                And if you go to the

14   bank and say:     Show me my money, they are not going to

15   say:     Well, here's your money.             They -- they have title

16   to it.     They own it, and you have a claim against the

17   bank to what you gave them.

18                 MS. HALLIGAN:          But the bank could not hold

19   title to that as against me if I came and tried to take

20   the money out of my safe deposit box, nor could the

21   farmers at the -- at the grain elevator be told that

22   they -- they don't have title to the grain.

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Is there any point in time

24   from the time that the -- the processors get ahold of

25   the uranium until the time it leaves their control that

 1   if they went bankrupt, anyone other than the utility

 2   could get ahold of the product?

 3              MS. HALLIGAN:            No.

 4              JUSTICE BREYER:              No.     Okay.

 5              MS. HALLIGAN:            And let me clarify this

 6   because it's an important issue.                These are very

 7   expensive, offshore transactions that the utilities

 8   engage in in order to purchase a feed.                   It is a very

 9   valuable commodity.      So what is critical to the --

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, but if they go

11   bankrupt because -- I mean let's say they don't have all

12   the uranium.    They have got five people who shipped them

13   uranium, and they have only got enough for four.                  Each

14   of the five can't say:        I'm entitled to get mine back.

15              MS. HALLIGAN:            But -- but the system doesn't

16   operate that way, Your Honor.              The contracts provide

17   that the utilities have to deliver feed.                  And it's a

18   very different sort of business that the utilities are

19   engaged in, to go out into the market and make bets

20   based on the price fluctuations for uranium and procure

21   that uranium.

22              The enrichers are not in that business, and

23   so there would be no economic reason or any reason

24   provided for in the contracts for them to proceed that

25   way.

 1               I would like to touch briefly, if I can, on

 2   the purpose of the statute, because the government

 3   relies very strongly on this notion that somehow the

 4   processors' sales have to cognizable in order to further

 5   the antidumping statute.

 6               This law is not a boundless license to

 7   protect domestic industry from any competition.         There

 8   are other statutes that are are written much more

 9   broadly in the trade laws; for example, the

10   countervailing duties law, the safeguards law which

11   allows the Department of Commerce to impose quotas or

12   tariffs on the import -- not the sale but the import of

13   any goods, statutes regarding the protection of

14   intellect0ual property rights, all of which are cited in

15   the -- in the briefs.

16               So the notion that somehow to protect the

17   integrity of the statute you need to rewrite it to allow

18   them to address processing sales exclusively is really

19   not -- not well-founded.

20               Finally, with respect to the loophole

21   question that the government has relied on, I think it's

22   important to focus on what is specifically at issue

23   here.   The government initially argued that it was

24   critical to address this case and these particular

25   transactions because of concerns about agreements with


                                       51

 1   the Russians.

 2                That has been addressed as to U.S. concedes

 3   in its -- legislation that has been implemented by

 4   Congress.    The government has consistently in court and

 5   in its decisions -- not just in the Contract Disputes

 6   Act that you referenced Justice Ginsburg, but in other

 7   cases regarding the UCC which relates to the sale of

 8   goods, the government has said:               These very kinds of

 9   contracts for the processing of uranium are contracts

10   for services.    They are not covered by statutes that

11   reach the sale of goods or the disposal of property.

12                There is nothing that has changed with

13   regard to the statute or with regard to these kinds of

14   transactions; and, accordingly, we would ask you to

15   affirm the Federal Circuit.             If there are no other

16   questions --

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, Ms.

18   Halligan.    Mr. Stewart, you have three minutes

19   remaining.

20                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

21                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

22                              IN NO. 07-1059

23                MR. STEWART:         Thank you.

24                One of the things Ms. Halligan said, and I

25   think it's really a central theme of their brief, is


                                        52
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that utilities come to the enricher for services and not

 2   for goods.   And to understand what it is that utilities

 3   acquire, I think it may be helpful to ask:                 Under what

 4   circumstances would the utility have a valid breach-of-

 5   contract right?

 6                And it is very clear that the enricher's

 7   obligation under the contract is to deliver a specified

 8   quantity and assay of enriched uranium at a specified

 9   time and place.   And if the enricher complies with that

10   obligation, it doesn't matter that the enricher decided

11   to -- what they call in the industry -- "overfeed"; that

12   is, use more feed staff stock and fewer SWU's to produce

13   the final product.

14                And the utility in that circumstance

15   couldn't file a breach-of-contract claim by saying:                 I

16   paid for more SWU's than I actually received.                 Because

17   what the utility had contracted for was a given product.

18                The second thing -- and I think the

19   corollary to that is -- it's potentially misleading to

20   say that every contract is either one for merchandise or

21   one for services, especially when you are contracting to

22   acquire ownership of a commodity that doesn't exist at

23   the time the contract is formed.                 The only way you are

24   going to get to your ultimate objective is for somebody

25   to create it.   And that can generally be described as a


                                         53
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   service, but it still results in the sale of goods.

 2              With respect to the used-car analogy, I

 3   understood Ms. Halligan to acknowledge that -- that that

 4   would be a sale even though the consideration paid by

 5   the customer is partly in cash and partly in kind.                  And

 6   if the customer and the car dealership characterize

 7   their contract as one for car-refurbishment services and

 8   said that the new car the customer receives shall be

 9   deemed to be the used car that it traded in in

10   refurbished form, nobody would contend that that deeming

11   quality should be controlling.

12              Now here the -- the falseness of the

13   proposition that it's the same feedstock is less

14   apparent, but it's equally the case that the utility

15   doesn't receive back its original feedstock.

16              And finally the perspective of tolling

17   regulation in cases, Commerce has essentially said three

18   things:

19              First, we were dealing with a separate

20   question; that is, who is the producer, which sale is

21   relevant, and not whether the goods are covered at all.

22              Second, they said in those situations the

23   tollee was exercising much more control over the

24   ultimate process than is the case here where the

25   utilities don't manufacture anything.                  They simply pay


                                      54

 1   for one of the inputs.

 2                 And, finally, Commerce said that if at some

 3   level of abstraction there is a tension or contradiction

 4   between what we said previously and what we decide

 5   today, then what we decide today controls.                  And Commerce

 6   is entitled to make that determination.

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, Mr.

 8   Stewart.   The case is submitted.

 9                 (Whereupon, at 12:07 p.m. the case was
