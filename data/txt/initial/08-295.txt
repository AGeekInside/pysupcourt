 8             ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY R. OSTRAGER

 9                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10              MR. OSTRAGER:             Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11   please the Court:

12              In 1988, the Second Circuit decided in two

13   separate decisions that a bankruptcy court exercising

14   its core jurisdiction had properly confirmed the plan of

15   reorganization that resolved present and future claims

16   against Johns-Manville and the insurers who funded

17   Manville's reorganization plan.                Last year, despite its

18   decades-old rulings to the contrary, the Second Circuit

19   sustained a collateral attack on the confirmation order

20   and held that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter

21   jurisdiction back in 1986 to enjoin direct actions

22   against Travelers, quote, "based upon, arising out of,

23   or related to," close quote --

24              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Mr. Ostrager, you have

25   characterized the Second Circuit's decision in a way the


                                          4

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Second Circuit did not.        The Second Circuit said:       The

 2   confirmation of the 1986 order stands, but that order

 3   did not encompass what was added in 2004; that is, that

 4   order dealt with the debtor, with Manville and the

 5   insurer's obligation to cover Manville's liability.             The

 6   Second Circuit said:      Now, this 2004 order, which

 7   concerns independent actions against insurers for their

 8   own wrong, was never encompassed in the order that they

 9   affirmed.   So I think it's quite unfair to say it's a

10   collateral attack on the 1986 order.

11               MR. OSTRAGER:          Justice Ginsburg, the

12   bankruptcy court judge, interpreting his own order,

13   explicitly held that the 1986 order was intended and was

14   always intended to enjoin direct actions against

15   Travelers based upon, arising out of, or relating to the

16   insurance policies Manville purchased from Travelers.

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             At the time of the 1986

18   order, had these independent actions started?             I thought

19   at the time of the 1986 order the concerns were suits

20   involving Manville's liability and the insurers'

21   derivative obligation to cover.

22               MR. OSTRAGER:          Justice Ginsburg, at the time

23   of the 1986 order there had been various forms of direct

24   action filed against Manville, and the bankruptcy court

25   concluded, and the Second Circuit recognized, that a


                                        5

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   settlement with the insurers was essential for the

 2   reorganization and rehabilitation of Manville --

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The insurers, to the

 4   extent of the insurance proceeds.                That's what created

 5   the pot that made the settlement fund.                  But what I'm

 6   trying to get at is this extra piece, because the only

 7   information we have is that Manville -- there was the

 8   conversation that's reported in the Chubb brief.                  This

 9   question came up, well, what about actions against the

10   insurers for their own wrongs?              And the answer was, oh,

11   those aren't covered.

12               MR. OSTRAGER:          The plan of reorganization as

13   ultimately confirmed contained the language to which I

14   directed the Court.     It -- a plan of confirmation

15   included all aspects of the resolution of the Manville

16   estate.   The confirmation order was all about ensuring

17   fairness to all claimants.          It was all about expanding

18   the value of the estate, and it was all about

19   rehabilitating the debtor for the benefit of its

20   employees, suppliers, and local claimants.

21               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, Mr. Ostrager, is --

22   help me out, because this is an issue of fact, and I

23   don't have the record in front of me now.                 But didn't

24   the 1986 order expressly include permission for certain

25   actions alleging insurer misconduct to proceed, those


                                        6

 1   that had already been filed?

 2                MR. OSTRAGER:          It did.         It did, yes.

 3                JUSTICE SOUTER:             I drew the implication from

 4   that that the -- that the bankruptcy court thought its

 5   order would be barring such actions if they had not

 6   already been filed.      Am I right on the -- on the -- at

 7   least on the record point?

 8                MR. OSTRAGER:          You are right on the record

 9   point.    However, Judge Lifland in the hearings that were

10   associated with his clarifying order was very explicit

11   that he use the words "based upon, arising out of, or

12   related to" for the express purpose of granting

13   Travelers the broadest relief that could be afforded to

14   Travelers post-confirmation.             And --

15                JUSTICE SOUTER:             But he was saying that --

16   in effect, that was simply articulating rather more than

17   he had done the first time around and what he intended

18   the first time around.

19                MR. OSTRAGER:          Well, he certainly intended

20   to make the cornerstone of the Manville reorganization

21   work.    And as the Second Circuit itself held, in a

22   subsequent collateral attack, the O'Malley case --

23   reported at 100 F.3d 944, a 1996 case where there was a

24   challenge to the bankruptcy court's reaffirmation and

25   continuation of the '86 order, Second Circuit held in


                                         7

 1   1996 that such an injunction is essential to the success

 2   of the settlement, and its continuation was well within

 3   the discretion of the trial court.

 4              JUSTICE ALITO:          Was the Second Circuit's

 5   decision based on an interpretation of the confirmation

 6   order or was it based on subject matter jurisdiction?

 7              MR. OSTRAGER:          The Second Circuit order was

 8   explicitly predicated on the theory that the bankruptcy

 9   court lacked subject matter jurisdiction back in 1986 to

10   enjoin these direct actions.

11              Now, we submit that the Second Circuit

12   clearly erred, because it conflated the entirely

13   distinct concept of the court's subject matter

14   jurisdiction and the propriety of the court's exercise

15   of subject matter jurisdiction.             This was a distinction

16   that this Court expressly recognized 75 years ago in the

17   Continental Illinois v. Rock Island Railroad.

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, there is a

19   distinction between jurisdiction and whether the action

20   taken by the bankruptcy court comes within the statute.

21   But at some point, at some point surely the two overlap.

22   I mean, suppose -- you know, you say simply because it

23   is a bankruptcy action it comes within the bankruptcy

24   clause and there is jurisdiction.               But what if the

25   bankruptcy court in connection with the bankruptcy


                                       8

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   decrees that a totally unrelated company has to pay a

 2   certain amount of money and it's conceded that this

 3   company has no relation to the bankruptcy, but the court

 4   says, this is a national problem and this other company

 5   ought to contribute.

 6                 MR. OSTRAGER:         Justice Scalia --

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Do you think that would be

 8   within the bankruptcy power?

 9                 MR. OSTRAGER:         Justice Scalia, clearly the

10   Congress in fashioning over the years expansive

11   safeguards facilitating growth and change in the

12   bankruptcy law as our nation's commerce has grown has

13   done that.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            They can do anything under

15   the bankruptcy law?

16                 MR. OSTRAGER:         No.      Subject to appropriate

17   safeguards.    Now, in order to confirm a plan of

18   reorganization a -- a debtor must meet all 16

19   requirements of section 1129.

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay, that's fine.   I'm not

21   arguing about that.      I'm arguing about the principle

22   that you are asking us to accept, to wit, that this

23   challenge cannot possibly be based upon jurisdiction.

24   Surely there are some things that simply do not fall

25   within the bankruptcy power.              Isn't that true?

 1               MR. OSTRAGER:          I would agree that that is

 2   so.

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay.       And that --

 4               MR. OSTRAGER:          This is not our case.

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, what you are saying

 6   is this does fall within the bankruptcy power.                   But

 7   don't tell us that it is not a challenge based upon the

 8   jurisdiction of the court and based exclusively upon the

 9   statute.   It could be based upon both.

10               MR. OSTRAGER:          Justice Scalia, I would say

11   that the bankruptcy court in this case unquestionably

12   had jurisdiction over the Manville reorganization under

13   28 U.S.C. 1334(b) as the Manville reorganization was a

14   civil proceeding arising under Title 11 of the

15   Bankruptcy Code.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The Second Circuit's view

17   was that the bankruptcy court has no authority, no

18   subject matter jurisdiction, when the debtor -- debtor's

19   liability is not in question.             The Second Circuit

20   thought, rightly or wrongly, that when the liability is

21   between two- the question is between two nondebtors,

22   Travelers on the one hand, the claimants on the other,

23   Manville is not in the picture.              That's what the Second

24   Circuit said, it falls outside the domain of the

25   bankruptcy court, and that could be wrong or it could be


                                       10
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   right.   But in the Second Circuit's view the bankruptcy

 2   court lacked authority to deal with the nondebtors'

 3   liability to the claimants.

 4               MR. OSTRAGER:            There were, Justice Ginsburg,

 5   60 pages of findings of fact indicating that the direct

 6   action suits against Manville was an end run around the

 7   --

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               The direct actions

 9   against Travelers.

10               MR. OSTRAGER:            Against Travelers, were an

11   end run around the discharge of Manville, and that all

12   of the claims against Travelers arose out of and flowed

13   to the insurance relationship.

14               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Mr. Ostrager, may I ask

15   this question.   I -- I was unable to find the complaints

16   in the voluminous filings here.                Do any of the

17   plaintiffs' cases seek recovery from assets of the

18   estate that would reduce the payments to creditors of

19   Manville?

20               MR. OSTRAGER:            Well, the reason that this is

21   so critical is that --

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Can you answer my

23   question?

24               MR. OSTRAGER:            They do not seek assets of

25   the estate, although Travelers would potentially have


                                         11

 1   contribution claims against Manville because all of the

 2   claims --

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But why does the

 4   bankruptcy court have jurisdiction to enjoin third party

 5   actions against some creditor of the estate?

 6               MR. OSTRAGER:            The Respondents actually

 7   concede that bankruptcy courts have subject matter

 8   jurisdiction to enjoin actions against non-debtors in

 9   appropriate circumstances.            That's the Chubb brief at

10   pages 22 and 40.

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But if those actions won't

12   affect the estate at all, I just don't understand sort

13   of the basic theory, and I don't really understand the

14   theory of the plaintiffs' cases, either.                  I don't

15   understand -- I can't figure out what anybody expects to

16   collect from Travelers for what they did.                  The fact that

17   they defended cases certainly was proper for them as an

18   insurance company.      This is mysterious case to me.

19               MR. OSTRAGER:            Justice Stevens , you are

20   absolutely right that these direct action cases have

21   never been sustained because they all relate to the

22   discharge by Travelers of Travelers' obligations as

23   Manville's insurer, and that's one of the reasons why

24   the bankruptcy court judge issued the injunction.

25               Now, the Second --

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             These were cases in the

 2   State courts and, as I understand it, so far none of

 3   them have succeeded.

 4               MR. OSTRAGER:          That is correct.

 5               The Second Circuit also completely ignored

 6   the enactment by Congress of sections 524(g) and (h) of

 7   the Bankruptcy Code, which are modelled on the Manville

 8   reorganization, and expressly grandfather the Manville

 9   injunction as a final order that could not be revoked.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How could you say they

11   ignored it when they had several pages devoted to 524,

12   and they said it was -- it didn't cover these so-called

13   direct actions, which really aren't what we generally

14   call direct actions.      But the Second Circuit did address

15   what Congress did to codify essentially the Manville

16   device.

17               MR. OSTRAGER:          I would respectfully

18   disagree.   524(g) specifically says that asbestos --

19   asbestos channeling injunction "shall be valid and

20   enforceable and may not be revoked or modified by any

21   court except through direct appeal."                    And 524(h)(i)

22   specifically says that the pre-1994 asbestos channeling

23   injunctions shall be considered to meet all of the

24   requirements of 524(g)(2), which is in our appendix at

25   page 471, which means that they automatically meet

 1   524(g)(3)(A)(i) and may not be revoked or modified

 2   except through appeal.

 3                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           How do -- how do these

 4   pending actions have any impact on fulfilling the

 5   objections -- objectives of the channeling instruction

 6   or affect the disposition of the assets in the estate?

 7   I just don't understand it.

 8                 MR. OSTRAGER:         The essential issue here,

 9   Justice Stevens, is that there would have been no

10   Manville reorganization --

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Yes, but there has been

12   one and it's been a success.

13                 MR. OSTRAGER:         It's been a remarkable

14   success.   Asbestos claimants have received -- 660,000

15   asbestos claimants have received --

16                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           None of whom would be

17   affected --

18                 MR. OSTRAGER:         -- more than $2.8 billion.

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But none of whom would be

20   affected if these suits go forward, as I understand it.

21   I'm missing something very important, I think.

22                 MR. OSTRAGER:         The point is that there

23   couldn't have been have a Manville reorganization

24   without the insurance settlements.                  The Second Circuit

25   recognized that.    The Second Circuit further recognized

 1   that these direct actions violate the express terms of

 2   the injunction that Judge Lifland, the bankruptcy judge,

 3   granted in this case.

 4              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Why isn't it harmless

 5   error?

 6              MR. OSTRAGER:           The 524(g)(4)(A)(2)(iii)

 7   specifically authorizes asbestos channeling injunctions

 8   that bar any claim against the third party to be

 9   directly or indirectly liable for claims against the

10   debtor.

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So if part of the

12   settlement -- I mean, Travelers says, we need to get

13   more out of this before we're going to put in all the

14   policy funds; the bankruptcy judge says, well, you are

15   going to be immune from any traffic accident liability;

16   and there is a traffic accident and Travelers said:

17   Well, the bankruptcy court said I don't have to pay.                   Is

18   that all right?   It's within the jurisdiction as you

19   read it because it involves Travelers it's related to

20   the funds they submitted into the trust account.                 Is

21   that --

22              MR. OSTRAGER:           Mr. Chief justice, that would

23   not be covered and that is certainly not what the

24   bankruptcy court intended or said.

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  No, I know they that

 1   didn't intend anything with respect to traffic

 2   accidents.     But my question is how far does your theory

 3   reach?

 4                 MR. OSTRAGER:          This Court has recognized in

 5   the Katz case that bankruptcy extends beyond the res.

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So there would be

 7   jurisdiction in the hypothetical that I posed?

 8                 MR. OSTRAGER:          Not in the hypothetical you

 9   posed.    On direct appeal that would clearly be excluded

10   because it wouldn't meet --

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Right, on direct

12   appeal.     Are you suggesting it would be barred -- that

13   Travelers would have protection under a collateral

14   attack?

15                 MR. OSTRAGER:          I don't think we need to

16   reach that issue in this case.                There is no question

17   that in connection with exercising its subject matter

18   jurisdiction over the Manville reorganization the

19   bankruptcy court had the power under section 105 of the

20   Bankruptcy Code to issue any order, process or judgment

21   necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of

22   Title 11.

23                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, but it seems to me

24   you --

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But you acknowledge that

 1   that's not true.    You acknowledge that they couldn't

 2   have issued the hypothetical order that the Chief

 3   Justice proposed, even if that was necessary, even if

 4   Travelers said, we will not kick in the money up to the

 5   limits of our liability unless you make us immune from

 6   all traffic accidents.        You acknowledged that that's no

 7   good, right?

 8                MR. OSTRAGER:          In this order the -- the

 9   limitation on the injunction was based upon arising out

10   of or related to.    I would submit that the traffic

11   accident falls outside the scope of --

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Why is that?    It --

13   it involves one -- it involves the insurance company,

14   its coverage of Johns-Manville.               And the Travelers is

15   saying:    Look, we are not going to do it unless you give

16   us this -- this broader immunity, and the bankruptcy

17   judge does it.    I don't know why it would be outside the

18   jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.                    It is clearly

19   related to allowing the settlement to go forward.

20                MR. OSTRAGER:          Well, I -- I think we have an

21   act of Congress, 524(g) and (h), which --

22                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             May I interrupt you

23   there?    Because you told me that the Second Circuit

24   ignored 524(g), and I'm looking at page 33a of the

25   petition for cert and the Second Circuit addresses

 1   524(g), and its discussion continues for a couple pages.

 2   I don't see how that's ignoring the issue.

 3              MR. OSTRAGER:          With -- with respect, I

 4   believe that there are express findings of fact that the

 5   bankruptcy court made which were adopted by the district

 6   court, which were embraced in full by the Second

 7   Circuit, and we have a -- a pure issue of law here.

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And may I -- may I have

 9   an answer to my question about the Second Circuit

10   ignoring 524(g) when they devoted two and a half pages

11   to it?

12              MR. OSTRAGER:          I believe that they clearly

13   misinterpreted the intent of 524(g) and (h).            They

14   clearly misperceived the fact that Congress had

15   expressly grandfathered the Manville injunction in

16   524(g).

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Another mystery in this

18   most mysterious case:     If it was so clear that the

19   original order, the 1986 order, insured Travelers that

20   it would have no liability for asbestos claims, period,

21   then why did it put up $400 million, much more than it

22   had put up originally, in order to settle with people

23   who were bringing precisely that kind of claim?

24              MR. OSTRAGER:          During the course of the five

25   years of proceedings before the bankruptcy court, the


                                      18

 1   case was referred to mediation before the Honorable

 2   Mario Cuomo.    And in connection with that mediation

 3   there was a business decision made to secure releases

 4   much broader than the injunction that was contained.

 5   Travelers would in connection with the mediation process

 6   participate in a settlement.

 7              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               What was the difference

 8   between the release that you say flowed from the 1986

 9   order and the releases that were obtained with the

10   $400 million?

11              MR. OSTRAGER:            One was a general -- one was

12   a general release and the other was a release based

13   upon, arising out of, or related to the Manville

14   insurance policies that Travelers purchased --

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               So, specifically what was

16   not included in the 1986 release that was included as a

17   result of the settlement negotiations?

18              MR. OSTRAGER:            It -- an absolute, broad

19   general release by 80,000 people.                 Now, I want to --

20              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But I would like to know

21   the difference.   What would -- what would Travelers be

22   liable for under the 1986 order as you read it, that

23   they got freedom from as a result of this settlement?

24              MR. OSTRAGER:            Potentially -- potentially

25   the traffic accident that Mr. Chief Justice referenced.

 1                 I want to reserve --

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So then -- so that the

 3   2000 clarification order did exonerate them from traffic

 4   accidents?

 5                 MR. OSTRAGER:          It's a general release.

 6                 I -- I want to conclude and reserve the

 7   balance of my time by noting that "Redefining the scope

 8   of a long-final confirmation order unravels intricate

 9   transactions so as to knock the props out from under the

10   authorization for every transaction that has taken

11   place."     That's a quote from the Second Circuit's

12   decision in Chateaugay Corp., 10 F.3d 944.                And that

13   creates an unmanageable, uncontrollable situation for

14   courts and litigants alike.

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I have one question

16   before you reserve the rest of your time.                 That is, you

17   said this is -- this is a sweeping release that

18   Travelers got in settlement for the claims of many

19   parties.     But some people were not there and those are

20   the people who still want to bring their claims.

21                 MR. OSTRAGER:          I would say that the --

22                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I haven't asked my

23   question.

24                 MR. OSTRAGER:          Oh, I'm sorry.

 1   -- what notice did the people who were left out of the

 2   settlement, who were not part of the settlement, who

 3   say, so we want our day in court -- what notice did they

 4   have and what opportunity to be heard?

 5                 MR. OSTRAGER:         There was broad notice to the

 6   people who would be affected by the issuance of the

 7   injunction.    This Court has recognized --

 8                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           How did they get the

 9   notice?   You say it's broad notice.                     What exactly was

10   done?

11                 MR. OSTRAGER:         There were newspaper blasts

12   repeatedly, all sorts of public notice, radio

13   announcements.    But we are dealing with a special

14   remedial scheme that expressly forecloses successive

15   litigation by non-litigants and in the bankruptcy

16   context --

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            How can it be successive

18   when they didn't even get their -- I mean they -- these

19   people haven't had a day in court.                  They may have a

20   claim that's no good.       All State courts so far have said

21   their claim is no good.         But they have a right --

22                 MR. OSTRAGER:         This is what Congress has

23   made provision for in 524(g) and (h).                     This is what I

24   believe the Court contemplated in Ortiz at page 846,

25   also in Martin v. Wilks, also in Taylor v. Stargell.

 1   And I think this rule was foreshadowed as long ago as

 2   Mullaney v. Central Hanover Trust Company.

 3              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              The rule -- the

 4   particular rule that I am asking you about is that

 5   people who have not had their day in court can be

 6   precluded --

 7              MR. OSTRAGER:           Yes.

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              -- on the basis of

 9   newspaper notice and radio announcements?

10              MR. OSTRAGER:           As the court said in

11   Mullaney, beneficiaries whose interests are either

12   conjectural or future, although they could be --

13              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              That was the best

14   possible notice, which included regular mail notice.

15              MR. OSTRAGER:           Not -- not with respect to

16   future claimants who haven't had any disease.                     There has

17   to be finality.   That's what 524(g) and (h) says.                    A

18   confirmation order has to be final.                     As the Court said

19   in Stohl, there has to be a beginning of litigation and

20   a place to end litigation.

21              I would like to reserve, if I may, with

22   respect, the balance of my time for rebuttal.

 3                 MR. ISSACHAROFF:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 4   it please the Court:

 5                 As the Court has indicated, this is a

 6   question of jurisdiction, and the issue is whether a

 7   bankruptcy court may enter an order that goes to a

 8   nondebtor, offers a release against independent State

 9   law claims.

10                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, as to the 1986 order

11   it seemed to me that the counsel for the Petitioner

12   might have answered the question posed by the Chief

13   Justice with the traffic accident hypothetical:              That is

14   an interesting question of subject matter jurisdiction,

15   and maybe there is subject matter jurisdiction, maybe

16   there isn't, but that issue as to the 1986 order is

17   final.     Now, that brings us to the -- the later order,

18   2004, 2006.     And then the question is whether or not

19   that's just a reiteration of the earlier order or a

20   further expansion of jurisdiction that could be reached.

21                 Why couldn't the counsel for Petitioner have

22   given that answer?

23                 MR. ISSACHAROFF:            Well, the counsel for

24   Petitioner can't give that answer for two separate

25   reasons.     The first has to do with the subject matter


                                         23
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   jurisdiction limitation of a bankruptcy court:                That as

 2   soon as the release is outside the debtor's estate and

 3   impact on the debtor's estate or the debtor/creditor

 4   relationship, that places it beyond the power of the

 5   bankruptcy court.

 6              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But, putting aside

 7   questions of notice, if these parties had been

 8   represented in the appeal of the 1986 order, maybe the

 9   subject matter jurisdiction ruling was correct; maybe it

10   was incorrect; but it's done.

11              MR. ISSACHAROFF:              If -- if these parties had

12   been present, if they had been appealed, if this had

13   been in effect a settlement orchestrated through the

14   bankruptcy court, then there might be the -- the ability

15   to liquidate the class action.

16              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              So then it's just a

17   question of personal jurisdiction and notice.             It is not

18   a question of subject matter jurisdiction, because

19   subject matter jurisdiction can be concluded in an

20   earlier order and there can be no collateral attack if

21   you've been a party.

22              MR. ISSACHAROFF:              Justice Kennedy, it is a

23   question of subject matter jurisdiction if it is not to

 1   out and to object --

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            I don't think there's a

 3   notice question.     I thought there were 5,538 plaintiffs

 4   here and -- that you represent, and every one of them

 5   has already gotten money from the trust except for two

 6   who have filed claims against it.                  So I imagine if

 7   that's so, they certainly know about it.

 8                 MR. ISSACHAROFF:            They do know about it.

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay, so there is no notice

10   problem.     If there were a notice problem I guess there

11   would be a due process problem.                So, I don't see what

12   notice has any more to do with this than the NCAA

13   tournament.

14                 MR. ISSACHAROFF:            Justice Breyer, I

15   misunderstood Justice's Kennedy's question to be about

16   1986, not about the present.              And in 1980 -- in the

17   original confirmation, these people had not filed suit,

18   had not made claims at the time.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, in the original

20   confirmation there are problems in asbestos cases, like

21   other bankruptcy cases, of giving people notice.

22   Bankrupt people often give notice to many who aren't

23   there.     And I don't know that -- maybe there is a

24   constitutional problem with some of them, but I would

25   have thought jurisdiction under the statute is clear.

 1              MR. ISSACHAROFF:             Well, the question is --

 2              JUSTICE BREYER:             What is -- is this about

 3   notice?

 4              MR. ISSACHAROFF:             No, I don't believe it is

 5   about notice.

 6              JUSTICE BREYER:             I didn't think so.          I

 7   thought this was about the case of the meaning of the

 8   words in the statute that they have authority in the

 9   bankruptcy court to issue any order, process or judgment

10   that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the

11   provisions of the title.         And we've said that the test

12   is whether the outcome of the proceeding -- this is the

13   other State proceeding -- could conceivably have any

14   effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy.

15   So, as I understood it, that's the test.

16              MR. ISSACHAROFF:             I agree.

17              JUSTICE BREYER:             That's what -- that's what

18   this Court said.   Now, they may be few and far between,

19   an order like this, but where there are special reasons

20   for it -- suppose it's a pension fund and you want to

21   reorganize the company and this is the employees' --

22   they're -- the employees' pension fund's worried about

23   claims which are related directly.                 Or suppose it's an

24   officer, or suppose it's a worker, and to reorganize the

25   company you must cut the claims off.                    And otherwise, it

 1   is down the drain for everyone, no more money in the

 2   fund, no more jobs for the employees.

 3                 Now, what is it here that would say there is

 4   no special circumstance such that a bankruptcy judge can

 5   ever do it, no matter what?

 6                 MR. ISSACHAROFF:           In -- in your example,

 7   Justice Breyer, you rely upon this Court's decision in

 8   Celotex, which adopted the Pacor test from the Third

 9   Circuit.   And in each case that has applied that, the

10   question is whether there is a potential impact upon the

11   estate of the bankrupt.         The critical issue in this case

12   is that not a single one of the claims that is presented

13   ir seeks to be enjoined here has any potential impact on

14   the --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Is what you are saying also

16   true of the various other asbestos cases that have, I

17   think, done this?

18                 MR. ISSACHAROFF:           There is no asbestos case

19   that I am aware of that has released third party claims

20   that have no impact on the debtor.                  I am not aware of a

21   single one.

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, of course, this has

23   enormous practical impact on the debtor.                  If not him --

24   not this one, because it's already a done deal -- you

25   will never get insurance companies --

 1                 MR. ISSACHAROFF:            No, I don't --

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            -- to go into this kind of

 3   thing if they are going to be sued for the very act of

 4   helping the debtor defend the asbestos cases.              And so, I

 5   can't imagine an insurance company in its right mind

 6   going into that when in fact all these suits are still

 7   open.     That presumably is why the bankruptcy judge cut

 8   it off.

 9                 MR. ISSACHAROFF:            I think that the facts of

10   record indicate that Travelers went into this particular

11   deal full well knowing that it was not getting this kind

12   of release because that kind of release was not

13   available.     And I think --

14                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            What do you -- what do you

15   make of the provision of the 1986 order to the effect

16   that, as I understand it and as I asked your brother a

17   moment ago, existing claims based upon misbehavior of

18   the -- of the insurance company were not cut off?              The

19   reasonable implication, I think, of that is that any

20   future claims based upon insurance company misconduct

21   would be cut off by the terms of the '86 order.

22                 What -- what do you say about that

23   implication?

24                 MR. ISSACHAROFF:            Justice Souter, I would

25   say two things.     First of all, that the record speaks to

 1   specific negotiations between Travelers and Manville and

 2   between all the insurers and Manville on prospective

 3   liabilities of the -- of the insurance companies, so

 4   that the bankruptcy court can be read to be just

 5   cleaning up what had happened retrospectively up until

 6   that point.

 7                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Yes, but it was prospective

 8   liability based upon misconduct of the insurance

 9   company, not merely derivative of -- of its insurance

10   contract in -- in the conventional sense.

11                 MR. ISSACHAROFF:           I -- I understand that.

12   But it's also important -- I think that there was a

13   question raised by Justice Alito a minute ago about what

14   exactly had happened in 1986 and whether the Second

15   Circuit was making findings of fact or findings of law.

16                 In 1988, in the MacArthur case, the Second

17   Circuit relied on section 1334(d) as the jurisdictional

18   basis for upholding the district -- the bankruptcy

19   order.   Section 1334(d), which is now recodified as

20   1334(e), has to do only with the disposition of the

21   assets of the estate, the property of the estate.

22                 And so, the Second Circuit order in 19 -- in

23   1988, which is the controlling legal authority on what

24   the scope of the release was, went only to the property

25   of the estate.    And so, I don't think that there was any


                                        29

 1   understanding at the time by anyone that there was a

 2   release of claims that were independent of the property

 3   of the estate or made -- or had no hold upon or

 4   potential impact upon the property of the estate.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:             Why does it say -- it

 6   doesn't say that.    What it says in the release is it

 7   says:   We are releasing or everybody is enjoined from

 8   bringing a suit for policy claims against Travelers, and

 9   a policy claim is any and all claims based upon, arising

10   out of, or relating to any insurance policy.

11               And then the bankruptcy judge, in thousands

12   of findings, I guess, said that your lawsuits do relate

13   to the relevant insurance policies.                      Indeed, the claims

14   are based upon the joint -- the obligation of Travelers

15   to defend those very policies, given the obligation to

16   defend Johns-Manville.

17               So the relation is exceedingly close, and

18   the language covers it, and there are thousands of pages

19   of findings, I guess, that show that.

20               MR. ISSACHAROFF:             Well, Your Honor, some of

21   the releases that are in effect in this case go to

22   conduct that occurred after 1986.                 Some of them have to

23   do with claims.   For example, the Wise claim which is

24   referred to in the Second Circuit's opinion has to do

25   with claims that have nothing to do with the coverage of

 1   Manville.    They have to do with actions taken with

 2   regard to other insurers.           This is an exceedingly --

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Settlement clauses often

 4   release future claims; standard stuff in a release

 5   clause.

 6                MR. ISSACHAROFF:            Absolutely, Your Honor.

 7   Contract clauses do it and class actions do it,

 8   consensual agreements, when there is notice, the

 9   opportunity to opt out, and there is volition; they

10   often release much broader.             But a bankruptcy court is

11   an extraordinary proceeding.             A bankruptcy court is an

12   obligation that rights are terminated without any

13   consensual --

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But that is subject matter

15   jurisdiction and that is foreclosed.                     Now, if you are

16   talking about personal jurisdiction that may be

17   something else.

18                MR. ISSACHAROFF:            No, I'm not talking --

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But you're talking about

20   subject matter jurisdiction and that has been foreclosed

21   by the earlier Circuit Court of Appeals' opinion.                     And

22   the court of appeals' opinion that we are reviewing now

23   seems to conflate that issue.

24                MR. ISSACHAROFF:            I don't believe so, Your

25   Honor.    I think that in the 1988 opinion in the

 1   MacArthur case, the Second Circuit was quite clear that

 2   all that was being released was claims against insurance

 3   proceeds that had been delivered and had become property

 4   of the estate, whose depletion could affect the estate.

 5              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Okay.       If that is -- if

 6   that is the case -- let's assume that that is -- that it

 7   was that narrow.    The fact remains, however, that at

 8   this point, as Justice Kennedy has suggested several

 9   times, my understanding is at least that you cannot

10   collaterally attack the jurisdiction of the court who

11   entered the order it did.           And the only claim that you

12   can make now is that the order by its terms did not

13   cover your cases.

14              Do you agree?

15              MR. ISSACHAROFF:              I agree that that is the

16   general rule, that is correct.               I agree further that the

17   Second Circuit expressly held at page 31a that the error

18   of the bankruptcy court was that it subsequently

19   interpreted the order more broadly than the Second

20   Circuit had affirmed in 1988.              I think that that's the

21   heart of the case, because --

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:              So it's a question of the

23   scope of the order?

24              MR. ISSACHAROFF:              Yes, it is.

25              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Okay.

 1                 MR. ISSACHAROFF:             Yes, it is.          There is a

 2   question which this Court has actually not addressed,

 3   which is about the prospective application of an order

 4   that is entered without subject matter jurisdiction.                          I

 5   don't think there is any case squarely on point.

 6                 Certainly there are cases that allow

 7   prospective collateral challenges to an order entered

 8   without personal jurisdiction.                 I don't think the Court

 9   has addressed the subject matter jurisdiction, but it

10   doesn't have to --

11                 JUSTICE ALITO:           But didn't this --

12                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             I didn't mean to cut you

13   off.     I'm sorry.

14                 MR. ISSACHAROFF:             I don't think the Court

15   has to address this here, Your Honor, because in this

16   case, the initial order only went -- as affirmed by the

17   Second Circuit, only went to the property of the estate.

18   And second --

19                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             May I then raise a question

20   there?     I mean, I think there is a legitimate question

21   about that, given the -- given the rather general terms

22   of the -- of the scope of the order.                       And I would like

23   your response to this.          It seems to me as a background

24   consideration that we should have in mind in

25   interpreting how broad that order was.                      It's been raised


                                          33

 1   a couple times; Justice Breyer raised it a moment ago.

 2   And it's this:   It is one argument to say that the

 3   bankruptcy court does not have jurisdiction, and

 4   derivatively an order that it issued should not be

 5   interpreted to cover, any claim that does not affect or

 6   cannot deplete the bankruptcy estate taken as a given

 7   fact at the time this later case is brought.

 8              Another view of jurisdiction would be that

 9   the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction and hence an order

10   might be interpreted to cover any cases which, if

11   contemplated, would have precluded the settlement that

12   created the bankruptcy estate.              If Travelers had thought

13   that it was going to be liable for these cases of

14   insurer misconduct, it might very well have said:                We're

15   not forking over X hundred millions of dollars, leaving

16   this exposure open.     So that the bankruptcy estate would

17   never have attained the size that it attained if the --

18   if the insurer and everybody else had not understood

19   that these later claims would be -- were being cut off.

20              Is that argument a relevant -- number one,

21   is that a legitimate jurisdictional argument?              And

22   number two, is it a relevant argument that we should

23   bear in mind -- in trying to figure out how broad the

24   '86 order really was?

25              MR. ISSACHAROFF:             Your Honor, you gave two

 1   alternative definitions of jurisdiction.                     The first one

 2   we have no problem with.          Obviously that's our

 3   argument --

 4                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Everybody accepts at that

 5   much.

 6                 MR. ISSACHAROFF:           Right.          The second one, I

 7   think that this Court has to go back to the Syngenta

 8   case, which I think is quite instructive on this point.

 9   In Syngenta there was a settlement in a Federal court

10   action.   There is no question that the parties settled,

11   that the monies were paid, everything was done pursuant

12   to that settlement.       Then one of the parties goes into

13   State court and files a claim that was clearly subsumed

14   within the settlement.

15                 The district court tried to issue an order,

16   saying:   I have to have power over this, because

17   otherwise there could never have been a settlement.                    And

18   this Court unanimously reversed on the grounds that that

19   had to be brought through the State court system,

20   because you could not get jurisdiction simply because of

21   the expediency, the necessity, any of these terms do not

22   afford an affirmative grant of jurisdiction to the

23   Court.    So I think --

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Can you answer the

25   question practically, the insurers would not have

 1   settled, there would have been no 1986 order, if they

 2   didn't have this broader liability?                      They say without

 3   global protections they never would have contributed to

 4   the trust fund.    And I would like you to answer that

 5   question.

 6               MR. ISSACHAROFF:             We don't know that, Your

 7   Honor.   We know that the record indicates that they did

 8   not believe in 1985, when they signed a letter among all

 9   the counsel that was submitted to the court, that they

10   were getting any such release.               So there's nothing in

11   the record that indicates that they would not have gone

12   into this deal, and in fact, there have been many, many

13   asbestos workouts since that time, none of which have

14   releases that do not affect the debtor's estate.

15               So I don't know that the factual premise is

16   there.   But let's assume that it was, for the purposes

17   of the question.    Let's assume that no insurance company

18   would go -- go into this, unless they get releases that

19   go far beyond normal jurisdiction of a bankruptcy court.

20   I think that under Syngenta that has to be given to them

21   by Congress.    Congress in 1334 gave specific forms of

22   jurisdiction.    It gave the "arising under" and "arising

23   in" which pertained to the activities of the bankrupt,

24   of the debtor; and it gave "related to" and "related

25   to," as this Court interpreted in Celotex, adopting the


                                        36

 1   Third Circuit standard, "related to" means that it has

 2   an impact upon the estate of the debtor.

 3                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Isn't that what the Congress

 4   gave them in the 1994 Bankruptcy Act?

 5                 MR. ISSACHAROFF:            No.      The Bankruptcy Act

 6   actually has very interesting language on point.                  The

 7   Bankruptcy Act says, in 524(g)(4)(ii), says that the

 8   relief is for demands on the debtor, that flow from

 9   demands on the debtor, and by reason of the demands on

10   the debtor.    That is the trigger language before we get

11   to Roman numeral (iii), which has to do with insurance.

12                 So if one actually looks at the statute, the

13   form of the statute is that there is releases to the

14   extent that there is a claim of derivative liability.

15                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Do you dispute the

16   proposition that that statute was passed in large part

17   for the purpose of codifying what was done in this case?

18                 MR. ISSACHAROFF:            I do not --

19                 JUSTICE ALITO:          The sort of thing that was

20   done in this case?

21                 MR. ISSACHAROFF:            I do not dispute that at

22   all.   But what was done in this case was not simply what

23   Judge Lifland did, but what Judge Lifland did as

24   affirmed by the Second Circuit.                The bankruptcy court

25   does not have stand-alone powers to make determinations

 1   as pertain to, particularly, common law actions.                   That

 2   goes back to the Marathon Pipeline issue that this Court

 3   had to -- had to address and that Congress sought to fix

 4   by maintaining a tight hold on the "relating to"

 5   jurisdiction of the Court and making sure that that's

 6   reviewable by the district court and by the court of

 7   appeals.   So the -- yes, Congress codified the -- the

 8   Manville deal in -- in 1994, but they did so as it was

 9   interpreted by the controlling courts.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:              In your view, if Smith has

11   a 2 or $4 billion claim against company X and the

12   pension fund together, company X is in bankruptcy, and

13   so the judge says:      "I want to enjoin this claim, we

14   will settle it," you know, but the pension fund --

15   doesn't -- doesn't the bankruptcy judge -- if in fact

16   without the pension fund you couldn't reorganize,

17   wouldn't the bankruptcy judge have authority to cut off

18   the claim against the pension fund?

19               It's a question of whether the company goes

20   down the drain or whether it doesn't.                     And --

21               MR. ISSACHAROFF:              The rule --

22               JUSTICE BREYER:              -- the pension fund is all

23   mixed up in this together.

24               MR. ISSACHAROFF:              The rule of thumb, Justice

25   Breyer, is that if there is an automatic indemnity

 1   against the -- the --

 2              JUSTICE BREYER:              No, there is nothing here

 3   in indemnity.

 4              MR. ISSACHAROFF:              Then our position is that

 5   it does not have authority.

 6              JUSTICE BREYER:              And that would be true of

 7   all the workforce and they have claims against the

 8   individual members of the workforce?                      They have --     it

 9   seems to me it would be an unusual case, I agree with

10   you on that, but to say never -- to say never is what is

11   bothering me.

12              MR. ISSACHAROFF:              Well, I think that it

13   comes down to two questions, Justice Breyer.                      One is

14   whether the constitutional authority under Article I

15   reaches beyond --

16              JUSTICE BREYER:              Well, why not -- because

17   there is a good constitutional protection; it's called

18   the due process clause.         If the bankruptcy judge goes

19   too far, it's a due process violation.

20              MR. ISSACHAROFF:              No, I don't -- I -- I

21   disagree with that, Justice Breyer.                      I think that the

22   bankruptcy court has to point to statutory authority.

23              JUSTICE BREYER:              Well, there's language,

24   broad language.

25              MR. ISSACHAROFF:              Broad language.

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:            Broad language.

 2                MR. ISSACHAROFF:            Yes, in the statute, yes.

 3   Yes, there is broad language in the statute.                   The

 4   "relating to" language is quite broad.                   But the

 5   "relating to" language has been interpreted, and every

 6   court that has looked at it, this Court and -- this

 7   Court and every court of appeals, without any dissent in

 8   any court of appeals that has looked at this issue --

 9   has decided that "relating to" means an impact on the

10   estate.    Without that, the bankruptcy power has no

11   tethers.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

14                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACOB C. COHN

15                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

16                CHUBB INDEMNITY INSURANCE COMPANY

17                MR. COHN:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

18   please the Court:

19                A discharge in bankruptcy wipes away a

20   debtor's liability for its prepetition conduct.                    Yet

21   Travelers' interpretation of the 1986 orders gives

22   Travelers broader protection than even Manville could

23   obtain because it gives Travelers immunity for its

24   knowledge.    Bankruptcy discharges do not erase a

25   debtor's knowledge.

 1                If Manville started making asbestos products

 2   again after its discharge, it would not be immune for

 3   claims that it acted with the knowledge that asbestos is

 4   dangerous.    Yet, that is precisely the protection that

 5   Travelers argues that it is entitled to here.

 6                And to take, for example, the Wise

 7   complaint -- which The Travelers, Petitioners, put forth

 8   as a typical claim here -- and you look at the class

 9   they purport to represent, they purport to represent a

10   class of disappointed claimants against three companies,

11   Combustion Engineering, AC&S, and A&I, none of which are

12   Manville.    They claim that they are not seeking even to

13   recover for asbestos bodily injury claims.                 Instead,

14   they claim that they settled their claims too cheaply

15   with Combustion Engineering because, for example, in the

16   1990s allegedly, decades, 15 years after the

17   confirmation and discharge of Manville, Travelers in

18   defending Combustion Engineering, with the knowledge

19   that asbestos is dangerous or whatever from working with

20   Manville, provided false interrogatory responses on

21   behalf of Combustion Engineering.                 That is how far

22   afield the proffered interpretation of the 1986 order

23   goes.

24                JUSTICE ALITO:          Is it not the case that most

25   of the claims are claims based on -- based on Manville?

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                MR. COHN:       Are they claims --

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:           Relating to what Travelers

 3   did in relation to Manville, rather than other

 4   companies.

 5                MR. COHN:       I don't think it's related to

 6   what they did.   I think the distinction here is relating

 7   to what they know.      The point is --

 8                JUSTICE ALITO:           You're -- you're making the

 9   argument that some of these claims concern things that

10   Travelers did in relation to the defense of other

11   asbestos manufacturers.          Now, maybe that means that the

12   -- the bankruptcy court interpreted the order too

13   broadly or -- in that respect.                But what does that have

14   to do with the main issue here?

15                MR. COHN:       If an asbestos claimant, an

16   independent action plaintiff, is seeking to recover from

17   Travelers for Manville-derived liability, it's barred.

18   That was the purpose of the remand by the Second Circuit

19   having provided the appropriate measuring stick to the

20   bankruptcy court to go look at these complaints and

21   figure out whether or not in fact somebody's trying to

22   take money out of Travelers' pocket for Manville's

23   liabilities.

24                JUSTICE SOUTER:             But isn't it the case, to

25   make sure I understand it, the Wise complaints are the


                                         42
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   -- are the exception.     They are the only complaints, as

 2   I understand it in this current round of litigation,

 3   that claims that the actual harm to them resulted from

 4   actions other than actions of Manville.                Is that

 5   correct?

 6              MR. COHN:      The statutory -- not exactly.

 7   The statutory direct actions, which account for 400

 8   million of the half billion dollars they'd like to pay

 9   to these alleged contemnors, all have to do with claims-

10   handling practices of Travelers with respect to other

11   insureds besides Manville.

12              The Common Law independent actions allege

13   that the insurance industry as a whole learned of the

14   dangers of asbestos.     It has a free-standing duty to the

15   world to warn the world of the dangers of asbestos.

16   Chubb Indemnity Insurance Company was not a Manville

17   insurer, yet Chubb is alleged to have been in cahoots

18   with the rest of the industry in failing to warn the

19   world, and, therefore, they along with the rest of the

20   insurance industry face unlimited liability unrelated to

21   insurance policies for this --

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, I understand -- or

23   maybe I don't -- maybe I don't understand the -- every

24   step in the liability claim.           My only question was,

25   among the plaintiffs, is it correct that the only


                                      43
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   plaintiffs who claim they were hurt physically by

 2   asbestos as a result of the actions of somebody, the

 3   only ones who are claiming that the somebody was other

 4   than Manville are the Wise plaintiffs.                  Is that correct?

 5              MR. COHN:       I think not.

 6              JUSTICE SOUTER:             No?

 7              MR. COHN:       I think that every asbestos

 8   claimant by and large has a claim against Manville, but

 9   that doesn't mean they are not --

10              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Simply because of

11   Manville's position in the --

12              MR. COHN:       The ubiquity of Manville asbestos

13   and their activities makes practically everybody, if not

14   everybody, a Manville claimant, at least --

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:             So -- so that you are

16   saying in effect everybody ultimately is claiming

17   against Manville, the Wise plaintiffs and every other

18   set of plaintiffs in this -- in this group of direct

19   liability claimants, right?

20              MR. COHN:       Well, is or can.             But that

21   doesn't mean that they are attempting to assert

22   liability against an insurance company because of

23   Manville's own conduct.

24              JUSTICE SOUTER:             I -- I understand your

25   cause of action.   Okay.       I don't want to --

 1                MR. COHN:      So, getting back to the next

 2   point I would like to make is, as Mr. Issacharoff has

 3   stated, the Second Circuit was presented and the

 4   bankruptcy court was presented in 1986 with a plan and

 5   with an order that was stated to be premised upon the

 6   derivative liability of Travelers for Manville.

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:            Who stated it?   Who stated

 8   that?    I mean, when I -- I read what the judge said at

 9   the time.    I've read language of the order, and I

10   haven't found there anything that said that.                What it

11   talked about was policies that were seriously

12   intertwined with the liability of Manville.

13                MR. COHN:      Well, the insurance settlement

14   order, which is what is at issue here -- which is not

15   the channeling injunction order, by the way; it was

16   entered before that -- was premised upon the policies

17   being property of the estate.              That was --

18                JUSTICE BREYER:            Is this the confirmation

19   order?

20                MR. COHN:      The confirmation order is

21   actually not directly at issue.

22                JUSTICE BREYER:            That's different.     Okay.

23   So the confirmation order --

24                MR. COHN:      The confirmation order is

25   purposely --

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:             But there's another piece

 2   of paper called "the insurance settlement order," which

 3   says that the confirmation order and all these other

 4   definitions and the injunction just refer to derivative

 5   liability?

 6                MR. COHN:       The --

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:             Yes or no?

 8                MR. COHN:       -- definition of -- yes --

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:             Yes?

10                MR. COHN:       No.      The definition of --

11                JUSTICE BREYER:             No?     Okay.    All right.

12                MR. COHN:       -- of "policy claims" is

13   contained in the --

14                JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, then I don't see what

15   has to do with it.

16                MR. COHN:       Well, the definition of "policy

17   claims" is contained in the settlement order, which is

18   December 18, 1986.      It was a free-standing order that

19   was entered --

20                JUSTICE BREYER:             All right.       That's a

21   different definition than the definition of "policy

22   claims" in the injunction, presumably.

23                MR. COHN:       There are two injunctions, Your

24   Honor.

25                JUSTICE BREYER:             All right.       I have a

 1   confirmation order, an injunction.                 It defines "policy

 2   claims" in both as a lawsuit relating to any or all of

 3   the insurance policies.

 4               MR. COHN:      That is the injunction in the

 5   insurance injunction.

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:            And your other piece of

 7   paper says what?

 8               MR. COHN:      The other piece of paper is even

 9   clearer.   That's why they don't rely on it.                It says,

10   you may not seek to recover asbestos health obligations,

11   which are the future Manville-derived asbestos claims

12   from Travelers, from a settling insurance company.                   They

13   don't even try to argue that the channeling injunction

14   gets them there.   They're arguing that the insurance

15   policy buy-back order, if you want to call it that, the

16   insurance settlement order pursuant to which they

17   retired their insurance obligations was -- the

18   definition of "policy claims" was --

19               JUSTICE BREYER:            You go on.       Don't worry.

20   I'll look it up.

21               MR. COHN:      Thank you.

23   Process Clause fully protect you?                If the bankruptcy

 2   process claim that fully protects you.

 3              MR. COHN:         Chubb, Mr. Chief justice, in fact

 4   has an alternative argument that was never reached that,

 5   as a non-Manville insurer, it was in a position of an

 6   unrepresented future claimant, and in fact it cannot be

 7   constitutionally bound by res judicata to the 1986

 8   order.

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I saw in the -- I

10   guess it was in the Travelers' reply brief, the

11   suggestion that there was a future -- somebody

12   representing future claimants.

13              MR. COHN:         Future tort claimants, not future

14   insurance defendants.

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Where is that?

16              MR. COHN:         Cause of action claimants.

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Where is that

18   limitation spelled out?

19              MR. COHN:         Well, if you look at the order

20   that -- that appoints the future claims representative,

21   it is to represent the interests of people who have been

22   exposed to Manville asbestos but have not yet been --

23   manifested harm because of the long latency period of

24   asbestos injuries.

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Is that a

 1   description of the clients at issue here?                     They've been

 2   -- they've all been exposed to asbestos?

 3                 MR. COHN:     It's not a description of Chubb,

 4   Your Honor.

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I know, but I'm

 6   asking about the claimants.

 7                 MR. COHN:     The claimants presumably were

 8   people that were -- the individual independent action

 9   plaintiffs presumably were represented by the future

10   claimants' representative in 1986 and were at that time

11   future claimants or else their -- you know, their harm

12   would have arisen well before and they wouldn't be in

13   these cases in this decade.

14                 If there are no further questions, Your

15   Honor --

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Yes, in the -- at the

17   time of 1986, there were many claims against Manville,

18   of course, for Manville's liability.                     These later suits

19   in State court about the insurance company's independent

20   obligation -- I asked this to counsel on the other side

21   -- to what extent was there such litigation in 1986?

22                 MR. COHN:     May I respond?

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Sure.

24                 MR. COHN:     There were no independent actions

25   of the flavor that you are seeing here.                     I am not aware

 1   of any claim like that.         There were claims by other

 2   Manville coinsureds.       There were claims by Manville, and

 3   there may have been some direct actions.                    I'm just

 4   simply not familiar -- we didn't come into this case

 5   until 2004, when our rights were impugned.                    So I don't

 6   know the answer to whether or not there was anything

 7   just like this, but I doubt it.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

 9                 Five minutes, Mr. Ostrager.

10           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY R. OSTRAGER

11                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12                 MR. OSTRAGER:         Thank you.           I have five quick

13   points I want to make.

14                 First, the Second Circuit upheld the core

15   factual findings that, quote, "the instant claims

16   against Travelers arise out of its provision of

17   insurance coverage to Manville," close quote.                    That's

18   from the Second Circuit opinion.                It's in the appendix

19   at page 33.

20                 Second, there is no use of the word

21   "derivative" in either the confirmation order, the

22   settlement order, or 524(g). 524(g), about which we

23   haven't spoken enough, clearly and unmistakably reflects

24   Congress's intent to allow channeling injunctions that

25   bar claims against a debtor and those, like insurers,


                                        50

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   who are directly or indirectly liable for claims against

 2   the debtor.    That is 524(g)(4)(A)(ii) and Roman (iii).

 3   524(g) expressly provides an asbestos channeling

 4   injunction shall be valid and enforceable and may not be

 5   revoked or modified by any court except for an appeal.

 6                 We cite in our reply brief the fact that a

 7   Senate report accompanying an earlier version of the

 8   bill clarified that 524(g) is -- quote, "is not meant to

 9   give the bankruptcy courts authority which they do not

10   already possess and simply codifies the court's ability

11   to issue supplemental permanent injunctions which are

12   irrevocable except on appeal."

13                 There is a final judgment in this case

14   confirming the plan of reorganization.                   The Second

15   Circuit issued that -- confirmed that judgment twice,

16   once in the MacArthur case and once in the Cane case.

17   And then in the O'Malley case, which is a 1996 case, the

18   Second Circuit rejected a collateral attack on the

19   confirmation order on two grounds.

20                 First, they found that the performance of

21   the futures representative that Judge Lifland had

22   appointed and which was incorporated in 524(g) and

23   modelled on the Manville reorganization proceeding --

24   the Second Circuit found that the legal representative,

25   quote, "took an active and aggressive role in protecting


                                        51
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   future claimants in this litigation."

 2              And, secondly, the Second Circuit rejected

 3   the challenge to the continuation of the 1986 order

 4   enjoining the suits against insurers as being without

 5   merit because such an injunction was essential to the

 6   success of the settlement, and its continuation was well

 7   within the court's discretion.

 8              As respects Chubb, Judge Koetle in affirming

 9   Judge Liflin's 2004 order, specifically found that

10   Chubb, a multinational insurer that has paid more than a

11   billion dollars to resolve asbestos-related claims, was

12   clearly on notice of these proceedings.                We cite in our

13   reply brief on pages 10 and 11 several 524(g)

14   injunctions that have run to the benefit of Chubb which

15   contain the exact same "based upon, arising out of, or

16   related to" language that appears in the original

17   Manville order.

18              We didn't cite -- but it's a matter of

19   public record -- that Chubb paid $550 million to resolve

20   through a bankruptcy proceeding with Fibreboard

21   liabilities relating to Fibreboard receiving the same

22   "based upon, arising out of, or related to" protection.

23              The Manville plan carries out the core

24   values of bankruptcy.     The Manville trust has made

25   payments to 660,000 asbestos claimants -- that's at

 1   record at 139 -- funded by $2.8 million of proceeds from

 2   insurance settlements and the sale of the reorganized

 3   and rehabilitated Manville --

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:             Is there anything you want

 5   to say about the practical thing I have in the back of

 6   my mind which may be false?             That language permits your

 7   position, but it certainly has rarely been implemented,

 8   if ever.   And I see that, but in the back of my mind is

 9   the fact that if we start mucking around and give narrow

10   meanings to these things now, there are going to be

11   hundreds of thousands of people who won't get

12   compensated who have asbestos --

13               MR. OSTRAGER:           Precisely.

14               JUSTICE BREYER:             Is that true?

15               MR. OSTRAGER:           That is absolutely --

16               JUSTICE BREYER:             Is there anything to back

17   that up?

18               MR. OSTRAGER:           And I -- I wanted to point

19   out that in your dissent in the Ortiz case you said that

20   judges can and should search aggressively for ways

21   within the framework of existing law to avoid delay and

22   expense so great as to bring about a massive denial of

23   the injunction --

24               JUSTICE BREYER:             I said that.

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              That was the dissenting

 1   opinion.

 2              MR. OSTRAGER:            I understand that.

 3              But you were -- on that particular point you

 4   were correct.    And we have a General Motors -- we have a

 5   General Motors potential that I can see.

 6              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But there are two

 7   decisions of this Court, Abcam and Ortiz, that reject

 8   that position.

 9              MR. OSTRAGER:            In Ortiz the -- the Court

10   absolutely recognized that where you have a special

11   statutory scheme that is designed as 524(g) and (h) is

12   to deal with these types of issues, that is an exception

13   to Hansberry versus Lee.          I cannot --

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

15   That case is submitted.

16              (Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in the

17   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
