 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We will hear

 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

 9               MR. COLEMAN:        Good morning, Mr. Chief

10   Justice, and may it please the Court:

11               After more than 20 years of steadfast

12   compliance with the Voting Rights Act, Northwest Austin

13   MUD Number One is entitled to be free from the intrusive

14   burdens of preclearance.        The district is entitled to

15   seek a bailout because it is a political subdivision

16   under the Court's decisions in Sheffield and Dougherty

17   County.   This natural parallelism between bailout and

18   preclearance allows bailout to serve its ameliorative

19   purposes of encouraging, recognizing, and rewarding

20   long-term compliance and progress --

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                It may be -- it may

22   be a political subdivision under those decisions, but

23   it's certainly not a political subdivision under the

24   statutory definition.

25               MR. COLEMAN:        Well, we disagree with that,


                                       3

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Your Honor.    We believe that under Dougherty County in

 2   particular, the Court specifically recognized that these

 3   entities such as cities and school boards and utility

 4   districts are political subdivisions and that that term

 5   as it's used --

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Bailout wasn't involved

 7   in those cases.    And what do you do with a statute that

 8   has three categories -- the State, political

 9   subdivision, and then there's "governmental unit"?                 The

10   district qualifies as a governmental unit.                 Why would

11   Congress add that third category if the district came

12   within "political subdivision"?

13                 MR. COLEMAN:       Justice Ginsburg, the term

14   "governmental unit" doesn't actually appear in the

15   provision that authorizes bailout.                 What it says is that

16   when a political subdivision seeks a bailout that, if it

17   has any governmental units within it, it must also

18   ensure that they are compliant before it can have a

19   bailout.   For instance, although the district is not a

20   political subdivision of the county, it is in the

21   county, and therefore under the substantive criteria, if

22   the -- Travis County wanted to bail out, it would have

23   to demonstrate compliance of all of those governmental

24   units within it.

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Yes, but the -- but the


                                        4

 1   statute does use the term "governmental unit" to

 2   encompass districts.       And if they were also

 3   subdivisions, why would Congress need to add an

 4   additional category?

 5                 MR. COLEMAN:        Again, I disagree with Your

 6   Honor that -- that the term "governmental unit" appears

 7   in the provision that defines criteria.

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            It appears in the statute

 9   twice, suggesting that Congress had in mind three

10   categories.

11                 MR. COLEMAN:        Again, the statute that

12   defines who's eligible to bailout says a State, a

13   political subdivision that has been separately

14   designated for coverage under 4(b), and a political

15   subdivision that has not been separately designated for

16   coverage.

17                 We were never separately designated for

18   coverage.     And under Sheffield and Dougherty County, we

19   have long been considered a political subdivision.

20   Indeed, we are subject to the process of preclearance

21   only because we were a political subdivision.                The

22   actual requirement that you send in preclearance

23   submissions is on political subdivisions.                We are

24   subject to lawsuits under section 2 because we are a

25   political subdivision.         We are subject to the


                                         5

 1   possibility of Federal examiners because we are a

 2   political subdivision.

 3                 At no place in this Voting Rights Act, in

 4   any of the dozens of the uses of the term "political

 5   subdivision" has this Court or Congress, other than the

 6   designation statute, separately suggested that a

 7   political subdivision such as the district would not be

 8   considered a political subdivision under the terms of

 9   the Voting Rights Act.

10                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, to the extent we

11   have some latitude in construing the Act, certainly it

12   would be a relevant factor if we concluded that it's

13   just unworkable or impractical to have an uncovered

14   jurisdiction within a county which is a covered

15   jurisdiction.     They would have competing election days,

16   competing election formulae.              And it would seem to me

17   that that just makes compliance with the Act much more

18   difficult.

19                 MR. COLEMAN:        Well, certainly we believe

20   that the purposes of the Act suggest that we should be

21   considered a political subdivision eligible to bail out.

22   This interaction between the county and the district --

23   we -- we exist within the county, but we are not part of

24   the county.     The county, as we say, is not the boss of

25   us.   They don't have any way to ensure or require us to


                                         6

 1   do things.   And as the facts of this case demonstrate,

 2   not only did the county have different political

 3   interests, but we've also demonstrated that because you

 4   have entities that are subject to separate designation,

 5   like the county, that have dozens and perhaps in this

 6   case over a hundred separate political subdivisions,

 7   Travis County could never practically seek a bail out.

 8                And in order to give effect to what I call

 9   this ameliorative purpose to bail out, the Court should

10   interpret the statute in a way that allows these small

11   entities to bail out.       These small entities --

12                JUSTICE ALITO:         And how do you account for

13   the fact that if your district were located in a

14   separately covered political subdivision, you clearly

15   could not bail out.

16                MR. COLEMAN:       Well, I -- I -- again, the

17   Court doesn't need to reach that question yet, but I'm

18   not sure that the answer is that we clearly couldn't if

19   we were a separately designated or -- excuse me -- if we

20   were in a separately designated county that says --

21   that's it's not in a covered State, right?                  There is

22   this argument, for instance, that -- that that State

23   could be covered in whole or in part.                  And certainly,

24   for instance, in California the State is -- is covered

25   in part.   And it could be resolved in that way.

 1              The statute is not exceptionally clear on

 2   it, but the Court doesn't have to reach that because we

 3   are in a fully covered State, and we are -- under all

 4   the provisions of Voting Rights Act, have always been

 5   considered political subdivisions.                  The district court

 6   said you're a political subdivision for every purpose

 7   except this one.    You have to --

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               There is -- the district

 9   court had some assistance from the legislative

10   development of this latest extension.                    There was a

11   proposal, was there not, to allow governmental units to

12   bail out -- to allow anyone who was required to preclear

13   to bail out?

14              MR. COLEMAN:           I don't know that there was a

15   specific legislative proposal, Justice Ginsburg.                       There

16   was certainly some discussion of that.                    What -- what is

17   particularly clear is --

18              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               And what was the reason

19   that it was resisted?

20              MR. COLEMAN:           I don't know that the record

21   actually shows that it was resisted.                     It was simply part

22   of the discussion during the reauthorization

23   proceedings.   I'm not aware of any specific resistance

24   relating to that.     There weren't any amendments to the

25   statute, but the amendments in 1982, we do believe are


                                         8

                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   very important to the Court's consideration of that

 2   because the bailout aspects were considered in City of

 3   Rome, and in City of Rome the only entities that could

 4   bail out were a -- were a State or a separately covered

 5   or a separately designated subdivision.               And then 2

 6   years after that, Congress amends the statute to add

 7   this third category, which is political subdivisions

 8   that have not been separately designated for coverage.

 9              That amendment and that addition is clearly

10   in direct response to City of Rome and, we believe, a

11   clear indication that Congress did intend and, indeed,

12   it said it intended to expand the bailout opportunities.

13   Congress believed that many, if perhaps not most,

14   political subdivisions in 1982 would be eligible for

15   bailout, but because --

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The Department of Justice

17   has -- does it -- does it not have a regulation that

18   contradicts your reading?        And hasn't that been out

19   there -- wasn't it out there before the 2006 extension?

20              MR. COLEMAN:        Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but

21   unlike the Attorney General's regulations that relate to

22   preclearance, bailout is not something that the Attorney

23   General actually has any specific say in.              The statute

24   provides for a lawsuit to seek a bailout.              It's not like

25   preclearance, where can you get it from either the


                                      9

 1   Attorney General or the district court.

 2               Now, the Attorney General may choose, as it

 3   has for several of the Virginia entities, not to resist

 4   that.   So you can file a friendly suit once the Attorney

 5   General has been convinced, but --

 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             If we find that you're not

 7   covered by the bailout provision, that only the county

 8   is, do you really then have standing to proceed to

 9   question the workability of the bailout procedures?                   I

10   -- I suppose that would be a threshold argument for you

11   to question the validity of the Act.

12               MR. COLEMAN:         Well, with respect to our

13   constitutionality issue, Justice Kennedy, one thing

14   nobody is contesting here is that we are not subject to

15   preclearance.    And so, if we are not eligible for

16   bailout, we obviously do and we believe have standing to

17   assert that the reenactment of the preclearance

18   provisions is unconstitutional because they, unlike the

19   bailout, would clearly continue to apply to us.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, has preclearance been

21   denied to you?

22               MR. COLEMAN:         Well, we didn't seek a

23   preclearance --

24               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Exactly.         I mean, I -- if

25   -- if you're basing it simply on your subjection to

 1   preclearance and there's no contest between you and the

 2   government over preclearing anything, I'm not sure why

 3   you would be in court.

 4               MR. COLEMAN:          Well, there is certainly a

 5   possibility we may seek to preclear things in the

 6   future, but this is primarily --

 7               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Then isn't -- isn't that

 8   the time for litigating?

 9               MR. COLEMAN:          No, Justice Souter.             This is

10   primarily a facial challenge to the statute.                     We are

11   subject to the obligations of preclearance.                     And we

12   believe that we --

13               JUSTICE SOUTER:             But it's not affecting

14   anything you're doing on a day-to-day basis, as I

15   understand it.   There's no claim that -- that your

16   district is doing anything improper.                     No claim is being

17   made against you.     And I guess your whole argument would

18   be maybe some day we want to preclear again, and maybe

19   we wouldn't be as successful as we had been in each of

20   the instances before.        But I don't see how that gets you

21   in court.

22               MR. COLEMAN:          I agree with -- I disagree

23   with that as well, Justice Souter.                  While it has not

24   been highlighted in the briefs, there is deep in the

25   record discussion during a MUD board meeting of

 1   potentially some changes, and discussion on that was

 2   table pending the outcome of this lawsuit.

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What was the last time

 4   the district applied for preclearance, the last year?

 5               MR. COLEMAN:        The contract in 2004 by which

 6   we asked the county to actually perform the elections

 7   itself, that was precleared, Your Honor.

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And so 2004 is the last

 9   year.   So between 2004 and 2009 the district has not

10   sought preclearance?

11               MR. COLEMAN:        That's correct.        This lawsuit

12   --

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:           But you're subject to

14   preclearance and you cannot make changes without going

15   to the Attorney General and asking for his permission.

16               MR. COLEMAN:        That's correct.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Is it any different from,

18   from a -- a Federal law prohibiting certain speech?              Do

19   you have to subject yourself to the -- to the penalty

20   for that speech before you can attack the law?              I don't

21   think so.

22               MR. COLEMAN:        No, Justice Scalia.

23               JUSTICE SOUTER:           But the suit -- correct me

24   if I'm wrong, and I may be wrong on this, but I thought

25   this suit eventuated from the fact that you had been

 1   denied bailout and that your entire case was brought on

 2   the refusal of bailout.        I did not understand that you

 3   had brought a general declaratory judgment action or

 4   a -- or a facial attack in gross, as it were, on the

 5   statute.   Am I wrong about your pleadings?

 6                 MR. COLEMAN:       I do think you're wrong about

 7   that, Justice Souter.       We had not been denied bailout.

 8   The suit sought bailout.         The only way to seek a bailout

 9   is through the lawsuit --

10                 JUSTICE SOUTER:          Right.

11                 MR. COLEMAN:       -- and this lawsuit seeks the

12   bailout and the declaratory judgment that if we cannot

13   bail out --

14                 JUSTICE SOUTER:          You separately asked for

15   declaratory judgment?

16                 MR. COLEMAN:       Yes.       There are different

17   claims in the lawsuit, Your Honor.                 And indeed, the

18   standing point is--

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           You don't challenge -- if

20   you have bailout, say we accept your reading of the

21   statute, you are not contesting the constitutionality of

22   the act if it matched your obligation to preclear with

23   the right to bail out.

24                 MR. COLEMAN:       Well, that's not exactly right

25   either, Justice Ginsburg.          We certainly contest and


                                       13

 1   contend that preclearance is unconstitutional.                 We

 2   acknowledge that if the Court were to give us bailout

 3   that the Court might choose on its own not to reach the

 4   constitutional issues because we would receive relief.

 5              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But I -- I thought I just

 6   heard you say even if you got the bailout the extension

 7   for another 25 years would still be unconstitutional.

 8   Is that -- or are you saying that the accommodation, the

 9   modification, would suffice to make the statute

10   constitutional?

11              MR. COLEMAN:          No.      We do not say that the

12   modification would make the statute constitutional.                 Our

13   position is both that we are entitled to bailout and we

14   have an alternative claim that we have asserted that is

15   independent, it's not dependent on the first one, that

16   preclearance is unconstitutional.

17              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well Mr. Coleman, this is

18   important to me.   Do you -- do you acknowledge that if

19   we find on your favor on the bailout point we need not

20   reach the constitutional point?

21              MR. COLEMAN:          I do acknowledge that, Justice

22   Souter.

23              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, presumably you

24   wouldn't have standing to raise it because you wouldn't

25   be subject to the preclearance requirement.

 1              MR. COLEMAN:           Right.         But because we had all

 2   the claims together in one lawsuit, we had to assert

 3   them all together, and that's what we've done.

 4              Getting to the heart of this preclearance

 5   issue, if I may, Katzenbach recognized that preclearance

 6   really was an extraordinary remedy and it recognized

 7   that is a remedy that would not otherwise be appropriate

 8   but for the extraordinary emergency circumstances that

 9   existed at the time.       Nobody has challenged that.                 But

10   we are in a different day.            The kinds of --

11              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Mr. Coleman, may I just

12   raise a basic point here.           And I'll be candid with you

13   that it affects my view of your argument.                      I just want

14   to start with it.     Your argument is largely based on the

15   assumption that things have significantly changed and

16   that therefore Congress could not by whatever test we

17   use extend the -- extend section 5.

18         But what we've got in the record in front of

19   us -- I don't have a laundry list to read, but I mean,

20   we've got I think at the present time a 6-point -- a

21   16-point registration difference on Hispanic and

22   non-Hispanic white voters in Texas.                      We've got a record

23   of some 600 interpositions by the -- by the Justice

24   Department on section 5 proceedings, section 5

25   objections, over a period of about 20 years.                      We got a


                                        15
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   record that about two-thirds of them were based on the

 2   Justice Department's view that it was intentional

 3   discrimination.   We've got something like 600 section 2

 4   lawsuits over the same period of time.

 5              The point that I'm getting at is I don't

 6   understand, with a record like that, how you can

 7   maintain as a basis for this suit that things have

 8   radically changed.    They may be better.              But to say that

 9   they have radically changed to the point that this

10   becomes an unconstitutional section 5 exercise within

11   Congress's judgment just seems to me to -- to deny the

12   empirical reality.    I mean, what it your answer to that?

13              MR. COLEMAN:         Our answer, Your Honor, is --

14   is a very clear one and that is there is a difference

15   between a nondiscrimination statute and a

16   noncircumvention statute.         Section 2, section 203, the

17   prohibition on the uses of tests and devices, these are

18   clear nondiscrimination provisions that are textually

19   linked back to the -- to the constitutional

20   prohibitions.   Section 5 was never intended to be a

21   nondiscrimination statute.          Section 5 is a

22   noncircumvention statute, notwithstanding the volume --

23              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, the evidence that

24   I've been getting into is a pretty good indication -- I

25   would have thought Congress thought so and I would have


                                      16
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   thought so too -- that there is something to be

 2   concerned about on the issue of circumvention; that in

 3   fact the attitudes have not so radically changed as to

 4   render circumvention irrelevant.

 5                MR. COLEMAN:       I honestly disagree with you,

 6   Justice Souter, on that.        Notwithstanding --

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But there was -- but

 8   there was -- Congress fastened on that issue and it

 9   referred to second generation discrimination, which is a

10   frequent pattern with discrimination.                  You start with

11   the blatant overt discrimination, and then in time

12   people recognize that that's -- that won't go any more,

13   so the discrimination becomes more subtle, less easy to

14   smoke out.   But it doesn't go from blatant overt

15   discrimination to everything is equal.

16                MR. COLEMAN:       Justice Ginsburg, the Court in

17   Katzenbach recognized that Congress had been trying for

18   several years to try to fix this problem and it walked

19   through, as this Court has walked through innumerable

20   times, that section 5 is simply not about

21   nondiscrimination, but it was about the unremitting and

22   ingenious defiance of statutes in a way that made

23   ordinary enforcement mechanisms, including litigation,

24   simply ineffective, that no matter what the courts did,

25   in the South the enforcement mechanisms were unable to


                                      17
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   allow minority individuals to register and get out and

 2   vote, that no matter what happened -- preclearance put a

 3   stop to that.

 4               But notwithstanding this record, which I'd

 5   like to speak to the volume of separately --

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:           No, I'll ask you that

 7   question because I'd like to hear your answer to that.

 8               MR. COLEMAN:        Notwithstanding that record,

 9   it is not the kind of record -- Congress put together

10   what it believed was a discrimination record, but not a

11   circumvention record.      There is no indication, for

12   instance, in these types of examples that have been

13   offered in the briefs and were offered in the

14   congressional hearings that these aren't things that can

15   be fixed through ordinary enforcement mechanisms through

16   section 2 litigation.

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But if you take the

18   multiple devices -- take the one as simple as moving the

19   election day so that it will coincide with the -- with

20   the holiday of a predominantly minority college.               To go

21   after every change of that order with a section 2

22   lawsuit -- of the two devices, surely section 5 is more

23   effective to smoke that out.

24               MR. COLEMAN:        Two points on that, Justice

25   Ginsburg.   First, with respect to the Waller County


                                      18

 1   issue, that was an issue that was very swiftly addressed

 2   by Texas officials itself in cooperation with the NAACP.

 3   The Texas secretary of state and the Texas attorney

 4   general came down very swiftly on that issue.                  The

 5   second point is --

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Perhaps they -- perhaps

 7   they wouldn't if the only tool in the arsenal were

 8   section 2, if everything had to be a Federal lawsuit.

 9                MR. COLEMAN:         And that gets at the heart of

10   one of our arguments, Justice Ginsburg.                  That is --

11                JUSTICE BREYER:            Can I ask you this question

12   for a second, please?        And just take 2 minutes to answer

13   it or not.     You don't have to answer it, but it seems to

14   me this is the question.          This whole issue depends on

15   the evidence before Congress.              So, in reading the

16   briefs, I have six categories of evidence.                  Compared to

17   the City of Rome, the registration turnout still has two

18   States, Virginia and Texas, with significant

19   disparities.

20                As to minority officeholders, there is a big

21   improvement, but if you look at Mississippi, Louisiana,

22   and South Carolina and a couple of others, it is still

23   not great.

24                The DOJ objections:               The number of DOJ

25   objections has fallen a lot, but it still exists.

 1              In terms of election observers, which were

 2   not mentioned in City of Rome, we have their statistics

 3   that two-thirds of the observers are focused on five of

 4   the six States that are covered.                        In terms of

 5   polarized voting, not mentioned in Rome, we still have

 6   testimony that the polarization is significant and

 7   common in certain places.

 8              And as to successful section 2, section 5

 9   suits, once again not mentioned in the City of Rome, but

10   since 1982 there were at least 105 successful section 5

11   suits and 653 successful section 2 suits.               All right.

12              I just summarized that because I'd like to

13   hear in a couple of minutes, or five, or whatever you

14   want to take.    I'm trying to lead you to what I think is

15   the heart of the case.        It seems evidentiary.         That is

16   what I read.    What is your response?

17              MR. COLEMAN:          Well, I'm obviously not going

18   to have time to respond to all of that, Justice Breyer.

19              JUSTICE BREYER:             Whatever you want.

20              MR. COLEMAN:          But, for instance, with

21   respect to the first point that you raised, which is

22   voter registration and turnout issues, those numbers

23   don't tell the whole story.            In fact -- in fact, with

24   respect to both black and Hispanic voters, the record in

25   covered jurisdictions is above the national average.

 1   Massachusetts, for instance, you might be learned to

 2   know, has a white-black voter registration and turnout

 3   differential that is in the high 20s, far in excess of

 4   any covered jurisdiction.          And that's part of what

 5   Congress didn't do.

 6      So in addition to the argument we have that the

 7   record Congress produced is really a nondiscrimination

 8   record and not a circumvention record, we also have the

 9   argument that we've made that it is simply irrational

10   for Congress to go back and say the Voting Rights Act of

11   1965 was intended to make sure that minority voters

12   could register and vote and that's going to be our

13   number one priority.

14                 As Justice Ginsburg recognized, Congress

15   believes that that has been satisfied.                  But now we are

16   going to go back and in determining who's going to be

17   covered under the 2006 amendment, we are going to use

18   the same data from the 1964 election.

19                 It would have been as if Congress in 1965

20   said:   We anticipate that there are problems here; and,

21   in order to define coverage, we are going to look at the

22   Roosevelt-Hoover election in 1932 and registration and

23   turnout then, because we think that is the best way to

24   evaluate --

25                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, Justice Breyer --

 1   Justice Breyer did refer you to some other more current

 2   statistics, submissions, Title V suits, and so forth.

 3   You might want to address those.               And in that context,

 4   was there any control data to compare preclearance rates

 5   or preclearance events in colored -- in covered

 6   jurisdictions as opposed to uncovered jurisdictions?

 7              MR. COLEMAN:         That's --

 8              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And that -- that's part of

 9   the showing, it seems to me, that the Congress has to

10   make, that these States that are now covered and that

11   were covered are markedly different from the noncovered

12   jurisdictions.   Was there anything in the record before

13   the Congress or the district court to address that

14   point?

15              MR. COLEMAN:         The only comparative data that

16   existed was of two kinds.         There was a -- there was a --

17   some data that grouped all covered jurisdictions into

18   one lump and all noncovered jurisdictions into another

19   lump and counted up section 2 lawsuits.                And the

20   difference was about 17 successful -- 17 more successful

21   section 2 suits in covered jurisdictions than in

22   noncovered jurisdictions.         That's not a big difference.

23              What Congress didn't do, though, is look at

24   specific noncovered jurisdictions, for instance, the

25   ones I've cited, and say, how do these compare to


                                      22
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   covered jurisdictions?

 2                 And the other thing it didn't do is say:

 3   Among covered jurisdictions and noncovered

 4   jurisdictions, let's look among -- let's separate out

 5   among these jurisdictions and see where the problem

 6   locations are and what areas we think might, if -- if

 7   preclearance is going to be constitutional, might be

 8   subject.   There is absolutely no evidence in the record

 9   of that.   Preclearance once again is based on the

10   results -- well, whether there was a test or device in

11   the 1960s and the results of the 1964, 1968, and 1972

12   presidential elections.

13                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           What kind of coverage

14   formula would be adequate?           You are attacking Congress'

15   preservation of the same coverage formula.              But what

16   other coverage formula could it come up with?

17                 MR. COLEMAN:       Well, just to give one example

18   -- and I'm not -- not recommending this -- but if, for

19   instance, the same coverage formula had been applied to

20   the 2000 and 2004 elections, equalizing for citizen

21   voting age population, the only covered State would have

22   been Hawaii.    Under that formula, using modern data,

23   modern information, none of these States would have been

24   covered if you account for noncitizen voting age

25   population.

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           There was -- and maybe

 2   the government will refer to it -- I thought, quite a

 3   bit of evidence comparing covered and noncovered in this

 4   record.

 5                 MR. COLEMAN:       I wouldn't say quite a bit,

 6   Your Honor.    What it did is it lumped all covered

 7   jurisdictions together and all noncovered jurisdictions.

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Well, you said all that

 9   there was was a number of section 2 suits, but I think

10   there was quite a bit more than that.

11                 MR. COLEMAN:       I -- I actually dispute that.

12   There is a lot of discussion of that information, Your

13   Honor, but it's not that much information.              And, again

14   it doesn't -- it doesn't take into account any attempt

15   to say:    How does the panhandle of Texas do against

16   Florida, against parts of northeast Georgia or northwest

17   Alabama?    How are these -- it makes no attempt

18   whatsoever.    It is simply all covered jurisdictions as a

19   lump and all noncovered jurisdictions as a lump, and

20   Congress had no basis to make that -- that declaration.

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           In your -- in your answer

22   you said if they used the 2004 the only State would be

23   Hawaii.    But I asked you what formula would pass if

24   Congress wants to get at -- wants to protect the gains

25   that have been made but are still fragile against

 1   backsliding?     If that's its objective, what can it

 2   cover?

 3                MR. COLEMAN:         It needed to make an

 4   evaluation of where there is an actual risk of

 5   backsliding and where there is actual evidence of

 6   circumvention.     We don't believe that.                We don't --

 7                JUSTICE SOUTER:            What about the evidence

 8   that Justice Breyer summarized, that I alluded to?                     I

 9   mean those -- that is simply evidence of racial attitude

10   and it seems to me in the real world that can be taken

11   as evidence that if the -- if the section 5 safeguard is

12   taken away, the pushback is going to start.

13                MR. COLEMAN:         That evidence --

14                JUSTICE SOUTER:            It has never stopped.

15                MR. COLEMAN:         That evidence justifies strict

16   enforcement of nondiscrimination statutes, but it does

17   not justify a presumption that State and local officials

18   in these areas are so racist that they cannot be relied

19   on to pass and enforce fair voting laws.

20                JUSTICE SOUTER:            They couldn't -- they

21   couldn't be relied upon apparently in the some 200 cases

22   in which the voting change was withdrawn after DOJ

23   objection.

24                MR. COLEMAN:         Again, this -- this

25   information that goes out over 30 years and across

 1   thousands upon thousands of jurisdictions --

 2              JUSTICE SOUTER:              This wasn't information

 3   over 30 years.     My recollection -- and I could be wrong

 4   on this, but my recollection is that those were

 5   statistics from about 20 years prior to the

 6   reauthorization.

 7              MR. COLEMAN:           From -- from 1982 forward.

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Yes, that's correct.

 9              MR. COLEMAN:           So you have 25 years across

10   thousands of jurisdictions.             But the objection rate is

11   on the order of single digits per 10,000 submissions.

12   It simply as a matter of comparison with 1965 doesn't

13   work.

14              May I reserve the rest of my time, Your

15   Honor.

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you,

19              ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL

20              ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE HOLDER

21              MR. KATYAL:          Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

22   and may it please the Court:

23              And let me begin where Mr. Coleman left off,

24   because I don't think that his argument adequately

25   grapples either with this Court's consistent upholding

 1   of the provision at issue 4 times over 4 decades or with

 2   Congress's action in 2006.          Congress's reauthorization

 3   in 2006 was the paradigmatic attempt of what to do in

 4   Congress.   It didn't redefine a rate, nor did it cast

 5   aspersions at Supreme Court doctrine.                  Rather, it took

 6   that doctrine seriously, both this Court's teachings

 7   with respect to the Voting Rights Act specifically, as

 8   well as the -- as the scope of the Congress's

 9   Reconstruction enforcement powers, and arrived at a

10   considered judgment.

11               After 16,000 pages of testimony, 21

12   different hearings over 10 months, Congress looked at

13   the evidence and determined that their work was not

14   done.

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, the -- the

16   -- our -- our decision in City of Boerne said that

17   action under section 5 has to be congruent and

18   proportional to what it's trying to remedy.                 Here, as I

19   understand it, one-twentieth of 1 percent of the

20   submissions are not precleared.              That, to me, suggests

21   that they are sweeping far more broadly than they need

22   to, to address the intentional discrimination under the

23   Fifteenth Amendment.

24               MR. KATYAL:       I -- I disagree with that,

25   Mr. Chief Justice.     I think what that represents is that

 1   section 5 is actually working very well; that it

 2   provides a deterrent.        This was a debate in Congress.

 3   Indeed, Mr. Coleman himself testified before Congress

 4   and said the low objection rate is evidence that it

 5   isn't congruent to proportional.

 6                 The Congress disagreed with that.                What it

 7   found instead was that section 5 was deterring the

 8   problem.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, that's like

10   the old -- you know, it's the elephant whistle.                  You

11   know, I have this whistle to keep away the elephants.

12   You know, well, that's silly.              Well, there are no

13   elephants, so it must work.

14                 I mean, if you have 99.98 percent of these

15   being precleared, why isn't that reaching far too

16   broadly.

17                 MR. KATYAL:       Well, let me suggest another

18   example.     Yesterday the Administrative Office for the

19   United States Courts said there were approximately

20   17,500 requests for Title 3 wiretaps in the past 10

21   years.     Four of them had been rejected.               That's a .023

22   percent rejection rate.

23                 But I don't think one could use those

24   numbers and say, oh, that means that Title 3 doesn't

25   deter or prevent abusive wiretaps.                  What it suggests

 1   instead, if Congress would have found -- I agree that if

 2   we were just standing up with no record whatsoever,

 3   that's one thing, but if Congress heard testimony, they

 4   found example after example of --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          No, the parallel -- the

 6   parallel isn't there.       I mean, there are laws against

 7   intentional discrimination.            So there should be laws

 8   against wiretapping.      There should also be laws against

 9   intentional discrimination.            But where the -- the

10   argument here is not that those laws be eliminated.

11   It's just that the preclearance requirements be

12   eliminated.

13                 MR. KATYAL:      Absolutely.              And Congress found

14   with respect to those intentional -- laws that prevent

15   intentional vote discrimination, which is section 2,

16   which you hear Mr. Coleman relying on today, that that

17   is ineffective for the same reasons that this Court has

18   found them repeatedly in South Carolina v. Katzenbach,

19   in City of Rome.

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          A long time ago.         How much

21   of the evidence that Congress amassed was specifically

22   circumvention evidence?

23                 MR. KATYAL:      Quite a bit of evidence about

24   the ineffectiveness of section 2 as a remedy.                   So -- and

25   the statement for the intervenors -- there's a 500-page

 1   statement filed before the district court which excerpts

 2   the congressional record.          In the pages 270 to 279 you

 3   see a long series of -- a long analysis by Congress

 4   about how section 2 is ineffective, that it costs too

 5   much to bring the litigation, that there are few

 6   attorneys that will handle it, that -- that there isn't

 7   enough money and that --

 8                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, if section 2 is

 9   ineffective, then why didn't Congress extend section 5

10   to the entire country?        Could Congress have reauthorized

11   section 5 without identifying significant differences

12   between the few jurisdictions that are covered and the

13   rest of the country?

14                 MR. KATYAL:      I don't believe so.             I think

15   Congress had to make some showing.                 And here there are

16   explicit legislative findings that say that section 5 is

17   needed in these areas --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Not comparative, however.

19   Not comparative with the rest of the country except

20   in -- in --

21                 MR. KATYAL:      Well, I disagree with that for

22   several reasons.    First of all, and most I think what

23   this utility district can argue about is Texas, and

24   Congress found very specific evidence about

25   discrimination in the State of Texas.                   They found that


                                       30
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   they led the country in the number of objections.               They

 2   found that the -- that the registration rates, as

 3   Justice Souter said, between Hispanics and whites was

 4   great.

 5              JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, it's 18 percent.        If

 6   these statistics are correct, the difference between

 7   Latino registration and white registration in Texas was

 8   18.6 percent, which is not good, but it's substantially

 9   lower than the rate in California, which is not covered,

10   37 percent; Colorado, 28 percent; New Mexico, 24

11   percent; the nationwide average, 30 percent.

12              MR. KATYAL:       Well, again, I think that what

13   Congress found is that the rate in Texas coupled with

14   its historical amount of discrimination together

15   justified -- justified the reauthorization of section 5.

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, let me focus

17   on that historical aspect.         Obviously no one doubts the

18   history here and that the history was different.               But at

19   what point does that history seek -- stop justifying

20   action with respect to some jurisdictions but not with

21   respect to others that show greater disparities?

22              MR. KATYAL:       Again, I think what this Court

23   has -- has answered that question in Katzenbach by

24   saying it may be the case that there are other

25   jurisdictions discriminate more, Congress can deal with


                                     31
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the problem one step at a time.             And the -- and Congress

 2   has said that the Court should be particularly worried

 3   about trying to predict the future and say that

 4   discrimination is now over.          We have fairly good --

 5              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, so your answer

 6   is that Congress can impose this disparate treatment

 7   forever because of the history in the south?

 8              MR. KATYAL:       Absolutely not.

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                When can they --

10   when can they -- when do they have to stop?

11              MR. KATYAL:       Well, Congress here said 25

12   years was -- 25 years was the appropriate

13   reauthorization period.

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, they said five

15   years originally and then another 20 years.               I mean, at

16   some point it begins to look like the idea is that this

17   is going to go on forever.

18              MR. KATYAL:       Well, again, if Congress can't

19   make the findings, then I think this Court would be well

20   within its powers to -- to strike it down.               But here the

21   Court is being asked to do something that has never been

22   done before, which is to use its Fifteenth -- to say

23   that Congress exceeded the balance of its Fifteenth

24   Amendment powers and its Fourteenth Amendment powers in

25   an area involving race and voting.               That has never

 1   happened before.

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, is the burden that

 3   the Act puts on the State irrelevant consideration?

 4                 MR. KATYAL:       It certainly is.           We don't --

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            How many people in the

 6   Department of Justice -- what's the Department of

 7   Justice budget for preclearance processes each year, do

 8   you know?

 9                 MR. KATYAL:       I don't know what the budget

10   is.   I can tell you there are -- there are approximately

11   30 attorneys who work in the voting --

12                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Thirty attorneys.      Do you

13   quarrel with the assessment -- the testimony before the

14   Senate Judiciary Committee that it costs the States and

15   the municipalities a billion dollars over 10 years to

16   comply?

17                 MR. KATYAL:       Again, I don't quarrel with

18   that, but Congress certainly --

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But you think that is --

20   that is relevant?

21                 MR. KATYAL:       I -- I certainly think the

22   burden on the States is relevant.                  Also relevant is the

23   fact that the States are now not coming before the Court

24   and objecting the way they were in South Carolina v.

25   Katzenbach.

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But yet -- yet the

 2   Congress has made a finding that the sovereignty of

 3   Georgia is less than the sovereign dignity of Ohio.              The

 4   sovereignty of Alabama, is less than the sovereign

 5   dignity of Michigan.       And the governments in one are to

 6   be trusted less than the governments than the other.

 7   And does the United States take that position today?

 8                 MR. KATYAL:       I wouldn't put it at all in

 9   those terms.     I would say what Congress found is that

10   there is a historical amount of discrimination coupled

11   with recent evidence and comparative data between

12   covered and noncovered jurisdictions that justifies

13   continuation of a remedy that States now overwhelmingly

14   appreciate.

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, then my point

16   stands.   You say that there is a basis for treating

17   States quite differently as to the -- this fundamental

18   right that we all agree on with respect to voting.              And

19   what's happened in part is that because of section 5

20   preclearance, say, a minority opportunity district is

21   protected in covered jurisdictions and not in noncovered

22   jurisdictions.

23                 MR. KATYAL:       But -- but --

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            This is -- this is a great

25   disparity in treatment, and the government of the United

 1   States is saying that our States must be treated

 2   differently.    And you have a very substantial burden if

 3   you're going to make that case.

 4                 MR. KATYAL:      Justice Kennedy, their burden

 5   is the same as it has always been in South Carolina

 6   versus Katzenbach and City of Rome.                     The burden is on

 7   Congress to say is continuation of this landmark

 8   achievement, one of the most transformative acts in

 9   American history, still justified, because with this act

10   what Congress -- what Congress did was essentially

11   redeem itself in the eyes of the world.

12                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           No one -- no one questions

13   the validity, the urgency, the essentiality of the

14   Voting Rights Act.    The question is whether or not it

15   should be continued with this differentiation between

16   the States.    And that is for Congress to show.

17                 MR. KATYAL:      And Congress did show precisely

18   that.   They showed, for example, Justice Kennedy,

19   that -- that the differential between covered and

20   noncovered States with respect to section 2 lawsuits was

21   57 percent of successful section 2 lawsuits were filed

22   in covered jurisdictions, even though they are 25

23   percent of the population --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, why didn't

25   Congress then extend the Act to Massachusetts, whereas

 1   your brother told us the disparity between Hispanic and

 2   non-Hispanic voting is far greater than jurisdictions

 3   that are covered?

 4              MR. KATYAL:          Because that -- because, again,

 5   that is only one aspect of the overall problem, the

 6   amount of registration rates or something like that.

 7   What Congress has historically done ever since the

 8   inception of the Voting Rights Act is target those

 9   States where discrimination is so rooted that it is hard

10   to get rid of without preclearance.

11              Preclearance will transform the landscape

12   and enfranchise millions of Americans.                   And Congress

13   heard evidence and said, after 16,000 pages of

14   testimony, that the extension in these specific areas

15   was necessary in order to root out and prevent

16   discriminatory changes.

17              JUSTICE ALITO:             Wouldn't you agree that

18   there is some oddities in this coverage formula?

19   Isn't -- is it not the case that in New York City the

20   Bronx is covered and Brooklyn and Queens are not?

21              MR. KATYAL:          There -- there -- there are

22   certainly some oddities, as there always have been, from

23   Katzenbach and from City of Rome.                  And what this Court

24   has said is that Congress can act on the state-by-state

25   level and -- and that there is a remedy for the problem,

 1   which is the bailout provision --

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Oh, let's talk about the

 3   bailout provision.      That -- that was inserted in 1982.

 4               MR. KATYAL:        That's correct.

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:            How many years is that?

 6   Over a quarter of a century, there have been 15 bailouts

 7   that have gone through?        All of them in the State of

 8   Virginia?

 9               MR. KATYAL:        There -- there have been 18

10   under the new provision, which is --

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You bring this before us as

12   a justification for the legislation.

13               MR. KATYAL:        I am saying --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:            It's obviously quite

15   impracticable --

16               MR. KATYAL:        Again --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- for anybody to bail out.

18               MR. KATYAL:        Justice Scalia, that precise

19   argument was made to Congress in 2006 and it was

20   rejected.   And it --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:            The question is whether

22   it's right, not whether Congress rejected it.

23               (Laughter.)

24               MR. KATYAL:        And I think it's not right

25   because what the testimony found was that States are


                                       37

 1   able to bail out, but they don't, and this goes back to

 2   my point to Justice Kennedy, because today States are

 3   finding that preclearance actually serves their

 4   interests; it increases --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It fends off Section 2

 6   suits, I assume.     I mean, that's great.               You get a

 7   declaratory judgment, here -- you know, a benediction,

 8   and you skip off without having to face suits.                  That may

 9   be one reason.     Another reason may be that they like the

10   packing of minorities and the other -- the other

11   districting tricks that can be -- that can be pulled

12   because - because of the requirements of the Voting

13   Rights Act.

14                 MR. KATYAL:       Well, I don't think that's a

15   quite fair characterization.              After all, here, Congress

16   in 2006 -- all Senators voted for this bill, and indeed

17   90 of the 110 Representatives from covered jurisdictions

18   voted for it, so if the Court is concerned about --

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, they get elected

20   under this system.     Why should that they take it away?

21                 MR. KATYAL:       Excuse me?

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I say, everybody who voted

23   for this -- this system was elected under this system.

24   Should it be surprising that they think it it's a good

25   thing?

 1                 MR. KATYAL:      Well, I think that we shouldn't

 2   -- this Court should be loathe to second-guess the

 3   motivations of Congress under --

 4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           We have -- we have before

 5   us the representations of the county in which the

 6   district is located, and of several of the covered

 7   jurisdictions, that they don't seek bailout because they

 8   think that the benefits, many of which have nothing to

 9   do with districting, outweigh whatever burden

10   preclearance puts on them.           It's first, bringing

11   minority groups into the discussion of what the change

12   will be in the first place, and then warding off the

13   kind of examples that appear in the -- in the Louis -- I

14   think we -- we can't impugn their integrity by saying

15   that that host of reasons, having nothing to do with

16   redistricting, is why they are not asking for bailout.

17                 MR. KATYAL:      That's precisely right, Justice

18   Ginsburg, and what the covered jurisdictions also say is

19   something about how this -- the test before this Court

20   shouldn't be the narrowest time slice of today, but

21   rather the test should be to think about historically

22   what has happened.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          We are not insisting that

24   they -- the other side is not insisting that they be

25   kicked out.    If they want to voluntarily stay in, fine.

 1   In fact, you should let other States and other

 2   jurisdiction opt in if they want to.

 3               MR. KAYTAL:      But --

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:          If you want to make this a

 5   voluntary system that's something entirely different,

 6   but the question is assuming a State or -- or a covered

 7   jurisdiction does not want to be in, do you have the

 8   right to coerce them to be in?            That's all we are

 9   talking about.

10               MR. KAYTAL:      Yes, and --

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:          If they want to stay in,

12   that's fine.

13               MR. KATYAL:      And this Court has recognized

14   and the brief of the covered jurisdictions recognizes

15   the fact that it's a separate sovereign requiring in

16   this provides an additional deterrent element and

17   increases the integrity of the elections.

18               If I could return to the point I was saying

19   a moment ago, what these covered jurisdictions are

20   saying is that this moment in time isn't the right test.

21   Rather you should look at the overall historical

22   record --

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, the overall

24   historical record, Katzenbach said there had been

25   unremitting and ingenious defiance, and that was


                                     40
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   certainly true as of the time of the Voting Rights Act.

 2   Democracy was a shambles in those -- that's not true

 3   anymore, and to say that the States are willing to yield

 4   their sovereign authority and their sovereign

 5   responsibilities to govern themselves doesn't work.

 6              We've said in Clinton s New York that

 7   Congress can't surrender its powers to the President,

 8   and the same is true with reference to the States.

 9   Wouldn't you agree?

10              MR. KATYAL:         That is correct.         And here this

11   Court has repeatedly said this isn't any sort of

12   surrendering of power.       It was justified because of the

13   record of discrimination.         South Carolina v Katzenbach,

14   Justice Kennedy, I don't quite think said that defiance

15   was the precondition; rather it found that the onerous

16   amount of case-by-case litigation itself wasn't enough.

17   And I would caution this Court because this Court has

18   had examples before in which the historical record

19   looked good at a narrow moment in time.               If we think

20   back 100 years to Reconstruction, 95 percent of

21   African-Americans in franchise, 600 black members in the

22   State legislatures, 8 black members of Congress, 8 black

23   justice in the South Carolina Supreme Court.               Things

24   looked good, and that led this Court in the civil rights

25   cases over Justice Harlan's lone dissent to say the era

 1   of special protection was over.

 2              JUSTICE ALITO:           Could I ask you this

 3   question about -- about bailout?               I mean we have --

 4   there's a very odd aspect to this case.                 We have an

 5   immense constitutional question and then on the other

 6   hand you have this little utility district, which -- and

 7   you'll correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I got from

 8   the briefs, they have never done anything wrong, and

 9   they would like to bail out and the Voting Rights Act

10   was intended to permit jurisdictions that were not

11   committing transgressions to bail out.                 Now if the

12   statute doesn't allow them to do it, the statute doesn't

13   allow them to do it, but is there any good reason why a

14   district like that should not be permitted to bail out?

15              MR. COLEMAN:         Again, this Court has

16   repeatedly said that this Congress, of the United

17   States, can legislate on the State-by-State level.

18   After all, the text of the Fifteenth Amendment speaks of

19   "any State."   So I think the relevant test is the amount

20   of discrimination in Texas, and there the evidence is

21   not just registration rates; it's the fact that they

22   lead the country in objections under section 5, that the

23   greatest deterrent effect of the more information

24   process is in the State of Texas.

25              JUSTICE ALITO:           If it's the case that there

 1   is no discrimination going on, no evasion going on in

 2   this little utility district, is there any good reason

 3   why they shouldn't be able to bail out?

 4               MR. KATYAL:       Yes, absolutely, because that's

 5   what City of Rome argued in 1980, and what this Court

 6   said in rejecting precisely that argument over Justice

 7   Powell's dissent, was that it's not that discrimination

 8   can't be to be at the individual unit-by-unit level.                       It

 9   rather, if Congress so chooses, can do it on a more

10   broad level.

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:           That was 1980?

12               MR. KATYAL:       That's correct.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Why --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:           The bailout provision was

15   adopted in 1982, 27 years ago.             There have been 15

16   bailouts since then.     Is that what you think Congress

17   contemplated when it enacted the bailout provision in

18   1982?

19               MR. KATYAL:       First of all there was a

20   bailout provision at issue in 1980.                    It was amended in

21   1982.   And yes, I think Congress contemplated a process

22   -- the legislative record on this is very clear.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Less than one a year?

24               MR. KAYTAL:       -- that -- no, what they

25   contemplated was to make it easier for political

 1   divisions to bail out, and what Congress --- what

 2   Congress anticipated, certainly more than one a year,

 3   that didn't materialize.         And again, I think, Justice

 4   Scalia, the reason why it didn't materialize is because

 5   States generally -- general appreciate Section 5's

 6   preclearance process as well as its -- covered

 7   jurisdictions.

 8              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Counsel, I thought

 9   -- I thought our opinion in City of Boerne said that the

10   problem that Section 5 legislation addresses has to be

11   widespread and persisting.           Do you think the record that

12   is before us today shows widespread and persisting

13   discrimination in voting?

14              MR. KATYAL:         I do.        I think that Congress,

15   Congress' reports, it's 16,000-page track record --

16              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              In covered States as

17   opposed to noncovered States, if I can add that to the

18   Chief Justice's question, please.

19              MR. KATYAL:         I do agree that they went State

20   by State and showed -- showed tremendous amounts of

21   discrimination in those places.               Of course I disagree

22   with the notion that this utility district can point to

23   any one place in the country, be it Massachusetts or

24   some corner in Georgia, and say well, the evidence

25   wasn't there.    I think Congress has far more latitude

 1   under its Fifteenth and Fourteenth Amendment powers.

 2              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Just one thing on bailout.

 3   It's like Eurystheus keeps telling Hercules, "Oh, you

 4   did a good job, but now you've got another -- got

 5   another thing to do."       That's the bailout provision.

 6   Anybody who has tried to fill out a government form

 7   realizes they make a mistake, so that the DOJ rejects

 8   it, that counts as a rejection.               You have to have a --

 9   what, a clean record for how many -- how many years --

10   before you can preclear?         I mean, this is simply

11   impracticable.    And it seems to me a cornerstone of the

12   Act and of your argument for upholding the Act, and if

13   we find that it doesn't work, that it's just -- it's

14   just an illusion, that gives me serious pause.

15              MR. KATYAL:         Justice Kennedy, the only

16   evidence in the record is that the bailout provision

17   works nothing like the way that it might be

18   hypothesized.    That is, every single county, every

19   single political subdivision that has asked for a

20   bailout has received one, and in 2006 there was an even

21   amendment offered to minimize the bailout provision.

22   That amendment was rejected overwhelmingly, and the

23   reason it was rejected was that jurisdictions that are

24   covered have now come to appreciate the power of Section

25   5 to deter voting discrimination, and that's why


                                       45
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Congress made a judgment --

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          What I understand it, is

 3   this incorrect?    As I understand it for Travis County to

 4   get a bailout, it would -- it has within Travis County

 5   something like 106 political subdivisions that are

 6   covered, and Travis County would have to go to all of

 7   those 106 and demonstrate that there has been no

 8   violation by any of those 106 for the preceding whatever

 9   it is, five years, whatever the bailout provision is.

10                 You think that's -- you think that's

11   feasible?

12                 MR. KATYAL:      For the way the statute works,

13   they have to go to the 107 subunits, which is absolutely

14   feasible because they are under contract with all 107

15   subunits to administer their elections.                 They have all

16   of the voting data to put together that bailout, and in

17   previous --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Travis County is not the

19   superior of many of those subunits, as it is not of this

20   district here.    This district is a subdivision of the

21   State, but not of Travis County.

22                 MR. KATYAL:      Again, I think that's a

23   distinction without a difference.                 They have all of the

24   registration data and everything else necessary to make

25   the bailout provision.        And the only record Congress and

 1   the only record before this Court is that every single

 2   entity that has sought a bailout has received one.

 3                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And the number is 18 now?

 4                MR. KATYAL:        The number is 18.

 7                ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEBO P. ADEGBILE

 8               ON BEHALF OF THE INTERVENOR-APPELLEES

 9                MR. ADEGBILE:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                Our long experience demonstrates that racial

12   discrimination in voting has been persistent and

13   adaptive.    Only after careful assessment of the record

14   did Congress find that the case-by-case method was

15   inadequate and that section 5 continued to do important

16   work within the covered jurisdictions.

17                There are a couple of things that I want to

18   call the Court's attention to in light of the discussion

19   that we've been having.         First, the pernicious nature of

20   voting discrimination is such that small changes in the

21   rules of the game can affect many people.                 In addition,

22   the Court has observed, as Congress has on multiple

23   occasions when reauthorizing the Act, that the

24   case-by-case method is slow and inadequate to the task.

25   Indeed, Justice Kennedy's opinion in Boerne spoke to


                                        47
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   this problem of the case-by-case method.

 2                I want to --

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I think that's absolutely

 4   right.   Section 2 cases are very expensive.                They are

 5   very long.   They are very inefficient.                I think this

 6   section 5 preclearance device has -- has shown -- has

 7   been shown to be very very successful.                 The question is

 8   whether or not it can be justified when other States are

 9   not covered today.

10                MR. ADEGBILE:        As -- as the Court said in

11   Katzenbach when it first was presented with this

12   question of the coverage formula, Congress is permitted

13   to use so much of its power as is necessary to target

14   the problem as it finds it.           The discrimination that was

15   manifest in the covered jurisdictions was different in

16   character at that time and -- but Congress did not stop

17   and get frozen in time in 1965.              The periodic

18   reauthorizations have given Congress an opportunity to

19   revisit the progress.

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So is it your -- is

21   it your position that today southerners are more likely

22   to discriminate than northerners?

23                MR. ADEGBILE:        I wouldn't frame it in that

24   way, Justice -- Chief Justice Roberts.                 I think the

25   record does reveal that discrimination in the covered

 1   jurisdictions has a repetitive form.                     There are very --

 2   there are brief talks about over six dozen examples.

 3   Those are illustrative and not exhaustive, but

 4   repetitious violations, that is, violations in covered

 5   jurisdictions after a section 2 case --

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   So your answer is

 7   yes?

 8              MR. ADEGBILE:            I think that it's fair to say

 9   that the pattern has been more repetitious violations in

10   the covered jurisdictions and -- and more one off

11   discrimination in other places.

12              That is not to say that there isn't voting

13   discrimination in other States.                The record shows that

14   there is discrimination in other States.                    But the -- but

15   Congress found that the nature of the way the

16   discrimination is practiced, viewed through the lens of

17   history, is that repetitive violations happen.                     For

18   example, after this Court decided the LULAC case, a case

19   that was litigated over a number of months and very

20   expensive and complicated, the State then tried to

21   shorten the period for early voting.                     And the plaintiffs

22   in that case needed to file a section 5 enforcement

23   action, post-2000 redistricting, to give effect to this

24   Court's judgment.

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   So -- but I guess

 1   that point depends upon the assumption that shortening

 2   the time period for early voting is discriminatory as

 3   opposed to good policy.

 4               MR. ADEGBILE:         I think in the context of

 5   that circumstance, Justice -- Chief Justice Roberts, the

 6   issue was that you had a long-standing incumbent and

 7   that the early voting -- the timing of the early voting

 8   period was such that it was going to conflict with a --

 9   a holiday of -- of a --

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So that was largely

11   to protect the incumbent.

12               MR. ADEGBILE:         To protect the incumbent, but

13   to disadvantage the community that was prepared to

14   exercise its voice, as this Court found in the LULAC

15   opinion.   That is to say --

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, incumbent --

17               MR. ADEGBILE:         -- the incumbent was not the

18   candidate of choice.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Incumbent protection

20   takes place in the North as well as the South.

21               MR. ADEGBILE:         By all means, but the -- but

22   the incumbent protection in this instance was designed

23   to cut off the minority community, the Latino voters who

24   had been disadvantaged by virtue of that plan.                But

25   certainly that is not the only example.

 1              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Adegbile, what was -- I

 2   read it in the briefs, and I forget what it was.                     What

 3   was the vote on this 2006 extension -- 98 to nothing in

 4   the Senate, and what was it in the House?                   Was --

 5              MR. ADEGBILE:          It was -- it was 33 to 390, I

 6   believe.

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:            33 to 390.          You know, the

 8   -- the Israeli Supreme Court, the Sanhedrin, used to

 9   have a rule that if the death penalty was pronounced

10   unanimously, it was invalid, because there must be

11   something wrong there.       Do you ever expect -- do you

12   ever seriously expect Congress to vote against a

13   reextension of the Voting Rights Act?                   Do you really

14   think that any incumbent would -- would vote to do that?

15              MR. ADEGBILE:          Well --

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Twenty-five years from now?

17   Fifty years from now?      When?

18              MR. ADEGBILE:          Justice Scalia, I think some

19   members of Congress did of course vote against the Act.

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Thirty-three members of the

21   House and nobody in the Senate.

22              MR. ADEGBILE:          Thirty-three members of the

23   House, indeed.   But I think the -- the reason that they

24   voted for it is what's more important.                   Congress did not

25   assume that section 5 was necessary.                   It took a very


                                      51

 1   careful examination to see how it was operating, and the

 2   determination was that in the absence of section 5,

 3   because of the repetitive violations, because of 620

 4   objections -- there was evidence that approximately 60

 5   percent of those show some evidence of intentional

 6   discrimination.

 7                 If you take away the prophylaxis, the

 8   discrimination will return in a way that we don't need

 9   to revisit.    The history has been that voting

10   discrimination manifests itself through repetitive

11   efforts and --

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But the question is, do

13   you agree that this is unlike access to buildings by

14   people who are in wheelchairs?              There has to come a

15   point where it will end, and perhaps Congress was just

16   picking up on what this court said a few years before in

17   the University of Michigan law school case, this court

18   came up with a 25-year figure so maybe Congress thought

19   this court thinks 25 years is about right, must be about

20   right.

21                 MR. ADEGBILE:        Congress had a more specific

22   reason as I understand the record.                 There was a specific

23   amendment proposed to shorten the time to 10 years.

24   Then Chairman of the judiciary committee James

25   Sensenbrenner rose to it explain part of the experience

 1   most of the infractions not all but most when many

 2   voting changes are necessary through reapportionment.

 3   Not all of them involved reapportionment but many of

 4   them are necessitated and the judgment was that it was

 5   going to capture two censuses and they also looked back

 6   to see how much discrimination they found from 1962 to

 7   reauthorization.

 8              And indeed Congress has been a little bit

 9   surprised they have not been able to dislodge more of

10   the discrimination.      They acknowledged the progress.

11   Progress didn't happen by itself and the experience had

12   been that it was helping us to move forward and that is

13   reflected I think in the State's brief to come to

14   Justice Kennedy's point.         I think there is an intrusion.

15   This Court's decisions have recognized that Section 5

16   does intrude but even in Bernie as the court

17   distinguished Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act from

18   the, many of the statutes that were there at issue in

19   this case, RFRA, certainly other cases followed, the

20   court kept returning to section 5 because the problem

21   had been demonstrated by Congress.                 The gravity of the

22   harm was so severe that Congress needed a special

23   mechanism to dislodge it because if we don't have the

24   vote as this court's decisions have recognized, our

25   whole system is undermined.

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:          So what is the reason in

 2   your opinion if you had to summarize it in ray sentence

 3   or two, you would say that the reason that Congress

 4   didn't go into other States and decide which ones to add

 5   to this or go into these States district by district and

 6   decide which ones to subtract from this, the reason that

 7   Congress didn't modify voting rights statute but simply

 8   renewed it?

 9                 MR. ADEGBILE:        Is that it wanted to stay the

10   course of ridding the covered jurisdictions from

11   discrimination.    Katzenbach spoke in items of the case.

12   Subsequent have spoke about ridding the country of this

13   scourge as it manifested itself in the covered

14   jurisdictions and I think this was some State-by-State

15   analysis and the reports of the covered jurisdictions

16   that do it --

17                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Would you say from your

18   experience and I'm sure you're very knowledgeable about

19   this that there is no great are discrimination in voting

20   in Virginia than in North Carolina or in Tennessee or in

21   Arkansas or in Ohio?

22                 MR. ADEGBILE:        I can't precisely quantify

23   the quantum of discrimination in each of those stays but

24   I think that Congress' judgment was there had been a

25   demonstrated pattern of discrimination in the covered


                                       54

 1   jurisdictions, covering formula had --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Wasn't Virginia the first

 3   State in the Union to elect a black governor.

 4                MR. ADEGBILE:        Yes, indeed it was.

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:          And it has a black chief

 6   justice of the supreme court currently.

 7                MR. ADEGBILE:        Yes, Justice Scalia, I take

 8   the point.   But I think it's not quite fair to say.             As

 9   my predecessor at the podium made the point, that there

10   have been African-Americans to rise to high office

11   throughout our history, but that occasion of a single

12   person sitting in a seat doesn't change the experience

13   on the ground for everyday citizens.

14                It is -- it has an important salutory effect

15   and it tells us about the possibilities of our

16   Constitution, but it doesn't mean that voters that are

17   trying to vote in a school board election in Louisiana

18   are going to have an easy time of it where racially

19   polarized voting is as extreme as it is and when

20   election officials manipulate the rules of the game to

21   try and disadvantage the minority community.

22                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, the brief filed by

23   the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the first 15 pages I think

24   makes a good demonstration of discrete discriminatory

25   acts; and the brief filed by Nathaniel, Professor


                                      55

 1   Percelly, makes an important point about crossovers in

 2   different -- my concern is it's just not clear to me

 3   that Congress addressed this for the rest of the

 4   country.   That's my concern.

 5                 MR. ADEGBILE:        I think the close -- the best

 6   evidence of the comparison question to which you're

 7   returning is the section 2 cases that were examined in a

 8   report that was submitted to Congress.                  And as

 9   Appellants recognize in their brief, 600 --

10   notwithstanding the powerful section 5 remedy, there

11   were 653 successful section 2 cases in covered

12   jurisdictions, and the success rate in covered

13   jurisdictions was much higher than in noncovered

14   jurisdictions.

15                 So when you put together the objections, the

16   requests for more information followed by withdrawals,

17   the section 5 enforcement actions, the section 2 cases,

18   it is a picture that far exceeds the record that was

19   before this august body when considering enactments of

20   Congress in other contexts in Hibbs and in Lane, and the

21   record was of intentional discrimination, not simply

22   disparities but purposeful efforts to disadvantaged

23   minority groups.    And I think that's the fundamental

24   difference between the covered jurisdictions and the

25   noncovered.

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, the cases

 2   you're talking about include both intentional and impact

 3   cases.   And the Constitution that section 5 is designed

 4   to implement covers only intentional discrimination.                       So

 5   even the examples you have given sweep broadly as a

 6   prophylactic measure and then the section 5 preclearance

 7   of course sweeps even more broadly.                     So we do have a

 8   situation, despite the evidence that was -- that you

 9   have cited, where less than one-twentieth of 1 percent

10   of the submissions that the States make are denied

11   preclearance.

12                Again, it seems to me that that means that

13   section 5 sweeps very, very broadly.

14                MR. ADEGBILE:         I think there are two

15   responses.    First, the relevant assessment is not simply

16   the rate.    As the lower court found, the rate of

17   objections even at the time of the 1975 re-authorization

18   in Rome was very small.        Judge Tatel spoke to this point

19   in his opinion and in the oral argument.                    The rate has

20   always been small.    But what section 5 is designed to do

21   is to vindicate the principles of our Constitution, and

22   the gravity of the harm is such that if we have 620

23   examples of discrimination and 60 percent of those are

24   intentional discrimination together with some of the

25   other indicia and under this Court's cases Congress is


                                       57
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   entitled to look broadly, not simply at the decided

 2   case, but to look broadly and to be the factfinder of

 3   this important information.

 4              This is a pattern.              It's a widespread

 5   pattern of intentional discrimination, and I think that

 6   that is something that this Court needs to focus on as

 7   it works through this important and serious issue.

 8              JUSTICE BREYER:            Thank you.

 9              I have another question.                    How long did it

10   take Congress to compile this 13,000-page record?

11              MR. ADEGBILE:          Approximately 10 months,

12   Justice Breyer.

13              JUSTICE BREYER:            And how long would it have

14   taken Congress in your opinion to have compiled the

15   record to figure out what's happening in this respect in

16   every State or in these States district by district?

17              MR. ADEGBILE:          I think that I can't put a

18   precise time on it, but it would have been certainly a

19   couple more years.    The time that is necessary to

20   compile these investigations and the expertise that's

21   necessary to assemble them and cull the data takes some

22   time in my personal experience.

23              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So your position is

24   that it makes no difference if discrimination in the

25   noncovered jurisdiction is more widespread and more


                                      58

 1   persistent; it doesn't matter, because Congress can

 2   focus solely on the jurisdictions that have been covered

 3   since 1965?

 4                 MR. ADEGBILE:         I make a slightly different

 5   point.   I don't think that it doesn't matter at all.                 I

 6   think Congress has to act reasonably, but in light of

 7   the record before it its judgment to stay the course in

 8   the covered jurisdictions because of the way voting

 9   discrimination has manifested itself in those

10   jurisdictions, that judgment is reasonable on the record

11   it had before it.     It made a judgment in effect that

12   section 2 has proven more adequate to the task in other

13   jurisdictions that don't have the same history of

14   repetitive violations.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So I guess your

16   answer is that they can address the covered

17   jurisdictions that have been covered since 1965 without

18   looking at all to the rest of the country?

19                 MR. ADEGBILE:         I think that if things were

20   flipped and discrimination was much worse outside, that

21   would reflect on the reasonableness of Congress'

22   judgment.   But that's a fact situation that was not

23   present before Congress.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

 3                 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN

 4                        ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

 5                 MR. COLEMAN:       But, as Justice Alito pointed

 6   out, Congress didn't know, because it didn't ask,

 7   whether discrimination is worse in Tennessee or Arkansas

 8   than in Virginia and other States.                 Nobody knows sitting

 9   here today.

10                 I respectfully disagree that Congress

11   couldn't have put together that effort.                 What we really

12   do hear is that this, this badge that is preclearance,

13   this Congressional judgment that State and local

14   officials in covered jurisdictions who in my experience

15   are strongly --

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:          You should have a chance to

17   answer the same question.          You heard my question, the

18   time question.    What's your estimate?

19                 MR. COLEMAN:       Oh, I strongly disagree with

20   that.   AEI put in a number of reports that evaluated

21   things on the ground in a variety of noncovered

22   jurisdictions such as Milwaukee.                I certainly think

23   within the time that Congress took to look at this if

24   they had been interested they could have easily

25   evaluated this.    It would have been easily available to

 1   them.

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, they now have 25 years

 3   to look at, or 24 years, to look at the rest of the

 4   country.    Are they doing that?             Are they holding

 5   hearings?

 6                MR. COLEMAN:         No, nobody is doing that.         In

 7   answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, that's what

 8   Congress did in 1982.        It said 25 years.           That 25 years

 9   has gone by.     Times have changed.

11   -- it was not 1982, it was two thousand something.                This

12   Court thought from two thousand something 25 years was a

13   reasonable period.

14                MR. COLEMAN:         Congress' justification simply

15   does -- I think as we've heard from counsel, in light of

16   our mobile society and the fact that people don't live

17   in the same place people lived 40 years ago.                This is a

18   bad --

19                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Let me ask this question

20   just as sort of background.             Does your case challenge at

21   all the standards that Congress has used throughout the

22   statute for causing States to become covered

23   jurisdictions?

24                MR. COLEMAN:         Well the only standards that

25   exist are whether they use a test or devise in the


                                        61

 1   1960s.

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Correct.       Have you ever

 3   challenged those as a basis for making a State or county

 4   or election district covered?

 5              MR. COLEMAN:         I don't think we've challenged

 6   the action that took place --

 7              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Well, you have a history

 8   that some States are covered and some are not because of

 9   certain requirements that the statute imposed.                 And I

10   didn't understand the case to involve a challenge to the

11   method by which States became -- become covered.

12              MR. COLEMAN:         No, Justice Stevens, we do

13   challenge that.   In fact --

14              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Then why is it relevant

15   there are a lot of States out there that are not

16   covered?

17              MR. COLEMAN:         Because this Court's

18   discussions of these issues in Morris and in Garrett and

19   even in Hibbs indicate that it does matter what the

20   evidence shows with respect to a coverage determination,

21   and Congress' decision to not update it, which we

22   believe was for political reasons, simply bears no

23   resemblance to reality.       And looking back to see who was

24   registered and who was voting in the '60s doesn't --

25              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Are you arguing the


                                      62
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   statute is unconstitutional because Congress failed to

 2   extend it to other -- other parts of the country?

 3               MR. COLEMAN:        No, I don't think that's our

 4   argument.   I think our argument is it's partially

 5   unconstitutional because it even failed to look at the

 6   coverage criteria and that it used the criteria

 7   literally off the books from the '60s and '70s without

 8   even looking at the information.

 9               Again, if Congress had done that in 1965 and

10   said, we want to look at this Franklin-Hoover -- excuse

11   me -- this Franklin Roosevelt-Hoover election in 1932, I

12   think the Court would have been pretty surprised that

13   that was the best and most relevant information that

14   Congress could come up with.

15               This idea of -- of a badge that really runs

16   with the land is -- is something that we -- we think is

17   inherently unjustifiable.

18               I'd also like to address the point about

19   racial bloc voting.      Racial bloc voting is not

20   discrimination, and it's not unconstitutional.            And,

21   indeed, the way the Court has interpreted section 2 --

22   and I realize there are divisions in the Court about

23   this --

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The district will -- the

25   district will never be involved in racial bloc voting


                                      63

 1   for districting purposes because it doesn't -- it's

 2   boundaries don't change.

 3              MR. COLEMAN:        That's true, Justice Ginsburg.

 4   But in terms of this facial challenge, it is important

 5   for the Court to understand and to consider the fact

 6   that Congress really thumbed its nose at the Court in

 7   terms of rejecting the constitutional concerns that the

 8   Court raised in -- in Miller and in Bossier Parish and

 9   in Georgia versus Ashcroft.

10              The new enactment has been changed in a way

11   that -- that really requires covered jurisdictions to

12   engage more and more in race-based redistricting and

13   race-based -- and it's not only redistricting, Justice

14   Ginsburg -- in race-based decisionmaking.             And so here

15   we are 40 years --

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Why wouldn't one

17   construing the Act as it was passed in 2006, say, well,

18   Congress obviously had in mind that this would be

19   enforced consistent with this Court's decision in Shaw,

20   this Court's decision in Miller?

21              MR. COLEMAN:        We believe that the

22   interpretation of the Act or -- excuse me -- the passage

23   of the amendments in 2006 go far beyond what

24   preclearance was in 1965.        We have a more restrictive

25   form of preclearance that requires State and local


                                     64

 1   governments to engage in more, not less, race-based

 2   decisionmaking with respect to elections.               And that, as

 3   the Court has noted, creates additional constitutional

 4   issues with the Court -- with the statute.

 5              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

 6   The case is submitted.

 7              (Whereupon, at 11:26 a.m., the case in the

 8   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
