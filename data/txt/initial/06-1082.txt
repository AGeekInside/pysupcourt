 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 We'll hear argument

 6                   ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. McCULLOUGH

 7                           ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8               MR. McCULLOUGH:             Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 9   it please the Court:

10               This Court has again and again held that an

11   arrest is constitutionally reasonable if the officers

12   have probable cause to believe a suspect has committed a

13   crime.   The Court has found that this standard

14   represents the best compromise between the needs of the

15   citizens and the duty of the government to combat crime.

16   While the States are free to build additional procedures

17   on this constitutional bedrock, when they do so these

18   additional procedures are matters of State law.                They do

19   not change the constitutional standard.

20               The Court below erred in substituting this

21   clear, established, uniform, time-tested standard for a

22   standard that has none of those virtues.

23               First, it is undeniable that if State law

24   can raise the constitutional bar, that it will lead to

25   widespread differences on the exact same facts, on the


                                        3

 1   exact same crime, not only across State lines, but also

 2   within a particular jurisdiction.

 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Mr. McCullough --

 4              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                If this officer had

 5   complied with the State law, that is he had issued a

 6   summons, then you agree that the exclusionary rule would

 7   apply if he went ahead and searched.

 8              MR. McCULLOUGH:                That's correct.      If he had

 9   issued a summons, Knowles would apply and the evidence

10   would be excluded.

11              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                So would you explain the

12   logic to saying that when the police violate State law,

13   then the evidence can come in; but when they comply with

14   State law, it can't.

15              MR. McCULLOUGH:                Your Honor, the rationale

16   of Knowles was that the officer did not engage in any

17   extended contact with the suspect and that there was no

18   need to gather evidence.

19              But where from a constitutional sense there

20   is a full-fledged arrest, then the particular rationale

21   of Knowles doesn't apply; and I don't think the -- we're

22   asking the Court to embrace violations of State law;

23   we're asking the Court to recognize that when a State

24   goes above and beyond what the Constitution requires,

25   that the remedies for those violations should be left to

 1   the States.

 2                 And Virginia has provided a number of those

 3   remedies; but here the officer did make a full custodial

 4   arrest.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Did you -- excuse me,

 6   sorry, General.

 7                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Well, you say he made a

 8   custodial arrest.     Did he search the defendant at the

 9   time of the arrest?

10                 MR. McCULLOUGH:            No.    There was a

11   miscommunication between the officers --

12                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            And did he search him at

13   the place of the arrest?

14                 MR. McCULLOUGH:            No.

15                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Well, how can this be

16   incident to an arrest?

17                 MR. McCULLOUGH:            Your Honor, the fact of the

18   arrest was uncontested, and the law doesn't require --

19                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            But the search is

20   unrelated to the arrest, as I understand the facts.

21                 MR. McCULLOUGH:            No, Your Honor.

22                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            It took place later in a

23   different place.

24                 MR. McCULLOUGH:            Justice Stevens, the search

25   was related to the arrest.           What happened at the scene

 1   was the officer made a pat-down and assumed the other

 2   officer had conducted the search.                  When they got to the

 3   hotel, they realized there had been a mix-up.                  But he

 4   had not yet been taken to the station and booked and so

 5   the rationale supporting the search incident to the

 6   arrest is present.

 7               JUSTICE STEVENS:               Well, why is it present if

 8   he's not -- he searched when he wasn't arrested?                   I

 9   don't understand.     Could they wait a week and do it?

10               MR. McCULLOUGH:               The arrest did not cease at

11   that point, Your Honor.          In United States v. Edwards,

12   the Court recognized that at times the search will not

13   proceed immediately upon arrest.

14               JUSTICE STEVENS:               It's an ongoing arrest, is

15   it?

16               MR. McCULLOUGH:               Well, it's an arrest --

17               JUSTICE STEVENS:               Incident to an ongoing

18   arrest?   That's kind of a new concept.

19               MR. McCULLOUGH:               It's an arrest until he is

20   released or denied bail.           But I would also add that the

21   timing issue was simply not raised below.                 And so

22   there's no reason at this juncture to raise an issue

23   that the litigants chose not to --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Mr. McCullough, the

25   proposition that you're arguing, does it apply at the

 1   Federal level as well?        Suppose -- suppose I think that

 2   my neighbor next door is growing marijuana and I have

 3   probable cause to believe that, all right?

 4                 So I go in and search his house; and sure

 5   enough, there is marijuana.              And I bring it to the

 6   police's attention, and they eventually arrest him.

 7                 Is that lawful search?

 8                 MR. McCULLOUGH:            If there is State action --

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I'm a State actor, I guess.

10   You know --

11                 (Laughter.)

12                 MR. McCULLOUGH:            If you have State actors --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            You know, a Supreme Court

14   Justice should not be --

15                 (Laughter.)

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- should not be living

17   next door to somebody growing marijuana.                 It doesn't

18   seem right.

19                 MR. McCULLOUGH:            That's not a smart

20   neighbor.

21                 (Laughter.)

22                 MR. McCULLOUGH:            If you have State action

23   and you enter into someone's home, then the Constitution

24   affords a heightened level of protection.                 But --

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Don't dance around.       Is it

 1   -- is it rendered an unreasonable search by the fact

 2   that I'm not a law enforcement officer at all?

 3                MR. McCULLOUGH:             I don't think the fact

 4   of -- no.    The fact that --

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:             So any Federal employee can

 6   go crashing around conducting searches and seizures?

 7                MR. McCULLOUGH:             So long --

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:             So long as he has probable

 9   cause?

10                MR. McCULLOUGH:             That's correct.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:             That's fantastic.

12                (Laughter.)

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Do you really think that?

14                MR. McCULLOUGH:             I think if there is State

15   action, it doesn't matter that you're wearing a badge or

16   that you've gone through the police academy.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Or that you are an

18   administrative law judge at the, you know, Bureau of

19   Customs?    It doesn't matter?

20                MR. McCULLOUGH:             I think that's right.     That

21   if you have -- if the State --

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:             What about a janitor?

23   You're a janitor, a federally employed janitor.

24                MR. McCULLOUGH:             Your Honor --

 1   marijuana, and he's just as offended as a Supreme Court

 2   Justice would be.    Can he conduct a search?

 3              MR. McCULLOUGH:               I think if he's doing it on

 4   behalf of the State, the answer is yes.

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Wow.

 6              MR. McCULLOUGH:               But in terms of the

 7   Federal-State distinction, Your Honor, I think what

 8   we're advocating for is the uniform standard that this

 9   Court has embraced before, that there should not be a

10   difference between a Federal officer on a State facility

11   who is authorized under the Assimilated Crimes Act to

12   arrest for Virginia laws and a Virginia officer who is a

13   hundred feet away with making an unconstitutional arrest

14   under the holding below when --

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Would you agree that

16   there was no probable cause to arrest, given the State

17   statute?

18              MR. McCULLOUGH:               Your Honor --

19              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               You're talking about

20   probable cause to believe that he committed an offense.

21              MR. McCULLOUGH:               That's right.

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But was there probable

23   cause to arrest?

24              MR. McCULLOUGH:               Well, the State court found

25   there was no -- none of the exceptions in the statute


                                         9

 1   applied.   But when the Court has used the term "probable

 2   cause to arrest," it has never required a two-step

 3   analysis of, first, probable cause to believe a crime

 4   had been committed, and then probable cause to arrest.

 5   It's always been, in this Court's cases, a single

 6   inquiry:   Has there been probable cause?

 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Could he -- could this

 8   officer have gotten a warrant to arrest Moore?                 Could he

 9   -- is it -- oh, there's an offense going on under

10   Virginia law, I'm going to check with -- call in to see

11   if I can get a warrant.        Could he have gotten a warrant?

12               MR. McCULLOUGH:            Well, under the facts of

13   this case he could have, but it would have caused a

14   prolonged detention of the suspect.

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How could he -- how could

16   he have gotten a warrant to arrest when it's

17   a nonarrestable offense?

18               MR. McCULLOUGH:            Well --

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             He couldn't -- would a

20   judge have told this police officer -- they have a

21   call-in procedure, call the judge.                 You want to -- you

22   need to issue a warrant to arrest him for driving with a

23   suspended license, but that's not an arrestable offense.

24               MR. McCULLOUGH:            Your Honor, it is an

25   arrestable offense under certain circumstances.                 And so

 1   the officer is left with each arrest to make a

 2   discretionary call.

 3              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Did these officers think

 4   this -- those circumstances exist?

 5              MR. McCULLOUGH:             The officers did not --

 6   their only testimony was it was their prerogative.                   And

 7   unfortunately they did not then unpack that explanation

 8   to say why they thought one of the exceptions applied.

 9              What the State argued below and the State

10   court rejected was that he was alone in a car with this

11   large angry dog.   There was no passenger that he could

12   switch places with, and so if they write him a summons,

13   logically, what is he going to do?                 He doesn't live

14   anywhere nearby.   As soon as they leave the scene, he's

15   going to get right back in his car and drive away.

16              Now the State court rejected that, but that

17   illustrates the fact that under this statute the

18   officers have to make discretionary calls as to when

19   these exceptions apply.        Is the defendant --

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Maybe we could say that in

21   this, in these unique circumstances, where the officers

22   could not let the fellow drive off without a license, it

23   was not unreasonable to arrest him, but in some other

24   situation where they had no arrest authority it would

25   be.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I mean, you know, let's

 3   assume that the stop was not based on some, some

 4   deficiency in his license or some deficiency in the

 5   car -- I don't know what else it could be -- like, he

 6   had been going too fast, okay?              And it's just a

 7   misdemeanor.   He was five miles over the speed limit.

 8                Now, in that situation you couldn't say, as

 9   you've said here, gee, if they just let him go, he'd

10   still be driving without a license; they had to arrest

11   him; they had no choice.         In that situation, he wouldn't

12   necessarily be going above the speed limit.                Would that

13   be -- why couldn't you say it was reasonable here, but

14   it wouldn't be reasonable there?

15                MR. McCULLOUGH:           Well, what we're asking the

16   Court to do is to let the States regulate this arrest

17   authority.

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:           If that's the argument

19   you're making, then don't bring forward the argument

20   that they couldn't let him go because he'd be in

21   violation of the law.      If you want us to make that

22   narrow a holding, I guess we can.                Is that what you want

23   us to do?

24                MR. McCULLOUGH:           All we're asking the Court

25   to do is to affirm the probable cause standard that has

 1   -- without any further balancing, that the balancing has

 2   occurred when --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:              No, you're asking us to

 4   balance.   You're asking us to say, after all, in this

 5   case if they hadn't arrested he would have been

 6   violating the law as soon as they let him go.

 7               MR. McCULLOUGH:              No, I'm simply explain --

 8   what I was trying to so was to explain that as a matter

 9   of state law these officers have to make these

10   discretionary calls.        If that then becomes the

11   constitutional standard, that instead of a simple

12   probable cause finding you have to get into every

13   discretionary call by the officer, that it -- it

14   turns actually --

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:              You say this was not

16   unlawful under Virginia law, then, because of the factor

17   you brought forth?

18               MR. McCULLOUGH:              No, Your Honor.     That was

19   adversely litigated against us in the State court.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, I don't know what

21   you're talking about a discretionary call.                 It wasn't a

22   discretionary call.       He couldn't arrest the person.

23               MR. McCULLOUGH:              Well -- but the problem is,

24   if the standard then becomes a two-step probable cause,

25   where we have to figure out as a matter of

 1   constitutional law whether the officer guessed right in

 2   terms of one of these exceptions, then every

 3   discretionary judgment in the field becomes the occasion

 4   for constitutional --

 5              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   But suppose it works

 6   the other way.    If Virginia has a law saying you can

 7   arrest anybody you want on our highways, but, you know,

 8   here's what the offenses are, the officers did not have

 9   probable cause to think a crime had been committed, but

10   it was they had probable cause to arrest, I suppose

11   under the Respondent's theory that would be all right.

12              MR. McCULLOUGH:              It -- I mean, it certainly

13   would flow from that.       So I think, given the

14   multitude --

15              JUSTICE STEVENS:              Let me ask this question:

16   You would argue it doesn't matter whether it violated

17   State or Federal law; it's a question of Federal law on

18   probable cause.   But does the character of the crime for

19   which the person is being arrested have any relevance to

20   the question whether the search is reasonable?                 For

21   example, supposing he is arrested for a tax offense;

22   could you go ahead and search him incident to that

23   arrest?

24              MR. McCULLOUGH:              The search incident to

25   arrest is a bright-line rule, Your Honor, that this

 1   Court has promulgated in Robinson.

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:            The answer is yes, they

 3   could search?

 4              MR. McCULLOUGH:            I'm sorry.          Yes, the answer

 5   is yes, that if a crime has been committed the

 6   bright-line rule permits the officer to search the

 7   suspect for officer safety as well as --

 8              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Even though the rationale

 9   for the search incident to arrest doesn't apply?

10              MR. McCULLOUGH:            What the -- yes, because

11   what the Court said in Robinson was:                   We're not

12   interested in delving into case-by-case litigation as to

13   how dangerous this person was and how -- and whether

14   there was a likelihood of evidence being found --

15              JUSTICE ALITO:          Why would the rationale not

16   apply in that situation?        Are you accepting the

17   proposition that anybody who's arrested for a tax

18   offense is not a danger to the arresting officer?

19   Haven't there been some pretty dangerous people arrested

20   over the years for tax offenses?

21              (Laughter.)

22              MR. McCULLOUGH:            I agree with that.           I'm

23   arguing that it's a bright-line rule and that if someone

24   is arrested for a crime, tax or otherwise, it's not the

25   nature of the crime --

 1                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           No, but you're also

 2   arguing, as I understand it, that the -- that the

 3   search, even in the case of the tax arrest, does fall

 4   within the rationale of search incident to an arrest

 5   because one of those two rationales is officer safety.

 6   Isn't that your point?

 7                 MR. McCULLOUGH:           Yes.

 8                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Okay.       So you reject the

 9   premise of the question then?              The premise of the

10   question was that the search incident to the arrest in

11   the tax case is outside the rationale of searches

12   incident to an arrest; and your position is it's not

13   outside it.

14                 MR. McCULLOUGH:           That's correct.

15                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Okay.

16                 MR. McCULLOUGH:           This Court has crafted a

17   bright-line rule -- it has not distinguished between

18   types of offenses; it doesn't have to be a violent

19   offense; it could be a white-collar offense -- that

20   across the board there is virtue to having this

21   bright-line rule that permits the officer to search

22   incident to a lawful arrest.             And in Robinson the Court

23   noted that a lawful arrest is a -- that it met a

24   constitutionally lawful arrest, one made with probable

25   cause.   This arrest was made with probable cause.                The

 1   search incident to the arrest was lawful.

 2               I would ask the Court if I could keep my

 3   remaining time.

 6               ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

 7                 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 8                          AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 9                     SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

10               MR. DREEBEN:          Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

11   and may it please the Court:

12               The States and the Federal Government may

13   for a variety of reasons enact restrictions on officer

14   authority that exceed the requirements of the Fourth

15   Amendment as this Court has articulated them.

16               When such State law or Federal law

17   extra-constitutional restrictions are violated, it is a

18   matter for the government that enacted them to determine

19   what remedy appropriately flows from that violation.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Does the person making the

21   arrest at least have to have some arrest authority?

22               MR. DREEBEN:          This Court has never --

 1   arresting people or searching people.

 2                 MR. DREEBEN:        Well, certainly,

 3   Justice Scalia, such an individual wouldn't have

 4   positive law authority to engage in an arrest.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Just as this person here

 6   didn't have positive law authority to engage in an

 7   arrest.

 8                 MR. DREEBEN:        The question would then be

 9   whether that means that it's automatically a

10   constitutional violation.           I think in some situations

11   even a governmental official can act in a private

12   capacity by acting outside the boundaries of that

13   individual's responsibility.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes, but he was purporting

15   to act in an official capacity.               And he did, indeed,

16   give the marijuana to the officials at the Justice

17   Department.

18                 MR. DREEBEN:        And if you assume that the

19   Court would have two options.              It could either

20   federalize some sort of an amorphous requirement that

21   there must be law enforcement authority in an official

22   in order for that official to engage in Fourth Amendment

23   activity, or it could hold that, what I think is the

24   more reasonable approach, which is that the bedrock

25   requirements of the Fourth Amendment protect against


                                        18

 1   arbitrariness, and the crucial one here is the existence

 2   of probable cause based on the facts to believe that the

 3   individual has violated a law.

 4               If that criteria is met, it is not

 5   constitutionally unreasonable, absent where an

 6   extraordinary intrusion for the individual's liberty or

 7   privacy interests to be compromised.                    It may be the most

 8   flagrant violation of departmental regulations in the

 9   world, and in that case the department that has those

10   regulations can take action, just as here Virginia says

11   if you violate the arrestable offense rule under

12   Virginia law, the consequence is not to exclude

13   evidence.   Virginia will not exclude evidence under its

14   own State law for a violation of this provision.

15               But it does say under State law that a

16   person can resist an unlawful arrest, The officer can be

17   sued for engaging in an unlawful arrest under State law,

18   and that the officer can be fired or disciplined.                   And

19   those are the sanctions that the State has chosen to do.

20               Now, what the Virginia Supreme Court has

21   done is come along and say, even though you do not

22   intend this rule to trigger the exclusionary rule under

23   Virginia law, you have no choice.                As a matter of

24   Federal constitutional law, if Virginia decides to

25   exceed the constitutional minimum as this Court

 1   announced in Atwater and place additional restrictions

 2   on the arrest authority, it must pay a constitutional

 3   price of having the evidence excluded if that rule is

 4   violated.

 5               At the outset, it's clear that imposing such

 6   a Fourth Amendment rule would do nothing other than

 7   discourage the States from providing additional

 8   restrictions as a matter of their own State's law that

 9   may serve to protect citizen privacy interests above the

10   floor that this Court has identified as required by the

11   Fourth Amendment.

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              If you're right,

13   Mr. Dreeben, then the Court gave a false signal when it

14   GVR'd in Lovelace, in the Lovelace case, the person who

15   was drinking in public, it GVR'd in light of Knowles.

16               MR. DREEBEN:          I don't know that it gave a

17   false signal, Justice Ginsburg, but a GVR doesn't

18   indicate this Court's disposition of the merits once all

19   of the arguments are presented to it.                    And, admittedly,

20   I think neither side is able to point to a case that

21   squarely addressed and conclusively resolved the issue

22   that's before this Court.

23               What the Court has done, I think, under

24   related issues under Fourth Amendment law is announce

25   pretty clearly that the fact that a State has either

 1   renounced an interest in taking a particular law

 2   enforcement action that it could otherwise

 3   constitutionally take or positively prohibited a law

 4   enforcement action does not mean that the action is

 5   unconstitutional.

 6              As long ago as the Cooper v. California

 7   case, the Court dealt with the situation where an

 8   officer was not authorized to undertake an inventory

 9   search, and the California courts treat it as a

10   violation of their own law.

11              This Court said it was still a reasonable

12   search under the Fourth Amendment; and unless

13   Respondent -- excuse me, unless -- well, Respondent

14   concludes that there should be a different Fourth

15   Amendment rule for searches than procedures, Cooper

16   stands for the proposition that a violation of State law

17   does not ipso facto equate to a violation of the Federal

18   Constitution.

19              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              If we rule for Respondent

20   in this case, would we have to reexamine the holding in

21   California v. Greenwood?

22              MR. DREEBEN:           Yes, Justice Kennedy.

23   California v. Greenwood is the next case in the line

24   where the Court recognized that California had made it

25   illegal to conduct garbage searches.                     And you could make

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the same argument that Respondent is making here today:

 2   That California had renounced any interest in conducting

 3   garbage searches, therefore there's nothing on the State

 4   side of the line to balance against the individual's

 5   invasion of privacy, and therefore the State should

 6   lose.   And this Court held precisely the opposite in

 7   California v. Greenwood, finding that it was

 8   constitutionally reasonable to engage in the garbage

 9   search because there was no federally recognized

10   expectation of privacy, even though the State had

11   decided to go further and grant an additional layer of

12   protection to its citizens.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             There could not have been

14   a warrant -- a grant-- a judge could not have given a

15   warrant for arrest on these charges.

16               MR. DREEBEN:         I'm venturing a little bit

17   outside of my expertise under State law, but I think

18   that that's correct.      Because State law provided that

19   this was not an arrestable offense unless one of the

20   exceptions to the offense existed.

21               And I should note that one of the offenses

22   here -- excuse me -- one of the exceptions here is that

23   a court of general jurisdiction could have entered an

24   exemption from the arrestable offense rule and then

25   officers within that jurisdiction would have been

 1   constitutionally and under State law --

 2              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               How often and under what

 3   circumstances is that Virginia -- Virginia law rule?              I

 4   mean, when does a general district court give permission

 5   for a custodial arrest in a certain class of cases?

 6              MR. DREEBEN:           I know that it has done it.         I

 7   don't know that there are any restrictions on when it

 8   would do it.    The point, I think, of giving the general

 9   courts the authority to do this is that these kinds of

10   laws are not necessarily enacted, as Respondent posits,

11   to be supplementary protection for privacy.              They do not

12   necessarily represent a judgment that law enforcement

13   officers should never bring people in for minor traffic

14   misdemeanors.   They may represent a judgment that law

15   enforcement officers should be out on the beat policing

16   more important crimes and it's a waste of social

17   resources and scarce police resources to have them

18   bringing people downtown for these kinds of offenses.

19              In a particular jurisdiction, law

20   enforcement may make a case that actually it's important

21   enough to deter various traffic violations and to ensure

22   that the individuals show up, that officers should have

23   plenary authority to make arrests.

24              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I should know this, but do

25   we defer to State law in determining the lawfulness of

 1   the time before arraignment in the context of

 2   confessions, the McNabb-Mallory rule?

 3              MR. DREEBEN:           The McNabb-Mallory rule --

 4              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Which is Federal.

 5              MR. DREEBEN:           -- is uniquely Federal.          The

 6   closest analog -- and this may be what Your Honor has in

 7   mind -- is that in the County of Riverside case the

 8   Court set a 48-hour outside limit for when you have to

 9   bring an arrested individual before a magistrate for a

10   probable cause hearing.         Under Respondent's position --

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, was there any

12   indication in that case that if the State had a shorter

13   period, they would --

14              MR. DREEBEN:           No, and that's precisely, I

15   think, the point.    All of the rules that this Court has

16   announced under the Fourth Amendment, the search

17   incident to arrest rule, which is triggered as a

18   bright-line rule without regard to whether the specifics

19   of the case support it, under Respondent's theory

20   Virginia could overrule that by saying officers shall

21   not conduct a search incident to arrest without a

22   specific exigency in that case.               States could overrule

23   within their own jurisdictions the Federal rule that

24   this Court announced in Riverside.                  It could say that

25   individuals have to be brought before a magistrate

 1   within 12 hours or they have to be released.                  And under

 2   Respondent's theory that you absorb State law into the

 3   reasonableness inquiry, this Court's Federal court

 4   decision would be overruled.             And most directly here,

 5   Atwater would be overruled with respect to

 6   non-arrestable offenses if Respondent's position is

 7   correct that when the State has said that we don't want

 8   to undertake an arrest for a minor offense, therefore,

 9   there's no longer any State interest in undertaking the

10   arrest.

11                 The reality is that this Court has balanced

12   as a matter of Fourth Amendment law what is

13   constitutionally necessary as a uniform Federal matter

14   to protect people against arbitrary law enforcement

15   action, and it's drawn the line at probable cause.                   And

16   as this Court said in Whren, absent rare circumstances

17   when probable cause exists, a search or seizure is

18   reasonable.

19                 And the kind of rare circumstances that the

20   Court gave the example of in Whren were heightened

21   intrusions on individual privacy or liberties such as

22   surgery to remove evidence or an unannounced entry into

23   a home.   We don't have anything like that here and the

24   standard Federal rule should govern.

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, Mr.

 2               Mr. Goldstein.

 3              ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

 4                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 5               MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 6   it please the Court:

 7               The notion that the proud men who framed the

 8   Constitution would believe it reasonable to go out and

 9   arrest someone for a non-arrestable offense and not only

10   do that, but having committed that trespass at common

11   law, to further search them, is I think an extreme

12   proposition and one that they would not have accepted.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:            But you think they would

14   accept arresting somebody for not wearing a seat belt?

15               MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Your Honor, I do --

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:            It seems to me we've

17   crossed that bridge with Atwater.

18               MR. GOLDSTEIN:          No, Your Honor, I disagree,

19   for the reason that -- and there are obviously -- I'm

20   not here to tell the Court what its own precedents mean.

21   But Atwater makes quite clear that at common law this

22   was something that was subject to legislate ive

23   override, and that's what was reasonable at common law

24   when the Constitution was framed.                And that is,

25   legislatures sometimes said that you could arrest and


                                       26
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   sometimes said that you couldn't.

 2               But two things were undisputable, I think,

 3   and that is when you did arrest illegally that was

 4   unreasonable --

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:            The particular illegal

 6   arrest here, to bring this down to earth a little bit,

 7   is I take it they arrested him because he had a

 8   suspended -- he was driving without a good license?

 9               MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Yes.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay.       So that Virginia law

11   says if you stop somebody, arrest him -- if you stop

12   somebody, you know he doesn't have a license to drive,

13   you can arrest him if you think he's going to continue

14   driving?   Can't you?

15               MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Yes.

16               JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay.       So the policemen

17   here, according to you and I guess the Virginia court,

18   made a misjudgment.     He thought this guy might still

19   drive somewhere or he might have thought it or a

20   policeman in similar circumstances might have thought

21   it.

22               So Virginia says if, in fact, policemen, you

23   stop somebody for suspended -- for driving without a

24   license, and you make a mistake, you arrest him, we

25   don't think that's a big deal, because who knows if he's


                                       27
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   going to continue to drive.            We don't even suspend.          We

 2   don't even suspend.     We don't even suppress the

 3   evidence.   That's Virginia.

 4               So if Virginia isn't going to suppress the

 5   evidence because they think it's not a big deal to make,

 6   for the policeman to make a mistake as to whether a

 7   person who's driving without a license will keep driving

 8   once the policeman goes away, why do you think Thomas

 9   Jefferson and everybody else thought that that was such

10   a big deal that the evidence had to be suppressed?

11               MR. GOLDSTEIN:          For a few reasons.         First,

12   Virginia does take this quite seriously.                 The officer

13   can be fired for violating the statute.                 That's no small

14   thing.

15               The second is I wouldn't assume that

16   Virginia believes and the Virginia legislature believed

17   that the evidence would not be suppressed, because for

18   reasons that I'll explain in a minute the Virginia

19   legislature was triggering a long line of its court

20   cases that say if you arrest someone for a

21   non-arrestable offense, the Fourth Amendment is

22   violated, and the application of the exclusionary rule

23   has never been questioned in that context.

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I thought it's

25   questioned in your footnote 13 in your brief.                 You seem


                                       28
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to suggest that the exclusionary rule is not at issue in

 2   this case.

 3                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:         That's right.           I don't

 4   question its application, but neither does Virginia,

 5   Your Honor.

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So - so we should

 7   write an opinion saying we're not saying that it was

 8   correct to -- we're not saying that it was correct to

 9   exclude the evidence in this case?

10                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:         That's -- I think that

11   that's right.    That also happened in California v.

12   Greenwood, you may recall, Mr. Chief Justice, where

13   there was some discussion at oral argument about would

14   we believe the exclusionary rule should be applied here.

15   That question had not been preserved.                    That case is on

16   remand in the California Supreme Court.

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:           What is the difference

18   between this and Whren?         That is, in Whren the arrest

19   violated a D.C. regulation that says a plainclothes

20   officer cannot approach a car except in immediate cases

21   of immediate danger.       And in Whren we said that isn't

22   such a big deal and we don't think the Fourth Amendment

23   turns on that kind of triviality.

24                 All right.      If it doesn't turn on that kind

25   of arrest procedure triviality, is how we characterized


                                        29
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   it there, how is this any any different?

 2                MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Whren is different in

 3   several different ways.         The first is that that was a

 4   challenge to the stop, not the search incident to

 5   arrest.    The claim was that the officers under a local

 6   D.C. Government regulation did not have the power to

 7   make a traffic stop because there was a local regulation

 8   that said if you're not in uniform and if you're not in

 9   a police car, a marked car, you shouldn't make those

10   traffic stops.

11                So, it's different on a couple of different

12   actions.   The nature of the constitutional challenge,

13   the nature of the law that's being evoked, the local

14   regulation rather than legislation, I think, are the

15   principal ones.

16                Here we're dealing with something quite

17   fundamental, and I haven't gotten to this

18   Court's precedents applying the common law rule that I

19   described at the beginning, so if I could do and then

20   compare Whren.    Post -- define the common law, every

21   since Weeks, which is the first case of this Court to

22   recognize the search incident arrest exception, all the

23   way through Di Re, Miller, Johnson, Ker, DeFillippo,

24   those are five cases that confront the question in this

25   case, I believe that genuinely confront it; is not


                                        30
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   dictum, it is holding.

 2               Those cases confront the question:          Can you

 3   have a constitutional search incident to an illegal

 4   arrest?   Illegal there not being unconstitutional, but a

 5   violation of State law.

 6               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, why do you draw a

 7   distinction between something that's prohibited by a

 8   statute, something that's prohibited by a local ordnance

 9   or let's say it's a directive of the police department?

10   And if it's -- if the arrest is contrary to any of those

11   things, it's unlawful under State law, is it not?

12               MR. GOLDSTEIN:          The court hasn't ever

13   confronted that question.          The places -- the line of

14   cases that I described were one of two things, Positive

15   State legislation enacted by the legislature or common

16   law.   It has never dealt with the locality question.

17   Whren suggests that maybe a local police regulation is

18   too variable.   We would win under either rule.

19               The -- I think the core reason you would

20   draw the line at legislation is because this -- the

21   Fourth Amendment is not just an instrumental thing

22   designed to do good.      It is, as designed, to apply

23   common law concepts of reasonableness, which was the

24   foundation --

25               JUSTICE ALITO:          I thought it was your


                                       31
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   argument that if the arrest is unlawful under State law

 2   it's an unreasonable search, an unreasonable arrest

 3   under the Fourth Amendment?

 4              MR. GOLDSTEIN:          That's right.         And your

 5   question, Justice Alito, is designed to test what I mean

 6   by unlawful in terms of what sources -- the State

 7   constitution, legislation, local police practices.

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:            No.     It's designed to test

 9   whether you really mean unlawful under State law.

10   Either you don't mean it, because something that

11   violates a municipal ordnance is unlawful under State

12   law, and yet you would not apply your test.               So you

13   could express your test differently, unlawful under

14   State statutory law.

15              MR. GOLDSTEIN:          If I have conveyed that

16   impression, I am sorry.       I did not intend to.           Our rule

17   is that if it's unlawful.         All I'm saying is the Court

18   could conclude that local police regulations, for

19   example, are too variable to -- and Whren calls them

20   "trivialities," so we won't pick them up.

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No, it says the laws

22   of the 50 States are pretty variable on this question as

23   well.

24              MR. GOLDSTEIN:          As are the laws of whether

25   it's a crime at all, as are under Indianapolis v. Edmund


                                      32
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   and lots of other cases where the court --

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Do we have to look

 3   at both of those varieties?            Let's say the State has a

 4   rule that, yes, you can arrest people in a way that we

 5   would say you can't, but you don't have to have probable

 6   cause.   You just have to -- they're just arrestable.

 7                MR. GOLDSTEIN:         No, as Justice Ginsburg

 8   suggests, you have to have probable cases to arrest.

 9   Cases like Berkemer, Seth --

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- is probable cause

11   to arrest.   The State has a law that says you can arrest

12   in these circumstances whether or not you have probable

13   cause to believe that a crime has been committed.

14                MR. GOLDSTEIN:         I'm sorry.          By that phrase I

15   mean there is a constitutional component.                  Part of the

16   constitutional floor is that you have to have sufficient

17   cause.   That's a guarantee of the Fourth Amendment.

18   This Court's cases make clear you can't go below --

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I thought you were

20   telling us it has to be sufficient cause to arrest, not

21   sufficient cause to believe that a crime has been

22   committed.

23                MR. GOLDSTEIN:         That is necessary but not a

24   sufficient condition, Mr. Chief Justice.                  There's

25   obviously a -- the constitutional floor includes the


                                       33
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   element of the -- the degree of proof that's required by

 2   this Court precedents.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So it is, as your

 4   friends on the other side put it, you are advocating a

 5   two-step process.     There has to be probable cause to

 6   arrest and there has to be probable cause to believe a

 7   crime has been committed?

 8                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:          I view those as the same

 9   thing.     We may be just having --

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No, they're

11   different here.    They had probable cause to believe a

12   crime has been committed, but you say they didn't have

13   probable cause to arrest because State law makes it

14   illegal.

15                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:          In that sense, absolutely.

16   I just wanted to make sure I understood the terminology.

17   That's correct.

18                 But let me make quite clear that we are

19   discussing in the first half hour and the second half

20   hour I think two slightly different things.                   The first

21   half hour focused on the constitutionality of the arrest

22   vel non, which is at issue in Atwater, for example, and

23   at issue -- not even in Whren, which is just a traffic

24   stop.

25                 I am focusing on the somewhat different


                                         34
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   point.   There is a line of cases that deals with the

 2   constitutionality of the search incident to arrest and

 3   it says because at common law you could not search

 4   someone pursuant to an arrest that was a trespass, the

 5   search itself is unconstitutional.                   So if at the time of

 6   the framing a Federal officer, a Federal marshal, at the

 7   time of the framing had the power to arrest them for

 8   State law offenses, as they still do under the OLC

 9   opinions.

10                 If a Federal marshal had gone up to someone

11   who's committing a completely trivial offense, Atwater

12   recognizes there are offenses at common law that are not

13   arrestable.     That would be a trespass and to search the

14   person incident to that arrest would have violated the

15   Fourth Amendment, we believe.               It would have been

16   unreasonable.     When Mapp applies the Fourth Amendment to

17   the States, it would have been --

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What if the State

19   makes a trivial offense arrestable, as in Atwater?

20   You're suggesting in that situation the common law rule

21   we have doesn't apply.         It's a trivial offense, but it's

22   made arrestable and therefore it doesn't violate the

23   Fourth Amendment to search incident to that arrest.

24                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:          That's right.         At common law

25   and under the Fourth Amendment, that's right.                   You look


                                         35
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   to the positive source of authority, which is State law

 2   authority to arrest or a common law authority to arrest.

 3   That would not be unconstitutional.                     That -- that rule

 4   also make sense as a question of the structure of our

 5   democracy.   Remember, it puts in the hands of the

 6   legislature, which can be held responsible for the

 7   decision to make a trivial offense --

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, what if

 9   the legislature -- this was the hypothetical Mr. Dreeben

10   posed.   What if the legislature says yes, you can arrest

11   for this offense but you cannot search incident to the

12   arrest, because we think that's too much of an intrusion

13   given the fact that it's a relatively trivial offense?

14   In that case, would our doctrine saying under the Fourth

15   Amendment you can search incident to a valid arrest be

16   reversed preempted, preempted by the State law?

17                MR. GOLDSTEIN:         No.      There are times --

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So the State can

19   define the circumstances under which you can have an

20   arrest, but the State can't define and limit the

21   consequences of the arrest?

22                MR. GOLDSTEIN:         That's right.            That is --

23   there are traditions that are rooted in the common law,

24   that the search incident to arrest here was pursuant to

25   a trespass at common law that was completely

 1   unreasonable.

 2              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But isn't -- isn't the

 3   difficulty with that argument that we -- we have

 4   rejected the, in effect, the trespass rationale; and

 5   what you're telling us now, it seems to me, based on in

 6   effect trespass concepts, is that so far as the Fourth

 7   Amendment is concerned an arrest may constitutionally be

 8   made, but the officer following that arrest may not take

 9   the step of determining whether the individual arrested

10   has on his person anything that can be used to hurt the

11   officer like a knife or a gun?

12              And why should be we draw what seems to

13   me -- if we scrap, as we have done, the trespass

14   analogy, why should we make what seems to me at least an

15   irrational distinction of saying the Fourth Amendment

16   says it's okay to arrest but it's not okay to protect

17   yourself after you have arrested?               Why should we accept

18   such a rule?

19              MR. GOLDSTEIN:          This is I think the hardest

20   question for us, and so if I could have the time to give

21   you a couple of answers.        The first is remember your

22   instrumental point is that the officer has the person,

23   they need to protect themselves.              We know that is not

24   itself -- and I'm going to give you a couple of

25   answers -- that is not itself to make the search

 1   constitutional because everyone agrees that if the

 2   arrest was unconstitutional, then the search,

 3   notwithstanding the exigencies that exist under Chimel

 4   and like cases all the way back, exist.                     So it's not

 5   enough that the officer has to protect himself.                     The

 6   reason --

 7               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Right.           But we're starting

 8   with a different premise.

 9               MR. GOLDSTEIN:          I --

10               JUSTICE SOUTER:            We're starting with a

11   constitutional premise.

12               MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Yes.       I understand this.

13   Justice Souter, I understand.             I was just trying to get

14   to your -- what I think is the greatest sort of logical

15   force:   The officer need to protect himself.

16               Now, to get to the harder case, which is

17   yours, and that is accept that the arrest is

18   constitutional.   We of course don't do that.                   We believe

19   that there isn't a sufficient interest to make it

20   reasonable, but you posit otherwise.                    The reason is

21   given by Justice Powell's concurrence in Robinson, which

22   is the fundamental search and seizure arrest case, and

23   he says when the person is lawfully arrested they have

24   engaged in conduct that they know can subject them to

25   arrest, they have a reduced expectation of privacy.                       So


                                       38

 1   while it's the case that the governmental interest

 2   remains the same -- protect the officer, find the

 3   evidence -- the other side of the Fourth Amendment

 4   balance is fundamentally different, because when a

 5   person has engaged in conduct which they know does not

 6   subject them to arrest they do not have a reduced

 7   expectation of privacy.

 8               This individual had every reason to believe

 9   dating back to the traditions of common law, to positive

10   State law, that they would not be searched incident to

11   arrest.

12               JUSTICE SOUTER:            If that -- if that logic is

13   sound and that logic depends on Justice Powell's use of

14   the word unlawfully, then it seems to me the -- the only

15   way to arrest an irrational system would to be conclude

16   that, in fact, the arrest is not constitutionally

17   lawful.   Because on -- on your logic, you're still left

18   with the problem that I raised; and a constitutional

19   arrest in which the officer does not violate the Fourth

20   Amendment by apprehending the person, and yet the

21   officer is disabled from protecting himself, if we're

22   going to have a sensible rule, we've either got to say

23   the Fourth Amendment allows him to make the search

24   incident and protect himself, or we've got to have a

25   rule that says the Fourth Amendment doesn't allow him to


                                       39
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   make the search -- make the arrest in the first place.

 2   Otherwise we've got a crazy system.

 3                MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Can I just correct one

 4   thing?    And that is it does not depend on Justice

 5   Powell's use of the word unlawful.                  I believe to rule

 6   against us, Justice Souter, that you will have to

 7   overrule the line of cases from Di Re to DeFillipo.

 8   Those are on point.      Now you may decide --

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Don't you think we have

10   to, if not overrule, at least back away from the holding

11   in California versus Greenwood?

12                MR. GOLDSTEIN:          No, Justice Kennedy, and

13   that's why I focused so much on searches incident to

14   arrest.   There are times when State law is incorporated

15   into the Fourth Amendment, and everybody agrees that

16   regulatory searches are; inventory searches are, there

17   are times when it isn't.          And California v Greenwood is

18   not one and there's a logical reason for it.                 And that

19   is that the premise of when you were deciding in a -- in

20   a trash search, this Court's document looked at two

21   things.   The first is, is there a reasonable expectation

22   of privacy, and if there is do we balance the interest?

23   California v Greenwood says there was no reasonable

24   expectation of privacy because that's evaluated as a

25   societal matter.   I'm focusing on a very narrow question


                                        40
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that doesn't disturb any other doctrines.

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            What about Cooper -- Cooper

 3   v California?

 4                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:          I think Cooper v California

 5   is a very good case for us, because Cooper and all its

 6   progeny say that State law has to authorize and

 7   determine the validity of the inventory search.                 If you

 8   violate the State regulations on when you conduct an

 9   inventory search, you violated the Fourth Amendment.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Can we go back for a

11   second?    Because, the reason I asked my question is I

12   was thinking about this very differently, and I just

13   want to have an answer, and I want your best thinking on

14   this.     My thought is that the answer to the question of

15   whether it violates the Fourth Amendment when a State --

16   when a person is arrested in violation of State law, the

17   answer is:     it depends.       Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

18   Obviously, if there is no probable cause or if there

19   wasn't a crime at all, as just defined, the answer is

20   yes; but then I look at Whren and it says if all that

21   was at stake was a kind of arrest procedure State law,

22   herein -- there embodied in a rule, the answer is no.

23   So I look at this one.         And this one it seems to me

24   there is probable cause; it is a crime; moreover, it is

25   a crime for which the State permits arrest where the


                                         41

 1   officer subjectively thinks he's likely to keep driving.

 2   So it seems to me that's maybe much more close to what

 3   we had in Whren.

 4               Now I want you to say -- I want your

 5   comments on what I -- it's hypothetical, my statement,

 6   because I want to get your reaction to that point of

 7   view.   I'm not saying I hold it.              But I'm putting it

 8   forward so that I can get your reaction and argument.

 9               MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Well, I think it is a

10   terribly difficult rule to administer when you try to

11   decide, well if this is a law that sometimes allows

12   arrest and sometimes does not.              It is an infinitely more

13   administrable rule on our side, where we say to the

14   police officers, you have the power to arrest or not and

15   that's what determines --

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I think it is much easier

17   to administer, to have a uniform Federal standard,

18   rather than whether or not an officer can arrest in one

19   county for something and not in another county whether

20   he has to have a badge or not.              Those are the kind of

21   trivialities we talked about in Whren.

22               MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Well, Justice Kennedy,

23   remember, we have one standard for an officer on the

24   street, and that is, look -- do, if you're allowed to

25   arrest, you can arrest, and that's what will determine


                                       42

 1   the constitutionality of the search incident to arrest.

 2   The Government posits two different standards that

 3   govern the officer's conduct:               a Federal one and State

 4   one.

 5                 But let me also get to your point, Justice

 6   Kennedy, that you are worried that are all kinds of

 7   these State laws.     There's -- you know, are you out of

 8   your jurisdiction , are you wearing a uniform?                       What we

 9   think that the common law was concerned with, and this

10   line -- this Court's court line of cases from Di Re to

11   DeFillipo is a more fundamental judgment.                       It's like the

12   judgment whether it's a crime at all.                      The police power

13   of the State is most fundamentally, is this a crime, can

14   we arrest for it, someone for it, so that we will hold

15   them?     And those are the judgments:                    is its arrestable

16   or not?     And not these other little things that --

17                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            But under that analysis,

18   it seems to you we rely on the citizen's expectation of

19   privacy as the justification.               And I think

20   Justice Kennedy makes a rather strong response to that,

21   because it's unrealistic to assume that a citizen in

22   certain counties in Virginia had such an expectation but

23   did not in other counties, because most citizens don't

24   know the sophisticated aspects of the Virginia law.

25                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:          This is a very -- just as a

 1   court note, there's no other State that has one of these

 2   statutes.   Just in terms of your thinking about whether

 3   this is a common practice, we haven't been able to find

 4   any others, and even in Virginia, it's only to a small

 5   body of offenses.    But even taking as a given --

 6   Justice Stevens, I think doctrinally, as Justice Powell

 7   says in Robinson, the notion is that people go out into

 8   the world and engage in conduct, and we expect them to

 9   know the law.   Sometimes that's an unreasonable

10   expectation, but it's the only premise that this Court

11   --

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Counsel, can I get

13   back to your discussion of Cooper?                  In Cooper, you said

14   that if it violates the State law for an inventory

15   search, then you can't search incident to that.                  But

16   that's because it is then not an inventory search.                     Here

17   there's no doubt that this was an arrest, whether it

18   complied with State law or not.

19               MR. GOLDSTEIN:           Chief Justice Roberts, I do

20   disagree.   Post-Cooper, in South Dakota v. Opperman,

21   even if the police officers label it an inventory search

22   -- the person says, oh, we were just trying to keep

23   track of everything, so nobody doubts they were really

24   inventorying things --        the Court has said it's the --

25   the practice is, the State practice is --

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No, but just -- it

 2   gets to -- I mean, if you don't follow the State rules,

 3   it doesn't comply with the rules for an inventory

 4   search.     But here you're saying if don't -- you're not

 5   saying if you don't follow the State rules, it's not an

 6   arrest.     It's not a lawful arrest.                But that's a

 7   different question than whether or not it is an arrest.

 8   Our precedents say if it's an arrest, you can search

 9   incident to the arrest.

10                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Mr. Chief Justice, I

11   disagree.    This Court has said many times, and indeed

12   squarely held in Johnson, where the evidence was

13   suppressed, that it has to be an arrest that is lawful

14   under State law.

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Goldstein, can I bring

16   you back to Cooper v. California?

17                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Yes.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Which you say is a good

19   case for you.    I don't see how you can say that.                  This

20   was a case of a car impounded.                The State court had said

21   that there was no authority to search the car, simply

22   because it was impounded, and we said the question here

23   is not whether the search was authorized by State law;

24   the question is rather whether the search was a

25   reasonable one under the Fourth Amendment.

 1              Just as a search authorized by State law may

 2   be an unreasonable one under that amendment, so may a

 3   search not expressly authorized by State law be

 4   justified as a constitutional reasonable one.           And you

 5   think that helps your case?

 6              MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Not -- I don't think that

 7   language is relevant for the following reason:           What the

 8   Court said in Cooper was that the seizure of the car,

 9   which is analogous to the arrest here, right?           They

10   seized my client's person; they seized the car.           The

11   Court said because the seizure of the car was lawful

12   under State law, then the search incident to was.           And

13   let me just read to you from Coolidge versus --

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Even though the State law

15   did not authorize it.

16              MR. GOLDSTEIN:          The State law did not speak

17   to it either way, but -- it didn't speak to it either

18   way.

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:            They were assume ing, in

20   that passage, that the State law did not authorize it,

21   or otherwise the passage makes no sense.

22              MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Justice Scalia, I disagree.

23   In any event, post-Cooper, South Dakota v. Opperman, as

24   the conversation between the Chief Justice and I was

25   just explaining, is perfectly clear that the inventory


                                      46
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   search has to be authorized pursuant to State

 2   regulation.    If after Cooper this is perfectly settled,

 3   there really isn't --

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel, if we

 5   assume, contrary to your footnote 13, that the

 6   exclusionary rule is implicated in this case, could you

 7   explain why, under the Federal Constitution, there

 8   should be imposed on the State an exclusionary rule for

 9   a violation of State law when State law does not impose

10   an exclusionary rule for the violation of its law?

11                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Assuming the Court decides

12   that the question was not waived because it wasn't

13   briefed, the reason is that this Court's exclusionary

14   rule precedents look to something else, and that is:

15   Did the evidence follow directly from the

16   unconstitutional conduct?            And here it did.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I guess the

18   question would be:      Why doesn't our jurisprudence on

19   whether there's an arrest also look to something else,

20   rather than whether it's permitted or violated under

21   State law?    In other words, the State doesn't -- the

22   State law does not provide for the exclusionary rule,

23   but we say the Fourth Amendment does.

24                 Under -- this is not a valid arrest under

25   State law, but your brothers say under the Fourth

 1   Amendment it is because there's probable cause to

 2   believe a crime has been committed.

 3               MR. GOLDSTEIN:           Mr. Chief Justice, I think

 4   that illustrates the point I am willing to accept, and

 5   that is there are times that State law is relevant under

 6   this Court's doctrines; there are times it isn't.                Welsh

 7   v. Wisconsin, for example, is another example where the

 8   Court looks squarely to the State law of whether and how

 9   serious the offense is.         My point is that there is a

10   very particular doctrine that is in play here that deals

11   with searches incident to arrest.

12               JUSTICE ALITO:           What if Virginia has a

13   statute that said it's unlawful to arrest for a traffic

14   violation, but that it is lawful under Virginia law for

15   an officer to conduct a search incident to any arrest,

16   whether it's lawful under Virginia law or not?                Would we

17   follow that latter Virginia law?

18               MR. GOLDSTEIN:           I don't know.       That is the

19   true answer, because no State has such a law.                It would

20   depend, I think, on whether the arrest itself satisfied

21   constitutional --

22               JUSTICE ALITO:           What is the difference

23   between that law and in effect what Virginia has in

24   place?   They say the arrest is unlawful, but they don't

25   provide for the exclusion of evidence that's obtained as

 1   a result of that arrest under Virginia law.

 2               MR. GOLDSTEIN:          The reason is I think the

 3   one -- that the Court has never looked to the State law

 4   remedies in Di Re, Miller, Johnson, Ker, and DeFillippo,

 5   and that it looks to what the common law would look to,

 6   which is:   Is the arrest legal or not?

 7               I also would repeat what I said to Justice

 8   Breyer, and that is I would not assume that Virginia

 9   believes that the exclusionary rule wouldn't apply

10   because those precedents trigger the Fourth Amendment.

11               But, Justice Breyer, I do want to come back

12   to your question about, okay, Whren.                    The important

13   differences are:   Remember Whren didn't just say that

14   things about whether people can be arrested are

15   trivialities.   It's at the core of the Fourth Amendment.

16   The Court would never say that arrest is a triviality.

17   What it's talking about is what concerned

18   Justice Kennedy, and that is the kind of rule in Whren,

19   which is the guy had to be in a police uniform and

20   driving around in a marked police cruiser, which could

21   vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the Court felt

22   that was more of a triviality.              This is a much more

23   fundamental statement --

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And both arrests are

25   illegal, but you're saying that there's a difference.

 1   So your bright-line rule now seems to evaporate.

 2                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:          Justice Kennedy, I don't --

 3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I mean I'm assuming that

 4   your answer to my question about the badge or the wrong

 5   county and so forth would not result in suppression.

 6   Correct me if I have misinterpreted your argument.

 7                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:          We have proposed two

 8   alternative rules.      Fundamentally, that's right.                  And

 9   that is --

10                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What's right?

11                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:          I'm sorry.          You're right:

12   On our core condition, the evidence would not be

13   suppressed.    The reason is that we think the most

14   fundamental State judgment here is whether this offense

15   is arrestable.    Alternatively, the Court could apply a

16   rule that just says State officers, if they're allowed

17   to arrest lawfully, then that will generate a

18   constitutional search incident to arrest.                    We would win

19   under either either rule.

20                 I think the core of our case is a much

21   simpler rule that simply says if the State has decided

22   this thing is not arrestable, it obviously doesn't have

23   an interest in the arrest that would outweigh the

24   individual's expectation of privacy --                    remember search

25   incident to arrest is an exigency.                   There is no --

 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But then if you -- do you

 2   accept the proposition then, in some of these minor

 3   cases, the arrest might be valid, then you're whole

 4   argument about the Framers and the trespass and so forth

 5   is wrong.

 6                MR. GOLDSTEIN:           To -- that's correct.            If we

 7   are going to follow the common law and the rule that is

 8   articulated, I think, in every single

 9   search-incident-to-arrest case, that it has to be a

10   lawful arrest, that's right.              It will take up all of

11   State arrest law.     I'm not trying to hide from that

12   fact.   But the Court has never had a problem with that.

13   In all of those cases all through time, it has never had

14   any problem with administerability or anything else with

15   a rule that simply says to the police officer:                   If

16   you're allowed to arrest him, arrest him; if you're not,

17   you're not, and you can't search him constitutionally.

18   That is --

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I think your friend

20   agreed that the cases didn't establish whether our

21   references to probable cause meant to probable cause to

22   arrest or probable cause to believe that a crime had

23   been committed.     You don't agree with that?                Do you

24   think that the cases foreclose their position?

25                MR. GOLDSTEIN:           I do when it comes to the

 1   search-incident-to-arrest cases.                I think two things.

 2   This is my understanding of the Court's precedents.                     The

 3   Court has said if you have probable cause, you can

 4   arrest.    In every case that it has said that, it has

 5   been lawful at State law to arrest -- to arrest.                    So the

 6   Court has confronted this question when it comes to the

 7   constitutionality of the arrest vel non.

 8                There is a second line of cases that deals

 9   specifically with this search-incident-to-arrest

10   doctrine, and in every one of those, it has both said it

11   has to be a lawful arrest.           And then in five separate

12   cases, it has explained what it meant by a "lawful

13   arrest."   And it can't be dictum.                The evidence in

14   Johnson versus the United States was suppressed.                    It has

15   to have been the holding of the court.

16                We think that that is a sensible rule for

17   two reasons:   It is what Framers meant.                 It cannot be

18   the case that a Federal marshal, at the time of the

19   framing, could go and just arrest somebody for a

20   completely trivial offense -- that was a trespass -- and

21   then search them.    And, second, Justice Powell's

22   concurrence in Robinson makes a lot of sense.                  But if

23   you engage in constitutional --

24                JUSTICE ALITO:          In Johnson, the search was

25   illegal because they illegally entered the hotel room.

 1   Isn't that right?     So it didn't matter what happened

 2   after that point.

 3                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:         That is not what the Court

 4   said.    The Court was quite clear on this, Justice Alito.

 5   I just don't think there's two ways about it.                     It was

 6   quite on all five of these cases.

 7                 I'm not saying the Court couldn't have

 8   decided the case otherwise.             That's true.          I think the

 9   Court could have had a different rationale, but the

10   point is it didn't.      All of these cases cite each other.

11   It's a uniform line of authority.                 It's not an accident.

12   It's not --

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           The Court simply said

14   we're going to use our Federal supervisory power and

15   incorporate the State law of arrest.                     If we don't have

16   another body of law, we're going to do it.                     It didn't

17   say it was required to by the Constitution.                     That's not

18   the way I read Di Re.

19                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:         Well, then -- I don't know

20   how you pronounce it either, but I do know that Johnson,

21   Ker, and DeFillippo are cases that are against the

22   State.   They are not supervisory authority cases.

23                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Then you have three cases,

24   not five.

25                 MR. GOLDSTEIN:         Well, I disagree.

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:           Putting cases aside for the

 2   moment --

 3               MR. GOLDSTEIN:         Yes.

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:           I mean if we reach this

 5   question, you must have lost on the first question.                 I

 6   mean you win -- if you win on the first question, you

 7   win.

 8               If you -- all right.              If you have lost on

 9   the first question, this is not an unreasonable search

10   -- arrest, rather, under the Fourth Amendment.

11               And, moreover, it's not enough of a big

12   deal, so the State makes it suppressible.                Otherwise, a

13   -- and so now we're talking about minor things under

14   State law that is secondary at the least.

15               And there, when the policeman make a mistake

16   about that, the reason we let him search is he might be

17   hurt, the policeman.     There's danger involved.

18               And so I don't see why at the moment that

19   rationale wouldn't apply just as strongly with a reason

20   for it being unlawful under State but not Federal law is

21   a violation of one of these subsidiary rules whether he,

22   you know, thought the guy was going to keep driving

23   under the suspended license or, you know, might be risky

24   or might not show up.

 1   good faith here which could be raised to a Fourth

 2   Amendment argument in a later case.                      There's absolutely

 3   no mistake.    And we don't want to encourage officers to

12                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. McCULLOUGH

13                          ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

14                 MR. McCULLOUGH:           Thank you.

15                 First, when counsel says that this is some

16   kind of a unique Virginia statute, that's wrong.                     The

17   brief filed by the ABA shows that all but nine States

18   have enacted provisions that are similar, that involve

19   restrictions on their officers' authority, and each of

20   those has exceptions, and so on and so forth.

21                 So it is not a unique situation.                   You have

22   clear rules.    Why would you trade them in for a morass?

23   An arrest is constitutional if the officers have

24   probable cause to believe a crime has been committed.

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Any crime at all?

 1              MR. McCULLOUGH:               I'm sorry?

 2              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Any crime at all;

 3   jaywalking, for example?

 4              MR. McCULLOUGH:               That's -- that's correct.

 5              JUSTICE SOUTER:               We would never know about

 6   it if the -- if the misdemeanor, or jaywalking offense,

 7   was not committed in the officer's presence.

 8              MR. McCULLOUGH:               That's right.     In the case

 9   --

10              JUSTICE SOUTER:               That's not a problem for

11   you here, but that is a limitation on what we have held.

12              MR. McCULLOUGH:               That's correct.     In

13   Atwater, a jaywalking arrest is constitutionally

14   permissible.   Atwater did not reach the in-the-presence

15   question, and it is not presented here because the

16   offense occurred in the officer's presence.                 So --

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Mr. McCullough, what is

18   here, for some reason the Commonwealth did not cite

19   Cooper v. California, which I can't understand unless

20   you agree with your friend that it has been overruled by

21   later cases.

22              MR. McCULLOUGH:               No.     I think -- we relied

23   on Greenwood, and so I --

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:               I understand.     Why didn't

25   you cite Cooper v.      California?

 1               MR. McCULLOUGH:            I don't have an explanation

 2   for that.   We certainly think it strongly -- as the

 3   United States points out in their brief, that it

 4   strongly supports our position.

 5               And as the lower courts have noted when

 6   facing a similar argument, you've already held that when

 7   it comes to a search, that under Greenwood and Cooper,

 8   that State-law considerations aren't going to be what

 9   the constitutional inquiry turns on.

10               Why would you have this incongruity where

11   that's true in Greenwood and Cooper with a search of a

12   residence or an automobile but then you have a different

13   rule when it comes to an arrest?               The States have been

14   handling this problem, but it's an issue of State law.

15               And the State here has never held, going

16   back to 1924, that a violation of State law rises to the

17   level of a constitutional arrest and -- or, excuse me --

18   that -- let me restate that.

19               That a violation of State law warrants the

20   exclusionary rule at the State level.                   So when the

21   legislature enacted this, they contemplated that

22   specific set of remedies.

23               So, at the end of the day, we just ask the

24   Court to adhere to its jurisprudence; that the arrest is

25   constitutional because it is made with probable cause.

 1   There was a violation of state law, but it wasn't a

 2   constitutional problem.

 3                 And so we would ask the Court to reverse the

 4   judgment below.

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. McCullough, there is

 6   one thing that I was curious about.                       It is this Virginia

 7   law that allows the custodial arrest pursuant to an

 8   order of a general district court.

 9                 MR. McCULLOUGH:            Yes.

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             When is that used?

11                 MR. McCULLOUGH:            That is used with some

12   frequency, and we certainly saw an increase in the wake

13   of the Moore decision.         I can't go county by county and

14   city by city, but it has common currency.

15                 And one example is Portsmouth evidently,

16   although it is not clear -- we have gotten conflicting

17   answers.     When Mr. Moore was arrested, there is no such

18   order.     But a few miles down the road the City of

19   Virginia Beach does have such an order.

20                 And this just shows the complexities the

21   Court would be stepping in where, if Mr. Moore is

22   arrested in Portsmouth for the exact same crime on the

23   exact same facts, it is unconstitutional under Moore's

24   rule.

25                 But he goes a few miles down the road to the

 1   City of Virginia Beach, and the arrest is perfectly

 2   constitutional because the district court has entered

 3   such an order.    And it just doesn't make sense, as the

 4   Court noted in Whren, for constitutional provisions to

 5   be so variable.

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              What would be the basis

 7   of a --   can a district court enter such an order just

 8   because it thinks it's a good idea?                      Are there any

 9   grounds in --

10               MR. McCULLOUGH:             The statute -- I see my

11   time has expired.    The statute at issue, 46.2-936, does

12   not really lay out particular criteria.                      So it is -- and

13   the issue hasn't been litigated in the Virginia courts

14   as to the criteria that's required.                      But it seems to be

15   broad discretion by the general district judge.
