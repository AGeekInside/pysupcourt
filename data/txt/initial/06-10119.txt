 6             ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BRIGHT

 7                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8              MR. BRIGHT:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10              The decision here of the majority of the

11   Louisiana Supreme Court on remand from this Court is an

12   extraordinary departure from the lessons that this Court

13   taught in its Miller-El decisions.                   And I point out sort

14   of three overarching errors in that regard.

15              First, the majority looked at each of the

16   Miller-El factors or some of them, and largely

17   discounted them.     That there were five African-Americans

18   struck, they whittled that down to two.                   That there was

19   disparate questioning, they identified that of the white

20   jurors and Jeffrey Brooks, but they said that counted

21   for the State.     And Miller-El clearly teaches that it

22   didn't.

23              They found there was no racial implication

24   in the mention of O.J. Simpson case from the start of

25   the case all the way through, because neither O.J.


                                          3

 1   Simpson's race nor Mr. Snyder's race was mentioned.

 2               Secondly, there were some Miller-El factors

 3   that were not considered at all, not even acknowledged.

 4   For example, one of the most powerful ones, the failure

 5   to ask any questions of Jeffrey Brooks or Elaine Scott.

 6   There are very ambiguous general reasons for striking

 7   them.   They asked no questions.             In this case, you could

 8   ask anybody any questions you wanted as a lawyer.

 9               And then thirdly, when they got to the point

10   of considering them cumulatively, they had now whittled

11   them down to where there was very little to consider.

12               And our position is that what Justice

13   Kimball did, the author of the original decision, who

14   wrote the dissenting opinion, one of the two dissents

15   here, actually did what this Court remanded this case to

16   do, which was reconsideration in light of Miller-El,

17   because when you consider all those factors together,

18   nothing answers the question of or explains them as well

19   as race.

20               You can pick each piece out, each leaf out

21   and you can try to find an innocent explanation for it.

22   But when you stand back and look at it all together --

23   and that's why the court missed the fact that the back

24   strike was racially motivated in this case.

25               It just simply didn't look at these things


                                        4

 1   in the context --

 2               JUSTICE ALITO:           Can I ask you about one of

 3   the factors?

 4               MR. BRIGHT:         Sure.

 5               JUSTICE ALITO:           It's hard to discuss them

 6   all at the same time.       What is the relevance of strikes

 7   of black lawyers that you don't argue were based on

 8   race?   It's hard for me to understand why that's

 9   relevant in this calculation.

10               Suppose there's a case where it's perfectly

11   clear that certain strikes were not racially motivated.

12   Let's say the prosecution has the strategy of striking

13   every lawyer who's on the panel.                It strikes every white

14   lawyer and it strikes every black lawyer.                    Then what is

15   the relevance of the fact that the black lawyers were

16   peremptorily challenged?

17               MR. BRIGHT:         Well, I see.             You mean the

18   jurors happen to be lawyers and they are struck?

19               JUSTICE ALITO:           That's right.

20               MR. BRIGHT:         There's a common reason.                Well,

21   if that's the case and you have considered that in

22   Miller-El, that's a factor for race neutrality.                    The

23   difference here is the reason given for striking Brooks,

24   for example, is he might have a reason to go home --

25               JUSTICE ALITO:           You are making the argument


                                         5

 1   there were five African-American jurors who were the

 2   subject of prosecutorial peremptory challenges.

 3                MR. BRIGHT:       Yes.

 4                JUSTICE ALITO:         And -- but you don't claim

 5   that three of those strikes were based on race?          Do you?

 6                MR. BRIGHT:       Well, no different than

 7   Miller-El.   The Court in Miller-El says you look at the

 8   prima facie case because it is unlikely to happen by

 9   chance.

10                JUSTICE ALITO:         There were a large number of

11   strikes in Miller-El.      This is a much smaller number.

12   Could you just explain, if you can, what is the

13   relevance of strikes that you do not even claim were

14   racially motivated?

15                MR. BRIGHT:       Well, the difference is that as

16   in Miller-El it is unlikely to happen by happenstance.

17   They struck all the blacks they could in this case.

18   There were only five.      They struck every one of them.

19   And the way they went about striking them -- and the

20   context of all this -- it doesn't say that all five of

21   those, that's -- Justice Alito, but that's the classic

22   Batson case where the prima facie case is strong, given

23   the number of people struck, but you zero in on the

24   particular jurors where doing the side by side

25   comparison, the failure to ask any questions, the other

 1   factors that were identified --

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I think that's right

 3   that you zero in on the ones as to which you objected.

 4   But you also want to rely on the fact that these other

 5   jurors were excluded, and no objection was made to their

 6   exclusion.   If an objection had been made, the State, of

 7   course, would have -- could have explained if they had a

 8   reason, a non-racial one, why they were struck.                   But you

 9   didn't object.

10                And yet you want them to be considered as

11   convincing racial bias.

12                MR. BRIGHT:         Well, part of the reason they

13   weren't struck, Mr. Chief Justice, was one of the

14   elements of race here.         The prosecution accepted the

15   first black juror.      So when the second one, Gregory

16   Scott is struck, there's only one out of two.                  There's

17   no the pattern.     Then Mr. Hawkins is struck.               Now it's

18   two out of three.     It is when Miss Elaine Scott was

19   struck.   And now it's three out of four.                 There's still

20   one African-American.

21                At that point defense counsel said there's a

22   pattern, and I strike based on the pattern of striking

23   African-Americans.

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Couldn't counsel at that

25   point have gone back and said, ah, now I see what's


                                          7

 1   going on, so I'm going to challenge -- I'm going to

 2   interpose a Batson challenge with respect to the second

 3   and third African-American?

 4               MR. BRIGHT:        Or actually the first and

 5   second.   You're right.      The second and third.                There was

 6   -- that certainly could have been done.                   I think

 7   basically the defense was snookered here.

 8               But also, there was nothing to prevent the

 9   prosecution from giving reasons.               In fact, Mr. Oland,

10   the junior prosecutor here, he starts to say, I struck

11   Mr. Hawkins, and at that point Williams, the senior

12   prosecutor, said, don't say anything.                   Stop --

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Presumably because

14   no objection was raised as to Mr. Hawkins.                   I mean, it

15   is -- the burden is on you to object if you think jurors

16   are being excluded on a racial basis.

17               MR. BRIGHT:        Well, but the only thing we're

18   putting the pattern forward for is step three of Batson,

19   where both Miller-El decisions make it quite clear that

20   if the numbers are such that it is unlikely to happen by

21   happenstance, that's one element.                It is not that all

22   five necessarily were struck on the basis of race.                    But

23   it is the fact that that unlikely event, that five out

24   of five were struck, informs that decision in Batson

25   saying looking at all relevant facts, it doesn't

 1   exclude -- I've seen Batson challenges where a lawyer

 2   will say, well, with regards to five and six, then we

 3   think those are particularly strong, not with regards to

 4   others -- Miller-El did that.

 5                 They only challenged seven on direct appeal,

 6   only challenged six on the habeas corpus case that

 7   ultimately made its way to this Court, and this Court

 8   only found with regard to two.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Out of -- out of how

10   many who were struck.

11                 MR. BRIGHT:       Ten.       So they only challenged

12   seven of those on -- on direct appeal, six on habeas

13   corpus, and this Court only found Jurors Fields and

14   Juror Ward.    That's basically -- we're here saying, you

15   struck five out of five, all that he possibly could

16   have, and Juror Brooks -- if you look at all the

17   Miller-El factors with regard to Jeffrey Brooks, just

18   two general reasons that probably applied to everybody

19   there.   He was nervous; I expect every citizen called

20   out of their home or out of their work --

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            The district judge is in a

22   much better position to decide those matters, such as

23   you know, he -- his -- his response was -- was slow on

24   -- one the question of, you know, whether he could

25   consider the death penalty.              I can't tell that from a

 1   cold record, and that's why we -- rely upon the trial

 2   judge.

 3                MR. BRIGHT:       Well, that was with regard to

 4   Ms. Scott.

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Right.

 6                MR. BRIGHT:       Justice Scalia, there -- only

 7   one juror here was ambivalent about the death penalty,

 8   said she wasn't sure.      She's cross-examined for four or

 9   five pages of transcript.          23 -- 21, I'm sorry -- jurors

10   are asked if they are opposed to the death penalty and

11   answer the question yes.         21.      Every single one is asked

12   at least two and some were asked more questions.                   The

13   only person not asked any questions was Elaine Scott.

14   She first says, could you impose the death penalty?                      "I

15   think I could."   Then she says later, "I could."                  If you

16   look at the three jurors right before her, Mr. Boyd, "I

17   could consider it," Ms. Sara Coney, "I could consider

18   it," Mr. Salita, "I could consider it," Miss Scott, "I

19   could."

20                They all give the same answer.                  Two of those

21   people, Justice Scalia, end up on the jury in this case.

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, I'm looking at

23   -- at the joint appendix on page 360.                   As I read it,

24   Miss Scott gives an answer that can't be heard, right?

25                MR. BRIGHT:       Right.        The first time.

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Ms. Dupont says,

 2   "I'm sorry, I can't hear you."              I mean, we don't know;

 3   since we weren't there if it was kind of, you know, "I

 4   think I could" and then "I think" -- I mean, you know,

 5   it's an atmospheric determination by the -- the district

 6   court judge; and as -- as has been pointed out here, all

 7   we have is the cold transcript.

 8               MR. BRIGHT:        Well, then, just a couple of

 9   pages later, Mr. Chief Justice, she says I could.                    She

10   gives the same answer that the --

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 That's on joint

12   appendix 401?

13               MR. BRIGHT:        Yes.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And -- and the

15   problem with that, of course, is it's --

16               MR. BRIGHT:        I'm sorry.               367.

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 367.

18               MR. BRIGHT:        She says "I think I could" at

19   361.   And then just a few pages later they go each

20   juror, and she says "I could."

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, but -- the

22   question is not could you consider the death penalty.

23   It says could you consider both, when they're going

24   through several of the juries.              Jurors.

25               MR. BRIGHT:        Well --

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And I thought that

 2   was -- the point was made by your friend on the other

 3   side, was that it was ambiguous as to what option she

 4   was saying she could consider.

 5                 MR. BRIGHT:        Well, I'd invite the Court to

 6   look at that.    Because what that starts out with is a

 7   question about life.        Could you consider life

 8   imprisonment.    And then when Ms. Goff is answered, she

 9   says the death penalty, could I consider it?                   Yes, I

10   could consider it.      And then everybody says they could

11   consider it.

12                 Now, the Louisiana Supreme Court treated

13   this as her saying I could consider the death penalty.

14   That's what they said.         But here's the other point with

15   Miss Scott.    It only took one question:                 Ms. Scott, what

16   did you mean when you said I think you could?

17                 I mean that was in Miller-El -- in the

18   opinion in Miller-El II, the fact that Fields wasn't

19   asked any questions about the position on the death

20   penalty.   He had expressed some; but if the

21   prosecutor --

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, these are peremptory

23   challenges.    It seems to me if you have one -- one juror

24   who says I think I could and another one who said I

25   could, I'm going to strike the one who said I think I

 1   could.

 2                MR. BRIGHT:        But Justice Scalia, there's no

 3   reason you wouldn't ask them what they meant.                      And

 4   that's what the prosecutors did with all the white

 5   jurors here -- every single one.                It's only Ms. Scott,

 6   Elaine Scott that there's no questions asked about the

 7   reasons they gave for striking her.                      So they had the

 8   opportunity to ask her what she meant and they asked all

 9   21 of the white jurors.         They asked the --

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Did all 21 say I think I

11   could?

12                MR. BRIGHT:        No.      All 21 said no.           And then

13   the prosecution asked them follow-up questions about

14   what their beliefs were.          So in those situations, the

15   prosecutor is asking questions to be sure to clarify

16   their position on the death penalty.                     Miss Calligan is

17   the only one who says well, I'm not sure.                      So they asked

18   Ms. Calligan a number of questions.                      How long have you

19   thought about it?    What do you think?                   All those sorts

20   of things.   Ultimately it is pretty clear Ms. Calligan

21   is opposed to the death penalty.

22                JUSTICE ALITO:           Mr. Bright, you make good

23   arguments about comparisons between white jurors and

24   black jurors.

25                MR. BRIGHT:        Yes.

 1               JUSTICE ALITO:          What do we do with the

 2   comparisons that you are making now to white jurors who

 3   were never brought to the attention of the Louisiana

 4   Supreme Court?

 5               MR. BRIGHT:        Well, I think Miller-El, again,

 6   answers that, because the entire voir dire was before

 7   the Louisiana Supreme Court.            On remand from this Court

 8   arguments were made about the -- the disparate

 9   questioning of jurors; and also with Jeffrey Brooks,

10   where that's also very clear because the reason given

11   for striking Jeffrey Brooks is that he would have a

12   reason to want to go home early.

13               My experience is most jurors taken out of

14   their homes and out of their work, would like to finish

15   their job and go home early.

16               JUSTICE ALITO:          I think you have a good

17   argument in comparing him to some of the white jurors,

18   in particular Mr. Laws.

19               MR. BRIGHT:        Right.

20               JUSTICE ALITO:          But my understanding is you

21   never relied on Mr. Laws before the Louisiana Supreme

22   Court.   Is that correct?

23               MR. BRIGHT:        Not Mr. Laws specifically, but

24   you can look at the other people that are mentioned in

25   Justice Kimball's dissent.          Mr. Yeager had something


                                       14

 1   coming out on Sunday; he wanted to get home for that.

 2   Brandon Burns --

 3                JUSTICE ALITO:         But the arguments as to each

 4   of them are different.       The argument as to Mr. Yeager, I

 5   think is much weaker.      He had one event on a Sunday and

 6   he was told you don't have to worry about that, this

 7   case is going to be over by Sunday.

 8                MR. BRIGHT:       Well --

 9                JUSTICE ALITO:         So that's quite different

10   from somebody -- it could be quite different from

11   someone like Mr. Brooks or Mr. Laws.                    Isn't that?

12                MR. BRIGHT:       Actually the reason they say

13   they're concerned about Mr. Brooks is because he was

14   told, your dean says it won't be a problem.                    And he says

15   okay.   No further expression of worry by him.

16                There is, by the other jurors, that were

17   accepted -- they all say on the record I need to get

18   back to my job, to my family.             Mr. Burns -- a single

19   parent, teenagers, 89-year-old grandparents that he

20   wants to get back to.      All of those people accepted by

21   the State.   And Justice Kimball deals with some of those

22   in her dissenting opinions, and they're briefed up to

23   the Louisiana Supreme Court on remand from this case.

24                But I believe Miller-El III -- or II --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't understand how the

 1   dean could resolve his problem.

 2                 MR. BRIGHT:        Well, he's the dean.

 3                 (Laughter.)

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            The man's problem, what

 5   he's worried about is that he has to put in a certain

 6   number of hours of teaching.              And what was it?         A couple

 7   of months before the end of the term?                     It was going to

 8   be very --

 9                 MR. BRIGHT:        No, this was in August.             This

10   was right before the Labor Day weekend in August.                    The

11   term went all the way to December, Justice Scalia.                       And

12   he, at this point -- Brooks -- was just observing

13   someone else teach.       I mean, he wasn't teaching himself.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Whatever.        He had to be

15   there to observe.     He had to put in a certain number of

16   hours.     How could the dean say oh, don't worry, it's no

17   problem?

18                 MR. BRIGHT:        Well --

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            The hours requirement is a

20   requirement for the degree.              I don't think deans have

21   the ability to -- to waive degree requirements.

22                 MR. BRIGHT:        Well, with all due respect,

23   Your Honor --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Maybe the dean was just

25   saying oh, he'll be able to do it, and --

 1                MR. BRIGHT:        Well --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- that wouldn't inspire a

 3   great deal of confidence in me, even if I said okay.

 4                MR. BRIGHT:        Well, again, it would have only

 5   taken one question.      One question -- Mr. Books, now that

 6   you've heard that your dean said it won't be a problem,

 7   do you have further concerns about wanting to get home

 8   quickly?    Mr. Brooks --

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:            My reaction would be --

10   would depend on how he said okay.                 And if I were sitting

11   there as the trial judge, I -- I could discern whether

12   okay meant well, you know, that's what he says but I'm

13   still going to have a hard time digging out those hours

14   for the remaining time that I have in the term.                 I don't

15   know how he said okay.

16                MR. BRIGHT:        If --

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 If --

18                MR. BRIGHT:        If I could answer that

19   question, Mr. Chief Justice.

20                If you're the lawyer standing there beside

21   him and he says what you just said, then you ask him one

22   question.   But there's a professor, Sanders; he's not

23   watching class; he's teaching class at the start of a

24   semester at the University of New Orleans; and he

25   doesn't -- it is no speculation.                With Brooks it's all

 1   speculation.   With Sanders --

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 With Brooks, what he

 3   said when he said I'm missing right now something that

 4   will better me towards my teaching career, and they

 5   say -- and the judge says, is there anybody who could

 6   speak to it?   And he says, I've already talked to the

 7   dean.   And so based on the initial conversation with the

 8   dean he was still worried.

 9               MR. BRIGHT:        Well --

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Then the judge calls

11   the dean, and of course the dean's going to --

12               MR. BRIGHT:        No problem.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, that's what

14   he's going to say to the judge.              When Brooks talked to

15   him, apparently there was a problem because his concern

16   remained after having talked to the dean.

17               MR. BRIGHT:        Brooks doesn't say there's a

18   problem.   He gives the --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 He says I'm missing

20   right now --

21               MR. BRIGHT:        Something that --

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Something that could

23   help me out towards my teaching career.

24               MR. BRIGHT:        Sure.        Every -- the judge had

25   given this hardship question; we're going to sequester

 1   the jury, you're not going to be allowed to communicate

 2   with anybody.   You're going to have to stay out at the

 3   Travelodge while this case is going on.                 Of course, he

 4   doesn't say at that point how long it's going to be.

 5   And 44 people come forward.            But all -- with most of

 6   those people, like with Brandon Burns, who has got to

 7   get back to his landscaping business, Mr. Laws who's has

 8   to get back two homes he's building; his wife is

 9   recovering from surgery and taking his children to

10   school every day -- all those people are assured this

11   case is going to be over by Saturday; it's not going to

12   go very long.   This argument that they were worried that

13   the jury might be out for a long time.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I don't understand

15   your answer that Mr. Brooks did not say there was a

16   problem.   He says, I've already missed half a day.

17   There's something I'm missing right now that will better

18   me towards my teaching career.              He says I've already

19   talked to the dean.

20               How can you say he isn't identifying a

21   problem?

22               MR. BRIGHT:        Well, he -- he's saying, again,

23   not knowing how long this is going to last, or what's

24   going to be expected of him -- right now I'm missing

25   something to help my education.                Everybody is missing

 1   something that's going to help them in their job, with

 2   their families, or whatever.

 3              But once the judge calls him back up to the

 4   bench and says, we've talked to the dean.                 He said it is

 5   not going to be a problem for you to be here, most

 6   students I know -- and I know a lot of you have had

 7   experience with students -- once they're assured by the

 8   dean that it's not going to be a problem, it's not going

 9   to be a problem.

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Even if the assurance is

11   only secondhand, right?

12              MR. BRIGHT:           Well, I think when the judge --

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:               When the dean says it's

14   okay, that's all right.

15              MR. BRIGHT:           The judge of the court, the

16   presiding judicial officer there, says we've talked to

17   your dean, and it's not going to be a problem for you to

18   be here this week.      And everybody is told this week

19   we're going to try this case.               This is a Labor Day

20   weekend coming up.      We know you will send the jury out

21   on Friday afternoon.        You're not going to wait too long

22   for that verdict probably.            And everybody is told --

23   you're going to be out of here by Saturday.                Mr. Yeager,

24   you're going to be out of here by Sunday.

25              So we're talking really about Mr. Brooks

 1   missing three more days.           This is on Tuesday.            This case

 2   is over on Friday.

 3                And everybody knew it was going to be over

 4   on Friday, because they told jurors over and over and

 5   over again that it was going to be over by Friday, so --

 6   or Saturday at the latest.

 7                So I -- I would say, again, no questions

 8   asked.   The lawyers had an opportunity right there when

 9   they told him the dean says it's not a problem.                     Then

10   later he's called in panel 1.               You can ask -- you see

11   this voir dire.   It is very interesting.                    It is very

12   short, but the lawyers could ask individual questions to

13   any juror out there on the panel.                             Mr. Brooks,

14   do you have any concern that you won't be able to

15   concentrate because you need to get back to school?

16                They asked that question over and over, as

17   we pointed out in our brief, of white jurors.                     In fact,

18   the Louisiana Supreme Court, in what I think is one of

19   its great legal errors --

20                JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, suppose you are trying

21   this case.   You are a defense attorney, and you ask a

22   juror, a potential juror:            Would you hold it against a

23   defendant who doesn't take the stand?                     And the initial

24   answer is:   I have to think about that.                    I'm not quite

25   sure.

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               Now -- and then you go on, and you ask a lot

 2   of questions, and the juror comes around to saying:               I

 3   understand that's a person's constitutional right.               They

 4   get the -- advice from a lawyer.               It doesn't necessarily

 5   mean the person has something to hide, et cetera, et

 6   cetera.

 7               Does that additional questioning allay the

 8   concern that you would have had at the beginning about

 9   the fairness, the potential fairness, of the juror?

10               MR. BRIGHT:        Well, I think you have to look

11   not only at those answers but -- but what the court in

12   Miller-El II said were the side-by-side comparisons.

13               If you're asking the white jurors follow-up

14   questions to determine that, then that, I think, cuts

15   very much against the prosecution and supports an

16   inference of racial discrimination.

17               If you basically asked everybody about the

18   same thing, you can't draw that inference.

19               But the Louisiana Supreme Court said here

20   there was consistent questioning of the jurors about

21   whether whatever their other obligations were, it would

22   interfere with their ability to sit as jurors.              There is

23   consistent questioning of everybody except Jeffrey

24   Brooks.   And that's the one African-American who the

25   court -- who the prosecutors then say they're striking


                                       22

 1   for that reason.

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Bright, the Judge was

 3   quite passive, and was -- was the judge, in fact,

 4   present throughout the entire voir dire?

 5                MR. BRIGHT:       I -- I think the judge was

 6   present, but he was quite passive.                 One of the more

 7   remarkable aspects of this jury selection is when he

 8   grants a defense strike for cause, the prosecutor,

 9   Mr. Williams, says -- are you crazy?

10                And the judge says:             No.        And they go right

11   on to the next fact.

12                You know, I -- I practiced law for 30 years.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:           It sounds like the right

14   answer to me.

15                (Laughter.)

16                MR. BRIGHT:       It wasn't the right question.

17   I've often wondered about that, but I've never

18   articulated it.

19                (Laughter.)

20                MR. BRIGHT:       And I think most lawyers

21   wouldn't.

22                There's another point where Williams tells

23   the judge:   Swear all these people to say they've got a

24   valid reason for leaving, and send them all out of here

25   -- swearing people to say something that may be true or


                                       23

 1   may not be true.

 2                And the judge says:             Well, do I do it

 3   individually, or do I do it in a group?

 4                He says:     Do it in a group.              Just have them

 5   all swear that they've got a legal reason, a hardship

 6   reason, to be excused.

 7                And the judge goes right along with it.

 8                I think what we see with the judge in every

 9   ruling here is four or five words:                 I'm going to allow

10   it.   I'm going to allow it.

11                The judge is not engaged in questioning.

12   Unlike Uttecht v. Brown that Justice Kennedy wrote about

13   last term where you have a judge involved and hearing

14   the lawyers and whatever, that's not present here.

15                So I think that when you look at that

16   factor, you don't have assurance that this judge was

17   involved in a way to make sure that the credibility

18   determinations which were being made -- and the other

19   point I would make is here he's ruling on the Batson

20   strikes as the jury is being selected.                  So he doesn't

21   have all of the information.

22                Now, he does rule again on the motion for a

23   new trial.   That's the only time that all of the

24   information, all of the relevant information, is before

25   the judge.   But, there again, all he says is I think the


                                       24

 1   prosecutor's reasons were race-neutral.

 2              There is no indication that he went beyond

 3   that to consider what Batson said and what Miller-El

 4   says we have to consider, which is all the relevant

 5   factors.

 6              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Bright, may I ask, in

 7   your judgment, was all the reference to O. J. Simpson

 8   relevant at all to what is before us?

 9              MR. BRIGHT:        I think it is, Justice Stevens,

10   and I think, even if you don't look at the closing

11   argument, which tells you two important things -- first

12   of all, the prosecutor broke his promise to the judge

13   that he wouldn't mention it.           He said as an officer of

14   the court, I will not mention it.

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:            What does that have to do

16   with anything?

17              MR. BRIGHT:        It has to do with --

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:            So he broke his promise.    I

19   mean sue him or something, but I don't see how it has

20   anything to do with whether a fair jury was -- was --

21              MR. BRIGHT:        It has to do with his

22   credibility, which is very much what Batson is about.

23   But -- but to the O. J. Simpson case, I think the

24   prosecutor's obsession with O. J. Simpson -- a month

25   before he mentions it in a pretrial hearing.

 1               The defense moves to ask to quit referring

 2   to the O. J. Simpson case in the media; and, for

 3   goodness sakes, Judge, don't let him refer to it before

 4   the jury.

 5               And the -- the defense makes quite clear:

 6   The polls show that the society is divided.                  This was

 7   ten months ago that Simpson came down.                  It is a very

 8   polarizing case.   The fact that he is mentioning it is

 9   going to inject racial prejudice into this case.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What about the

11   explanation that was given that this was referring to

12   the defendant's feigning emotional distress rather than

13   anything to do with race?

14               MR. BRIGHT:        Well, I think, Chief Justice

15   Roberts, it doesn't have anything to do with that.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What doesn't have

17   anything to do with it?

18               MR. BRIGHT:        The fact of whether or not

19   Mr. Snyder was, in fact, suicidal is not rebutted in any

20   way by bringing in the most racially polarizing case in

21   the country and saying that Simpson was trying to get

22   away with it.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, that's not just

24   racially polarizing.      I mean maybe it is that, but it is

25   also a case in which a man killed his wife with a knife.

 1              MR. BRIGHT:         Yes.

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:             The same as here.

 3              MR. BRIGHT:         Well, there are a lot of

 4   similarities.

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:             And then feigned a mental

 6   illness by his -- his great-escape escapade, and that is

 7   -- that is what the prosecutor said he was trying to

 8   bring before the jury.

 9              MR. BRIGHT:         Well -- and he said Simpson got

10   away with it.   Snyder couldn't have possibly known that,

11   because the verdict in Simpson didn't come down until

12   after Snyder's crime had been committed.

13              So he couldn't have been imitating, if that

14   is what he was arguing -- he couldn't have been

15   imitating O. J. Simpson.         I -- I think what this

16   prosecutor learned from O.J. Simpson, Justice Stevens,

17   is that you don't let blacks on the jury.

18              I mean I think he saw that this racially

19   mixed jury in Los Angeles let him -- quote -- "get away

20   with it," and we're going to have an all-white jury here

21   in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.              And unlike what

22   happened out there, we're not going to let -- of course,

23   this was at the penalty phase.              He could only get life

24   without parole or the death penalty.                    He wasn't going to

25   get away with anything.        But that was the way it was


                                       27
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   pictured to the jury:        That if they didn't give him the

 2   death penalty, he would get away with it.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So the relief you

 4   are requesting goes only to the penalty and not to the

 5   conviction?

 6                 MR. BRIGHT:        No, Chief Justice Roberts.

 7   This was in striking the jury, and there's no prejudice

 8   requirement with race.         Allen Snyder is entitled to a

 9   new trial with a fair jury that represents the

10   community.     So I think that --

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Even though -- even

12   though your theory is that it was only with respect to

13   the penalty that the bias -- you have no allegation --

14                 MR. BRIGHT:        Oh, no.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 -- that this jury

16   did not return a valid conviction.                   I thought your

17   objection was with respect to the death penalty.

18                 MR. BRIGHT:        No.      Let me -- let me make this

19   quite clear.    Our objection is that when the jury was

20   selected, in terms of the disparate questioning,

21   disparate acceptance, failure to ask any questions,

22   racial prejudice infected the selection of the jury.

23   All the O. J. Simpson case does is put a little icing on

24   the cake.    But if you look at the Miller-El factors and

25   you consider them cumulatively, like Justice Kimball did


                                         28

 1   in her dissent, you come away once again with what the

 2   Court said in Miller-El.           The evidence is too powerful.

 3   It all points in one direction, and that's intentional

 4   race discrimination.        And that was in the jury.             And if

 5   that happened, Allen Snyder is entitled to a new trial.

 6                 If I could, I'd reserve the rest of my time.

 7   Thank you.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

 9   Mr. Bright.

11                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF TERRY M. BOUDREAUX

12                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13                 MR. BOUDREAUX:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may

14   it please the Court:

15                 I had some prepared remarks to begin with,

16   but I think I'd like to go straight into responding to

17   some of the concerns that have just been raised.

18                 First of all, concerning Elaine Scott, the

19   lady who said "I think I could."                 I think the record is

20   quite clear that she was being asked about considering

21   life imprisonment.      Beginning at 364 of the joint

22   appendix, the question is asked by the prosecutor four

23   times:   "Could you consider a sentence of life

24   imprisonment?"    "Could you consider the possibility of

25   life imprisonment?"       "Could you consider life


                                         29

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   imprisonment?"    "It is whether you could consider life

 2   imprisonment."    You get to Ms.             Scott, the answer is "I

 3   could."   She's the lady who said originally, "I think I

 4   could."   So the prosecutor's --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           As to life imprisonment or

 6   as to the death penalty?

 7                 MR. BOUDREAUX:         As to life imprisonment,

 8   Your Honor.    As to death, she said "I think I could."

 9   When it got to life imprisonment, the full question

10   asked four times, among various -- going down the list

11   -- is when she said --

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Where is this?      I -- 364?

13   Show me --

14                 MR. BOUDREAUX:         Beginning at 364 of the

15   joint appendix, Your Honor.             I just wanted to point out

16   the question posed is regarding life imprisonment.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Right.

18                 MR. BOUDREAUX:         She was originally asked the

19   question about the death penalty, and her response was

20   the "I think I could."

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Mr. Bright contrasts

22   that with the more probing inquiry with respect to white

23   jurors who said "I think I could," and here there was no

24   follow-up.

25                 MR. BOUDREAUX:         That's true, Your Honor.           In

 1   -- in reviewing this record, there are instances where

 2   -- where there were not a lot of follow-up questions.

 3   We see the situation with Mr. Brooks.                    This jury, unlike

 4   the jury in Miller-El, which took five weeks, this jury

 5   took less than a day and a half to pick.                    So there were

 6   not a lot of probing questions.

 7              JUSTICE ALITO:           The explanation for

 8   Mr. Brooks is not terribly convincing on its face.                      This

 9   is -- was an incredibly short trial, was it not?

10   Mr. Brooks is voir dired on Tuesday.                    And there's a

11   death verdict on Friday.

12              MR. BOUDREAUX:           Yes, sir.

13              JUSTICE ALITO:           And the concern -- the major

14   concern about him is that he's going to worry about

15   missing Wednesday, Thursday, Friday student teaching?

16              MR. BOUDREAUX:           Yes, sir.            But you see --

17              JUSTICE ALITO:           But you compare him to some

18   of the white jurors, particularly, I think, Mr. Laws.

19   Mr. Laws seemed to have a more compelling reason to be

20   worried about not being -- about being in court.                    He was

21   a contractor.   He had houses he had to finish.                   His wife

22   had recently had surgery.          He was taking kids back and

23   forth to the school.

24              MR. BOUDREAUX:           Yes, sir.            Mr. Laws, like

25   Mr. Brooks, I think it's good to point out, approached

 1   the bench of his own volition.                Other -- other

 2   individuals waited until they -- if they were called and

 3   were questioned.     The way the proceedings began, when

 4   the venire were summoned into the courtroom, the judge

 5   introduced the staff, read the statutory requirements

 6   for jury service, and then they started lining up.                       And

 7   one of the people lining up to express his concern, not

 8   just about meeting the requirements to be a juror, was

 9   "I've got class, I've got" -- and I think it's --

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Mr. Laws was an

11   identical -- he came up too.              He said --

12               MR. BOUDREAUX:            He did come up, and I think

13   the distinction there, Your Honor, is that like several

14   of others, unlike Mr. Brooks, in the end he said "I can

15   make arrangements.      I can deal with it."

16               JUSTICE BREYER:              Can I go back to Ms. Scott?

17               MR. BOUDREAUX:            I'm sorry.

18               JUSTICE BREYER:              Could I go back to Ms.

19   Scott?

20               MR. BOUDREAUX:            Ms. Scott?

21               JUSTICE BREYER:              Yes.      If you look at the

22   top of 367 and then you look over at 366, the format, I

23   think, is that the prosecutor is posing a general

24   question.   And then he poses his question -- or she --

25   and goes around and gets an answer.                       Here is Mr. Lindey.

 1   So they start out with the death penalty.                       They have

 2   some ambiguous thing at the bottom of 366.                       Then the

 3   prosecutor says, "Mrs. Alvarez -- Ms. Alvarez, you said

 4   you could not impose the death penalty."                       "Mrs. Goff --

 5   Ms. Goff:     I could consider the death penalty."                    "Ms.

 6   DuPont:     I couldn't hear."          Prosecutor:            You could

 7   consider both?"      "Yes, I would consider it."                   "Ms.

 8   DuBois:     I could consider it.             Yes."         "Ms. Archonie:    I

 9   could consider it."        "Mrs. Alvino:              I could consider

10   it."   "Ms. Scott:     I could.           I could."

11                 Now, that doesn't seem too ambiguous for me

12   -- to me.    It seems that what they're talking about,

13   each of them, is the death penalty because that's what,

14   by the time they got to the top of 367, they were

15   talking about.    Maybe there's ambiguity there.

16                 MR. BOUDREAUX:           I don't --

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:             But I haven't noticed in

18   anybody's opinion, so far, making that point that you

19   just made.

20                 MR. BOUDREAUX:           I would submit that -- that

21   would indicate ambiguity, Your Honor, that the

22   prosecutor starts off with the life imprisonment

23   question, and then it sort of morphed into a death

24   penalty.     But, by the time you get back to Ms. Scott --

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:             No -- well, there's -- I

 1   just read you what it was, so I guess people make up

 2   their own mind about that.           But by -- what I don't think

 3   you can make up your own mind as ambiguous is when this

 4   prosecutor met with an answer that he considered not --

 5   call it strictly kosher, when he found that, like Mrs.

 6   Calligan, she said, "I'm not sure."                      That's more

 7   ambiguous than Mrs. Scott.           And then he goes on, for

 8   three pages of additional questioning, and then 26 pages

 9   later, he doesn't excuse her yet and he doesn't excuse

10   her until she volunteers, "I could give a verdict -- I

11   don't think I could give a verdict to take someone's

12   life."

13                And it's at that point that the prosecutor

14   excuses her.

15                Now, compare that to Ms. Scott, who started

16   out saying "I think I could" and then, as I read it,

17   said "I could."    Now, that's the kind of comparison

18   here.    No follow-up.     At the worst, minor ambiguity.

19                MR. BOUDREAUX:          Yes, Your Honor.            What --

20                JUSTICE BREYER:            And a slight hesitation.

21   Now, what do you say to that?

22                MR. BOUDREAUX:          One of the weaknesses in

23   some these jurors is a lack of follow-up questions.                     But

24   I think we go back to her original comment, which was so

25   softly spoken that the defense attorney said "I can't

 1   hear you."   There's nothing --

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:             And that, of course, is a

 3   problem I have generally in this area.                    We can always

 4   imagine that things that are not in the transcript,

 5   perhaps what she said spokenly not in the transcript is

 6   "I hate the death penalty.            I'll never -- I'll never

 7   apply it under any circumstances."                   And I grant you, if

 8   that's the law, we are never going to find that there's

 9   any prejudice.    But I just don't see how that could be

10   the law.

11                MR. BOUDREAUX:           In the totality of her

12   responses, the ones that were heard which are on the

13   record and the ones which were not heard which are not

14   on the record, the prosecutor felt that she was weak on

15   the death penalty.       And that on its face is a

16   race-neutral reason.

17                JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, of course -- sorry.

18                MR. BOUDREAUX:           Well, I would just say that

19   the -- we're talking here with the prosecutor's

20   perception of the juror based on her answers and the the

21   trial court's perception in evaluating the prosecutor's

22   proper race-neutral reasons.

23                Could someone look at this and say it's to

24   the contrary?    Yes.     But in the -- in the totality of

25   the circumstances and the reviewing for clear error with

 1   the benefit, of course, that the trial court has in

 2   being present, hearing or not hearing what was said, the

 3   tone of voice, the demeanor, the mannerisms, the

 4   deference's --

 5              JUSTICE SOUTER:             There -- there isn't much

 6   reason, is there, to think that the trial court was

 7   being very critical of the prosecutor's answers?            My

 8   recollection is that, after the O. J. Simpson remark had

 9   been made in final argument, that the ultimate

10   resolution of that involved the trial judge saying that

11   one reason that was not a racially significant remark

12   was that the prosecutor had neither -- had mentioned

13   neither the race of the defendant nor the race of O. J.

14   Simpson.

15              Now that is not a critical mind at work, is

16   it?

17              (Laughter.)

18              MR. BOUDREAUX:           I would -- I would suppose

19   not, Your Honor.

20              (Laughter.)

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:             And because --

22              MR. BOUDREAUX:           The objection was --

23              JUSTICE SOUTER:             And because you suppose not

24   and I certainly suppose not, the -- the fact is that we

25   have to -- we have to consider the O. J. Simpson remark


                                       36

 1   in trying to evaluate what went on, in trying to

 2   evaluate, for example, the lack of critical follow-up in

 3   -- in a disparate way by the prosecutor.                And that, in

 4   fact, is a fair and potent argument that the other side

 5   has, isn't it?

 6              MR. BOUDREAUX:           Yes, Your Honor.        I would

 7   like to respond to that by pointing out, though, that

 8   the reference to the O. J. Simpson case was based on the

 9   factual similarities involving the O. J. Simpson case

10   and this case.

11              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Do you believe that, if

12   there had been a white defendant here, the O. J. Simpson

13   case would have been mentioned?

14              MR. BOUDREAUX:           Yes, Your Honor, and I

15   believe if the O.J. Simpson case --

16              JUSTICE SOUTER:             See, I'd be candid -- I

17   will be candid to say to you, under the -- under the

18   circumstances of the record in front of us, I find that

19   highly unlikely.   And because I find that highly

20   unlikely, I put significance in the O. J. Simpson remark

21   which even you concede is significant.

22              MR. BOUDREAUX:           Yes, Your Honor.       But I

23   think the -- the reason it doesn't fatally infect the

24   proceedings with racism is -- I think the comment would

25   have been made had O. J.         Simpson not been white -- I

 1   think perhaps the comment would have been made had it

 2   not been O. J. Simpson but some other high-profile white

 3   athlete celebrity; and I think it is appropriate,

 4   putting aside for the moment the assurance to the court

 5   that he wouldn't mention it -- but it was in response to

 6   the defense counsel's argument.              This defendant was

 7   tried on a plea of not by season of insanity.                 The

 8   murders are committed; several hours later he's

 9   barricaded in his house, calls the police claiming to be

10   suicidal; the police respond.

11               He gets up, unbarricades the door, lets the

12   police in; then goes back into his fetal position.                  To

13   rebut the -- this perhaps he's thinking, and I think it

14   is significant in Defense Exhibit 2 at trial, what --

15   the defendant's statement taken several hours later,

16   he's oriented; he's aware of the situation; he knew he

17   had done something wrong, was in -- and was in trouble.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Mr. Boudreaux, even

19   if -- even if you're correct that a neutral explanation

20   was given focusing on the emotional distress, are you --

21   do you think the prosecutor would have made the analogy

22   if there had been a black juror on the jury?

23               MR. BOUDREAUX:          I think he would have, Your

24   Honor.   I know the contention is that he didn't, but I

25   think the facts are clear on this record that it was not


                                       38

 1   an appeal to race, but it was an appeal to what was a

 2   historical fact, common knowledge among most people in

 3   the country, and the facts of this case.                  The

 4   defendant's statement as I said would betray no mental

 5   lack of wherewithal.      When the search warrant was

 6   executed his bloody shirt was found in the attic of his

 7   house.   That's at page 1311 of the record.                 It is not in

 8   the -- it's not in the joint appendix.                  But when the

 9   defense attorney brings up the police coming to the

10   house and -- and he agreed that the police officer's

11   testimony was correct, he's in a fetal position; he's

12   saying they're coming to get me, I'm suicidal, the

13   defense attorney is bringing up the mental aspects of

14   this case.   So I think it was appropriate for the

15   prosecutor to look at the record and -- and to rebut

16   that.

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Before -- before the

18   rebuttal, this prosecutor was going around advertising

19   this as his O. J. Simpson case, and the defense attorney

20   said please, Judge, get him to stop saying that.                 This

21   is long before -- you are painting a picture of someone

22   who was answering an argument made by the defense, but

23   this prosecutor initiated it, and the defense attorney

24   was reacting.   She said judge, he's talking in this

25   county, that county about this is his O. J. Case; stop

 1   him from doing that.

 2              MR. BOUDREAUX:             That's correct, Your Honor.

 3              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Then he says I'm an

 4   officer of the court, and I'm giving you my word.

 5              MR. BOUDREAUX:             That's correct; and then he

 6   believes -- despite his assurances, when the defense

 7   attorneys made the argument they made, they were

 8   inviting that -- that response.

 9              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Well, do you -- do you

10   believe that it would have been appropriate at that

11   point for the prosecutor to invoke in his argument any

12   case from any state in which a criminal defendant had

13   unsuccessfully feigned insanity as a reason to decide --

14   for the jurors to decide that this defendant is -- is

15   feigning insanity?

16              MR. BOUDREAUX:             I think any historical fact

17   well known to people would have been fair game.                         Just as

18   an analogy, remember this situation.                      The jury is

19   instructed, argument of counsel is not evidence; take it

20   for what you think it's worth.                This was the historical

21   reference this prosecutor used:                The facts are similar.

22              Contrast that with the -- or -- kind of,

23   almost similar to that when we're talking about racism

24   being part of these proceedings, one of the amicus

25   briefs refers to David Duke.              If Your Honor is not

 1   aware, in New Orleans, Louisiana, for a number of years

 2   David Duke is high profile Ku Klux Klan.                     In some of the

 3   voir dire in this case, at page 221, 222 of the joint

 4   appendix, it is defense counsel who brings up David

 5   Duke.

 6               Now you understand if David Duke was on

 7   trial here today and we had a photo album of him in his

 8   robes, he would still be entitled to a fair trial.                       So

 9   she's using --

10               JUSTICE BREYER:              Exactly.         He's entitled to

11   a fair trial without prejudice.

12               MR. BOUDREAUX:            Right.

13               JUSTICE BREYER:              So I think you have two

14   instances here.   One is Mrs. Scott, and the other is Mr.

15   Brooks.   And with regard to Mr. Brooks, what I've read

16   in the transcript is that he was nervous and unhappy,

17   because he's learning to be a teacher, and he's afraid

18   he's going to miss some student teaching time which will

19   count against him.

20               MR. BRIGHT:          Yes, sir.

21               JUSTICE BREYER:              What it says is the clerk

22   called the dean and the dean said it he won't, don't

23   worry about it, which Mr. Brook is then told.                     He's

24   challenged for that reason.              He might still worry about

25   it.   But Mr. Laws is not.           And Mr. Laws is a

 1   self-employed contractor who announced to the court, I

 2   have a big problem this weekend; two houses are near

 3   completion, the owners are supposed to be moving in; my

 4   wife has just had a hysterectomy, she's supposed to be

 5   taking care of the children back home, and I -- she has

 6   nobody to help.

 7              Okay?     He's not challenged.

 8              So we're not worried about Mr. Laws worried

 9   about his wife and his business which going down -- you

10   know, serious.    But we are worried about Mr. Brooks, who

11   has been told by the dean you have no problem.                   Now,

12   that's a little bit of a problem to me.

13              MR. BOUDREAUX:            Yes, Your Honor.

14              JUSTICE BREYER:              If you add them up, we have

15   Ms. Scott we have Mr. Brooks, we have the mention of --

16   and three others -- three others, the only other three

17   black people are challenged off, and we have the -- no

18   black juror us on and we have the references to O. J.

19   Simpson beside.

22              MR. BOUDREAUX:            Your characterizations are

23   -- are correct, Your Honor.             I won't dispute the factual

24   allegations, but the key thing to point out there is

25   Mr. Laws said he could make arrangements.                It is

 1   difficult; it's -- the jury duty happens.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What's the difference

 3   between that and "okay"?

 4                 MR. BOUDREAUX:         I'm sorry?

 5                 (Laughter.)

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            One says I can make

 7   arrangements, and the other is more economical and he

 8   says "okay."

 9                 MR. BOUDREAUX:         But that -- he said -- I

10   think that's the landscape man, he said, as long as it

11   wasn't a prolonged -- as.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           No, she means the dean.

13   The dean --

14                 MR. BOUDREAUX:         Oh, the dean --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           -- said no problem at all.

16   What better arrangement can you want?

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- meaning Brooks.

18                 MR. BOUDREAUX:         Brooks says --

19                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Brooks says okay.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The difference is between

21   "I can make arrangements" and "okay."

22                 MR. BOUDREAUX:         The difference -- difference

23   there, Your Honor, is that Mr. Brooks needs to make

24   these classroom -- undergraduate requirements to

25   graduate.   There's a day that's going to come when he's


                                        43
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   either made his requirements to graduate, or he has not.

 2   The people with the jobs, the contractors, their jobs

 3   are there when they got -- when they got out of court,

 4   when trial was over.      If Mr. Brooks didn't meet his

 5   requirements, he was not going to graduate.                And I would

 6   be a little careful to take it as face value from the

 7   judge's law clerk calling the dean who then -- she comes

 8   back and says it is a 300-hour observation.                That's

 9   obviously wrong.

10              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, I wouldn't take it at

11   face value if there had been a further question asked of

12   Mr. Brooks saying, are you really satisfied you have

13   nothing to worry about?        And he says well, gee, boy, I

14   sure hope I -- I'm able to make that requirement.                But

15   nobody asked that question.

16              MR. BOUDREAUX:           Nobody asked that question.

17              JUSTICE SOUTER:             All we have is got is

18   "okay" on the one hand and "I can make arrangements" on

19   other.

20              MR. BOUDREAUX:           We also have, Your Honor, as

21   far as the question of Mr. Brooks is concerned, a fact

22   that is not articulated by the prosecutor but which

23   would be supported by the record.                He's an education

24   teacher; he's young; prosecutors in a death penalty case

25   I think would shy away from asking or leaving on a jury

 1   a young person.   A teacher, maybe perhaps more

 2   sympathetic, maybe more understanding -- nothing wrong

 3   with that, but maybe that's not who a prosecutors

 4   seeking a death penalty --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, we -- we have to

 6   go -- your -- this is enough of a fact-specific inquiry

 7   for any appellate court, even when we go into the

 8   allegations that the prosecution did make.

 9               Now you're saying we also have to imagine

10   other reasons, which he didn't state were the reasons

11   why he struck, but which might have been.               You really

12   think that that's enough to --

13               MR. BOUDREAUX:          That's the problem with this

14   record.   The State says --

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:            It is not the problem with

16   it.   It is your problem with the record.

17               (Laughter.)

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:            It is not mine.

19               MR. BOUDREAUX:          The plausibility of the

20   prosecutor's reasons stand or fall on what he says.                  The

21   other things perhaps the court will say he didn't say

22   that; we're not going to consider them.

23               But talking about a fact -- factual specific

24   inquiry before an appellate court, that brings us back

25   to the -- to the discretion afforded the -- not the

 1   discretion, Your Honor, the deference afforded the trial

 2   court who is present for the proceedings, who is there,

 3   passive or otherwise.      He's there.             He sees what's going

 4   on, the demeanor --

 5               JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask you about Juror

 6   Hawkins.   You haven't talked much about him.

 7               MR. BOUDREAUX:          Hawkins?

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Why did they strike him?

 9   He seemed to me to be a pretty good juror for the

10   prosecution.

11               MR. BOUDREAUX:          Your Honor, that's a

12   question I've asked myself; and I can't -- I'm not --

13   you would think on the surface of it he would have been

14   a good juror for the State.            What I think is equally

15   clear is that the defense would -- objected to his being

16   excused but didn't make a Batson claim because I don't

17   think they wanted to go there.              They would not have

18   wanted that juror on their jury.               He said he had --

19               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Wasn't he struck before

20   they back-struck the first black on the jury?

21               MR. BOUDREAUX:          I believe so, Your Honor.

22               JUSTICE STEVENS:            So that probably explains

23   why they didn't make a Batson objection.

24               MR. BOUDREAUX:          Yes, you're correct about

25   that.   But I think he would have not -- the jurors --

 1   the defense perhaps would have struck him.                    He testified

 2   that he had plenty friends who were police officers in

 3   this jurisdiction.

 4               JUSTICE STEVENS:              I understand why the

 5   defense would have struck him.                I'm trying to understand

 6   why the prosecutor --

 7               MR. BOUDREAUX:            Well, we don't know that,

 8   Your Honor, because there was no Batson objection

 9   raised, and the prosecutor was not called upon to

10   articulate any reasons.

11               On the face of it, he looks like he could be

12   a good juror.    But that's a factual matter that the

13   trial prosecutor, then and there, made that decision.

14   And I think --

15               JUSTICE SOUTER:              He knew nothing about that

16   juror except what Justice Stevens and you have just been

17   reciting.   If that's all you knew and you were a

18   prosecutor, would you have struck him?                    Would you have

19   said:   I don't want -- I don't want anybody on this jury

20   who's got friends in the police department?                    Would you

21   have struck him for that reason?

22               MR. BOUDREAUX:            Well, I can say, Your Honor,

23   that's not the first time that's happened over years in

24   different -- different trials that I've reviewed.

25               JUSTICE SOUTER:              How about you?

 1                MR. BOUDREAUX:           I'm sorry?

 2                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Would you -- would you have

 3   gotten rid of him?      Would you have said:                  I don't want

 4   any cop lovers on my jury?

 5                (Laughter.)

 6                 MR. BOUDREAUX:             No, Your Honor.          I would --

 7   I would --

 8                JUSTICE SOUTER:             No, you wouldn't have, and

 9   neither would I.

10                MR. BOUDREAUX:           No, sir.            And that's the

11   difficulty that --

12                JUSTICE ALITO:           We have no idea -- we have

13   no idea what this man looked like.                   We have no idea

14   about his demeanor, his tone of voice.                      This could have

15   been -- there could have been very legitimate reasons

16   for doing it.   There could be no legitimate reasons for

17   doing it.

18                MR. BOUDREAUX:           Right.

19                JUSTICE ALITO:           But nobody asked what reason

20   for doing it was.

21                MR. BOUDREAUX:           And no reasons were offered.

22                JUSTICE BREYER:             I don't know the answer to

23   this at all but how this is supposed to work?                      A defense

24   attorneys -- the jury selection, and he sees that the

25   prosecutor doesn't challenge for peremptory or any other

 1   reason one black member.          Let's call it five.

 2               And then they start challenging black

 3   members.   Obviously, he didn't at the beginning impose

 4   any Batson claim.     He had no Batson claim.               There were

 5   five people on the jury who were black.                  What claim

 6   could you make?

 7               And then after you begin to get suspicious

 8   and start to make them, now they do this thing called

 9   black strike and they get everybody off the jury.

10               How is it supposed to work?

11               MR. BOUDREAUX:           I would disagree they would

12   not have a Batson claim to make when the first black is

13   struck if they felt there was evidence of that one --

14               JUSTICE BREYER:             They don't know.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:             The rule is not that you

16   can't -- so long as you have some black on the jury, you

17   can strike the rest.

18               MR. BOUDREAUX:           No, sir.

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Any single person.

20               MR. BOUDREAUX:           That's correct.

21               JUSTICE BREYER:             I'm speaking reality.

22               MR. BOUDREAUX:           That's why you don't have to

23   wait for a pattern.      Let's say you have an all black

24   jury.

 1   curious to the answer to Justice Breyer's question.

 2   When they go back and back strike at that point can the

 3   defendant say I don't think you can back strike this

 4   juror you're doing it on the basis of race.

 5              MR. BOUDREAUX:             They can go back and back

 6   strike, but the defendant could say --

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    They can go back and

 8   back strike.

 9              MR. BOUDREAUX:             Yes, sir.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    They can go back and

11   object to the back striking?              The State would say, well

12   here's the reasons we're back striking.

13              MR. BOUDREAUX:             The back strike is when is

14   the challenge exercised.           In and of itself you can't say

15   if it is racial or not.          It is a challenge.

16              JUSTICE BREYER:               That was my question.

17              JUSTICE STEVENS:               My problem -- after the

18   back strike of the first black juror who had been

19   accepted, can they thereafter renew an objection if the

20   jurors two and three, who are accepted on the assumption

21   that there would no --

22              MR. BOUDREAUX:             I think under Miller-El and

23   related decisions that would be part of the totality of

24   the circumstances.      The practical problem --

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                That wasn't done here.

 1   That was the point that you made.

 2               MR. BOUDREAUX:          Yes.

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             When the third -- the

 4   back strike of Brooks was made, they could have gone

 5   back for Hawkins and the others, but they didn't.

 6               MR. BOUDREAUX:          That could have been argued

 7   evidence for them to make their prima facie case.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I'm sorry.

 9               There's some ambiguity in your answer.

10   Miller-El says others who were struck can be considered

11   as part of the totality.         My question is -- can they go

12   back and object not only to the back struck juror, but

13   as Justice Stevens points out, to the others who weren't

14   objected to perhaps because there wasn't a black person

15   on the jury?

16               MR. BOUDREAUX:          To give you a yes or no

17   answer, yes.   The practical problem with that is those

18   two jurors having previously been excused, could be on

19   the way to their office or back to their home.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Still, the

21   prosecutor is still there.          You can ask the prosecutor,

22   why did you strike that juror?

23               MR. BOUDREAUX:          Yes, you could.         Yes, you

24   could.   Then you have got a practical problem what if it

25   doesn't pass muster.      That's the reason for the

 1   contemporaneous objection rule.

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Can I ask you one other

 3   question.     You are the only one who will know the answer

 4   to, this too.     I noticed in looking at the opinion of

 5   the Louisiana Supreme Court that they start out by

 6   saying we have conducted another review of the voir dire

 7   transcript and find nothing there to disparage the

 8   Batson claim.     In reading that opinion in several places

 9   they refer to their having gone back and having read the

10   whole transcript themselves.

11                 And then they have two full pages, or one

12   and a half anyway where they seem to be talking about

13   what happened in a pretrial conference and they refer to

14   that prior review and covered a factor favorable to the

15   State's use of a peremptory challenge.

16                 They went back and found a factor of

17   favorable to.    Now, was that factor argued to them in

18   the brief?    Do you remember that?

19                 MR. BOUDREAUX:          I wrote the brief, Your

20   Honor, but I don't think -- I don't remember.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:            I thought that's why you

22   might know.

23                 (Laughter.)

24                 MR. BOUDREAUX:          I don't remember.

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:            I thought that, in reading

 1   it, it seems as if they are not, and I was thinking

 2   about how a judge can't think of everything.                   But if

 3   they're going to think beyond what the briefs tell them,

 4   they ought to think of it for both sides, and not just

 5   for one side.

 6               MR. BOUDREAUX:            You know to be honest,

 7   Justice Scalia's comment about looking at the record and

 8   saying oh, here is another reason that the prosecutor

 9   didn't articulate.

10               Similarly, Your Honor, in reference to the

11   Thomas Hawkins being struck with no objections -- there

12   was -- Greg Scott was a black juror of peremptory struck

13   by the State.   Again with no objection.                  If you want to

14   talk about -- if we're talking about two or five here,

15   little weight should be given to the exercise of those

16   two.   Greg Scott -- again like the other juror, I don't

17   think was going to survive the challenge by the defense.

18   His wife was the victim of a carjacking, and he said if

19   he was a defendant and he was innocent, he would

20   testify.   He would need to testify.

21               And in this case, the defendant did not

22   testify at either phase of the proceedings.

23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Mr. Boudreaux, I'd like

24   to ask you a question before you finish.                  It is not an

25   issue in this case, but we are told that

 1   African-Americans are 20 percent of the population of

 2   Jefferson Parish, but they were less than 11 percent of

 3   the people summoned for jury duty.

 4               Is that typical?

 5               MR. BOUDREAUX:           Certainly pre-Katrina, Your

 6   Honor.   Yes.   The summons go out based on public

 7   records, driver licenses, voters registrations.              That's

 8   basically at random.       To say those numbers would not

 9   surprise me.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              That's -- and because

11   it's almost half of what you would expect.

12               MR. BOUDREAUX:           Yes, and that's going to

13   vary, you know, from venire to venire on any given day.

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Thank you.

15               MR. BOUDREAUX:           In the minute or two I have

16   left, Your Honors, I would just remind the Court, urge

17   the Court to consider its recent opinion last June in

18   Uttecht dealing with the deference due the trial court

19   in these types of proceedings -- that was a habeas case

20   -- what the opinion says to require on direct review,

21   and according to the trial court, the deference having

22   been present and not just relying on a cold record, that

23   the Louisiana Supreme Court's ruling should be farmered.

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Do you think the deference

25   in Uttecht, which was the death qualified juror --

 2              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               -- should be any greater

 3   than in a Batson case where we have the sensitive issue

 4   of racial discrimination?

 5              MR. BOUDREAUX:             I'm not sure I understood

 6   the question, Your Honor.

 7              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Well, Uttecht --

 8              MR. BOUDREAUX:             Whether it's going to the

 9   issue --

10              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Uttecht was a death

11   qualified juror --

12              MR. BOUDREAUX:             Yes.

13              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               -- and this is a Batson

14   case.

15              MR. BOUDREAUX:             Right, and it --

16              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Because of our concerns in

17   the Batson area, do you think we're entitled to have a

18   different standard of deference for the trial court?                I

19   think your --

20              MR. BOUDREAUX:             No.      Because you're

21   still dealing with --

23   this --

24              MR. BOUDREAUX:             -- of a factfinder.

 1   habeas and Witherspoon, but the similarities, I think,

 2   are enough that this -- the degree of deference has to

 3   still be there, although there's a statutory deference

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

 7   Mr. Boudreaux.

 8                Mr. Bright, you have three minutes

 9   remaining.

10                  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BRIGHT

11                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12                MR. BRIGHT:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

13                If I could just say, first of all about,

14   this backstrike, because what we see here is after

15   Elaine Scott is struck, that's State number 6, the very

16   next peremptory strike by the State it, number 7, is to

17   go back and backstrike Jeffrey Brooks.

18                Now, notice that with regard to the other

19   four backstrikes used, two by the prosecution and two by

20   the defense, it's at the very end of the process.                        It's

21   literally when they're down to one juror.                     Williams

22   says, "Do we have 11 jurors?"             And then he backstrikes.

23   The defense says, "Is this my 11th strike?"                     Backstrike.

24   Williams then, "Are we back to 11?"                     So these -- the

25   only way the backstrike makes sense really, when you


                                       56

 1   think about it, is to look at the whole jury and then go

 2   back and cull out the ones based on a comparison.

 3               But once Brooks had kept them from striking

 4   Mr. Scott, who as Mr. Boudreaux pointed out, his wife

 5   was robbed at gunpoint, said he would testify if he were

 6   a defendant in a case and was innocent.                  And then as

 7   Justice Stevens pointed out, Hawkins, who was -- had

 8   grown children, engineer, friends in the police

 9   department -- these two are not struck -- but then once

10   Elaine Scott is struck, the third back and the Batson

11   challenge is made, we don't have any use for Jeffrey

12   Brooks anymore, so he's -- the backstrike is used in

13   that way.

14               And I think, again, when you look at all the

15   relevant circumstances, it's pretty clear what was going

16   on here with the acceptance of Brooks at the start and

17   the backstrike --

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Do you agree with

19   your friend on the other side, that you could have

20   objected both to the backstruck juror and to the jurors

21   to whom you -- with respect to whom you did not object

22   because there was -- the juror that was later backstruck

23   on the jury?

24               MR. BRIGHT:         I -- I think yes.           The answer

25   to that is yes, and I think, if the defense had, we'd be

 1   talking about four jurors here today instead of two.

 2   But it doesn't diminish from what the Court in Miller-El

 3   called the numbers.       The fact that it is unlikely to be,

 4   by chance, that all five -- all five African-Americans

 5   are struck in this case.

 6              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Although you could have

 7   made an objection.      As I understand your opponent, he

 8   very helpfully said that they probably would have left

 9   the courthouse --

10              MR. BRIGHT:           They would.

11              JUSTICE STEVENS:               So what could you --

12              MR. BRIGHT:           So they're gone.           And so if the

13   objection had been overruled --

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    The objection would

15   have afforded the state an opportunity to present the --

16   if there was one -- the non-racial reason THAT they

17   struck the juror.

18              MR. BRIGHT:           But the reason for doing that

19   would be to have the judge not allow the strike and to

20   put that juror in the box and the juror'                   gone now.   So

21   that, as a practical matter, is not going to work.

22   There's no --

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Another reason to do it

24   would be to preserve your right on appeal, to object to

25   those jurors.

 1                 MR. BRIGHT:       But there's no procedural rule

 2   in Louisiana that says you have to do that.                  It might

 3   have been a stronger case if they had done it.

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Maybe your rule here that

 5   -- that we're not going to postulate the worst reason

 6   for a prosecutorial strike rather than a good reason

 7   when you haven't given the prosecution an opportunity to

 8   set forth a good reason.

 9                 MR. BRIGHT:       If I may answer.

10                 That only goes, though -- the only two

11   jurors on the reasons that are before the Court are

12   Jeffrey Brooks and Elaine Scott.                But the fact that the

13   prosecutor struck all five, and as Justice Souter points

14   out, you wouldn't have made this argument, I don't think

15   -- this O.J. Simpson argument -- not only depending upon

16   the race of the defendant, but if there had been black

17   people on that jury.       This is an argument that resonates

18   with an all-white jury.

19                 Thank you.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

21   Mr. Bright.
