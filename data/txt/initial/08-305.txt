 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY S. FEINERMAN

 8                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                MR. FEINERMAN:           Thank you,

10   Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

11                The 1997 amendments to IDEA prohibit tuition

12   reimbursement awards for students who are unilaterally

13   placed in private school without first having received

14   special education services from the public school

15   district.

16                This is so under ordinary principles of

17   statutory construction and particularly so under the

18   Spending Clause clear notice rule.

19                Prior to 1997, IDEA did not expressly

20   address tuition reimbursement for unilaterally placed

21   students.    In 1997, Congress added section

22   1412(a)(10)(C).    In subsection (i), Congress provided

23   that when the school district makes a free appropriate

24   public education available, a FAPE, no reimbursement is

25   allowed.    And then in subsections (ii) through (iv),


                                         3

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Congress addressed situations where courts and hearing

 2   officers may award tuition reimbursement and said that

 3   reimbursement may be allowed where the school district

 4   does not make a FAPE available to a student who

 5   previously received special education services from the

 6   public district.   Congress said nothing --

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Feinerman, but the --

 8   the first provision that you read, sub (i), says that

 9   there will be no reimbursement if the agency has made a

10   free appropriate public education available to the child

11   and the parents elected to place the child in private

12   school.   But that "if" -- if the agency made a free

13   appropriate public education -- and here, as I

14   understand it, the school district said that this child

15   was ineligible for special education.

16                MR. FEINERMAN:          That's correct.

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So if the child was

18   entitled to a free appropriate public education and

19   didn't get it, then under this sub (i), wouldn't the

20   parents be entitled to tuition reimbursement?

21                MR. FEINERMAN:          No.      Subsection (i) covers

22   students who are provided a free appropriate public

23   education.   Subsections (ii) through (iv) address the

24   other category of students --

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, that's your --

 1               MR. FEINERMAN:           -- those who are not --

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That's your construction.

 3   But couldn't this be read to say no reimbursement if --

 4   the word is "if" -- the agency, not -- so the

 5   implication is if the agency did not make a free

 6   appropriate public education available, then --

 7               MR. FEINERMAN:           That -- that might be the

 8   implication if there weren't subsection (C)(ii) through

 9   (C)(iv).   So it's -- it's T.A.'s argument and the

10   government's argument that (C)(i) sets forth the general

11   rule, but if that were the way that -- that Congress

12   meant the statute to operate, it wouldn't have had any

13   reason to put in (C)(ii) through (C)(iv) because we

14   would already know from (C)(i) that tuition

15   reimbursement was a possibility for students who did not

16   receive -- previously receive special education services

17   from the public district.

18               Congress instead went on in (C)(ii) through

19   (C)(iv) to address very specifically, in the context of

20   a comprehensive statutory scheme, when tuition

21   reimbursement would be available to students who did not

22   previously receive.      And Congress specified, after

23   essentially being invited to do so in Burlington, which

24   of those students could get tuition reimbursement.             And

25   the --

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Of course, (ii) through

 2   (iv) don't -- don't limit or contradict any explicit

 3   requirement of (i).

 4                 MR. FEINERMAN:           Oh, no.            It --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             (i) is only at most a

 6   negative implication, which -- which one would not draw

 7   in light of (ii) through (iv), is what you're saying.

 8                 MR. FEINERMAN:           Yes, that's exactly what I'm

 9   saying.     And -- and they deal with different sets of

10   students.    In (i), the school district has made a FAPE

11   available; in (ii) through (iv), the school district has

12   not made a FAPE available.             And no mention is made of

13   when a FAPE is not made available to a student who had

14   not previously received.

15                 And under this Court's decision in

16   Arlington, because those students like T.A. who had not

17   previously received, are not mentioned, yet Congress --

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Then -- then what happens

19   in a case which I think is like this one, where the

20   child doesn't receive special education because the

21   school has determined that the child is not eligible?

22   So the child isn't getting public education, and in the

23   parents' view, confirmed by experts, the child is in

24   need of special education, can't get it from the public

25   schools, because they declared the child ineligible.

 1   What is such a parent to do?

 2              MR. FEINERMAN:             If -- if it's an incorrect

 3   determination by the school district, the problem is

 4   remedied rather quickly.          There are very tight time

 5   frames in IDEA --

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Of course, the parents here

 7   didn't -- didn't run off to a private school only after

 8   the school district had found that their child didn't

 9   require any special education, did they?

10              MR. FEINERMAN:             That's correct.

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:               They -- they put him in a

12   private school without even consulting the schools.

13              MR. FEINERMAN:             Right.        And then only after

14   the fact went to the school district and asked for --

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Saying by the way, we can

16   get some money.   How much -- how much money are you

17   talking about imposing on the school district here?

18              MR. FEINERMAN:             Well, it's -- the tuition is

19   $5,200 a month.

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:               A month?

21              MR. FEINERMAN:             Yes, and then there's a

22   $5,200 alumni services fee, a $1,500 interview fee.                  But

23   let's --

24              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Mr. Feinerman, can we go

25   back to the time frame again?              I've just got a question


                                         7

 1   of fact.     I should know this, but I don't.              You said

 2   that if the -- if the parents and the school district

 3   disagree, it can be remedied fairly quickly because

 4   there's a fairly tight schedule set for the

 5   administrative procedure.            What I don't remember, and my

 6   question is this:     When the administrative steps have

 7   been exhausted, if there is still disagreement, is there

 8   any limit on the time in which the -- the judicial

 9   appeal has to be resolved?

10                 MR. FEINERMAN:           No, there isn't.      So --

11                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             Isn't that the -- isn't

12   that the kicker here?         In other words, I -- I fully

13   understand your -- your textual argument.                 I -- I can

14   see its soundness as a possibility that is open to us

15   and, perhaps on the face of it, the most likely

16   possibility, but there is a cost, and the cost, it seems

17   to me, is that once you get into the -- once you get

18   into appeals, this thing can go on for years, and you

19   can't wait years when -- when a kid is in this kind of

20   condition.

21                 MR. FEINERMAN:           That's correct, but there's

22   no need to wait years.         Let's assume that parents

23   actually went through the process appropriately, unlike

24   T.A.'s parents --

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But if you can explain

 1   what the process is --

 2                MR. FEINERMAN:          Yes.

 3                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- because Justice Scalia

 4   said the parents just went away.               The school at an

 5   earlier point said this child was ineligible for special

 6   education, isn't that so?          I think --

 7                MR. FEINERMAN:          That's correct.            That was in

 8   2001, and the district judge, at --

 9                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Yes.

10                MR. FEINERMAN:          -- at page 39 of the

11   petition to the -- of the appendix to the petition, page

12   39 note 3, the district judge noted that the 2001

13   evaluation is an appropriate part of this case.                     But for

14   this -- for the parents who try and get their student --

15   get their student evaluated, the school district says,

16   "No.   The child is ineligible"; and then the parents --

17   at that point, the timing kicks in.                     The parents can ask

18   for a due process hearing the next day.                     Under the time

19   periods that were in place when T.A.'s case was going

20   through --

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is that hearing --

22                MR. FEINERMAN:          -- the hearing officer --

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is that hearing on

24   eligible or not, or is it on what the IEP should be?

25                MR. FEINERMAN:          Well, it's --

 1              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              When the school said not

 2   eligible, is there -- is that question resolved first

 3   before we ever get to the IEP?

 4              MR. FEINERMAN:            I think, in a situation

 5   where the school district finds the child ineligible and

 6   there is an appeal, both the eligibility and the

 7   appropriate placement are decided in front of the

 8   hearing officer.   And there was a 45-day time period at

 9   the time T.A.'s case went through for the hearing

10   officer to make a decision.            And then after that, it's

11   --

12              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Well, wouldn't the school

13   say, we -- we have no obligation to get up an IEP until

14   the question of eligibility is determined?

15              MR. FEINERMAN:            I suppose if the school

16   district were to get a stay of the hearing officer's

17   decision pending appeal to the district court.              But

18   that's not what happened here.              What happened here is

19   that the hearing officer decided on June -- January 26,

20   2004, that T.A. was eligible.             On February 19th, quicker

21   than the 30 days allowed, Forest Grove School District

22   proposed an IEP that could have started as soon as

23   possible thereafter, as the regulations require.

24              So you are talking about a very tight -- I

25   understand the situation that you are hypothesizing,

 1   Justice Ginsburg, but we are talking about a very tight

 2   turnaround in T.A.'s case, 75 days, which is a matter of

 3   weeks, not a matter of years as was the case in

 4   Burlington.

 5                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           What happens when we get to

 6   court?

 7                 MR. FEINERMAN:          Excuse me?

 8                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           What happens when we get to

 9   court?   Isn't that when it turns into a matter of years?

10                 MR. FEINERMAN:          It turns into a matter of

11   years, but in the interim this school district, Forest

12   Grove School District, while it was litigating in the

13   district court, Forest Grove School District offered an

14   IEP, and at that point T.A.'s parents could have tried

15   the IEP out, sent the child to receive services in the

16   public school district --

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The IEP -- they did the

18   IEP after the hearing officer was finished?

19                 MR. FEINERMAN:          Yes.      Less than 4 weeks

20   after the hearing officer was finished, Forest Grove

21   offered an IEP, and that's in the addendum to our reply

22   brief.

23                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Okay.       But I think we've

24   got to assume that Congress has some concern for the

25   parents who correctly say, this IEP is no good, it just


                                        11

 1   can't be done in the school system, and the kid needs a

 2   special school.    In that case, maybe -- your answer may

 3   be that's the exceptional case and it shouldn't drive

 4   the -- the inferences to be drawn about congressional

 5   intent.   But in that case, if the district and the

 6   parents are at good faith loggerheads it can go on for a

 7   long, long time, can't it?

 8               MR. FEINERMAN:             It can go on for a long,

 9   long time if the parents file for a due process hearing,

10   and that it can --

11               JUSTICE SOUTER:              No, but they get the due

12   process hearing.   The ultimate result is that the school

13   proposes an IEP; the parents, based on what their

14   experts tell them, say that isn't going to work, and the

15   parents say the only way we can educate this kid without

16   his falling behind more is to put him in a private

17   school.   At that point, with assuming good faith here,

18   it seems to me you get into court and it can go on for a

19   long time, if we accept your -- your analysis of the

20   text.

21               MR. FEINERMAN:             But all the parents have to

22   do in that situation is to give the IEP a try and send

23   their child to public school.

24               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Yes, but doesn't that get

25   to the point of something pretty formalistic?              I mean,

 1   somebody in the brief said, given one day under the IEP

 2   and the -- if you win, ultimately the check can be

 3   written.    That can't be right.

 4                MR. FEINERMAN:           I don't think one day could

 5   be right.   The statute says -- it -- it expressly says

 6   "who previously received special" -- "special education

 7   service under the authority of a public agency."                  It

 8   doesn't say how long it has to be.

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Maybe -- I'm sorry.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I remember, perhaps

11   incorrectly, from the prior argument here that the

12   period that they had to try out the school plan was ten

13   days?

14                MR. FEINERMAN:           That -- that's a

15   discretionary factor that courts and hearing officers

16   can -- it's not a hard and fast rule.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Not a hard and fast

18   rule.

19                MR. FEINERMAN:           But I think it's probably

20   good as a general benchmark.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So is that -- is

22   that a period that your client's prepared to accept?

23                MR. FEINERMAN:           Yes, so long as -- in the

24   ordinary case, ten days would -- it's in the statute, so

25   we have that textual indication.                And it will provide

 1   the school district a chance to provide services under

 2   the IEP.

 3                 And as this Court mentioned in a prior case,

 4   IEP's -- it's not an exact science and when you look at

 5   it on a piece of paper it's hard to know whether it's

 6   going to work or not.        The way you find out whether it

 7   works is where the rubber hits the road and it could be

 8   that the parents look at IEP and say, you know what, I

 9   don't think this is going to work.                  But until you

10   actually give it a chance to work -- maybe the child

11   goes in and -- and works with the special education

12   teacher or the instructional assistant and they really

13   hit it off.

14                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Do you think that's

15   realistic?    If the parents are convinced going in that

16   this is an inappropriate IEP and they send the child to

17   school for ten days under the IEP, at the end of the ten

18   days they are going to say, oh, well, we've completely

19   changed our mind, now we think this is a good plan?

20                 MR. FEINERMAN:          It's certainly plausible

21   under certain circumstances.             It -- it may not happen

22   every time.    And it may not happen half the time.

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Isn't it also plausible

24   that the district will say, ten days is not a fair trial

25   for this system, this is a child with severe learning

 1   disabilities and to give this IEP a fair chance we need

 2   ten months?

 3                 MR. FEINERMAN:          At that point those

 4   arguments can be made under (C)(iii) and (C)(iv) because

 5   at that point the child would no -- the parents would no

 6   longer be categorically barred from seeking tuition

 7   reimbursement and those are arguments that you can make

 8   to the hearing officer.

 9                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           But you are basically

10   saying that the -- that the only necessary delay in

11   order to satisfy a condition for eligibility, if the

12   parents otherwise prevail, is a ten-day delay.                   That's

13   basically your answer?

14                 MR. FEINERMAN:          I -- I don't think I'm

15   saying that.    I'm saying --

16                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Okay.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           This school does not have

18   to come up with an IEP.         It could tough it out and say,

19   we're going to rest on our belief that this child does

20   not need any special education, right?                   And unless the

21   school proposes an IEP, the parent cannot come within

22   subsection (2) by sending the kid to get the special

23   services.

24                 MR. FEINERMAN:          I think that assumes that

25   the school district is not going to abide by the order

 1   of the independent hearing officer.                    And in this -- in

 2   our case.

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What about before?           The

 4   whole point is that under the words of the statute as

 5   you interpret it, there is a condition predicate that

 6   has to be satisfied.     So, to say that -- to answer by

 7   saying, well, that assumes they won't obey the hearing

 8   officer, what about before the hearing even takes place?

 9               MR. FEINERMAN:          Right.        Before the hearing

10   takes place, there is 45 days, and then well, the

11   hearing -- there's a request for a due process hearing,

12   the hearing officer has 45 days, and then if the hearing

13   officer says this child is eligible, district, you must

14   propose an IEP, the district has 30 days after that.

15               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, what happens in the

16   case where --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Could the district appeal?

18   That's the end of the road?           Can't the district say the

19   hearing officer is wrong?

20               MR. FEINERMAN:          Absolutely, the district can

21   appeal.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:           And if it does, does it

23   have to take any action in the interim.

24               MR. FEINERMAN:          I suppose it, yes, unless it

25   gets a stay of the hearing officer's ruling.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Which is --

 2                MR. FEINERMAN:            But that didn't happen here

 3   and I am not aware of any cases which it did happen.                     In

 4   this case there are two tracks.                 The hearing officer

 5   said:    T.A. is eligible; prepare an IEP.                The district

 6   said:    I disagree; I'm going to appeal to the district

 7   court.

 8                But in t mean time, within less than 28

 9   days, t district prepared an IEP and offered it to T.A.

10   And at that point T.A. could have accepted the services,

11   thus rendering him eligible for tuition reimbursement.

12                JUSTICE STEVENS:             I still don't understand

13   your answer to Justice Scalia.                What if the school board

14   just was adamant that he is not entitled to any special

15   education?     It just maintained that position throughout

16   the litigation?

17                MR. FEINERMAN:            I think the assumption is

18   that the school district would not abide by a lawful

19   order of a hearing officer.

20                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Well, they got a stay and

21   they wanted to appeal it.            And if they did what happens?

22                MR. FEINERMAN:            In that situation there

23   would be no -- and I'm not aware of that situation ever

24   happening --

25                JUSTICE STEVENS:             But they don't have a risk

 1   under your view of the law as I understand it.                  They

 2   could take that position and they would never be

 3   liable -- never be liable.

 4              MR. FEINERMAN:            There would be a delay in

 5   that situation, but I'm not aware of any case where that

 6   situation -- where a school district.

 7              JUSTICE STEVENS:             But that's the consequence

 8   of your position as I understand it, that they could do

 9   that and they would not have any risk of liability.

10              MR. FEINERMAN:            I think that's a

11   hypothetical risk, because again I haven't seen any

12   situations where that actually has occurred.

13              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, but it's not that

14   hypothetical when -- there are two prongs.                  Number one,

15   the school has to agree first with the diagnosis, which

16   in this case they didn't even do that.                  They had a good

17   faith disagreement.      Second, they have to have an

18   adequate IEP.   So there are two conditions.

19              MR. FEINERMAN:            That's true, and I think --

20   I think the answer to the question -- it's really, this

21   is really a legislative question.                Perhaps Congress

22   ought to further amend the statute to say in those

23   situations where a school district is being obstreperous

24   in refusing to comply with the hearing officer's order,

25   in those situations there is going to be an exception to


                                       18

 1   the exception.     But it's not -- it's not the statute

 2   that Congress wrote.        Congress wrote --

 3               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Doesn't your

 4   interpretation of the statute create an incentive for

 5   the school board to just say, we'll never provide any

 6   kind of education, special education, we will just tough

 7   it out?   Because they can't lose, they can't be liable

 8   if they do that, if I understand you correctly.

 9               MR. FEINERMAN:             I -- I suppose

10   hypothetically it does, but my understanding is that

11   that just doesn't happen.            In Schaffer v. Weast and

12   other cases, the assumption --

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Would you be surprised to

14   find a court decision which says that when the reason

15   that the plaintiff cannot comply with the requirement

16   that he first be in a plan, when the reason is -- is the

17   district's refusal to abide by an order to prepare a

18   plan, that subsection (2) does not apply?

19               MR. FEINERMAN:             Your --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:              You can't profit by your

21   own malfeasance.

22               MR. FEINERMAN:             That's correct.    And I -- I

23   don't think there could be reimbursement under

24   subsection (ii).    Perhaps if there were a parallel

25   Rehabilitation Act claim under 504, that might be a

 1   vehicle to get relief in a situation where the school

 2   district is acting as horribly as being hypothesized,

 3   but not under --

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:             But you -- you don't think

 5   -- you don't think a court could say the only reason

 6   these people could not comply with (ii) is that the

 7   school district made it impossible by not complying with

 8   the order to provide an IEP; and, therefore, they --

 9   they can recover for the private placement?

10              MR. FEINERMAN:            It's conceivable that --

11   that a court could hold that.             A court could also --

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:             I think it's more than

13   conceivable.   I know a lot of courts that would hold

14   that.

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:             But your position is that

16   there are basically two situations:                     One, the situation

17   in which there is an administrative order to do an IEP

18   and the school district says, no, we won't do it.

19   Millions for defense; we are going right into appeal,

20   and we are not going to prepare the IEP.                     In that

21   situation, as I understand it, you are saying, the

22   parents have no way of getting relief under the statute.

23              In the case in which there is an order for

24   the IEP and the school district prepares the IEP, even

25   though the parents think it will be inadequate, there in


                                       20
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   fact is a ready remedy subject to two delays:                    One, the

 2   time to prepare the IEP; and, two, ten days to give it a

 3   try before the parents take the kid out of school.

 4   That's basically the scheme that you are proposing that

 5   the statute provides; is -- is that correct?

 6               MR. FEINERMAN:           That's the scheme that

 7   Congress wrote in the statute, yes, under -- under

 8   (C)(ii).   And it has to work that way, because -- I want

 9   to come back to a -- to a point that was aired in the

10   briefs, which is T.A.'s argument and the government's

11   argument rests upon the notion that section

12   1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) gives hearing officers the authority

13   to award tuition reimbursement.               That provision doesn't

14   give hearing officers any authority to do anything, let

15   alone to award tuition reimbursement.

16               The only provision in IDEA that gives

17   hearing officers the authority to award tuition

18   reimbursement is 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).                    So if the statute

19   doesn't work -- the statute doesn't work, and the

20   Secretary's interpretation of 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) is

21   implausible because it accords to hearing officers the

22   authority that it doesn't have.

23               There is another textual clue why the

24   statute works in the way that I am suggesting, and that

25   is in the '97 amendments in subsections (iii) and (iv)

 1   Congress gave very explicit guidance to courts and

 2   hearing officers as to the factors the court and hearing

 3   officer should consider when deciding whether to award

 4   tuition reimbursement to a student who previously

 5   received special education services.

 6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            The -- the problem that

 7   the government and the parents have is they have to give

 8   some work to (ii).      Under -- under their view (ii)

 9   doesn't seem to do much work.

10                 And the problem with your position is that

11   it seems in a way formalistic and in some cases to

12   encourage intransigence.           If we adopted a presumption

13   that the school district's diagnosis was correct and a

14   presumption that it's -- if -- if there was a diagnosis

15   of disability, that its individual education program was

16   adequate, that would, it seems to me, not be all you

17   wanted, but would ameliorate the position of the school

18   district.     Would we have authority, do you think, to

19   adopt such a presumption?

20                 MR. FEINERMAN:           I think the -- the Court

21   already has adopted that presumption in Schaffer v.

22   Weast.   School districts are presumed to be acting in

23   good faith.

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, this -- this would

25   be a clear and convincing evidence presumption that the


                                         22

 1   -- that the IEP is -- that the school district designs

 2   is right, that its diagnosis is right.                      That's not all

 3   you -- that's not all you would be asking for.

 4              MR. FEINERMAN:              Well --

 5              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               But would we have

 6   authority to do that if we were to reject your

 7   interpretation of the statute?

 8              MR. FEINERMAN:              I suppose you would have the

 9   authority to do that.

10              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                How have -- how have

11   hearing officers been proceeding?                  I mean, here we had a

12   case that went to a hearing officer.                      There is no IEP

13   when the hearing officer begins the process.                      In the --

14   on the eligibility or not, do hearing officers give

15   deference to the school district and then -- so that's

16   eligibility.   At the IEP stage, do they give deference

17   to the student?

18              MR. FEINERMAN:              There is some deference

19   given to -- are you talking about the deference that the

20   district court gives to the hearing officer?

21              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                No, the hearing officer.

22   The hearing officer is the first-level decisionmaker.

23   And the school board gives its reasons why it thinks the

24   child is ineligible; the parent, the reasons that the

25   child is eligible.      That's the threshold determination.

 1                On that threshold determination of

 2   eligibility, do hearing officers presume in favor of the

 3   school district?

 4                MR. FEINERMAN:           Not -- not in this case.        In

 5   this case under Oregon law at the time -- and this was a

 6   pre-Schaffer decision -- the hearing officer put the

 7   burden of proof on the school --

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel --

 9                MR. FEINERMAN:           -- on the question of

10   eligibility.

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 -- why isn't it the

12   case that the school's diagnosis is a related service

13   under the statutory provision?               It seems to me to be

14   very important service to the parents to know what the

15   school's diagnosis is.

16                MR. FEINERMAN:           I -- I think that the

17   diagnosis is more in terms of eligibility.                  It's

18   under -- under (b)(6), the hearing officer can decide --

19   can consider issues of identification, eligibility, and

20   placement.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No, I'm talking

22   about what the parents received.                And they receive a

23   diagnosis, and the statute covers -- asks whether they

24   previously received special education and related

25   services.    Diagnosis would seem to me to be a service

 1   related to special education.

 2               MR. FEINERMAN:            I -- I don't think that's

 3   the way it works.    A diagnosis -- a finding of

 4   eligibility or not is not a diagnosis.                   It is just an

 5   eligibility finding, and that's something that the

 6   parents can take to a -- a due process hearing under

 7   1415(f).

 8               If there are no further questions, I will

 9   reserve the remainder of my time.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, counsel.

12               ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS

13                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14               MR. SALMONS:          That you, Mr. Chief Justice,

15   and may it please the Court:

16               The school district in this case improperly

17   denied T.A., a child with a disability who had always

18   been enrolled in public schools, access to all public

19   special education services.             It asserts that because its

20   wrong eligibility determinations prevented T.A. from

21   receiving special education services, it is immune from

22   reimbursing T.A.'s parents the cost of obtaining those

23   services from another source.

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  What is wrong with

25   ten days?   I mean it's -- it's a big expense you are

 1   asking the school district to incur, that will take away

 2   funds from other programs.            And all -- all they are

 3   saying is give it a try for ten days, and if it doesn't

 4   work out, then you can go?

 5              MR. SALMONS:           I think there are several

 6   problems with that reading of the statute, Your Honor.

 7   First of all, the ten-day period that is referenced in

 8   subsection (C)(iii) refers to the amount of notice that

 9   a district needs to receive before a child is removed

10   from the public school system.

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Oh, yes, the first

12   day -- the first day they say, look, we don't think this

13   is going to work out, so we are notifying you what we

14   are going to do.    And they say, well, you've got to do

15   that in ten days, and they said, okay, ten days.

16              MR. SALMONS:           But that's -- that's simply

17   not the way these things work as a general matter, and

18   let me just point out a few things about the normal

19   process of developing IEP's.             And, again, here the child

20   never even got that far.          But, typically, IEP's are

21   developed at the end of the -- of a school year for the

22   following year.    And the parents at that point have a

23   period of time in which to decide to go along with that

24   plan or to give notice and then make alternative

25   arrangements.


                                        26

 1              And it's simply the -- I mean -- and that's

 2   the way it works, because it's important for parents to

 3   be able to get their child in an alternative program if

 4   they decide that's what they want to do.                 And if you

 5   wait until the school year has already started, those

 6   may not be available.       And the ten-day notice

 7   requirement --

 8              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, I suppose

 9   that's right, but once the law is clarified, schools

10   that specialize in -- in treating these kids would be

11   able -- they would understand as well, and they would

12   understand you've got to -- the people who are going to

13   be sending -- most of the people who will be sending

14   their children to the school have to wait ten days.                   And

15   it seems to me that the actual practice on the ground

16   would work out pretty easily.

17              MR. SALMONS:          But, again, Your Honor, if you

18   focus on the terms of the statute, the -- even under

19   Petitioner's reading, the requirement would be to have

20   previously received special education services, not to

21   have tried out a particular plan.

22              It may be the case that the plan for the

23   upcoming year is -- is very different than the plan for

24   the prior year.   Perhaps they have had another

25   assessment, and they had substantially changed --

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, which way does

 2   that cut?   It seems to me that cuts the other way.

 3               MR. SALMONS:         Well, I --

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Here's a -- here's a

 5   new plan.   We've worked on it.             Here it is.     At least

 6   give it ten days -- two school week tries.

 7               MR. SALMONS:         I think the way that cuts,

 8   Your Honor, is -- is that that reading of what you are

 9   positing, I guess, in this exchange what Congress might

10   have had in mind, is not what they said in the statute.

11   They did not require parents to try out a particular

12   plan; just that at some point in time they had

13   previously received special education services.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 With respect,

15   counsel, what Congress provided is that the child must

16   have previously received special education and related

17   services.

18               MR. SALMONS:         That's right.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So I think they did

20   provide that you've got to try it out at least for a

21   minimal period.

22               MR. SALMONS:         But not the particular plan

23   that is the subject of the IEP, Your Honor.                 That --

24   that connection does not exist in the statute.                 And --

25   and we think it's counter to what Congress intended.

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Okay.   So what type

 2   of special education services do you think do count as

 3   having been previously received?

 4              MR. SALMONS:         Well -- well, if I -- if I

 5   may, the way we read this provision, and it's set forth

 6   on pages 3 and 4 on the addendum to the blue brief, and

 7   we think it's important that we read this as a whole and

 8   in context, is that subsection (C)(i) provides the

 9   general rule to govern the payment of private school

10   tuition based on a unilateral placement by the parents.

11   And subsection (C)(i) creates the only expressed

12   limitation on the right to reimbursement, and it does so

13   only in instances where the school district has provided

14   a free and appropriate public education.

15              We think subsection (C)(ii), (C)(iii), and

16   (C)(iv) work together to govern the subset of cases that

17   is Congress was most concerned about and that, in fact,

18   are the most common scenario in which these disputes

19   have arised.

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Except that you are reading

21   (C)(i) to say something that it doesn't say.                It just

22   says you don't have to pay if the agency has made a free

23   appropriate public education available.

24              MR. SALMONS:         That is what --

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:            And you read it to say you


                                      29
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   must pay whenever it hasn't made, and it just doesn't

 2   say that.   It -- it's a safe harbor for the school

 3   district.   It says, so long as you've made an

 4   appropriate public education available, you can't be

 5   liable for any -- any private school tuition.

 6               Now, you want to expand that to say, and

 7   whenever that condition doesn't exist, you are liable.

 8   But it really doesn't say that.               And -- and the later

 9   sections suggest that it meant not to say that.

10               MR. SALMONS:         Well, that's where we part

11   company, Your Honor, because, in fact, that negative

12   inference that you refer to is precisely what

13   Petitioners attempt to read into subsection (C)(ii).

14   There is nothing in subsection (C)(ii) that provides any

15   restriction on the ability to obtain reimbursement.                   It

16   was written in permissive language.

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 In reading -- in

18   reading it that way, you are reading the phrase "who

19   previously received special education services" to mean

20   also who previously did not receive special education

21   services.

22               MR. SALMONS:         No, Your Honor.          We are simply

23   not reading that language "who previously received" to

24   be a condition precedent.

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Yeah, so it doesn't


                                       30

 1   matter whether they previously received or not.

 2               MR. SALMONS:         It does matter, Your Honor,

 3   because the provisions that follow in (C)(iii) and

 4   (C)(iv) that guide the exercise of discretion, in that

 5   category of cases that were of concern to Congress, only

 6   apply to the cases that are defined in subsection

 7   (C)(ii).   So in our reading the language "who previously

 8   received" still serves an important purpose, but it

 9   serves an identifying purpose for the limiting factors

10   provided in (C)(iii) and (C)(iv).                It does not serve --

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So you are saying

12   Congress went to the trouble of spelling out this

13   elaborate provision in (C)(iii) and (ii) and all the

14   other things, but that was not the universe of the

15   situations in which there could be reimbursement?                 They

16   went to that trouble, but then -- at the end you want to

17   say or some other provisions or some other

18   circumstances?

19               MR. SALMONS:         Well, that's right.          We think

20   that Congress was focused on a particular set of cases

21   where problems had arisen, and that's where you already

22   had a child in the process of receiving special

23   education and you had parents who removed the child out

24   of that process without giving adequate notice, and

25   thereby short -- excuse me -- short-circuiting an

 1   ongoing collaborative relationship that Congress wanted

 2   to preserve.

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Yes, but if -- if you avoid

 4   that collaborative relationship entirely and just run

 5   off to a prior -- to a private school right away, you

 6   get reimbursement.      Why?

 7               MR. SALMONS:           Well you don't automatically

 8   get reimbursement.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Why would Congress -- huh?

10               MR. SALMONS:           You don't -- you don't

11   automatically get reimbursement, Your Honor.              There is

12   just no categorical bar to seeking reimbursement.              You

13   still have to show it's an appropriate remedy, which

14   always has been understood to require a showing that the

15   parents acted reasonably and in good faith, and that

16   they were sincere in their efforts to obtain services

17   from the school.

18               JUSTICE BREYER:              What about more than that?

19               MR. SALMONS:           The alternative --

20               JUSTICE BREYER:              Why not -- I mean,

21   suppose -- the part I don't understand in this statute,

22   which may not be relevant -- I would appreciate the

23   help.   It seems to me that (a)(10) large (A) and then

24   (F) have something to do with the parent who never goes

25   to public school, the child just goes to private schools

 1   to begin with, and they get something.                   If they have --

 2   if they have a disability, this program pays them

 3   something, right.

 4              MR. SALMONS:           Your Honor --

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:              I'm not following this.       I

 6   don't know what section.

 7              JUSTICE BREYER:              It's at the very beginning,

 8   at the end of addendum page 1.

 9              MR. SALMONS:           This is what's -- Your Honor,

10   this is what's known as the child find provision.

11              JUSTICE BREYER:              What is that?

12              MR. SALMONS:           What it provides is that

13   for -- let me just step back for a moment and remind the

14   Court that the obligation on the State is to ensure that

15   children, all children with disabilities, regardless of

16   whether they are in public or private school, have the

17   opportunity for a free appropriate public education.

18              With respect to children in private school

19   who are not seeking a free appropriate public school

20   education from the public school district, the only

21   requirement under the Act is that you seek them out, you

22   find them, you identify them, and that you report that

23   to the Department of Education, and that you get money

24   for those children.      And for those children who are not

25   enrolled in public school, you have to use a percentage

 1   of the funds you receive from the Federal Government --

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.       So in other

 3   words --

 4                 MR. SALMONS: -- to provide benefits that are

 5   available to all children.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:           -- a parent who has a

 7   disabled child who never thinks about the public school

 8   system still gets some money, but not as much, for the

 9   disabled child?

10                 MR. SALMONS:        It's not money to the parents,

11   Your Honor.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           It's money to the school.

13                 MR. SALMONS:        It funds programs, for example

14   speech therapy or something like that.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           To the school.

16                 MR. SALMONS:        That they would then allow

17   children in private school to -- to benefit from.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:           And so, it's money that

19   goes to the school for a program?

20                 MR. SALMONS:        It's not even necessarily

21   money that goes to the private school.

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Money that the children can

23   get.   I get it.

24                 MR. SALMONS:        It goes to the public schools,

25   that they provide services that they may make available

 1   to children regardless of their placement.

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.       Now, would it

 3   then work, what is -- would this system work under the

 4   statute?     You say, parents, if you are going to a

 5   disabled child, you simply go to a private school, you

 6   get the services you just mentioned.

 7                 Now, if you put in -- put the child in a

 8   public school, and they find a free appropriate public

 9   education, fine, that's the end of that, you have to do

10   it.     Now, if they don't give you a decent one, you can,

11   you can send the child to a private school, but it

12   has -- you have to give it a shot to the public school

13   system.

14                 Now, that's what you don't want the

15   interpretation to be?         You don't -- you are against

16   that.     But -- but let's amend it a little.

17                 MR. SALMONS:         That's not -- I would not

18   describe it that way, Your Honor, if I -- I don't mean

19   to --

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:            I am reading the language.

21   You may require the district to pay for someone who has

22   been enrolled in special services --

23                 MR. SALMONS:         I mean, again, just keep in

24   mind the facts of this case.              This is a child who was in

25   the public school system --

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:            You haven't heard my

 2   amendment.

 3                 MR. SALMONS:         Okay.        I'm sorry, Your Honor.

 4   Go ahead.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:            My amendment is the norm

 6   will be give the public school a shot, but there could

 7   be circumstances, you're getting the run-around, there

 8   is need to put that child in a public school now.                  In

 9   other words, special equitable circumstances that make

10   it reasonable for the parent not to give the school a

11   shot, though that's the norm.               And in those unusual

12   circumstances, there would remain grounds for equitable

13   relief.

14                 What about that as an overall interpretation

15   of the statute which has several parts to it?

16                 MR. SALMONS:         I would submit that the way we

17   read the statute, Your Honor, in fact, does precisely

18   that.     Because, the school district -- just again, take

19   this --

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:            But you have to be willing

21   to accept that it's an unusual situation, though it may

22   well exist, that the judge is going to reimburse the

23   parent where that parent didn't give the public school a

24   shot.     They will have to show there is a good reason for

25   not doing that.

 1               MR. SALMONS:          The -- the difficulty I

 2   have --

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:             Is that all right with you

 4   or not?

 5               MR. SALMONS:          Well, the difficulty I have

 6   with your question, Your Honor, is that the school

 7   district always has a shot under the Act.                In this case,

 8   the school district assessed the child in 2001 and again

 9   in 2003, and both times it erroneously concluded

10   that the child --

11               JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, you are simply saying

12   that it was reasonable for the parent here.               I'm not

13   asking that question.

14               MR. SALMONS:          No, not just that it's

15   reasonable, but in the process of assessing the child,

16   in developing an individual education plan that is

17   appropriate for that child, that is precisely the shot

18   that the statute gives the public school system to get

19   it right.   What the statute does --

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Salmons, I thought

21   that the -- the courts, the district court, will not

22   provide for tuition reimbursement, unless at least two

23   things are shown.    One is that the school district did

24   not provide an adequate education for this child.               And

25   two, that the private school did, and then there are

 1   equitable considerations.

 2              MR. SALMONS:           That is absolutely correct.

 3              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               So you must find both,

 4   not just that the private school was a good place, but

 5   that the school district did not offer an adequate

 6   education for the child.

 7              MR. SALMONS:           That is -- that is correct.

 8   That is what this Court held in Carter.                  That's what the

 9   regulations say.    I would note that there is nothing in

10   the text of the statute and the provisions that

11   Petitioner relies on, (C)(ii) for example, that makes it

12   a statutory requirement to show that the private

13   placement is reasonable as a -- as a condition precedent

14   to obtain tuition reimbursement.                But both sides concede

15   that that's required, even though it's not in the

16   statute.

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But procedurally we -- we

18   know that there is a provision addressed to a court for

19   equitable relief.    The question was put before:               Where

20   does the hearing officer get the authority to order

21   tuition reimbursement?        Because the statute on which you

22   rely for the court speaks only to the court's authority.

23              MR. SALMONS:           Thank you, Your Honor.         I am

24   happy to answer that question.               But Petitioner makes

25   this a centerpiece of their reply brief and I think they

 1   just misread the statute.         And again, keep in mind that

 2   these amendments in 1997 were written against a backdrop

 3   of this longstanding statute and this Court's

 4   interpretations of it.      The most direct place where the

 5   statute provides hearing officers the authority to hear

 6   address reimbursement claims and to award

 7   reimbursement -- and this is on page 9 of the addendum

 8   in the blue brief -- is 1415(b)(6).                    This has always

 9   been in the statute and it states that the parents must

10   be provided an opportunity to present complaints with

11   respect to "any matter relating to the identification,

12   evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or

13   the provision of a free appropriate public education to

14   such child."

15              That is -- again, that has always been

16   understood to include the right to seek reimbursement

17   before the hearing officer.           And this Court in

18   Burlington cited legislative history from the 1975 Act

19   that noted that hearing officers could award

20   reimbursement and address such claims in concluding that

21   it was part of the appropriate relief that courts ought

22   to be able to have under 1415.

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Are any of these other

24   procedures -- I took these to be procedures that have to

25   be provided by the school district, not -- not by the

 1   hearing officer.

 2                 MR. SALMONS:         These are -- these are

 3   required -- this whole section, Your Honor, 1412, is

 4   entitled "State Eligibility," and these are all

 5   requirements that States have to provide for process in

 6   order to obtain funds under the Act, and so it is a

 7   requirement that States provide hearing officers that

 8   have the ability to award reimbursement --

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But it doesn't say hearing

10   officers.     "An opportunity to present complaints with

11   respect to any matter relating to the identification" --

12                 MR. SALMONS:         Those complaints --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- to present the complaint

14   to the principal.

15                 MR. SALMONS:         No, Your Honor.             This is a

16   reference to the due process complaint notice that is

17   referenced elsewhere in the statute.                      I believe

18   Petitioner would agree with me that that's what this

19   references.

20                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, but the reference is to

21   a right to be heard on certain subjects.                      It doesn't say

22   anything about authorizing a particular individual or

23   officer within a school system to award relief.                       The

24   problem is, it says you can be heard.                      It doesn't say

25   who will tell you or who will tell the school district

 1   to write a check.

 2               MR. SALMONS:          Right.        But keep in mind that

 3   the judicial review process that the statute provides --

 4   and this is at page 17 of the addendum.                  The right to

 5   file a Federal action is limited to those matters that

 6   are raised in the due process complaint notice filed

 7   before the hearing officer.             This is an exhaustion

 8   requirement.

 9               JUSTICE SOUTER:             But can you raise the --

10   you can raise the claim to eligibility to a -- a private

11   education here without the hearing officer having the

12   authority to order the school district to provide it.

13               MR. SALMONS:          That has not been the

14   interpretation of this Act, Your Honor, and I would

15   refer the Court to 34 CFR 300.148(b), which is a

16   regulation that states that hearing officers can award

17   reimbursement and that has been around since the mid-

18   1980s.   My point is that is -- the Congress enacted

19   these amendments in 1997 against a subtle understanding

20   of how this Act works.        And it's always been understood

21   that hearing officers can award reimbursement.                 There

22   was no need to provide in the '97 amendments that

23   hearing officers can also award relief.

24               And again because it's an -- it's an

25   exhaustion requirement and the judicial review provision

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   only relates to the things that you have raised before

 2   the hearing officer, it makes no sense to say a court

 3   can award reimbursement but you can't get reimbursement

 4   from the hearing officer.         That's the subject of the

 5   review of the Federal court action.

 6              JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, but it might make

 7   senses to say that the hearing officer can determine

 8   eligibility; it is then up to the school to pay it; and

 9   if the school does not pay it, then you have got to go

10   into court and get an award.

11              MR. SALMONS:         In fact, Your Honor, the

12   hearing officers have always been permitted to award

13   reimbursement, as occurred in this case, and then the

14   school district can decide either to pay that or to seek

15   review if they -- if they so choose.

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:            And it might make also

17   sense to say that if the hearing officer has no

18   authority to award a certain type of relief, neither

19   does a court, under that general provision that --

20              MR. SALMONS:         But of course this Court in

21   Burlington held the court did have that authority and it

22   relied on the fact that it has always been understood

23   that hearing officers have that authority in reaching

24   that conclusion in Burlington.

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's right, but -- but


                                      42
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   with these new provisions, if the hearing officer

 2   doesn't have the authority to award the kind of relief

 3   that was awarded here, then the court wouldn't either.

 4                 MR. SALMONS:        Well, I -- with respect, I

 5   think there is nothing in the '97 amendments --

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, you agree they go, as

 7   we say, in pari passu --

 8                 MR. SALMONS:        Well, I do think that it

 9   doesn't make sense to say --

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- that -- that whatever

11   the hearing officer can do, the court can do.

12                 MR. SALMONS:        I think generally --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- and whatever he can't

14   do, the court can't do.

15                 MR. SALMONS:        I think they ought to be read

16   together, yes, Your Honor.            But I think they ought to be

17   read to provide for the authority to provide tuition

18   reimbursement.

19                 One statutory point I would like to make,

20   Your Honor, is that under Petitioner's reading of the

21   Act, if you read (C)(ii) to be -- that reference to "who

22   previously received" to be an absolute precondition,

23   then I think it's the case that (C)(i) has no meaning

24   whatsoever.    It does not work under the Act at all.

25   Whereas on our reading of the statute, (C)(ii) still


                                        43
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   does work.   It's not a precondition; it doesn't do the

 2   work that Petitioner suggests; it does a more limited --

 3   serve a more limited function, but it still serves that

 4   identifying role for the factors Congress wanted applied

 5   when it was focused on how to preserve relationships,

 6   ongoing collaborative relationships through the IEP

 7   process that warrant preservation.

 8                One other point I make, Your Honor, and

 9   Justice Scalia, you make reference to this principle of

10   equity, that you ought not be allowed to prevent

11   something from happening and then come into court and

12   claim, "Ha, ha, they didn't satisfy a condition."             And

13   that was a point that was made by Justice Cardozo in the

14   R.H. Stearns case that we rely on, where he said he who

15   prevents a thing from being done may not avail himself

16   of the nonperformance which he himself has occasioned.

17                That's precisely what happened here.            As

18   this case to this Court, it is established that is a

19   child who was entitled to receive special education

20   services back in 2001.       The only reason he did not

21   receive those services is because the district violated

22   its statutory duties --

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I thought in 2001 even

24   the parents agreed that he didn't -- that they didn't

25   want to put him in special education?

 1              MR. SALMONS:           The parents agreed, Your

 2   Honor, that he did not qualify for the learning

 3   disabilities they tested him for, but they had an

 4   obligation under the Act -- and this was found by the

 5   hearing officer and the complaint that was filed was

 6   filed within the two-year limitation to challenge that

 7   2001 determination, and that that was there, they had an

 8   obligation to test him for those other health

 9   impairments at that time.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

13                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER

14                  ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

16                    SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

17              MR. MILLER:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

18   please the Court:

19              Had Petitioner provided T.A. a special

20   education that was later determined to be inadequate,

21   there would be no question that the district court would

22   have authority and discretion to determine whether an

23   award of private school tuition reimbursement was

24   appropriate.    Petitioner's view is that because it

25   offered no special education at all, it was therefore


                                        45
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   categorically immune from such an award.                 That position

 2   is not supported by the statute and it's inconsistent

 3   with the reasonable interpretation of the Secretary of

 4   Education.

 5                There is no basis for reading the statute to

 6   create what effectively would be an incentive for

 7   districts to stonewall and to say that if they don't --

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, for 10 days,

 9   right?   Even assuming the bad faith that you are

10   ascribing to the school district, it would only work for

11   10 days, right?

12                MR. MILLER:       Well --

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And then they would

14   have -- then they would have previously received special

15   education services, and they could proceed.

16                MR. MILLER:       We were not assuming bad faith.

17   Or --

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                "Stonewall" sounds

19   to me like bad faith.

20                MR. MILLER:       Well there --

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That was the word

22   you used.

23                MR. MILLER:       I -- Congress -- there is no

24   reason to suppose that Congress wanted to create an

25   incentive or to reward districts that do do that.

 1              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But we are talking about

 2   two different things.        I think the Chief was talking

 3   about putting the child in special education, and

 4   keeping the child there for 10 days.                     You are talking

 5   about the school district that says "no special

 6   education; this child is not eligible."

 7              MR. MILLER:          That's absolutely right.              So in

 8   a case like this, there is -- there is nothing to try

 9   for 10 days because the district has found him not

10   eligible, they haven't offered any special education or

11   related services.    Now to the extent --

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, let's move to

13   the situation where they have a plan that the parents

14   regard as inadequate.

15              MR. MILLER:          In the case --

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   In that situation

17   all they would have to do is to have the child try the

18   plan for 10 days.

19              MR. MILLER:          Well if the -- to the extent

20   that there is an interest in having parents try out the

21   plan, Petitioner's reading of the statute is poorly

22   tailored to that objective, because it doesn't require

23   that they try the specific plan that's being proposed

24   for 10 days.

25              Even under Petitioner's reading the statute


                                        47

 1   simply would require that the child at some point have

 2   received some special education and related services.

 3   It wouldn't have to be under the plan that was being

 4   tried.   And --

 5               JUSTICE SOUTER:              But the odds are that it

 6   would be under the plan.           I mean, what you say is

 7   theoretically possible, but in the real world it's

 8   probably going to be under the plan, isn't it?

 9               MR. MILLER:          Well, not necessarily because

10   there's a new plan at least once a year under the

11   statute, and they are typically proposed at the end of a

12   school year for the start of the new school year.                       So

13   there wouldn't be, on Petitioner's reading, a

14   requirement that you show up for the first 10 days of

15   the new year; you would just have to give notice after

16   the IEP is proposed in May or June.                       You give your 10

17   days' notice.     You receive special education services

18   under the old plan, under the previous year.                       And under

19   -- on Petitioner's reading, the statute would be no

20   barrier to reimbursement there.

21               Now, of course, the district courts do have

22   considerable equitable discretion, and we're not

23   suggesting that reimbursement would be mandatory in that

24   case or in any case.        And --

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               And the parents -- I

 1   think you agree that the parents would have the burden

 2   of showing both that the school did not provide an

 3   adequate education, an appropriate education, and that

 4   the private school does?

 5                MR. MILLER:        That's -- that's absolutely

 6   right.   And they would also, in our view, have to show

 7   the district court that they had genuinely cooperated

 8   with the public school in making their child available

 9   for evaluation --

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Suppose we thought it were

11   sensible to add to that burden the further rule that the

12   school district is presumed to have made the correct

13   diagnosis and, if there is a plan in that kind of case,

14   that the plan was adequate, and that the parent would

15   have to show by clear and convincing evidence that this

16   is not so, rather than just inventing it and pulling it

17   out of the sky.

18                Is -- is there some authority in the statute

19   that would give us warrant to do that?                   Or is there

20   some -- any cases that would give us warrant to -- to

21   establish a presumption of that kind in order to

22   recognize the long-standing expertise of the States in

23   this matter and in order to allow section (ii) to do

24   some work?

25                MR. MILLER:        Well, a clear and convincing

 1   evidence presumption would be difficult to reconcile, I

 2   think, with 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii), which says that the

 3   district court decision should be based on the

 4   preponderance of the evidence, but it is certainly

 5   within the district court's discretion and it would be

 6   within this Court's discretion, I think, to prescribe

 7   principles to guide the exercise of the district courts'

 8   equitable discretion --

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The district court

10   doesn't get into the act until the hearing officer is

11   done.

12               MR. MILLER:        Right.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And so it would be odd to

14   have a presumption applicable in court that isn't also

15   applicable to the hearing officer, because the court is

16   reviewing a decision by the hearing officer.

17               MR. MILLER:        Right.         Well, the -- the

18   standard in both stages of the proceeding is by a

19   preponderance of the evidence, and the parents, as the

20   party challenging what the school has done, have the

21   burden.   But at both stages, it would be appropriate to

22   consider whether they were genuinely seeking a free

23   appropriate public education, and I think it would be

24   entirely appropriate and consistent with the

25   preponderance standard for the hearing officer or the

 1   court to take due account of the fact that the school

 2   district has some expertise and to give some deference

 3   to what it has proposed.

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:             (i)(2)(B)(iii) --

 5              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Is the department --

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:             (i)(2)(B)(iii)?

 7              MR. MILLER:         Oh, it's (i)(2)(B) -- it's been

 8   amended in 2004.   There's no change in the language,

 9   but it's now --

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:             It's now (C)?

11              MR. MILLER:         (C).

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:             (C)(iii).

13              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Does the -- does the

14   department have a regulation that says the hearing

15   officer may order the private school -- the parents to

16   be reimbursed for private school tuition?               Because it's

17   not in the statute.

18              MR. MILLER:         34 C.F.R. 300.148(b) says that

19   disagreements between the parents and a public agency

20   regarding the availability of a program appropriate for

21   the child and the question of financial reimbursement

22   are subject to the due process hearing procedures.               So

23   yes, that regulation gives hearing officers the

24   authority to award reimbursement, as indeed the hearing

25   officer had done Burlington.            Burlington was the case


                                       51

 1   where the reimbursement award was made in the first

 2   instance by a hearing officer, and, of course, the Court

 3   held that that was appropriate.               And --

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel, this is

 5   Spending Clause legislation.            Do you have any rough idea

 6   of how much of the obligation incurred by the States is

 7   reimbursed by the Federal Government?                   What percentage?

 8               MR. MILLER:        I think of the additional costs

 9   of treating special education children, above those of

10   educating other children, I think approximately

11   10 percent, 10 to 12 percent, is reimbursed by the

12   Federal Government.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So if this

14   interpretation vastly expands the liability of school

15   districts in that particular area, isn't that a

16   consideration we should consider?                Since they accept --

17   the States accept 10 percent of the funds to incur these

18   obligations and then you are expanding the obligation in

19   a way that we may at least find is ambiguous, isn't that

20   a pertinent factor?

21               MR. MILLER:        There's no basis for supposing

22   that there would be a vast expansion of liability, and

23   there are some statistics on this in the National

24   Disability Rights Network's amicus brief at pages 13 and

25   14.   Of about 6 million children in the United States

 1   who are receiving special education, barely 1 percent of

 2   those are in private placements, and the vast majority

 3   of those are agreed-upon placements between school

 4   districts and the parents.           So this sort of unilateral

 5   private placement is quite rare, because, first, the

 6   parents do it at their own financial risk, and so

 7   there's a real barrier to parents doing it, because they

 8   have to be pretty sure that they are right and that they

 9   are going to be able to meet the demanding standards of

10   -- satisfying the district court that an award of

11   tuition reimbursement is appropriate, and if they don't

12   do that --

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           If the --

14                MR. MILLER:       -- they're going to be --

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           If the parents are

16   entitled and the child is entitled to the special

17   education and the school doesn't give it, and there are

18   two schools -- private schools in the community, A and

19   B.   A charges, what is it, $5,200 a month tuition; the

20   other is considerably less.            And they both have adequate

21   programs for the child.        Is the hearing examiner

22   entitled to reimburse only for the lower amount, or is

23   the parent entitled to send the child to the -- to the

24   more expensive school?

25                MR. MILLER:       No.      What this Court said in

 1   Carter is that it's appropriate for the hearing officer

 2   to take into account whether the cost of the private

 3   education was unreasonable.           So in a situation where you

 4   had two basically equivalent schools, that would

 5   certainly be an appropriate thing for the hearing

 6   officer to take into account in limiting or denying

 7   reimbursement.

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Or there could be, I

 9   suppose, an order that any tuition in excess of a

10   certain amount would be the parents' responsibility.

11              MR. MILLER:        That's -- that's right.       That

12   would be within the discretion of the hearing officer.

13              In a case like this, where you have a

14   residential placement and the residential component of

15   it -- there has been no suggestion that that was -- had

16   some educational purpose or was a part of providing an

17   appropriate education, it would also be appropriate for

18   the court to decide to disaggregate that and say we are

19   only paying -- the school district only has to pay for

20   the educational component.

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Let me be clear.   Am I

22   correct that under -- under the theory of the statute

23   that you are supporting, it would be possible for a

24   parent, without first consulting with the school at all,

25   to put the child in a private school and then later to

 1   request public school services, and when it is -- when

 2   they are denied or they are inadequate, all that public

 3   school -- private school tuition would be reimbursable?

 4              MR. MILLER:           There would be no categorical

 5   bar in the statute in that situation, but a district

 6   court confronted with those facts would most likely

 7   conclude that the parents had not genuinely sought a

 8   free appropriate public education and hadn't

 9   appropriately cooperated with the school district.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

14           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARY S. FEINERMAN

15                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16              MR. FEINERMAN:              Thank you,

17   Mr. Chief Justice.

18              I'd like to address the two provisions that

19   we have heard today for the first time.                   T.A. and the

20   government are resting their argument that tuition

21   reimbursement is permitted in the unilateral placement

22   context to students who had not previous received.                   The

23   regulation 300.148 -- counsel referenced subsection (b),

24   Disagreements about FAPE, and it does say that the

25   hearing officer can consider the question of financial


                                         55

 1   reimbursement.   And the very next subsection, (c), is

 2   entitled Reimbursement for Private School Placement, and

 3   that provision speaks only to students who previously

 4   received special education and related services under

 5   the authority of a public agency.

 6              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Where are you reading

 7   this?

 8              MR. FEINERMAN:            This isn't -- this

 9   regulation was brought up at argument.                  It's not in any

10   of the addendums, but I -- I would direct the Court's

11   attention to subsection (c) of 300.148.

12              In terms of the -- the provision that T.A.'s

13   lawyer addressed, 1415(b)(6), no argument -- there's no

14   argument in the briefs that 1415(b)(6) gives hearing

15   officers the authority to grant tuition reimbursement in

16   these circumstances.      The Department of Education did

17   not rely on this provision when articulating its

18   commentary that tuition reimbursement is still permitted

19   under these circumstances.           The Secretary of Education

20   relied upon the 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) provision.                 That of

21   course, refers only to courts.

22              And even if the argument were properly

23   presented, which it isn't, it would be subject to the

24   same dynamic that's in play with respect to

25   1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).      You have a very general provision

 1   giving hearing officers authority.                  Congress got

 2   specific in 1997.    There's a heading -- enacted a

 3   provision under the heading Reimbursement for Private

 4   School Placement.    I think that clearly indicates that's

 5   where Congress intended to repose the authority of

 6   hearing officers to order tuition reimbursement to

 7   unilaterally placed children.

 8                 We also have the -- and -- and it just

 9   doesn't work to say that 1415(i)(2)(B)(iii) somehow

10   gives hearing officers authority.                 Even if it were

11   interpreted that way prior to 1997, in 1997 Congress

12   enacted the statute that expressly referenced hearing

13   officers and courts, and allowed both of them to give

14   tuition reimbursement.        So even if 1415 were interpreted

15   prior to '97 -- incorrectly, we would submit -- to give

16   hearing officers that authority, after 1997 where

17   Congress actually went to the trouble of saying hearing

18   officers and courts can give tuition reimbursement in

19   certain circumstances, that -- that prior

20   interpretation, whatever its merits back then, no longer

21   is valid --

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, what happens -- what

23   happens if the hearing officer can't, but why couldn't

24   the court?    I mean, they see an unusual situation.                The

25   parents were justified, and it doesn't say there are no

 1   circumstances other than -- where you couldn't -- where

 2   they may not pay.     So the judge says, I think this is a

 3   situation where it is -- it is equitable to pay the --

 4   the reimbursement.

 5              MR. FEINERMAN:              That's correct, but --

 6              JUSTICE BREYER:               Why not?         What says you

 7   can't do that, other than your basic point about the

 8   "may require"?

 9              MR. FEINERMAN:              The Spending Clause, the

10   headings that Congress used --

11              JUSTICE BREYER:               All right.        But anyway, the

12   regs don't say anything about that.

13              MR. FEINERMAN:              At any rate -- and it's a

14   system that doesn't make any sense, because for children

15   who did previously receive and go to the hearing officer

16   to challenge either an eligibility determination or an

17   improper IEP, the hearing officer could award tuition

18   reimbursement, but for children who didn't previously

19   receive and then they went in front of the hearing

20   officer, they would have to -- I don't know what the

21   word would be -- appeal to the district court in order

22   to get tuition reimbursement.               Is it conceivable that

23   that that could be the system --

24              JUSTICE BREYER:               You're saying the statute

25   says the hearing officer can't do that no matter what.

 1   That's a separate argument.

 2              MR. FEINERMAN:           That's correct, but I'm

 3   saying if --

 4              JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.

 5              MR. FEINERMAN:           If T.A. is right, that would
