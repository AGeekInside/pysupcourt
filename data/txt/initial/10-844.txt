 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Case 10-844, Caraco Pharmaceutical

 5   Laboratories v. Novo Nordisk.

 6               Mr. Hurst.

 7                ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. HURST

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9               MR. HURST:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               Since 1984, whenever an -- a drug has

12   multiple FDA-approved uses, there has been a statutory

13   path for generic drugs to reach the market if there are

14   specific uses not covered by a patent.               Here, there is

15   no dispute that Novo's patent does not claim the use of

16   repaglinide when used alone, and that is "an approved

17   method" of using the drug.         Even though that matches the

18   statutory language exactly, Novo is arguing that in this

19   case, our counterclaim to correct their blocking use

20   code is thwarted by the fact that their patent does

21   claim a different approved use --

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is the first -- is the

23   first approved, the drug itself -- they're not

24   claiming that, because that patent has expired, isn't

25   it?

                                                                          4
 1                 MR. HURST:    That patent has long expired,

 2   and they also had a patent using -- for the use of the

 3   drug to treat diabetes through any method, and that

 4   patent has long expired.       The only patent that's left

 5   that Novo has is specifically limited to the use of

 6   repaglinide in combination with metformin to treat

 7   diabetes.    My client, Caraco, is attempting to get on

 8   the market for admittedly noninfringing uses, which

 9   occupy about 70 percent of the marketplace out there.

10                JUSTICE ALITO:        Suppose I said your brief

11   does not cite a Supreme Court decision.            Would that be a

12   correct statement?

13                MR. HURST:     I believe that -- that -- if the

14   -- it depends on the context of the sentence, but I

15   think that would be a correct statement if I understand

16   the way you are asking the question.

17                You are asking the question in a way that

18   suggests to me, by context, you're asking whether I cite

19   any Supreme Court precedent.             But the context here is a

20   little bit different, because the context here in the

21   counterclaim is a situation where drugs routinely have

22   multiple and different, distinct uses.            And in that

23   context --

24                JUSTICE ALITO:        Well, we have hundreds and

25   hundreds, probably thousands, of opinions, and you


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                            5
 1   didn't cite -- there were many of them that you didn't

 2   cite.   You cited quite a few, but you didn't cite all of

 3   them.

 4                MR. HURST:    That's true.          That's true.    But

 5   when a judge -- when a judge says to me that, you know,

 6   you're going to lose this case because you did not cite

 7   an applicable precedent, I'm going to hear that to mean

 8   I didn't cite a specific particular case.             There are

 9   many ways to use the word "an" after the word "not"

10   where it clearly does not mean "any."            For instance:

11   "The prosecutor failed to get a conviction because she

12   did not prove an element of the offense."            "I got lost

13   on my way to the party because I failed to make a turn."

14   "My cake fell because I did not include an ingredient."

15   So, the context speaks volumes in terms of whether or

16   not "an" means "any" in any particular context.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:        But -- but the context

18   here, one would expect it to say, if it meant what you

19   say it meant a -- did not claim a use asserted by the

20   generic.

21               MR. HURST:     Justice Scalia, there --

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Not just "did not claim a

23   use."   And we have to fill in, that is "the use asserted

24   by the generic."   That's a strange thing to fill in.

25               MR. HURST:     Well, Justice Scalia, I am not

                                                                           6
 1   quibbling with the fact that this could -- the statute

 2   could have been written more elegantly.            My guess is

 3   that almost every statute this Court is asked to

 4   construe, there are different ways that it could have

 5   been written to resolve the issue in question.

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:        It's not a matter of

 7   elegance.    It's a matter of how I would have expected it

 8   to be -- to be framed if it meant what you -- what you

 9   say it means.   It's so easy to say "does not claim the

10   use asserted by the generic."            My goodness.   And that's

11   what you say it means.

12                MR. HURST:     If -- and look at the context.

13   The statute does not ask the brand company to identify

14   an approved use that the patent does claim.             It puts the

15   burden on the ANDA applicant to come into court, file a

16   counterclaim, and identify an approved use that the

17   patent does not claim.      We've carried that burden twice

18   over.   There are two approved uses that the patent does

19   not claim.   Context --

20                JUSTICE ALITO:        As I understand your

21   argument, you satisfy -- the ground for seeking deletion

22   or correction was satisfied even before Novo wrote the

23   new use code that you claim is overly broad.            When the

24   use code said simply the use of repaglinide with

25   metformin, the ground for seeking deletion or correction

                                                                             7
 1   was satisfied, wasn't it?

 2                  MR. HURST:    Well, I mean -- the truth is the

 3   patent -- yes, the answer to that question is yes.                But

 4   I would have no reason to go into court to fix a use

 5   code that's not blocking me.

 6                  JUSTICE ALITO:       No, but that's another --

 7   so, there are two oddities in the way you read the

 8   statute.     And it may be Congress just did a bad job of

 9   drafting.     But the first is the one we were discussing

10   before, and that's the second one, that -- your -- your

11   beef really is not that the patent does not include

12   every use.    Your beef is that the source -- the use code

13   is too broad.    And yet, that is not the ground that the

14   statute sets out for seeking deletion or correction.

15                 MR. HURST:     I believe it does, because it

16   talks about -- there's two remedies:               the deletion

17   remedy and the correction remedy.             As we read the

18   statute, we preserve distinct roles for the correction

19   remedy and the deletion remedy.            As Novo reads this

20   statute, they all but acknowledge that they are writing

21   the word "correct" out of the statute, because there is

22   no meaningful role for the correction remedy as Novo is

23   reading this statute.

24                 They call the correction remedy a -- a relic

25   of a failed bill.    And, in fact, they haven't identified

                                                                      8
 1   any meaningful role for the word "correct" in the

 2   statute as they read this statute.

 3                Remember, what they say is there's two

 4   pieces of information that qualify as patent

 5   information:    expiration dates and patent numbers.

 6   Nothing else.    The correction remedy can never reach an

 7   expiration date under any circumstances.

 8                I haven't heard Novo to argue otherwise.

 9   What they're saying is if a patent is correctly listed

10   in the Orange Book, this counterclaim is unavailable.

11   So, what does that mean?        If the brand company

12   incorrectly lists the expiration date for a properly

13   listed patent as 2150, this counterclaim is not

14   available to correct the expiration date.

15               So, that leaves only one single piece of

16   information that could possibly be addressed by the

17   correction remedy.     And what does Novo say?       Patent

18   numbers.   They say, well, the correction remedy could be

19   available for fixing typos in a patent.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Yes, well, it's not much,

21   but it's something.

22               (Laughter.)

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:          And -- and the way you're

24   talking, you seem to assume that all the problems in the

25   world have to be addressed by this statute.          Would you

 1   have no remedy by -- by suing the FCC for accepting uses

 2   that -- that it should not have accepted?

 3               MR. HURST:       I -- whether I do have

 4   alternative remedies doesn't answer the question about

 5   whether I have a remedy in -- for this particular

 6   counterclaim.

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:          That's true, but it -- but

 8   if you have alternative remedies, I am not terribly

 9   shocked by the fact that you don't have a remedy under

10   this statute.

11               MR. HURST:       I don't have any good remedies

12   under this statute.      I could not, Justice Scalia, sue

13   the FDA for accepting the use code, at least based on

14   existing law, because the FDA's position is that their

15   role with respect to patents is purely ministerial.

16   That has been upheld for about a decade now, including

17   multiple courts of appeals, the Federal Circuit, and the

18   D.C. Circuit.   So, my ability to sue the FDA for

19   accepting Novo's incorrect use code is not really a true

20   alternative remedy.

21               The remedy that Congress gave me, that I --

22   that we think Congress gave us is an enormously

23   efficient remedy.   We filed our counterclaim, and within

24   3-1/2 months, we got an injunction asking Novo to

25   correct its use code.

 1                JUSTICE ALITO:        Suppose you didn't

 2   file the -- suppose the counterclaim provision wasn't

 3   available, and Novo -- you filed a paragraph IV

 4   certification, and Novo sues you for infringement.

 5   Could you not defend the infringement action on the

 6   ground that your use of the -- of the drug was not in --

 7   did not infringe their patent?

 8                MR. HURST:     I could not.

 9                JUSTICE ALITO:        Why -- why is that?

10               MR. HURST:      Because there's two paths that

11   are available under the FDA to get -- for a generic to

12   get approval.    One is section (viii), and if I proceed

13   under section (viii), I can carve out the patented use

14   from my label.   If -- and Your Honor's question assumed

15   I went through the other route, paragraph IV.             I am

16   not -- FDA does not allow you to carve out any portion

17   of your label if you are proceeding under paragraph IV.

18   So, the circumstance that you just described, I would --

19   I would be infringing under paragraph IV, and the only

20   way for me to get on the market is to invalidate the

21   patent.

22               Now, think about what that means.             Novo is

23   forcing us, essentially, to infringe.             We don't want to

24   infringe.   We are trying to carve out our label so that

25   we can proceed under section (viii).              They have blocked

 1   our ability to use section (viii).               So, they force us

 2   into paragraph IV, force us to infringe.               And what

 3   happens if we fail to invalidate the patent?               We are

 4   kept off the market until 2018 for admittedly

 5   noninfringing uses of the drug.           There are two

 6   admittedly noninfringing uses of the drug.               That's where

 7   we want -- that's what we want to use to get to the

 8   market.

 9                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Mr. Hurst, would you agree

10   that Congress did not contemplate this situation?                 As I

11   understand it, it wasn't until 2003 that the FDA allowed

12   companies to write their own use codes, and that's what

13   creates this problem.     So, would you agree that the

14   Congress that passed this Act really couldn't have had

15   this situation in mind?

16               MR. HURST:     I wouldn't agree, because look

17   at the timing.   The FDA issued the regulation entitled

18   "Submission of Patent" -- "Submission of Patent

19   Information" in June of 2003.           Congress enacted this

20   counterclaim using the same language in December of

21   2003.   The submission of patent information regulation

22   by the FDA with respect to method-of-use patents, and

23   that's what we're talking about here, is all about

24   ensuring that the use code itself is accurate and

25   correct and matches up with the patent.

 1                So, I think this is something that Congress

 2   clearly had in mind, because they -- you have to assume

 3   that they knew about the regulation enacted by the

 4   agency that was administering this statute, issued just

 5   months before they enacted the counterclaim using the

 6   same -- the same --

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But what about the fact

 8   that the FDA, and not the patent holders, were drafting

 9   the use codes at the time this legislation passed?

10               MR. HURST:       Justice Ginsburg, that is

11   incorrect; your timing is incorrect.               Prior to June of

12   2003, the FDA was authoring the use codes based on

13   information from the brand companies; but after June of

14   2003, the brand companies were authoring the use codes,

15   and the statute was enacted after June of 2003.

16               JUSTICE KAGAN:          So, you're suggesting the --

17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              When the FDA was writing

18   the codes, was -- was it writing about the scope of the

19   patent or was it writing about labeling?

20               MR. HURST:       It was writing about the scope

21   of the patent.   The use codes have always been about the

22   scope of the method-of-use patent; it has never been

23   about anything other than the scope of the method-of-use

24   patents.   The only --

25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I mean, we can ask the

 1   Government, but why did it think that it lacked the

 2   expertise, because it didn't want to opine under the

 3   patent laws?

 4               MR. HURST:     I think the short answer is yes;

 5   the FDA has always done their very best to not get

 6   anywhere near the patents.        They don't do patents,

 7   essentially.   And so, they decided -- and there was a --

 8   there was a notice and rule -- I mean -- I'm sorry -- a

 9   notice-and-comment rulemaking about this, and eventually

10   decided to make -- to have the brands submit the use

11   codes.

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Would it suffice in the

13   description just to give a cross-reference to the

14   patent, to say the use of this drug is described in

15   patent claim number 43?

16               MR. HURST:     It -- it would not be

17   sufficient, because the way -- the whole purpose of the

18   use code is to administer section (viii).              So, what the

19   FDA does is they take the use code, and they match it up

20   with the label, and then the generic gets to carve out

21   whatever the brand company says is patented via the use

22   code.

23               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Counsel --

24               MR. HURST:     But if I could get back to a

25   question, Justice Scalia, that you asked about the --

 1   whether correcting typos in patent numbers is a real

 2   role for the correction remedy.            I would submit it is

 3   not.     And for all practical purposes, Novo is asking you

 4   to eliminate the correction remedy from this statute,

 5   and here's why.    Think about what they're saying.

 6                 Novo is saying that the brand company

 7   decides to put the patent in the Orange Book, but

 8   somebody transposes two numbers.             There's a -- there's a

 9   mistake that's made.      What does that mean in concrete

10   terms?    Well, if you transpose the two numbers, the odds

11   are astronomically high that the brand company is citing

12   a patent that they don't own and that certainly doesn't

13   relate to the drug in question.            It might relate to tire

14   treads; who knows?

15                 But you do not -- Congress did not enact a

16   Federal cause of action to address typos in patents.

17   The brand company has every incentive in the world --

18   and the generic company has no incentive to file a

19   lawsuit to fix that.      But the brand company has every

20   incentive in the world to ensure that they don't make

21   such mistakes, because there is a statutory benefit to

22   properly listing patents.

23                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Counsel --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, it's -- it's -- the

25   issue is not whether Congress enacted it only for that.

 1   The issue is whether Congress enacted it for that in

 2   addition to a lot of other stuff.

 3                 MR. HURST:    But --

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       I mean, it's a very small

 5   detail, you know -- "correct."           You're saying this one

 6   word, "correct," in this immense bill with all sorts of

 7   causes of actions and other provisions here and there --

 8   that one word has this -- this minimal meaning.

 9                 MR. HURST:    You have --

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       It's conceivable.

11                 MR. HURST:    You have to give it some

12   meaning.   You have to give it some practical meaning.

13   And right now -- and it's only -- the counterclaim has

14   only two remedies.    So, Novo is arguing that the first

15   of the two remedies is practically nonexistent.

16                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Counsel --

17                 MR. HURST:    There is no role -- I'm sorry.

19   answering.

20                 MR. HURST:    There is -- there is no role

21   whatsoever.   It is surplusage by any definition to -- to

22   say that "correct" -- "correct" is surplusage by any

23   meaningful definition.      If you even put a dose of

24   realism to this, "correct" has no role under Novo's

25   reading, while we preserve distinct roles for both the

 8               ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH

 9                  ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

10         AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

11                MR. HORWICH:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

12   please the Court:

13                I'd like to pick up with Justice Kennedy's

14   question about FDA and writing use codes.               The first

15   thing I'd point out is that before 2003, although FDA

16   wrote the actual text that went in the Orange Book, it

17   was relying on information submitted on a sort of

18   free-form declaration by the -- by the brand.               So, the

19   brand was still kind of -- excuse me -- calling the

20   shots in that -- in that respect.

21                But the -- but the more important point is

22   that FDA doesn't have the resources or expertise or --

23   and to engage in the substantive patent evaluations

24   that, that would be required under a theory where you

25   would go sue the FDA if you had a problem with this.

 1   But more to the point --

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Mr. Horwich, do we -- do

 3   we know what FDA's position is in this case?              Is the

 4   position you're presenting the position of the FDA?

 5                 MR. HORWICH:     We -- yes.         We represent the

 6   United States here; and so, we -- we speak -- we speak

 7   for FDA and the other agencies of the government who are

 8   very concerned here about the competition law effects of

 9   this.   I mean, that's -- that's in some ways the bigger

10   story here.

11                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, Mr. Horwich, what does

12   that mean exactly, that you represent?             I mean, this

13   might be a case where we would give the agency

14   deference, except the agency's name doesn't appear on

15   the brief.    So, should we give you any deference?

16                 MR. HORWICH:     Well, the -- the names on the

17   briefs I think should not be a guide to the deference

18   question.    But we're not really claiming deference in

19   the sense -- because what we're construing here, or what

20   the Court is construing here, is the counterclaim

21   provision, which is a Federal cause of action.             And so,

22   the Adams Fruit decision of this Court would say that

23   agencies don't get deference in defining the terms of a

24   Federal cause of action.

25                 And we do think that -- we do think that

                                                                           18
 1   it's important to recognize that Congress and the agency

 2   were engaged in a dialogue in 2003.                And although I

 3   wouldn't label that deference, I would -- I would

 4   probably characterize it more accurately as Congress

 5   building upon what FDA had done in constructing its

 6   patent information regulation and Congress saying we

 7   need a means to -- to protect the integrity of the

 8   system FDA has set up.

 9                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Just one more question on

10   how this works.    Why does the FDA rely on use codes in

11   the Orange Book to make the carve-outs if it doesn't do

12   anything to ensure the accuracy of the code?

13               MR. HORWICH:        Well, the statute -- well, let

14   me start with the basic that the statute envisions that

15   there will be carve-outs.         That's the whole principle

16   behind section (viii).

17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Yes.

18               MR. HORWICH:        And so, FDA says, well, we

19   need to know when a generic has made a valid carve-out.

20   And FDA says -- and FDA goes through this in the 2003

21   rulemaking -- if you read through the preamble, there's

22   more detail.    But the short of it is FDA has three

23   choices.

24               It could rely on the generics to say that

25   they've carved out, but that doesn't really work because


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                         19
 1   the generics could say something and then get on the

 2   market when they hadn't properly carved out, and that

 3   kind of defeats the whole point of Hatch-Waxman's

 4   principle of getting patent issues resolved before

 5   regulatory approval.

 6                FDA could, as the second alternative, try to

 7   evaluate patents itself.      But nowhere else in the

 8   statute is FDA given any role in the substantive

 9   evaluation of patents, and with good reason.           This Court

10   has said in its Markman decision that claim construction

11   of patents is a question of law.           The actors in our

12   system that decide what patents mean are courts and

13   ultimately this Court; it's not FDA.

14                JUSTICE ALITO:       If a patent holder --

15                MR. HORWICH:     So, the third choice --

16                JUSTICE ALITO:       If a patent holder writes a

17   use code that is ridiculously, totally, unreasonably

18   broad, is there anything that FDA can do about that?

19                MR. HORWICH:     Well, I think the problem,

20   Justice Alito, is that from FDA's point of view, it's a

21   very slippery slope, because as soon as FDA starts

22   undertaking criticism of a use code, its effective --

23   the only basis for criticizing it is looking at the

24   patent.   Now, this may be a very easy case, but the

25   Court shouldn't be fooled that all cases are going to be


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   easy.   And if FDA here were to go in and said, well,

 2   this doesn't look like it's the same as the claim of the

 3   patent, in the next case, where it's a more difficult

 4   question, where there may be some very good faith

 5   dispute between the parties about the very meaning of

 6   the patent, FDA is going to have to make a decision one

 7   way or the other --

 8               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, what about after --

 9               MR. HORWICH:        -- and it's going to get sued.

10               JUSTICE ALITO:          What about after there has

11   been litigation and a court has decided that a use code

12   that was written in a particular case was totally

13   unreasonable?    Does that -- does that mean that the

14   writing of that was in violation of some provision of

15   the -- of the Food and Drug Act or FDA regulations and

16   that there would be some sanction against the company

17   that did that?

18               MR. HORWICH:        Well, I think the -- I think

19   the only posture in which a court would actually look at

20   a use code and evaluate it is under the counterclaim.

21   There's -- the court would not be looking at a use code

22   under traditional paragraph IV litigation --

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What about --

24               MR. HORWICH:        -- and so, the author of the

25   majority opinion below was kind of mistaken in that

 1   regard.

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What about an APA

 3   action against the FDA for relying on the use code?

 4   Couldn't that be challenged as arbitrary and capricious?

 5               MR. HORWICH:        Well, it seems to me that --

 6   that that challenge would fail because FDA has made a

 7   reasonable construction of the statute, that its role is

 8   ministerial.     It does not engage in substantive

 9   evaluation of patents because the statute doesn't

10   envision that.    So, FDA would win that suit.

11               On the other hand, if in -- going back to my

12   answer to Justice Kennedy, if we're talking about kind

13   of the second scenario where FDA does engage in

14   substantive patent review, yes, FDA could get sued.                But

15   the problem with that is that FDA is going to get sued

16   in an APA suit; the real parties in interest are going

17   to be the generic and the brand.             FDA is not going to be

18   owed any deference because it's going to turn on a

19   matter of claim construction, which is a question of

20   law.

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              So -- so, how do -- how do

22   you describe what the FDA does as your third --

23               MR. HORWICH:        So, what FDA does do is it

24   accepts the submission from the brand describing its --

25   describing its use code.        And FDA says in its 2003

 2   the administrative process to get good information in

 3   the first instance.

 4                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       And it's your understanding

 5   that you require companies to state the scope of the

 6   patent in the use code, or might you think it's

 7   perfectly permissible for a company to write its use

 8   code in terms of indications?

 9                  MR. HORWICH:     It's certainly possible in a

10   particular case that the indications will be

11   appropriate.    This is -- what we are asking for in the

12   use code is something that's good enough to do the job

13   that the use code is intended for, which is to inform

14   FDA --

 2   controls is the patent.

 3                MR. HORWICH:     Well, that is true that FDA

 4   said that parties should, of course, look at the patent.

 5   But what FDA said in the 2003 rulemaking is that it

 6   would rely on the use code.

11                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- just on a practical

12   basis -- I understand that the Petitioner has filed an

13   amended label in 2010.     I presume that that amended

14   label copies the current label with the exception of

15   substituting the manufacturer.

16                MR. HORWICH:     The -- the labeling -- I can't

17   speak to what the labeling in the application is right

18   now, because it's confidential.

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         But let's assume that's

20   what --

21                MR. HORWICH:     But if we assume for the sake

22   of argument that it's the same, yes.

23                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Now, it claims that when

24   the paragraph IV -- the paragraph IV action is started

25   and it's sued for infringement, that it's automatically

 3   fact --

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- because --

 5                MR. HORWICH:     In fact, Caraco has stipulated

 6   to that.   That's at joint appendix 177 --

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         All right.      Could you

 8   explain to me --

 9                MR. HORWICH:     Because it includes the

10   metformin use.

11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Could you explain to me

12   why?   Is merely the use of a label that's identical

13   infringement or is it an infringement of the underlying

14   patent?

15               MR. HORWICH:      It would be inducement of

16   infringement to sell a product with labeling that

17   suggests that the product be used for a patented method

18   of use.

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Okay.      So, tell us how a

20   court gets out of the quandary of there being a claim

21   that is stipulated to -- I've infringed -- and then how

22   does it deal with the counterclaim?              Now, the district

23   court just ignored --

24               MR. HORWICH:      Well, the --

25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          -- the act of

 1   infringement below and went straight to the

 2   counterclaim.   But I'm not quite sure how you get out of

 3   the quandary that this creates for the courts and the

 4   parties.

 5                MR. HORWICH:     The counterclaim is designed

 6   precisely to get out of the quandary, because what it

 7   says is the paragraph IV litigation here, the choice

 8   between infringement and noninfringement, is a false

 9   choice, because if the counterclaim prevails and the use

10   code changes, the paragraph IV litigation is going to go

11   away because Caraco is going to want to go proceed

12   through section (viii).      It's going to be able to carve

13   out --

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          All right.    How about --

15               MR. HORWICH:      -- and get approval that way

16   without a judgment in the paragraph IV litigation.

17               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Let's assume that Caraco

18   puts in a label like the one it wants to use under claim

19   4.   Will the FDA just kick it out?

20               MR. HORWICH:      Yes.      It's not --

21               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          It will not even --

22               MR. HORWICH:      It's not permissible.

23               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          It will not even ask for

24   a response from Novo?

25               MR. HORWICH:      FDA will not permit -- does

 1   not permit -- will not approve the application where a

 2   -- where there's carve-out labeling combined with a

 3   section -- with a paragraph IV.

 4                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         But is that before --

 5   without an infringement action by Novo?

 6                 MR. HORWICH:     I'm not -- I'm not sure of the

 7   timing.   Of course, it's possible that -- I mean, the

 8   paragraph IV litigation is somewhat in the control of

 9   the parties; so, it's not as if FDA sends out the

10   notices that could trigger the litigation.           But there --

11                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Well, if you tell me

12   that the FDA --

13                 MR. HORWICH:     There might not be a -- there

14   might be --

15                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         If you tell me the FDA

16   doesn't want to get involved in construing the patent,

17   why is it kicking out the claim for -- claim until Novo

18   does a suit on whether or not the generic is infringing

19   or not and let that issue be decided below?

20                 MR. HORWICH:     From FDA's point of view, it's

21   not a sufficient application if there's carve-out

22   labeling presented with a paragraph IV certification.

23   And I'd also say this, to take a step back:           The fact

24   that there might be conceivably alternative remedies

25   under some other construction of the operation of the

 7                 -- the situation Novo agrees is covered by

 8   the counterclaim, where the patent doesn't belong in the

 9   Orange Book at all, is one that can be remedied at some

10   -- at some expense and delay through paragraph IV

11   litigation by proving noninfringement if the patent's

17                 MR. PERRY:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

18   please the Court:

19                 I think the last half-hour has made clear

20   that what really is at issue here is a challenge to

21   FDA's administration of the Orange Book.                That is an APA

22   challenge, not this counterclaim.

23                 Justice Kennedy, you asked if when FDA was

24   writing the -- the use codes, did it describe the scope

25   of the patent?    And Mr. Hurst said yes.              That's false.

 1   The answer is no.    For example, if I could point to the

 2   joint appendix at page 522, these are some FDA-authored

 3   use codes.    Everything before U-530 is an FDA-authored

 4   use code.    U-275 --

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Oh, I'm sorry.   What

 6   page were you again?

 7                 MR. PERRY:       Page 522, Your Honor.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thanks.

 9                 MR. PERRY:       U-275, "Method of use of the

10   drug substance."    U-278, "Method of use of the

11   indication of the drug product."               U-279, "Method of use

12   of the approved product."           These were the ones that the

13   FDA wrote when it was responsible for writing use codes

14   to put the world on notice.

15                 So, U-278, method of use of an indication of

16   the drug product -- the patent relates to secondary

17   hyperparathyroidism, but you will never know that from

18   the use codes, and -- and that's when FDA was writing

19   it.

20                 In 2003, FDA decided to turn it over to the

21   industry.    And it said in this rulemaking -- you've

22   heard a little bit about the rulemaking but not what FDA

23   actually said.    It said to this:             "We believe" -- and

24   I'm quoting by the way from page 19a of the reply brief.

25   This is 68 Federal Register page 36,682.                  "We believe an

 1   approach that requires the NDA applicant or holder or

 2   patent owner to identify the approved methods of use

 3   protected by the patent is most consistent with the

 4   general balance adopted in" the Hatch-Waxman Act.                 And

 5   then the generic industry, during this very rulemaking,

 6   made all of the arguments that Mr. Hurst has made today,

 7   said we should have more of a challenge, we should have

 8   litigation and so forth.        And the FDA said no, that's

 9   not right, because that would let the generics pick it.

10                 And we said -- they said we shouldn't do

11   that.   And this is important.            This is on page 24a of

12   the reply brief.    The FDA said very clearly, "There

13   would be repeated litigation over individual patent

14   listing decisions."      That's a bad idea, the FDA said,

15   because there is no assurance that ANDAs would be

16   approved sooner or generic drugs would enter the market

17   any more rapidly.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               But the alternative

19   is that the FDA is going to have to hire an awful lot of

20   patent lawyers to review the -- the use codes and their

21   correspondence to the actual patents.

22                 MR. PERRY:     There are several alternatives,

23   Your Honor.    First, the FDA could de-link the

24   indications from use codes.          Right now the regulations

25   say that you can base your use code on the indication.

 1   Our use code is identical to our indication, applies

 2   with every regulation.

 3                 You didn't hear Mr. Horwich say that FDA

 4   thinks our use code is wrong.              FDA has accepted our use

 5   code.     Caraco filed an administrative challenge to the

 6   use code arguing that it was arbitrary and capricious.

 7   FDA rejected the administrative challenge.                 And they

 8   didn't go to the D.C. Circuit to say that was arbitrary

 9   or capricious under the APA.              I mean, that's the way

10   agency action gets challenged in the ordinary course as

11   this Court has seen many times.             Not here.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, that's the way

13   agency action gets challenged when it's substantive

14   action.    The FDA's position -- the United States'

15   position is that this is purely ministerial act.

16                 MR. PERRY:     Your Honor, they have chosen to

17   make it a ministerial act, which is not a negative, by

18   the way.    It is the Federal Drug -- Food and Drug

19   Administration.    What they do is administer this

20   program.    And they have in other areas, such as patent

21   term extensions, entered into memorandums of

22   understanding with PTO where there are patent issues so

23   that there is interagency cooperation to deal with

24   patent issues.    They could do that here, but they've

25   chosen not to and, in the exercise of their enforcement

 1   discretion, said we are going to accept the NDA

 2   applicant's submission.

 3                 And, more importantly, FDA has made the

 4   policy decision to tie the section (viii) determination

 5   to the use code.    They don't have to do that.          That's

 6   not in the statute.      They could change that by

 7   rulemaking.    And, third, on the indication, for example,

 8   Novo's use code always follows the indication.            The

 9   change in this case was because FDA changed the

10   indication.

11                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          What odds would you

12   put --

13                 MR. PERRY:     I'm sorry?

14                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          What odds would you put

15   as a betting lawyer on them winning a challenge to the

16   FDA policy decisions of what it's capable of doing and

17   not doing?

18                 MR. PERRY:     Your Honor, there have been

19   about a dozen APA challenges to various aspects of this

20   administration in the D.C. Circuit over the past 10

21   years.   The generics have won several of them including

22   most importantly the Purepac case, which we cite in our

23   brief, which is a direct challenge to FDA's refusal of a

24   section (viii) carve-out because of the use code.            And

25   the generic won that argument.            It said it was arbitrary

 1   and capricious for the agency to do what it did.                 So --

 2   look, every APA battle is an uphill battle.                 They're the

 3   plaintiff.    They have burden -- the burden of proof.                 It

 4   is an available remedy.        You couple that, Your Honors,

 5   with the --

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           What you -- what you

 7   described sounded very much like this case.                 So, if the

 8   -- what was the D.C. Circuit case?                 If -- if the D.C.

 9   Circuit said it's arbitrary and capricious not to -- to

10   just accept the -- the brand's use code --

11                 MR. PERRY:     In Purepac, Your Honor, the

12   brand changed its position but the FDA did not change

13   its position accordingly, and that was the arbitrariness

14   there.   Here, the -- the brand changed its position, and

15   the FDA went along.      So, I -- I don't think they would

16   win that case, to be clear, in our particular facts.

17   That's because Novo has done nothing wrong.                I mean,

18   you've heard about -- a lot about over breadth,

19   misleading, blah, blah, blah.             There is nothing wrong

20   with Novo's use code if the agency agrees with that.

22   minute, please, to the statute?             And if you -- it's in

24   might be missing something which you will point out to

 1   of the page, it says, as I -- if you've got it there,

 2   right?

 3               MR. PERRY:     Yes, Your Honor.

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:        Okay.         It says, "If the

 5   [NDA] holder" -- now that's -- that's Novo -- "holder of

 6   the approval" -- "the approval holder for the drug,

 7   a" -- I'm skipping words -- "a use of which is claimed

 8   by the patent" -- and that's what you are doing.               And

 9   what is that use?   Well, I look at page 12, and the use

10   is "a method for improving glycemic control in adults

11   with type 2 diabetes mellitus."

12               So, that's the use that you're -- that's the

13   use that's claimed by the patent.           If you bring "a

14   patent infringement action against the [ANDA] applicant"

15   -- that's them -- "the [ANDA] applicant may assert a

16   counterclaim" -- which they want to do -- "seeking an

17   order requiring the holder to correct...the patent

18   information on the ground that the patent does not

19   claim...an approved method of using the drug."

20               So, I look at that with those words -- I've

21   skipped words.   I look at those words, and I say that's

22   what they're saying.    They're saying the use that --

23   that your patent does not cover a portion of the set of

24   things described by your use.           And, therefore, they

25   would like to correct the description so that the

 1   description no longer covers something that you do not

 2   have -- a use that you do not have a patent on.

 3                 Now, that would seem to me to fit within

 4   those literal words.       And, of course, the purpose is

 5   what we've been arguing about.           But just looking at the

 6   literal words, why doesn't it fit?

 7                 MR. PERRY:     Justice Breyer, your question

 8   conflated, as Caraco often does, the use and the

 9   indication.    You quoted the indication, that is, a

10   method of -- of improving glycemic control.             The use is

11   repaglinide combined with metformin.              They are disclosed

12   in different parts of the label.            The indication is

13   under indications, and the use is under dosage and

14   administration.   That's the way FDA has always

15   administered this, and that's the distinction between

16   indication and method of use, which is why the

17   regulations and the form are written in the alternative.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:       In other words, you're

19   saying that the -- this -- a method for improving

20   glycemic control in adults with type II diabetes

21   mellitus is not patent information.

22                 MR. PERRY:    Your Honor, that is the

23   indication that's --

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:       I know, but are you saying

25   it is patent information?

 6                 JUSTICE KAGAN:        Was not the regulation

 7   issued under this statutory section?

 8                 MR. PERRY:     No, Your Honor.            The regulation

 9   was issued under section 701, the general rulemaking

10   authority.    They cite section 505, but there was a

11   subsequent rulemaking when Pharma, the trade association

12   for the -- for the branded industry, challenged FDA's

13   authority to require all of this information.                And in

14   2007 rulemaking that my friends on this side never cite,

15   FDA came back and explained that our -- that the patent

16   submission reg is based on section 701 to facilitate the

17   section (viii) and ANDA process, not -- not an

18   interpretation of section 505.            And there are lots and

22   the -- at the chart in the back of our red brief where

23   we tried to lay out the various provisions of the actual

24   statute, the counterclaim that the Court read and that

25   we're focused on talks about "a" use.                In the preamble,

 1   it says, "If the patentholder claims a use" --

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:          You know, I know that

 3   argument.

 4               MR. PERRY:       Right.       So --

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:          You don't need that

 6   argument.

 7               MR. PERRY:       Well, "a" use --

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:          If you're right that patent

 9   information in this particular provision does not have

10   anything to do with, or at least does not cover, the

11   words about diabetes I just read, well, then I guess

12   this section would have nothing to do with it because

13   those are the words they want corrected, aren't they?

14               MR. PERRY:       That's correct, Your Honor, but

15   there's a second --

16               JUSTICE KAGAN:          Mr. Perry, so, in your view,

17   patent information is just the patent number and the

18   expiration date, and that's all?

19               MR. PERRY:       The patent information submitted

20   under (b) and (c) of section 505, correct, Your Honor.

21               JUSTICE KAGAN:          Is that just the patent

22   number and the expiration date?

23               MR. PERRY:       That's right.         And we know that

24   because the Congress at the same time debated a -- an

25   alternative bill that was sponsored by the Democrats


                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that had lots and lots of additional patent information.

 2                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, why would anybody have

 3   created this counterclaim to fix the patent number and

 4   the expiration date when that can be done by way of a

 5   defense to a patent claim?

 6                 MR. PERRY:    Your Honor, it's important to

 7   remember the counterclaim is only a delisting provision.

 8   It was -- it is a very narrow provision.            The FTC report

 9   that's cited in the briefs identified eight cases in the

10   first 18 years of Hatch-Waxman that raised this problem

11   of improper listing, mostly due to successive 30-month

12   stays.   That was fixed in the counterclaim, and the

13   30-month stays were fixed, and there has never been a

14   case since -- since 2003, there has never been --

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          What was fixed?   I missed

16   what you said.    What was fixed in the counterclaim?

17                 MR. PERRY:    The counterclaim addressed the

18   problem of improper listing that was addressed in the

19   FTC report.   The purpose of the counterclaim, according

20   to its sponsors, according to the conference report, the

21   listing of improper patents -- that problem has gone

22   away.    There is no such problem anymore.          It has never

23   come up again.    The counterclaim was entirely successful

24   in solving the problem that Congress set out to address.

25   It had nothing to do with use codes.

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:        What do you mean by the

 2   problem of improper listing?

 3               MR. PERRY:     Your Honor, what the FTC report

 4   explained was that certain branded companies near the

 5   expiration of the listed patent would come in and file a

 6   second patent in the Orange Book, even though it was not

 7   properly listed, it didn't fit within section 505(b) in

 8   the listing requirements, solely for the purpose of

 9   getting a second 30-month stay, essentially to box out

10   the generic companies; and that that was an

11   anticompetitive action.      They recommended the

12   counterclaim to fix that.

13               And at the same time, the FTC said if

14   Congress were to enact such a counterclaim, it is

15   unclear how frequently it ever would be used.          So, this

16   was always intended to be a very narrow -- it's not a

17   fix-all remedy.

18               JUSTICE KAGAN:        And so, your argument, Mr.

19   Perry, is not just that the word "correct" does no work.

20   Your argument is that the entire provision no long does

21   any work?

22               MR. PERRY:     No, Your Honor.       My -- my

23   argument is very simple.      A delisting question -- it's

24   an on/off switch.   Either the patent is properly listed

25   in the Orange Book or it's not.          The counterclaim gives


                         Alderson Reporting Company

                                                                               40
 1   the generic a one-shot knock-out remedy.               If it's not

 2   properly delisted, it goes away, and a bunch of things

 3   follow from that.   There's no 30-month stay.                There's no

 4   paragraph IV litigation.      There's no impediment to FDA

 5   approving the ANDA, because if the patent isn't listed

 6   in the Orange Book, then a whole separate set of ANDA

 7   approval requirements kick in.          A use code is nothing

 8   like that.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But I'm still not

10   following it.   It's not listed simply because the number

11   is wrong?

12                MR. PERRY:    Your Honor, the usual case is

13   it's not listed because it doesn't fit.               The most famous

14   example, the Buspar case, they claimed a metabolite

15   rather than the drug substance, and that wasn't a proper

16   listing for that reason.

17                The correction language, which does come out

18   of the other bill, the alternative bill, and we do think

19   is an artifact, is the language we've used, is there to

20   give flexibility to courts.        If you have a situation of

21   an improperly listed patent, then a court has more

22   flexibility than simply delisting.

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              The brand

24   manufacturer has an overwhelming incentive to list the

25   correct patent, doesn't it?


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1                MR. PERRY:      Yes, Your Honor, and --

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So, why would we

 3   give a procedure to an adversary to fix the number when

 4   the brand manufacturer is going to fix it as soon as

 5   it's alerted to the problem?

 6                MR. PERRY:      Because, Your Honor, if the

 7   generic raises a counterclaim, if it's delisted, the

 8   generic gets no more 180-day marketing exclusivity stay

 9   at the end of the ANDA process.             If it's corrected to a

10   different patent number, the generic would still have

11   its 180-day exclusivity.        So, there's every incentive

12   for the generic to bring the counterclaim for a

13   correction if that's the appropriate remedy.

14                And, again, it just gives more flexibility

15   to the courts.   That is something that very much would

16   benefit the generic, and it would be an available use of

17   the word "correct."      It may be an unusual one, but it's

18   certainly available.

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I can't imagine that that

20   would really come to -- I mean, if it's a transposition

21   of numbers, that there would be -- have to be a

22   proceeding to get it changed.             I mean, the minute that

23   was noticed, I assume that the brand manufacturer would

24   change it.

25                MR. PERRY:      Your Honor, the transposition is


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

 1   not the problem.     The more frequent -- the way we think

 2   it would come up is these branded companies have large

 3   portfolios of patents.       They list many patents in the

 4   Orange Book.     You know, Novo has five or six right now.

 5   Other companies have many more, dozens and dozens.             They

 6   write these use codes, and they associate with -- them

 7   with the patents.     And in the Orange Book -- by the way,

 8   this -- it's called "the Orange Book" because it's

 9   orange.    And it's thick.      It's got a lot of information

10   in it.    It has to list every single approved drug with

11   the use code.    I mean, it's just pages and pages of

12   numbers, is what's in here.

13                 It's not a transposition of numbers but,

14   rather, the -- listing one patent and improperly

15   associating it with a drug.          That could be corrected

16   through this counterclaim.          But, again, that's worlds

17   away from this use code challenge, which is really what

18   Caraco wants to bring, something that wasn't on

19   Congress's radar screen because FDA wrote the use codes

20   at that point.

21                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Counsel, let's -- let's

22   assume -- because I now take from your earlier

23   conversation with Justice Breyer that you're saying the

24   use code here is absolutely right, because the only use

25   that we claimed was the combination use of the drug,


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                     43
 1   your drug, with the metformin -- that the only thing

 2   that's wrong here is the indication that the FDA has

 3   required.   So, that's not even wrong because you had no

 4   choice about that; is that correct?

 5                MR. PERRY:    That -- the indication is

 6   correct.

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Tell me -- what this

 8   means practically, I believe, is that until your patent

 9   expires, no generic can come in with a use that's

10   different than yours because they're going to be boxed

11   out by this indication, this overbroad indication.         Do

12   you actually think that that's what Congress intended?

13   I thought, with claim IV and section (viii), that what

14   Congress intended was to ensure that drugs got onto the

15   market as quickly as possible.

16               MR. PERRY:     Your Honor, that argument was

17   made to FDA by the generic industry in the 1994

18   rulemaking, the first time this issue came up, and they

19   said you should not allow use codes to be based on

20   indications; you should instead require a description of

21   the patented method of use.        You heard Mr. Hurst say

22   that again this morning.      Here's what FDA said in

23   response.   It's page -- 59 Federal Register page 50,346,

24   quote:   "For a use patent, FDA includes in the Orange

25   Book a code identifying the indication covered by the


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                          44
 1   patent."   We decline to expand the Orange Book to

 2   include patent descriptions.            And then it went on to

 3   explain that persons interested in patent descriptions

 4   should consult the Official Gazette for Patents.

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:       Yes, but what it also says

 6   is this -- and that's what I want to go back to this

 7   literal statutory argument.        We took the words --

 8   because this is what you can correct.            What you can

 9   correct, the statute says, is you can correct "patent

10   information submitted by the holder under subsection (b)

11   or (c)."   So, we look at (b), and what (b) says is (b)

12   tells us that you're supposed to submit, in respect to

13   where you claim the use of a drug, the patent number and

14   the expiration date.    So, so far, that seems to support

15   you.

16                But then we look at the regulations which

17   the FDA promulgated, I take it promulgated in respect to

18   (b) and (c), particularly the sentence I read or maybe

19   some similar sentence.     And it tells you that you have

20   to provide the description of the patented method of use

21   as required for publication.            So, now I go back and look

22   to what you did provide.      And what you did provide was

23   you provided -- you said that what we do, we have a

24   method for improving glycemic control in adults with

25   type 2 diabetes mellitus.

 1                That seems to fit directly under (3) of the

 2   FDA's requirement, and that FDA requirement was an

 3   expansion of (b).   And, therefore, it sounds to me as if

 4   when they say "correct," "correct the patent

 5   information," it includes the sentence that you put

 6   there that they'd like to see corrected.             Now, what's

 7   wrong with that?

 8                MR. PERRY:    Justice Breyer, first, the

 9   regulation is not an interpretation of 505(b).              It's an

10   implementation of 701.

11               Second and more substantively, however, the

12   form -- you quoted accurately from Box 4.2b of the form.

13   There is also Box 4.2a of the form, which includes the

14   description of the method of use tied to the label,

15   which is required by subsection (P) of the regulation

16   that you were just quoting to me.           And that part of the

17   form -- Novo very carefully describes claim 4 of the

18   patent and ties it to the dosage and administration and

19   clinical pharmacology sections of the patent and calls

20   out by reference combination trials.             The only

21   combination trial in the label is the

22   metformin-repaglinide combination.

23               And in FDA speak, that is a sufficiently --

24   because these forms -- by the way, you've got them in

25   here.   They're these little tiny boxes.            You can't put

                                                                           46
 1   very much information in there.             That is described in

 2   there.    It is not that every piece of information

 3   required by the regulation -- the regulation has 19

 4   lettered questions, of which several have subparts; so,

 5   it's 26 separate pieces of information.             They're not all

 6   provided in one box, box 4.2b.             There's actually a whole

 7   form.    It's four pages long.           We filled it all out.

 8                And there's an important point, Justice

 9   Breyer.   This is a summary judgment case.            We put in a

10   declaration from an FDA expert -- it's in the record

11   before the Court -- explaining how every single box ties

12   to every single thing in the regulation.             That's

13   absolutely undisputed on this record.             There is no

14   contrary evidence as to Novo doing anything wrong.

15                So, whether Congress -- you know -- to go

16   back to this counterclaim, we know Congress didn't

17   intend it to reach this form, because this form didn't

18   exist when Congress was debating the counterclaim.

19                JUSTICE BREYER:        The Government -- now, the

20   Government, which is representing all the government

21   agencies, whether the FDA signs it or not, tells us that

22   that language, that (b) and (c) language, about patent

23   information as interpreted by the regs does cover this

24   stuff.

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:       And this is about the most

 2   technical statute I ever read --

 3               MR. PERRY:    Your Honor --

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:       -- and -- and when I'm

 5   talking about patent information among (b) and (c), we

 6   have the Government telling us that that covers this.

 7   And why don't I just stop right there and say thank

 8   goodness I'm out of this case -- and I'm not out of it.

 9               (Laughter.)

10               MR. PERRY:    I -- I think I can do no better

11   than refer the Court again to the 2007 rulemaking,

12   Justice Scalia, 72 Federal Register page 21,268, which

13   the United States does not address and which Caraco does

14   not address, in which FDA addressed your point,

15   Justice Breyer, and explained that this information,

16   while useful -- and we have never challenged FDA's

17   authority to require the information, but it is not an

18   interpretation of that language, "patent information."

19   And this Court sees agency --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:       And even if it were, as I

21   believe the Government acknowledged, this is not a

22   situation in which we owe deference to the FDA.       The

23   issue is whether a lawsuit can be brought or not.

24               MR. PERRY:    Correct.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:       And we -- we don't decide

 1   whether we have authority to decide cases on the basis

 2   of what the agency thinks.

 3                MR. PERRY:      It is certainly --

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           What is the parade of

 5   horribles that you imagine if we were to read the

 6   counterclaim provision in the way your adversary is

 7   promoting and the Government is promoting?            What --

 8   what, presumably, in the normal case and the one that

 9   the regulations appear to expect is that the use code,

10   the indication code, everything is going to match the

11   patent.   So, in that situation, the counterclaim would

12   have no work to do.

13                So, what's the parade of horribles?

14                MR. PERRY:      Your Honor, first, the

15   counterclaim has no work to do for use codes.            There's a

16   complete disconnect there.          So --

17                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           I -- I'm asking you to

18   accept that we were to -- as an assumption only,

19   don't -- it's not intended to be a -- a ruling -- to

20   assume that we read the counterclaim in the way your

21   adversaries want us to.

22                MR. PERRY:      Yes.

23                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           What's the parade of

24   horribles?

25                MR. PERRY:      Your Honor, it is going to add

 1   complexity, expense, and so forth.                 The reason -- the

 2   problems with all civil litigation, all new causes of

 3   action -- and this was raised during the congressional

 4   debates.   When they proposed a freestanding cause of

 5   action for generics to sue over a whole bunch of things,

 6   Congress was up in arms, said no, we're not going to do

 7   that because we don't want to let private parties into

 8   the FDA process.

 9                This Court is familiar with that and the

10   parade of horribles from the Buckman case.

11               JUSTICE KAGAN:          But, Mr. Perry, there are

12   also horribles on the other side, of course.                I mean,

13   here's -- there's -- there's the statute, and it has

14   three provisions, and two of them are vague, and one of

15   them works against you.        One is "an approved method."            I

16   think, you know, you both go back and forth about it; it

17   depends on context.      One is "patent information," which,

18   you know, maybe you're right, and maybe Mr. Hurst is

19   right.   It's not really quite clear what it means to be

20   under subsection (b) or (c).              The third is "correct."

21   You basically read "correct" out of the statute.                So, at

22   best, this is an unclear statute from your point of

23   view.

24               And then there's the question of what it

25   allows you to do.   The statute read your way essentially


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                           50
 1   allows you to unilaterally expand your patent in areas

 2   in which it's quite clear that your patent ought not to

 3   go -- does not go -- but allows you to do that.             So, why

 4   should we read the statute so that it effects a purpose

 5   that's entirely antagonistic to the purpose that

 6   Congress had in passing this statute, given that the

 7   statute is at best from your perspective ambiguous?

 8               MR. PERRY:      Justice Kagan, this statute was

 9   a political compromise.       There is no debate on the

10   historical record about that.

11               And the compromise, as Mr. Hurst indicated

12   earlier, was that the statute would deal with some

13   things -- the counterclaim would deal with some things,

14   delisting -- and almost everything else would be turned

15   over to the FDA.    And FDA had this extensive rulemaking

16   that, as Mr. Hurst said, Congress was aware of.

17               And during that rulemaking, Congress did

18   several things.    First, it confirmed that the -- the

19   industry would use the use codes.            Second, that use

20   codes could be based on the indication.            So, there's no

21   extension of the patent monopoly.            It is simply

22   following FDA's instructions as to indication-based use

23   codes --

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Perry, may I ask you,

25   on that core question:      We have a patent on a drug


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                              51
 1   alone.   It expires, and then the patent holder gets a

 2   label patent that's on a method of use, and we have a

 3   generic that wants to sell the drug alone which is no

 4   longer patented.    Doesn't want to sell it in combination

 5   with anything else.      Wants to sell the drug alone.

 6               Can it do so without infringing the

 7   method-of-use patent?

 8               MR. PERRY:       No.     Your Honor, we will -- they

 9   will be sued for infringement if they ever go to market,

10   because the generic substitution laws present in 49

11   States require or allow pharmacists to substitute the

12   products whether or not the combination is on the label.

13   So, there will always be an infringement suit, which

14   gets back to Justice Kagan's question:              Why would

15   Congress have contemplated this?              They didn't

16   contemplate this.   They contemplated delisting, where

17   you take it out of the infringement suit altogether.

18               This issue -- indications, use codes,

19   section (viii) -- that is all within the agency.                And if

20   there's a litigation problem with it or challenge to it,

21   that is what the APA is for.              And, again, there have

22   been dozens of APA cases where the generics largely have

23   challenged FDA's determinations in that respect.

24               It is not what the counterclaim is for.

25   This is a very narrow provision.              What we're -- we're


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                          52
 1   parsing, by the way, two clauses in one sentence of a

 2   statute.     The 2003 amendments were 415 pages long.         The

 3   Hatch-Waxman Act is thousands of provisions long.             Very

 4   delicate balance between lots of competing interests,

 5   billions of dollars at stake.             And we have to be

 6   careful.     When Congress creates a new cause of action,

 7   the law of unintended consequences kicks in here.

 8                  We know this is not -- that this case is not

 9   what Congress intended.        The counterclaim we don't

10   believe can be read it all to it, even if it's

11   ambiguous.    Putting it in context and looking at what

12   FDA has actually said about these matters in its

13   rulemakings when faced with the same challenges by the

14   generic industry that Mr. Hurst presents here, it has

15   rejected them over and over again as a policy matter.

16                 JUSTICE ALITO:        To come back to Justice

17   Kagan's question, your position is really nothing can be

18   done by a generic that is blocked from marketing a drug

19   for a nonpatented use by a use code that -- that is --

20   that seems to cover that use.

21                 MR. PERRY:     In this case, Justice Alito,

22   there were two points:       First, FDA rejected Caraco's

23   administrative challenge to the use code.            They could

24   have taken that to the D.C. Circuit under the APA.

25   Second, they have indicated a rejection of their section


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                              53
 1   (viii) carve-out because of the use code.                They could

 2   take that to the D.C. Circuit under the APA.                That is

 3   the usual course for challenging agency action.

 4                If there are any problems here -- our

 5   position is we have complied in every respect at every

 6   moment with every bit of FDA's regulations.                And, again,

 7   that -- that's what the evidence in this record shows.

 8                So, again, I need to push back a little on

 9   extensions and monopolies and so forth, because that's

10   not what this case is about.              This case is about a

11   properly working administrative process, and should --

12   in private litigation between two parties in which the

13   FDA will not be a party, should that regulatory regime

14   be dismantled.   You know -- and we actually asked to

15   bring the FDA in, in this case.              Novo did.   And Caraco

16   resisted that.

17                You know, we think that if you're going to

18   debate the administration of the Orange Book, it should

19   be under the APA --

20                JUSTICE KAGAN:         But --

21                MR. PERRY:      -- with the FDA as a party.

22                JUSTICE KAGAN:         But here's what we know

23   about Congress's intent, and it goes back to the Mylan

24   suit:   What we know about Congress's intent is that

25   Congress wanted to give a generic manufacturer in this


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                             54
 1   situation a remedy when there was a completely

 2   irrelevant patent.     And the question is why we should

 3   consider this to be any different.                 In some respects,

 4   this makes -- this is worse from the generic

 5   manufacturer's point of view because the generic

 6   manufacturer doesn't even have a defense in an

 7   infringement suit.

 8                 MR. PERRY:     Your Honor --

 9                 JUSTICE KAGAN:        So, why should we think that

10   the Congress that really cared about the result in Mylan

11   does not care about this?

12                 MR. PERRY:     Mylan, in the response, gives

13   the generic a one-shot remedy, and you're out of it

14   altogether.    And it's a black-and-white decision.              It's

15   an on/off switch.    Either the patent is properly listed

16   or not.   A use code in the Orange Book -- there are over

17   a thousand of them.      They are shades of gray.            There

18   are -- there are very specific ones, very general ones.

19   I read to the Court some of the ones that FDA itself

20   wrote.

21                 You would get into these long involved

22   questions about compliance and so forth -- to the

23   effect, Congress wanted to make generic approvals

24   quicker in the Mylan situation.            FDA itself -- and I

25   started out my argument reading from that page, page 24a


                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   of the reply brief, where the FDA said increased

 2   litigation over use codes -- patent listings -- would

 3   not assure faster generic entry because you'd spend

 4   years and years, as we all have, litigating these very

 5   issues.

 6               So, the Congress hadn't focused on this,

 7   which it never did.      There's not one word in the

 8   thousands and thousands of pages of legislative history

 9   about use codes.   Had it focused on this, it would never

10   have gone this way because it didn't need to.                And when

11   it did have the broader bill, S. 812, it failed.

12               Thank you.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

15              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JAMES F. HURST

16                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

17               MR. HURST:       Thank you.

18               I'd like to start by asking the Court, if I

19   can, to turn to the Joint Appendix, second volume, 484.

20   And I want to address two issues:             the argument that the

21   use code is disconnected from the patent itself and it

22   -- it may relate to the indication regardless of what

23   the patent says, and whether or not the information is

24   being submitted under subsection (b) and (c).

25               If you're at 484, this form went through


                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   notice-and-comment rulemaking before the enactment of

 2   the counterclaim.     The title, "Patent Information

 3   Submitted" -- that -- that is a -- this carries out the

 4   regulation 314.53, entitled "Submission of patent

 5   information."

 6                  Now look at right below those two boxes.

 7   What does it say -- how does it say the information is

 8   being submitted?     This is a form Novo signed.          "The

 9   following is provided in accordance with section

10   505(b)" -- that's 355(b) and -- "(c) of the Federal

11   Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act."

12               Moreover, when the FDA issued this patent

13   submission regulation in its final rule, it cited 505 as

14   its legal authority.      That's at 28J of the Blue Book.

15   It cited -- and it specifically called out subsections

16   (b) and (c).

17               So, this is a regulation that was enacted

18   prior to the enactment of the counterclaim.            And now --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:          And what do you say about

20   the -- the section cited by -- by your colleague?

21               MR. HURST:       We address -- he's citing

22   something the FDA said in 2007.            And if you actually

23   read it, we cited it -- we addressed this in our briefs.

24   It actually says our -- our legal authority for doing

25   this was explained fully in 2003.             And in 2003, the FDA


                           Alderson Reporting Company

                                                                           57
 1   cites 505.

 2                 Can I turn you quickly to 487 now?              This

 3   addresses quite specifically this notion that the

 4   indication can be used even if it's disconnected from

 5   the patent.    4.2b.    Remember what the regulation says,

 6   and Justice Breyer read this before.                It's at 127a of

 7   the appendix.    But the regulation says that the brand is

 8   required to, quote, "the description of the patented

 9   method of use as required for publication."                They're

10   supposed to provide that information.

11                 And look what the actual instruction says.

12   It could not be more clear.           4.2b, bottom right side.

13   "The answer to this question" -- this is where the brand

14   supplies the use code -- "The answer to this question

15   will be what FDA uses to create a 'use code' for Orange

16   Book publication.      The use code designates a method of

17   use patent that claims the approved indication or use"

18   -- it depends on what the patent claims -- "of a drug

19   product."

20                 And then it goes on to explain why you need

21   to do that:    "Each approved use claimed by the patent

22   should be separately identified in this section and

23   contain adequate information" -- this refers to section

24   (viii) -- "adequate information to assist 505(b)(2) and

25   ANDA applicants" -- that's us -- "in determining whether


                            Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                          58
 1   a listed method of use patent claims a use for which the

 2   ANDA applicant is not seeking."            That is precisely the

 3   situation we are facing.

 4                  We have offered a construction of this

 5   statute that is fully consistent with its text, its

 6   structure, and its purpose.          And it really is the only

 7   reading of the statute that carries out congressional

 8   intent in terms of trying to prevent situations where

 9   incorrect patent information is unfairly delaying

10   generic competition.

11               Up to this point right now, Novo has still

12   failed to identify any reason why anybody in Congress

13   would want the system to work as Novo posits, where the

14   brand company gets to supply an overbroad use code,

15   without judicial review, without agency review, that

16   blocks admittedly noninfringing products from the

17   marketplace.    And I -- and I submit that given the

18   addition of the correction remedy, that would not be in

19   there if this was not designed to address use codes,

20   because that's the only thing that can be corrected

21   without remedy.

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Going back to the

23   question that I had and a more practical question --

24               MR. HURST:       Sure.

25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            As I read the record, in

 1   April of '08, the FDA rejected your section (viii)

 2   application.

 3                MR. HURST:    Yes.

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         All right?       And it asked

 5   you to submit an amended code.          Your brief says we did

 6   it in September of 2010.      Is it anywhere in the record?

 7                MR. HURST:    The question is did we --

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         That you submitted what

 9   the FDA requested for your claim 4, the amended label?

10                MR. HURST:    Oh.     Yes, we -- we did, and it's

11   in JA 777, paragraph 20.      It's a stipulated fact.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

13                MR. HURST:    Thank you, Your Honor.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              The case is

15   submitted.

16                (Whereupon, at 11:06 a.m., the case in the

17   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
