 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 We'll hear argument

 4   first today in Marrama versus Citizens Bank of

 5   Massachusetts.    Mr. Baker.

 6               ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID G. BAKER

 7                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8              MR. BAKER:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10              Section 706(a) of the Bankruptcy Code

11   provides that a debtor may convert a case under chapter

12   7 to a case under any other chapter of the Bankruptcy Code

13   at any time if the case has not been converted previously

14   from another chapter, and that any waiver of the right

15   to convert a case under the subsection is unenforceable.

16   Other subsections of section 706 give rules for the

17   Court to decide about conversion in the case where some

18   party other than the debtor requests conversion of the

19   case and also provides that the conversion must lead to

20   a chapter to which that debtor is qualified to be a

21   debtor.

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Mr. Baker, as I

23   understand it subsequent to the grant of certiorari in

24   this case, your client filed for relief under Chapter 13

25   and that relief was denied.           You're now seeking under --


                                      3

 1   your petition seeks a conversion to Chapter 13 and I

 2   guess I wonder what relief is still open to you.

 3              MR. BAKER:      In the present case or the new

 4   case?

 5              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What relief is open

 6   to you in this case?    In other words, you're trying to

 7   get a conversion to Chapter 13.            Subsequently, you've

 8   tried to apply for relief under Chapter 13 and that's

 9   been denied.   Why isn't the case moot in the sense that

10   that relief is not available to you now?

11              MR. BAKER:      The circumstances of the new

12   case are entirely different.            In fact, in that -- in the

13   present -- the new case, the court decided that he was not

14   eligible because his debt limit exceeded the statutory

15   limitations that exist section 109(e).              There is a

16   three-year time span between the two, and we believe

17   that the existing case is not moot because he still has

18   remedies that he can obtain in Chapter 13.

19              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But if he isn't

20   eligible -- the new case determined that he was not

21   eligible because his debts were too high.              He didn't

22   incur additional debts between the time of the

23   proceeding one and proceeding two?

24              MR. BAKER:      Yes, Your Honor, he did.

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Or he didn't reduce the


                                     4

 1   debt.   If we have a finding from the bankruptcy court

 2   that he is ineligible, that is number one condition

 3   to convert into Chapter 13.            If you don't meet that

 4   condition, that's the end of the matter.

 5               MR. BAKER:       I wouldn't say it would be the

 6   end of the matter in the present case because the

 7   eligibility was never questioned below, was never a

 8   factor below.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But now there has been a

10   finding, and it's an essential finding, that there be

11   eligibility.    And wouldn't the bankruptcy court's

12   findings in the later case have preclusive effect?

13               MR. BAKER:       In the prior case?        I would say

14   no, Your Honor.    First, because as I mentioned, the

15   issue of eligibility within the monetary limits was

16   never raised below.     And in fact, if you look at his

17   schedules in the supplemental joint appendix, he is

18   clearly within the statutory limits based -- just

19   looking at his schedules.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But that's a question you

21   can argue on appeal in -- from the recent decisions, but

22   for the moment you have a bankruptcy court making that

23   determination, which I think would be preclusive on

24   another bankruptcy court.

25               MR. BAKER:       The -- well, the -- the

 1   bankruptcy court made a decision in the current case,

 2   the new case, but they haven't dismissed it.             Dismissal

 3   is in fact on appeal to the District Court for the

 4   District of Massachusetts.         The reason is, in our view

 5   is that the bankruptcy court in the new case incorrectly

 6   looked back to the claims that had been filed in the prior

 7   case.

 8                 Now, it is a difficult issue in some

 9   respects because there is case law at least in

10   Massachusetts or the First Circuit that says a debtor

11   does not have standing to object to claims in a Chapter

12   7 case.     So the fact that a number of claims were

13   filed and argued doesn't relate to, in a prior case,

14   does not have a preclusive effect in the new case.

15                 Now we did, in fact, object to quite a

16   number of claims and the eligibility, and I think that

17   ultimately once the claim objections are resolved, we

18   will be within the statutory limits.

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           If the decision is

20   affirmed on appeal to the First Circuit, do you think

21   you could still argue that there's qualification for

22   Chapter 13, after the court of appeals has affirmed a

23   determination that there isn't?

24                 MR. BAKER:     I'm -- I don't quite follow the

25   question.     Would you mind restating it?

 1              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             We have now a judgment that

 2   this debtor is ineligible for Chapter 13.           If that

 3   judgment is affirmed on appeal to the court of appeals,

 4   can you nonetheless argue that somehow there is no

 5   preclusive effect?

 6              MR. BAKER:       Yes, Your Honor, because there's

 7   a three-year difference between the two and

 8   substantially different facts.           The -- we have to go

 9   back, I think, to the case that's at bar, because it is

10   those claims, the claims that were filed in the current

11   case that are the issue.       As I say, we are in the process

12   of doing objections to those claims and I think that

13   ultimately we will come within them.

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:            They're not at issue as far

15   as this mootness question goes.           I mean, you're seeking

16   to have the right to file under 13.

17              And if, in fact, there's no eligibility to

18   file under 13, you're asking for the impossible.           The

19   case is simply -- you know -- it's just air.           So I

20   guess, perhaps you rely on the fact that the case is

21   still on appeal.   Should we not take as a given that

22   there is a judgment that you don't qualify for 13, and

23   yet you're coming before us asking us to say that you

24   can apply under Chapter 13.           It doesn't make any sense.

25              MR. BAKER:       Well, I would respectfully say --

 1   suggest that it does, Your Honor, because once -- we don't

 2   really get to the eligibility question until the court

 3   below considers it in the context of the case that's at bar.

 4   We have to, as I say, we are in the process of objecting to

 5   claims and resolving them.        Now the --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, didn't you make that

 7   argument to the bankruptcy court that found that you

 8   were not eligible?

 9               MR. BAKER:      No, Your Honor, because as I

10   mentioned before, the case law in the First Circuit up

11   to this point has held that a Chapter 7 debtor does not

12   have standing to object to claims.                Now in the new case,

13   in fact, the bankruptcy court --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:           That's what I'm asking.       A

15   Chapter 7 debtor doesn't, but a Chapter 13 debtor

16   presumably does.   So didn't you make the same argument

17   to the bankruptcy court.

18               MR. BAKER:      In the old case, yes, once we

19   converted the chapter.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:           And they rejected it?

21               MR. BAKER:      No.       I beg your pardon, Your

22   Honor.   No, we did not address eligibility in the

23   present case.

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't care about the

25   present case.   I care about the Chapter 13 case in which

 1   you have been found not to qualify for Chapter 13

 2   treatment.    Didn't you make before that court the same

 3   argument you're making now that some of the debts

 4   shouldn't be counted.

 5                 MR. BAKER:    I did.

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        They rejected it, right?

 7                 MR. BAKER:    Pardon?

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        And they rejected it?

 9                 MR. BAKER:    The bankruptcy court did reject

10   it, yes.   But they rejected it because, as I say, up to

11   that point the case law had held that we did not have

12   standing to object to the claims, so we were bound by

13   what was there.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        But you said it was only a

15   Chapter 7 debtor who couldn't object.

16                 MR. BAKER:    Right.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        But you are applying under

18   Chapter 13.

19                 MR. BAKER:    Right.       What I'm trying to say

20   is in the previous Chapter 7 case we lacked standing to

21   object to those claims and that in the new Chapter 13

22   case the court took the Chapter 7 case claims and said,

23   you're bound by these in the new chapter 13 case.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Didn't you object to that

25   and say you should look at these claims afresh?

 1                MR. BAKER:     Yes.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:        And what did the court say?

 3   Did it say it had to or that it did so and still found

 4   them over the limit.

 5                MR. BAKER:     It -- the bankruptcy court in

 6   the new case said -- pardon?            The bankruptcy court in

 7   the new case said that there are circumstances under

 8   which a debtor would have standing.              This was in effect

 9   a new rule of law for that, for this district.              So

10   subsequent to that decision we did, in fact, object to

11   quite a number of claims and substantially reduced the

12   total of those claims, and I think that once --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:        What did the bankruptcy

14   court say?

15                MR. BAKER:    The bankruptcy court sustained

16   our objections to those claims and in fact reduced the

17   total substantially.

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:        I don't understand that.

19   But did it reduce it to a level that you qualified for

20   Chapter 13 treatment?

21                MR. BAKER:    We are not finished with the

22   claims objection process.       I believe that once we are --

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Of course you are.      They've

24   rendered a decision.      How could you not be finished with

25   the claims objection process if the bankruptcy court has


                                    10

 1   rendered a final decision.

 2               MR. BAKER:       Because the bankruptcy court

 3   rendered a final decision which is on appeal in the new

 4   case.   We are objecting to the Chapter 7 claims in the

 5   old case.   I apologize if this is confusing.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:           It is terribly confusing.

 7   It seems to me that the Chapter 13 bankruptcy court had

 8   the responsibility for determining whether you qualified

 9   under the, you know, under the amount of debt.

10               MR. BAKER:       And it did so by reference to

11   the claims that had been filed in the previous Chapter 7

12   case.   We can't object to claims in a Chapter 13 case

13   that haven't been filed.        So procedurally, we had to go

14   back to the Chapter 7 case and do the claims objections

15   within the context of the old Chapter 7 case.

16               Now, in the Chapter 13 case we used the --

17   the bankruptcy court used the total of those claims that

18   had been filed in the Chapter 7 case to determine

19   eligibility in the 13.

20               In doing so, the bankruptcy court basically

21   announced a new rule of law that the claims that had

22   been filed would be essentially I suppose, res judicata

23   in the subsequent case, but that in some cases a

24   Chapter 7 debtor --

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:           And you objected to that, I

 1   gather?

 2                MR. BAKER:      Sorry?

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:          You objected to that, to

 4   that ruling?

 5                MR. BAKER:      Not necessarily, because it does

 6   give you a vehicle to go back to the old Chapter 7 case

 7   and do the procedural claims objections in that case,

 8   which is what we did, and we substantially reduced the

 9   total of the claims.

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What is the status of the

11   Chapter 7 case?     I was under the impression it had been

12   dismissed and a determination of no discharge had

13   been made.

14                MR. BAKER:      A determination of no discharge

15   had been entered.     However, it was an asset case, so it

16   remains open, it remains open at this point, until the

17   Chapter 7 trustee makes a distribution to creditors or

18   files his final report with the court.             It has not been

19   dismissed.

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But there's a

21   determination that you're not entitled to a discharge?

22   That has been made.

23                MR. BAKER:      That's correct.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:          If we just could go to the

 1   where it says, the word is you "may convert," and that

 2   means you can convert no matter what?

 3              MR. BAKER:     The plain language of the

 4   statute says that, yes, Your Honor.

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:           No matter what?      Okay,

 6   suppose they repeal Chapter 13 before you convert.                 Then

 7   can you convert?

 8              MR. BAKER:     I'm sorry.            Would you repeat

 9   that?

10              JUSTICE BREYER:           I'm just producing examples

11   where it's clear you can't convert.             Now, suppose

12   Congress -- there is no Chapter 13.             Could you convert

13   then?

14              MR. BAKER:     Not if there's no Chapter 13.

15              JUSTICE BREYER:           No, okay.     Suppose he dies.

16   Could you convert then?

17              MR. BAKER:     If the debtor dies?

18              JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes.   No inheritance, no

19   nothing.

20              MR. BAKER:     Well, there is a rule, I believe

21   it's --

22              JUSTICE BREYER:           Even though there's no such

23   person existing any more.        He's gone and his whole

24   family is gone, and there's no inheritors, nothing.

25   Then can he convert?    No.

 1                MR. BAKER:     Right.       I think the rule 2009

 2   says, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy --

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:         I'm trying to produce

 4   ridiculous examples.      Maybe -- all right, so you say

 5   even if he's dead and there's no family he still could

 6   convert.    That's an extreme test of my hypothetical, but

 7   okay.    What about if, in fact, he goes insane?              No.

 8                MR. BAKER:     Well, again, Your Honor, the

 9   rule says --

10                JUSTICE BREYER:         What about if, in fact, the

11   conversion is part of a scheme to defraud millions of

12   people in a foreign country because it will be viewed as

13   a signal that they should mail their life savings into a

14   particular account in Switzerland?                Can he convert then?

15                MR. BAKER:     The statute is plain, Your

16   Honor.

17                JUSTICE BREYER:         You say yes on that?

18                MR. BAKER:     I would say yes.

19                JUSTICE BREYER:         Even though it's going to

20   bilk people out of millions of dollars?

21                MR. BAKER:     I think that the statute is

22   plain and says that the debtor may convert.

23                JUSTICE BREYER:         No matter what?        Even if

24   he's dead, even if he's insane?

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:          Well alright, then I can't

 2   get anywhere with my hypotheticals.

 3               (Laughter.)

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:          I would have thought the

 5   answer was no, but there we are.

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Baker, couldn't the

 7   -- let's say the conversion goes through.            The first

 8   thing that the bankruptcy court does in the Chapter 7

 9   converted to Chapter 13 is say:           I'm going to dismiss

10   this suit, the -- the bad faith taint stays with the

11   case, it doesn't get -- you can't erase it; and so back

12   you go to the Chapter 7.       Why couldn't the bankruptcy

13   court now sitting as a Chapter 13 court say:           We're not

14   going to let a debtor who has conducted himself in bad

15   faith proceed in this court?

16               MR. BAKER:      The bankruptcy court could

17   certainly do that.    The procedural safeguards of due

18   process require, obviously, notice and hearing of the

19   court's reasons for wanting to say that.

20               JUSTICE SOUTER:          Yes, but your claim doesn't

21   rest on a due process denial of hearing does it?           That's

22   not, that's not the question you brought to us.           So it

23   seems to me that Justice Ginsburg's question is not

24   answered by saying, well, he'd get a hearing in that

25   case.   The fact remains that in that case the, as I

 1   understand it, the judge in Chapter 13 could immediately

 2   deconvert to Chapter 7, couldn't he?

 3                 MR. BAKER:     Well, I wouldn't say he could

 4   immediately reconvert.       Again, there is the due process

 5   requirement that the debtor have an opportunity to be

 6   heard on the issue.

 7                 JUSTICE SOUTER:         But due process is not the

 8   issue here.     The fact is the bankruptcy court could

 9   deconvert or reconvert to Chapter 7, in effect,

10   following the election that the debtor makes.                 That's

11   so, isn't it?

12                 MR. BAKER:     Yes.

13                 JUSTICE SOUTER:         Well then, why would we

14   have a system as ridiculous as to preclude the court

15   from looking at fraud or bad faith at the moment of

16   election, go through the paperwork and the folderol of

17   converting to 13, and immediately turn around,

18   admittedly having the power, to deconvert?                 That would

19   be a rather foolish system.

20                 MR. BAKER:     Well, perhaps, but it is the

21   system that Congress has given us.                 Congress has said

22   the debtor may convert at any time so long as it has not

23   been converted previously.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               When cases are

25   reconverted to Chapter 7, is that typically done before

 1   or after the filing of the Chapter 13 plan?

 2              MR. BAKER:       Most of the time, a plan is -- I

 3   don't do it this way, but most practitioners will file a

 4   plan at the same time as they file the notice, the

 5   motion to convert.

 6              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But they don't have to.

 7              MR. BAKER:       They don't have to.

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:            And the deconversion could

 9   be done prior to the filing of the plan?

10              MR. BAKER:       I suppose arguably it could.               In

11   my view, the statutory provisions of section 1307 have to

12   be applied to the question of conversion.                So I think --

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Creditors -- under

14   Chapter 13 one of the prerequisites to approval of the

15   plan is that the creditors get at least as much as they

16   would have gotten under Chapter 7, right?

17              MR. BAKER:       That's correct.

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So presumably the

19   creditors might want to see what the Chapter 13 plan

20   looks like themselves.

21              MR. BAKER:       Exactly.        Exactly.      Exactly.

22   And I think it's the Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy

23   Appellate Panel noted that sometimes a problem debtor

24   files a plan and gets it confirmed, pays creditors,

25   and everybody winds up better off.

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Could the district

 2   court -- pardon me.     Could the bankruptcy court make

 3   that same determination in deciding whether or not to

 4   allow the Chapter 7 proceeding to be converted?                He

 5   could make this inquiry in a Chapter 7 proceeding?                  He

 6   says:   I don't think you should be able to convert

 7   because there's a fraud, but I'll look at how the

 8   creditors come out.     Could he do that?           And then you

 9   don't have the specter that Justice Souter referred to

10   of this transfer back and then the transfer back, which

11   is a waste of time.

12               MR. BAKER:       Well, again, the statute says

13   that the debtor may convert except in certain

14   circumstances.   I think that the requirement of a motion

15   to convert a case gives the court the procedural

16   mechanism for looking at the case, seeing, making sure

17   that the debtor --

18               JUSTICE BREYER:           But there is a difference,

19   and this is -- assume with me, which apparently you

20   don't agree, that everywhere in law there are implied

21   exceptions for unusual circumstances.              I have never

22   found an instance where you couldn't think of some

23   exception that they didn't see.             You could not bring a

24   thing if you were insane or dead or if a death would

25   ensue or a murder.     Assume that, all right.

 1               Then the question would be, well, what about

 2   this instance?    And I think the strongest instance --

 3   the strongest argument for saying there's is no

 4   exception here is the argument that the trustee

 5   discovers that this individual is behaving dishonestly,

 6   that he's hidden assets.       Maybe he has a safe deposit

 7   box and he has a key and the key -- the key will allow

 8   him to get diamonds out of the safe deposit box and hide

 9   them.   Under 7, the trustee has the key.         As soon as you

10   convert it to 13 the key is given back to the debtor,

11   who has been shown dishonest.

12               Now, assuming you're going to have some

13   exceptions, why isn't that a very, very powerful one?

14               MR. BAKER:      Because ultimately the Chapter

15   13 trustee has the same powers of the Chapter 7 trustee

16   with the exception, as Your Honor is pointing out, of

17   possession of the property in the bankruptcy estate.

18   But that's how Congress wrote the statute.         We should

19   not ignore Congress's command about the process of

20   converting and look for exceptions before we proceed to

21   go back to the appellate court --

22               JUSTICE ALITO:        If I could come back to a

23   prior question.   Unless there is some different

24   procedure required when -- between the two situations of

25   denial of conversion from 7 to 13 and allowing

 1   conversion but with immediate reconversion back to 7,

 2   unless there's some difference between that's required

 3   by the code in those two situations, maybe it is because

 4   you have to -- in the reconversion situation, you have

 5   to wait until the plan is filed.          Maybe it's because the

 6   bad faith doesn't carry over.

 7              But unless there's some difference, I don't see

 8   what this case is about.

 9              MR. BAKER:      Well, ultimately the case is

10   about the language of the statute and whether the court

11   should apply it as written.        And I think --

12              JUSTICE ALITO:       You can't provide any reason

13   why there's a difference between those two?

14              MR. BAKER:     I'm sorry?

15              JUSTICE ALITO:       You deny -- do you dispute

16   the fact that the bankruptcy court could simultaneously

17   convert on the motion of the debtor from 7 to 13 and

18   during the 20-day period that's required by the rule,

19   the rules, reconvert?   Do you dispute that, for bad

20   faith?

21              MR. BAKER:     I dispute that the court could

22   do it sua sponte and without notice and an opportunity

23   for a hearing.

24              JUSTICE ALITO:       If it gives notice and

25   an opportunity for a hearing during the 20 day period --

 1   you have to give 20 days notice before the conversion

 2   takes place; is that correct, from 7 to 13?

 3              MR. BAKER:     I believe that's correct.           When

 4   you file a motion, a 20 day notice is required, yes.

 5              JUSTICE ALITO:       If it has the hearing during

 6   that period, you don't dispute that the court could do

 7   that, or do you?

 8              MR. BAKER:     Well, again we come to the

 9   question of when the plan gets filed.           The plan isn't

10   filed until after it's converted, according to the

11   rules.

12              JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But here there was a

13   hearing on the motion to convert, right?          There was a

14   hearing?

15              MR. BAKER:     Yes, Your Honor.

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:           And as I understand it,

17   there was no objection to the character of that hearing?

18   There was no request for an evidentiary hearing?          So

19   there was a hearing.    Now, does that get wiped out too,

20   just the way, the determination that you couldn't

21   convert?

22              MR. BAKER:     The procedure I would, I would

23   expect to see is that if the court saw an issue of fact

24   with respect to whether the case had been converted or

25   whether the debtor was eligible for it to be a debtor in


                                   21
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   the chapter to which he seeks conversion, then an

 2   evidentiary hearing would be required.

 3               If -- the fact that there was no evidentiary

 4   hearing in the particular case here, I think, I think we

 5   have to go back to recognize the fact that most issues

 6   in bankruptcy court are decided summarily on motion

 7   practice.

 8               And it is my feeling that, the

 9   jurisprudence of rule 56 has to apply.            If a court

10   sees that there are disputed issues of fact, the court

11   must schedule an evidentiary hearing.            It cannot, it

12   cannot simply grant summary judgment without furtherance

13   issue of fact.   So this is why I say that,

14   that on these two -- the two particular points -- and

15   obviously, the question of whether it has been

16   previously converted is very easy to determine.            But as

17   previously discussed, the issue of eligibility, whether

18   the claims and the debt is within the statutory

19   limitation, is an issue of fact that ultimately might

20   require an evidentiary hearing.

21               JUSTICE SOUTER:         But your case as I

22   understand it, your case does not turn on the question

23   whether there was or was not, should or should not have

24   been a hearing in this case, an evidentiary hearing in

25   this case; is that correct?

 1                MR. BAKER:     That's correct.        That's correct,

 2   because in our view the schedules -- excuse me -- in our

 3   view the schedules in this case clearly indicate that it

 4   -- that he was within the statutory limitations, at

 5   least as far as the schedules go.

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Mr. -- Mr. Baker, I have -- I

 7   have a question on a matter that really upsets me

 8   and causes me to wonder how, you know, how much we can

 9   rely upon your description here.            You claimed in the

10   petition that the reason your client filed under Chapter

11   7 rather than 13 was that he was unemployed at the time.

12   And that he decided to go to 13 after he became

13   employed.

14                Yet, on -- as shown in the supplemental

15   appendix, when he filed under Chapter 7, under penalty

16   of perjury, he said that he was employed, and at

17   the meeting of the creditors, he confirmed under oath

18   that he was employed.

19                What was it?      Was he employed or not

20   employed?

21                MR. BAKER:     On the petition date itself, he

22   was not.    And if you look at schedule I, which is at

23   page 30 of the supplemental joint appendix, at the

24   bottom line, bottom of the -- and it indicates that he

25   was in the process of having a second tenant in his


                                     23

 1   rental property and that he was beginning a job at about

 2   the time the petition --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         It says employment,

 4   occupation, name of employer:             Capital Carpet and

 5   Flooring.     How long employed, five months.             Address of

 6   employment:     Woburn, Massachusetts.             It also says the

 7   same thing on page 18 of the supplemental appendix.                   And

 8   also with the meeting of creditors.                If you look at the

 9   joint appendix at 64a, he says the same thing that he

10   was employed.    Was he employed or not employed?

11                 MR. BAKER:     Right.

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Does he go around swearing

13   he was when he wasn't?

14                 MR. BAKER:     No, he was -- he was not employed

15   at the time.    If you look at his page 18, as you

16   point out, it says at the bottom the income given is

17   estimated based on a new job which is about to start.

18   He had -- he had been the principal of a company called RLM

19   Flooring, which had been closed by Citizens Bank.               So he

20   was, in fact, unemployed because Citizens Bank had taken

21   all of the assets of the corporation and shut it down.

22   And this put him of course behind on his mortgage so he

23   was very concerned about finding employment so he could

24   in fact, keep -- get his mortgage current and then

25   retain his home.

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Look on page 64a of the

 2   appendix, the meeting of creditors.              Trustee says okay,

 3   and you now work for another entity, Capital Carpet and

 4   Flooring, sir?   And Mark Marrama says yes.

 5               MR. BAKER:     Right.         And between the -- between

 6   the time of petition at the meeting of creditors which

 7   was approximately six -- six weeks later, he became

 8   employed.

 9               As I say, he had a mortgage.              He had children

10   to whom he has to pay child support.             At the time he had

11   a wife he owed a lot of money to.            He was concerned about

12   having employment so he could in fact meet those

13   obligations.

14               JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask, I may have

15   missed some of the colloquy here -- is it correct that

16   he would not be eligible to file a-- to have a,

17   institute a Chapter 13 proceeding if he had unsecured

18   debts of over a certain amount?

19               MR. BAKER:     Yes, Your Honor.

20               JUSTICE STEVENS:            And what if at the time he

21   makes the motion to convert, which you say he has an

22   absolute right to make, what if the record then

23   disclosed that he had debts exceeding that amount?              What

24   should the bankruptcy judge do in that case?

25               MR. BAKER:     The bankruptcy judge should

 1   examine the claims that have been filed, if any, do

 2   the arithmetic, offer the debtor an opportunity --

 3                JUSTICE STEVENS:             He concludes they're

 4   over the amount?     So it is clear under the record.              What

 5   should he do then?

 6                MR. BAKER:      He should deny conversion.


 7                JUSTICE STEVENS:             He should what?


 8                MR. BAKER:      He should deny conversion.            If in


 9   fact --

10                JUSTICE STEVENS:             So he does not have an

11   absolute right in all cases to convert, then.

12                MR. BAKER:      It's absolute except in the

13   two circumstances stated in the statute.

14   One of which, is as Your Honor is pointing out, the

15   eligibility, the other is that if it has been previously

16   converted he does not have that right.

17                If the Court has no further questions, I'll

18   reserve my remaining time.

 1   please the Court:

 2              The bankruptcy court need not sit idly by

 3   and grant a motion which is part of an abusive scheme.

 4   The power of the court is there to deny such a motion.

 5   It is there by statute under section 105; it is there

 6   because the courts have always had power.

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Under -- you think

 8   105 is an affirmative grant of power?

 9              MR. BRUNSTAD:         I think the second sentence

10   of 105(a) supports the traditional powers that courts

11   have had to grant relief, to prevent or to deny relief

12   to prevent abuse or to remedy bad faith conduct.                   The

13   fact that the debtor has the authorization under section 706

14   to convert a case cannot be construed to prevent the

15   court from sua sponte taking action to prevent abuse --

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 105(a) is much more

17   limited than that.    It is only if you take the second

18   clause of that out of context and quote it, as has been

19   done, that it looks like an affirmative grant.                It says:

20   "No provision of this title providing for the raising of

21   an issue by a party in interest shall be construed to

22   preclude the court from taking sua sponte other action."

23   That's a much more limited, narrow provision telling you

24   not to imply a negative pregnant from a requirement

25   that a particular party raise an issue.                I -- as a

 1   source of sweeping powers to, to basically act as a

 2   roving commission in equity, I think that's a

 3   mis-citation.

 4               MR. BRUNSTAD:       Well, Chief Justice Roberts,

 5   I think that in order to understand 106(a), the second

 6   sentence, completely, I think it is important to

 7   understand it was added to 105 in 1986 in response to a

 8   number of decisions that were holding that the courts

 9   did not have the -- the bankruptcy courts did not have

10   the authority to sua sponte take action to prevent abuse,

11   to monitor their own calendars, to make sure that

12   inappropriate things weren't happening, and that Senator

13   Hatch when he introduced this legislation which was

14   ultimately enacted, the goal was to overturn cases like

15   the Second Circuit's decision in Grissom to provide

16   expressly and perhaps not as clearly as perhaps they

17   intended, to give the courts this power.          But I --

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Was that Second Circuit's

19   decision a decision that said the court didn't have the

20   power because it had not been moved to take that action

21   by the party who had the responsibility for raising the

22   issue?   Was that the basis for the Second Circuit's

23   decision?

24               MR. BRUNSTAD:       In part, yes.     The court also

25   --

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Then -- then you haven't

 2   contradicted what the Chief Justice suggested.

 3               MR. BRUNSTAD:         Well, I think -- I think

 4   105(a), the second sentence is worded the way that it

 5   is.   It doesn't say exactly that the courts may take any

 6   action of sua sponte.      It says shall not be construed;

 7   the fact that a party has the right to make an action shall

 8   not be construed to deny the court the right sua sponte to

 9   take an action.     But I think that the implication of the

10   statute is clear.    There is this background principle which

11   applies not only in bankruptcy cases but in trial court

12   cases in the district courts everywhere, that this Court

13   recognized in Chambers, that it has specific application

14   in this Court's jurisprudence in bankruptcy in Pepper

15   versus Litton and other cases, that the bankruptcy

16   courts may take action to prevent abuse.                 And in fact,

17   they must do so.    Because by granting a motion, by

18   sitting back and allowing the court to grant relief that

19   furthers an abusive scheme in essence makes the court

20   complicit in the fraud or misdealing.                We can't have that.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What do you do about

22   the different structures, wording between 706(a) and

23   706(b)?   I mean, this provision says debtor may.                The

24   other provisions say that a debtor may ask a court to

25   order, and it suggests a difference in who has the

 1   primary responsibility, whether it is a motion of the

 2   Court or whether it is an independent action.

 3               MR. BRUNSTAD:       Mr. Chief Justice, I think

 4   that the drafting conventions between the two subsections

 5   is key.   706(a) says the debtor may convert.              Whereas

 6   other sections of the code, like 1307(b), other

 7   provisions, provide that upon request of the debtor,

 8   the court shall take some particular action.               Here the

 9   use of the "May" -- I think the word "may" properly

10   signals discretion in the court.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So you think under

12   those other provisions the court doesn't have this

13   inherent power or the implicit power from 105(a) that

14   you're arguing for here?

15               MR. BRUNSTAD:       Well, if you look at section

16   1307(b), upon request of the debtor the court shall

17   dismiss the case, that is an absolute right.               And for a

18   clear reason.   Nobody can force a debtor to continue in

19   Chapter 13 against the debtor's will because Chapter 13

20   requires the debtor to work to pay off creditors.               That

21   would violate the 13th Amendment.           So there would be no

22   circumstance where someone could block a debtor from

23   getting out from Chapter 13, for constitutional reasons.

24   That's a special case.     That is why Congress drafted

25   1307(b) the way that it did.

 1                 Contrast that with section 706 where the

 2   court said the debtor may convert.                 Now, there are,

 3   there are requirements that the debtor has to comply in

 4   order to convert, statutory, but there is also, a debtor

 5   cannot have an absolute right to convert if it would be

 6   part of an abusive scheme.         I think the direct analogy is

 7   this Court's decision in Pepper versus Litton.                 There a

 8   fraudulent party wanted the Court to allow a claim as

 9   part of a fraudulent scheme, and this Court unanimously

10   said no we're not going to allow that, even though there

11   was a subsequent remedy further on in the process.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               If you, if given

13   that the court has express statutory authority to

14   reconvert from 13 back to 7, why should we take the leap

15   of conferring inherent equitable authority to do

16   something, when the statute addresses it in a much more

17   specific way?

18                 MR. BRUNSTAD:       Two primary reasons, Your

19   Honor.     The first reason is that it would be just

20   pointless wheel spinning.

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, maybe, maybe

22   not.     I mean, they convert.         He comes up with a plan

23   under 13 that looks better to creditors.                 I mean, just

24   because there's fraud that offends the court and prompts

25   it to take action prior to conversion doesn't mean that


                                      31

 1   that's going to be the same situation after conversion.

 2               MR. BRUNSTAD:        But the debtor could argue in

 3   the context of the motion to convert, well, I would like

 4   to propose a Chapter 13 plan, perhaps the misconduct

 5   wasn't that severe, and the court can take that into

 6   consideration allowing the debtor to proceed.                But where

 7   as here you have a clear case of abuse, the court should

 8   be entitled to nip it in the bud at that particular

 9   point in time.    Allowing the court to senselessly say,

10   "Oh, go ahead and convert -- "

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Even if it might

12   injure the creditors.

13               MR. BRUNSTAD:        Well, the court can take that

14   into account.    The court is not -- is not shackled under

15   section 706 to deny conversion, it can consider various

16   factors.   If all the creditors were to come up and say:

17   "We know the debtor has been abusing the bankruptcy

18   system, but we think you should allow the conversion to

19   a Chapter 13 case because perhaps that will work for the

20   particular circumstances."        But whereas here there was

21   no such thing, the creditors were saying don't allow

22   conversion, this is part of an abusive scheme.                The

23   trustee was saying don't allow conversion, this is part

24   of an abusive scheme, the bankruptcy court -- if the

25   court had signed the order, then that affects the

 1   integrity of the court.

 2                Is the court itself now not participating by

 3   allowing it to happen, this sort of fraudulent scheme?

 4   The court should be able to nip it in the bud.               Debtors

 5   who are --

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              What limitations

 7   would you recognize on this inherent authority to take

 8   action?   Where do they come from?

 9                MR. BRUNSTAD:      Well I think that --

10   Mr. Chief Justice, I think that they're the same sorts

11   of limitations that require the district court, when it

12   is considering invocation of its inherent powers,

13   whether to exercise them or not, we have always sort of

14   recognized a special situation for bad faith conduct and

15   clearly abusive schemes.      Where those occur as in this

16   case, the bankruptcy court looks at the circumstances,

17   holds a hearing as was held this case, considers the

18   views of the parties who are involved, and then decides.

19                Now it is a relatively high bar.             You know,

20   bad faith -- it is a continuum.          Where you have the

21   honest but unfortunate debtor, abides by all the rules,

22   clearly no bad faith implication would apply.              At

23   the other end of the spectrum where you have a debtor

24   who conceals assets, doesn't disclose, it's found out in

25   bankruptcy and then as soon as the trustee finds out and


                                    33
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   is hot on the debtor's trail, then seeks to convert to

 2   get out from bankruptcy, well, there you have a

 3   clear-cut case of abuse that can't be tolerated.

 4                Now I think that --

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Mr. Brunstad, are you going

 6   to address the mootness point?           Do you think the case is

 7   moot?

 8                MR. BRUNSTAD:       Yes, Justice Scalia.     I think

 9   candidly, the case is not moot.           There is a good reason

10   why we do not allow in our system two separate

11   bankruptcy cases to be pending at the same time.          Once a

12   first bankruptcy case has started, the court

13   jurisdiction attaches its exclusive jurisdiction, and I

14   think the second bankruptcy case that was filed while

15   the first bankruptcy case was still pending was filed

16   without jurisdiction and there was actually no

17   jurisdiction, because of the prior existing case.

18                Additionally, I think we have to recognize

19   that there were different debt levels at different

20   times.    I don't know exactly what they were, but for the

21   first case there was debt level A. About three years

22   later, there was debt level B, which may well have been

23   higher.   On remand if the debtor were to succeed, which

24   I hope the Court does not allow the debtor to proceed,

25   or succeed here, but on remand if it were determined


                                     34

 1   that with the first case the debt levels were properly

 2   below the limits under 109(e), then the debtor would be

 3   eligible to convert as far as that criteria is

 4   concerned.   We do not know absolutely that that would

 5   not be able to be satisfied in the existing case.

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Did you make the

 7   jurisdictional objection before the second bankruptcy

 8   court?

 9                MR. BRUNSTAD:        We did not participate in the

10   second case and make that objection, Your Honor.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:          How so?

12                MR. BRUNSTAD:        I think that it was

13   primarily, it was, the debtor was litigating and we did

14   not make the jurisdictional argument.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:          I find that extraordinary.

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So it wouldn't be

17   before the First Circuit.

18                MR. BRUNSTAD:        That particular issue, I

19   think the appeal of the second case is pending before

20   the district court.     I think that the bankruptcy judge

21   disposed of the case pretty summarily and decided that

22   while this particular debtor, just looking at the

23   schedules, does not have the eligibility requirements

24   for the second case, and therefore dismissed it.

25                That does not necessarily preclude a finding

 1   upon the facts in the first case which is still pending,

 2   that it could be converted.         I think candidly, I need to

 3   say that.

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            It's hardly a summary

 5   disposition.   The opinion goes on for pages and pages.

 6               MR. BRUNSTAD:       Well, this particular

 7   bankruptcy judge obviously had a lot of experience with

 8   this particular debtor, having presided over the first

 9   case as well, Justice Ginsburg.            So I think the

10   bankruptcy court was very fully apprised of the facts

11   and circumstances surrounding the case, with the record

12   and having written several opinions already in the first

13   bankruptcy case which was still pending.

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:         This case, your case?

15               MR. BRUNSTAD:       The current case today, yes,

16   Justice Scalia.

17               JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask this question.

18   If the remedy of not allowing them to convert to Chapter

19   13 is denied, are there other remedies that the

20   bankruptcy court can impose against the debtor who

21   engages in misconduct of this kind?

22               MR. BRUNSTAD:       Yes, Justice Stevens, but

23   they're not tailored to this particular problem or

24   abuse.   They are remedies, for example, the denial of

25   the discharge for concealing assets under section 727.

 1   But that won't --

 2                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Are there any criminal

 3   sanctions?

 4                MR. BRUNSTAD:      There might be criminal

 5   sanctions for willful -- basically, in essence, it's

 6   sort of an idea of theft, you know, by not disclosing

 7   assets, but it's a relatively high bar for criminality.

 8   But that won't protect the creditors in the Chapter 7

 9   case.

10                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Then how are the creditors

11   hurt by this series of events?

12                MR. BRUNSTAD:      Well, the creditors are hurt

13   because in the chapter 7 case, once the bankruptcy case

14   is filed, the trustee takes possession of all the

15   debtor's property, which becomes property of the estate.

16   The trustee's role is to liquidate the property and

17   distribute the proceeds to creditors.            When the case is

18   converted to Chapter 13, under 1306, the property

19   revests in the debtor, including any concealed property.

20   At that point, under section 348, upon conversion, the

21   Chapter 7 trustee is disenfranchised.            His services

22   terminate.   What debtors in bankruptcy who are

23   perpetuating this kind of concealment scheme want you to

24   do is say oh no, you can go ahead and convert, and then

25   maybe we'll deal with it later, because maybe later on

 1   in the proceedings something will happen.            The Chapter

 2   13 trustee might not be apprised of it.

 3               The case might go to a different bankruptcy

 4   judge.   In some jurisdictions, the Chapter 13 docket is

 5   heard by an entirely separate bankruptcy judge.            They

 6   would like to get the benefit of delay in conversion,

 7   because perhaps they can get away with it in the

 8   subsequent Chapter 13 case.         Or alternatively in the

 9   Chapter 13 case, if the debtor doesn't file a plan, then

10   the Chapter 13 trustee, who may have hundreds and

11   hundreds of Chapter 13 cases he or she is responsible

12   for, on a check list might simply check off no plan

13   filed, case dismissed, in which case the creditors don't

14   get the benefit of the liquidation, they don't get the

15   benefit of the assets being recovered, they don't get

16   equality of distribution under the Chapter 7 scheme, and

17   the debtor's fraud is in essence gotten away with.            So

18   that is why, when a motion to convert comes up and the

19   bankruptcy court sees --

20               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Wouldn't a Chapter 7 case

21   be refiled immediately?

22               MR. BRUNSTAD:       Not necessarily, Your Honor.

23   Not necessarily.   The debtor could move to another

24   jurisdiction.

25               JUSTICE STEVENS:            But the creditors aren't

 1   going to let him just run away with the assets, are

 2   they?

 3              MR. BRUNSTAD:        Well, Justice Stevens, in

 4   many many Chapter 7 cases, in many many bankruptcy

 5   cases, you have creditors, most of the creditors may

 6   hold claims of $500, $1,000, $3,000.             This case is

 7   unique because there happened to be a creditor, Citizens

 8   Bank, who was owed hundreds of thousands of dollars who

 9   had an interest in pursuing the case.             In many other

10   cases -- that's why -- one of the reasons why we have a

11   Chapter 7 trustee, to represent the interest of myriad small

12   claimants who collectively have no individual incentive

13   to really incur all the costs to monitor the system.

14              By converting the case from 7 to 13,

15   disenfranchising that representative of all the

16   creditors, the debtor who wants to play the game of

17   concealing the assets, and catch me if you can, can in

18   essence get away with it.       This bankruptcy judge

19   understood this.   This bankruptcy judge denied the

20   conversion so we would keep the case in Chapter 7, the

21   Chapter 7 trustee could do his job, collect the assets

22   --

23              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Could the Chapter 7

24   trustee be appointed the trustee in the Chapter 13, the

25   same trustee who has now been -- he's terminated because

 1   the Chapter 7 has been converted.            Could the court in

 2   the Chapter 13 format appoint the same trustee?

 3                 MR. BRUNSTAD:      No, Justice Ginsburg.        There

 4   is a standing Chapter 13 trustee in Chapter 13 cases

 5   that handles all the Chapter 13 cases, unless for some

 6   reason that Chapter 13 trustee must recuse him or

 7   herself.    Under section 348, once the case is converted

 8   from 7 to 13, the Chapter 7 trustee services are

 9   terminated.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        What does the trustee do?

11   He's not really a trustee under 13, is he?

12                 MR. BRUNSTAD:      The Chapter 13 trustee --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        I mean, the property

14   doesn't vest in him, you've told it.              It remains in the

15   ownership of the debtor?

16                 MR. BRUNSTAD:      Yes, Justice Scalia.        The

17   Chapter 13 trustee is probably characterized mostly an

18   administrative person, who supervises to see that the

19   Chapter 13 procedures are complied with, has the debtor

20   filed the Chapter 13 plan.        If not --

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        He's called a trustee,

22   though?

23                 MR. BRUNSTAD:      Correct, Justice Scalia.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well that's really not his

25   capacity.

 1              MR. BRUNSTAD:          In practical reality, that's

 2   correct, Justice Scalia.        What the Chapter 13 trustee

 3   does is, if a plan is not filed, moves to dismiss the case.

 4   If a plan is filed, may look at the plan.             If the

 5   plan is confirmed, acts as the disbursing agent.               The

 6   debtor typically makes payments under the plan to the

 7   Chapter 13 trustee.     The Chapter 13 trustee then makes

 8   distributions to creditors.           And on Chapter 13 day in

 9   many jurisdictions, one day a week or every other week,

10   the Chapter 13 trustee will come to court with hundreds

11   and hundreds and hundreds of files.

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:            It's called Chapter 13 day?

13              MR. BRUNSTAD:          In many places it is, Your

14   Honor, and they have a Chapter 13 bankruptcy judge.

15   Often it's assigned to the most junior bankruptcy judge

16   sitting in the particular jurisdiction.             With hundreds

17   and hundreds of cases, the Chapter 13 trustee has

18   neither the incentive nor the resources to do the things

19   that a Chapter 7 trustee does every single day.             And not

20   only that, the Chapter 13 trustee does not have the

21   power to go after collecting all of the property and

22   liquidating it.     It's denied that power under the

23   statutory scheme.

24              So it makes no sense.              It's pointless to say

25   we must -- the bankruptcy judge must idly sit by, grant

 1   a motion that's part of this abusive scheme, allow the

 2   case to be converted to Chapter 13, hold another

 3   hearing, have a second set of papers perhaps, only to

 4   send the case back to Chapter 7.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               The sense it makes

 6   is that that's what the statute provides, and rather

 7   than relying on this alleged inherent power that

 8   apparently is not boundless, and that the bounds of

 9   which will have to be articulated in case after case

10   after case, the statute provides a very clear mechanism

11   to address the issue of fraud which allows him to

12   reconvert it back to Chapter 7 promptly.

13               MR. BRUNSTAD:       Well, I think, Mr. Chief

14   Justice, in the Link case, the Court rejected that

15   argument in construing section 41(b), where the Court

16   said, quote, "neither the permissive language of the

17   rule, which merely authorizes a motion by the defendant,

18   nor its policy requires us to conclude that it was the

19   purpose of the rule to be abrogate the power of courts

20   acting on their own initiative to clear their calendars

21   of cases that have remained dormant because of the

22   inaction or dilatoriness of the parties seeking relief."

23   Likewise in Chambers, I think the same principle

24   applied.   The Court said, we don't need to wait and deal

25   with these subsequently occurring procedures to remedy


                                    42

 1   the problem.    We should do it now.

 2                And that is the -- that is the clear import

 3   of this Court's unanimous decision in Pepper versus

 4   Litton.   There was a remedy of equitable subordination

 5   for the fraudulent claim that could have been invoked

 6   far later in the proceeding.              And this Court unanimously

 7   said no, you don't have to wait for that proceeding

 8   later.    Where it's clear that there has been fraud, the

 9   creditor's scheme has been fraudulent, a fraudulent

10   claim, the court can act at the time of allowance of the

11   claim and simply deny the claim.             The reason for it, I

12   think, is the reason articulated in Chambers.                 The

13   integrity of the court itself is implicated if it has to

14   sit back idly by and watch the abusive process unfold.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, I still

16   haven't gotten an answer, I think, on what the prejudice

17   is.   Who is prejudiced by the procedure set forth in

18   the statute?   The conversion takes place.                The judge

19   then says, because of this fraud, I'm going to reconvert

20   it to Chapter 7.     Who suffers under that?              You say sit

21   idly by, but I don't see the long passage of time.

22                MR. BRUNSTAD:        Well, the creditors suffer,

23   Mr. Chief Justice.     And they suffer because there are

24   additional administrative costs that are incurred that

25   compete with their distributions.             We're already talking

 1   about dividing up an inadequate pie to satisfy all

 2   claims in full.     Having a second set of procedures

 3   prejudices the creditors.         It prejudices the court.

 4   Bankruptcy judges can have thousands and thousands of

 5   cases on their dockets.        To have to have a second set

 6   of procedures, a second hearing, it burdens the court

 7   unnecessarily.     And again, it also implicates, again,

 8   and I think this is fundamental, the integrity of the

 9   process.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:           Is it true or not what I

11   said, because I don't know the area, that if in fact you

12   had a dishonest debtor, the present -- the proceeding is

13   dismissed on 7.    He gets the papers back.               The papers

14   permit him access to a hidden source of resources, and

15   he steals them basically.         Is that possible or is that

16   fanciful?

17               MR. BRUNSTAD:         Justice Breyer, that is

18   certainly possible, and I think that is why Congress has

19   said you don't have an absolute right as a debtor under

20   section 707 to dismiss your Chapter 7 case.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

 5              MS. BLATT:      Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 6   and may it please the Court:

 7              A bankruptcy court has the inherent

 8   authority to sanction a debtor who has acted in bad

 9   faith by denying his request to convert a Chapter 7 case

10   to Chapter 13.   Courts have the inherent authority to

11   take appropriate action to prevent an abuse of process.

12   Nothing in the Bankruptcy Code or section 706 purports

13   to impair or limit the bankruptcy court's power to

14   police the integrity of its own proceedings.

15              JUSTICE ALITO:        Why isn't the power to

16   reconvert sufficient?

17              MS. BLATT:      The power to reconvert under

18   section 1307(c) is in this case, where the court is

19   already confronted with an adjudicated bad faith

20   litigator, it's indirect, it's inefficient, and it's

21   inadequate to protect the bankruptcy process.       The

22   potential for abuse is very significant if the case

23   languishes in Chapter 13 for any period of time because

24   the bad faith debtor gets control over the very asset he

25   fraudulently sought to conceal.

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, what are the

 2   odds that that's going to happen if you have a judge

 3   who's exercised enough by the fraud to exercise inherent

 4   authority to deny relief?       He's not going to let it

 5   languish under Chapter 13.

 6                MS. BLATT:    Well, he may or may not.

 7   Bankruptcy courts have thousands of cases, and if there

 8   is an absolute automatic right to convert, a court with

 9   thousands of cases may put off that Chapter 13

10   reconversion to another day.            Moreover, there may be

11   individual creditors without a sufficient stake to raise

12   the issue, and the Chapter 7 trustee who typically will

13   uncover the fraud cannot oppose conversion if there's a

14   right to convert in bad faith, and the Chapter 13

15   trustee or the United States --

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, why wouldn't

17   that trustee recommend to the bankruptcy judge that he

18   reconvert it to Chapter 7?

19                MS. BLATT:    Well, the Chapter 7 trustee is,

20   he's terminated on conversion.            It doesn't raise Chapter

21   13 issues.   The much more likely scenario is the Chapter

22   7 trustee will tell the United States trustee or the

23   Chapter 13 trustee, but they may or may not learn about

24   it until after the case converts.            In jurisdictions

25   where there is --

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Why can't they just have an

 2   order to the bankrupt -- to disclose the asset in the

 3   Chapter 13 proceeding?

 4                 MS. BLATT:    An order to disclose the asset?

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           In the Chapter 13

 6   proceeding.

 7                 MS. BLATT:    Well, we're talking about a case

 8   the court may or may not know about the fraud, and

 9   the trustee may or may not tell someone in time.             If

10   there's --

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, in this case they

12   knew about it, didn't they?

13                 MS. BLATT:    Yes, and there was a basis to

14   oppose conversion.    In jurisdictions where there's an

15   absolute right, and bad faith is not a grounds for the

16   conversion --

17                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Whenever he denies the

18   motion, he must know about it.             He must have a reason to

19   deny.

20                 MS. BLATT:    We're by hypothesis talking

21   about an absolute right to convert, and what I'm trying

22   to say, in jurisdictions where there is an absolute

23   right, the practice of bankruptcy courts is not to

24   simultaneously convert.       It does happen on occasion, but

25   the more likely scenario is that a significant period of


                                     47

 1   time passes.     But the other point is that if there's a

 2   simultaneous conversion it's a completely pointless and

 3   burdensome process, and here's why: A conversion and

 4   simultaneous conversion causes the termination and

 5   reappointment of the Chapter 7 trustee, the appointment

 6   and the immediate termination of the Chapter 13 trustee,

 7   and to the extent there's already pending Chapter 7

 8   proceedings for dismissal or denial of discharge, the

 9   conversion would appear to us to moot those proceedings

10   and require their reinstatement.              And this is a completely

11   unnecessary waste of everyone's time and energy.

12               JUSTICE STEVENS:              May I just clear up one

13   detail that's confusing to me.              The -- are there two

14   judges?   Does the same judge rule on both the motion to

15   convert and the motion to reconvert?

16               MS. BLATT:       Yes, in the majority of

17   jurisdictions.    There are one or two jurisdictions where

18   there are different judges, but the vast majority it's

19   before the same judge.       But a -- if a -- if there's a --

20   if there's a right to convert in bad faith, all you have

21   is a notice of conversion and, assuming the eligibility

22   is met and it hasn't previously converted, a court may

23   say, well --

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I wouldn't call it a

25   right to convert in bad faith.              If it's a right, it's a

 1   right to convert despite the allegation of bad faith.

 2   It's not a right to convert in bad faith.                 No one is

 3   arguing for that.

 4                MS. BLATT:      Well, I think that our point is

 5   that the absence of bad faith is implicit in the statute

 6   because there is this background rule.                 When a litigant

 7   comes to a court that's already abused the court's

 8   process or seeks relief of bad faith, it is a core

 9   element of a court's inherent authority to simply deny

10   relief.    You can toss out an entire complaint when a

11   litigant seeks it in bad faith.            If there was an

12   apparent benefit to this, go to 13 first or deny it, the

13   United States trustee wouldn't be here.                 We see no

14   benefit to the debtor to require the court to convert

15   and then reconvert.     All it is is an unnecessary waste

16   of everyone's time, and this is a core element of an

17   inherit authority.

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What about the idea

19   that the debtor can come in and say under 13, look,

20   whether the facts bear this out in this case or not,

21   I've got a job now.     I can pay off my debtors -- my

22   creditors according to this plan, and, as the statute

23   requires, the creditors get more under 13 than under

24   under 7.    That's a benefit to everybody.

25                MS. BLATT:      Here's why.           I don't think

 1   there's any dispute under --

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And he says, I'm

 3   sorry about that bad faith business.

 4               MS. BLATT:       Sure.        Right.      And there's

 5   nothing to stop a debtor who truly converts and has

 6   found religion and wants to come clean for arguing:                   Let

 7   me convert, it's in the interest of everybody if I do

 8   convert.   This is a discretionary right to deny relief.

 9   The court is free to allow conversion.

10               But under the plain terms of section

11   1370(c), the court has the power to dismiss or reconvert

12   a case to Chapter 7 without waiting for a plan to be

13   filed.   There's no requirement that the court has to sit

14   there for 15 days and see if there's a plan.                 A Chapter

15   7 -- excuse me --

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 If the statute

17   didn't provide that a Chapter 13 plan could be

18   reconverted to a Chapter 7, would the court have the

19   inherent equitable authority to do that?

20               MS. BLATT:       To reconvert to Chapter 7?

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Sure.

22               MS. BLATT:       I don't know if that would be an

23   appropriate remedy.     It might be because you can have an

24   involuntary Chapter 7 case.           But on this point about a

25   court sitting in Chapter 13, if on day one a Chapter 13

 1   debtor files a plan in bad faith, the debtor can say:

 2   Please wait, I've got a plan, I'm working on it, give me

 3   a couple extra weeks, and the court can say:                 No, I have

 4   the authority to throw it out.            And what's particularly

 5   odd about this proposal is that in 2005 a court is

 6   categorically prohibited from allowing a Chapter 13

 7   debtor to proceed under Chapter 13 if the petition is

 8   filed in bad faith.     The court can't confirm a plan.

 9                 So Congress had no interest in protecting

10   bad faith debtors after 2005 and they didn't before

11   2005.     There's no policy preference in the code for bad

12   faith debtors or allowing a debtor either proceeding in

13   Chapter 13 or moving from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13, and we

14   think this is a modest exercise of a court's inherent

15   authority simply to deny relief when the court is already

16   confronted with a clear case of abuse while the case is

17   in Chapter 7 or the debtor has otherwise abused the

18   bankruptcy process.

19                 The last thing I'd like to say is --

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, what about the

21   difference in language under 706(a) and the other

22   provisions?     706(a) says the debtor may.              The other

23   provisions call for action by the court, which suggests

24   at least that the authority to convert is greater under

25   706(a).

 1               MS. BLATT:     I think section 706(a) is fairly

 2   read as granting a statutory right to convert absent the

 3   two statutory exceptions or the court's proper exercise

 4   of inherent authority.     But the 706(b) and (c) just

 5   explain that the court may do something or the court may

 6   not, or the court shall do something.             So we think our

 7   position -- section 706(a) isn't even addressed to the

 8   court at all.   It just gives the debtor the right to

 9   convert, and it doesn't purport to limit or speak to the

10   situation when the debtor seeks that relief in bad faith

11   or has otherwise abused the bankruptcy process.           And I'd

12   just like to end by saying that a debtor's bad faith

13   concealment of assets or misrepresentation of financial

14   affairs is really the most serious abuse you can have in

15   a chapter 7 case.   It threatens the very structural

16   foundation of the code and its integrity.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Does the government have

18   any position on the mootness question here?

19               MS. BLATT:     Well, our position is that it's

20   not moot because it's on appeal.           If that decision is

21   affirmed, it would in a sense practically be moot

22   because there would be an alternative grounds and the

23   debtor wouldn't be eligible under Chapter 13 in any

24   event.   But we didn't see that as necessarily an Article

25   III mootness problem.

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               I guess I've been

 2   assuming -- but the eligibility under Chapter 13 even

 3   under the present case is a present day question, right?

 4   In other words, we don't go back and see if he was

 5   eligible for Chapter 13 when the conversion was denied?

 6   The question would be whether he's eligible now?

 7                MS. BLATT:     We have not compared the two,

 8   the two chapters -- well, there was never a Chapter 13

 9   petition.    We have not compared the Chapter 7 petition

10   with the -- after this case, this Court granted

11   certiorari, then the Chapter 13.            But it is on appeal

12   to the district court, so it's not presently moot.

13                We would ask for those reasons that the

14   First Circuit's decision be affirmed.

 1   having been counsel to a Chapter 13 trustee many years

 2   ago, I can assure the Court the Chapter 13 trustees

 3   exercise all of the powers and authority that a Chapter

 4   7 trustee does, with the exception, as was said, of

 5   possession of property of the estate.              The property of

 6   the estate remains vested, however, in the Chapter 13

 7   trustee throughout the length of the case.              It does not

 8   revest in the debtor until the case is either dismissed,

 9   a discharge is issued, and the case is closed.              So the

10   concerns about leaving a debtor to do anything it wants

11   to with property of the bankruptcy estate simply is not

12   a reality, and I think it does a disservice to the many

13   fine Chapter 13 trustees that there are around the

14   country.

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         I'm not sure I understood

16   what you just said.     You said until the plan is filed

17   and approved the property remains in the possession of

18   the Chapter 13 trustee.

19                 MR. BAKER:     No, it does not remain in her

20   possession.    The Chapter 13 trustee technically never

21   has possession.    The title remains vested in the Chapter

22   13 trustee.

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:         So is it possible if it's

24   in 13 that then the debtor, let's say a dishonest

25   debtor, could get back pieces of paper which would admit

 1   that debtor to the possession of certain property which

 2   he could then take and hide in a way that that couldn't

 3   happen in 7?   Is that possible or not possible?

 4                MR. BAKER:    It's certainly possible.           But

 5   then again, there are statutory and rule-based remedies

 6   for that sort of activity.       And our position is that those

 7   rules and those statutes are what should control in the

 8   case.
