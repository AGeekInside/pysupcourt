7                ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT L. NELSON

8                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9                MR. NELSON:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               The Federal question jurisdiction statute,

12   28 U.S.C. section 1331, broadly grants Federal courts

13   jurisdiction over all actions arising under Federal law

14   unless Congress has provided otherwise.                That grant of

15   jurisdiction encompasses rights of action that are

16   created and governed by substantive Federal law.

17               The Telephone Consumer Protection Act sets

18   for forth such a right of action.             It provides detailed

19   substantive standards, and it grants a private right of

20   action to recover for their violation.                The TCPA permits

21   that action to be filed in a State court if State court

22   allows such actions, but it says nothing one way or

23   another about whether the action may also be filed in

24   Federal court.

25               JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Nelson, do you think


                                       3
                           Alderson Reporting Company

1    that there is a clear statement rule that applies when

2    Congress attempts to divest a Federal court of

3    jurisdiction over claims of this kind?

4                   MR. NELSON:     Well, sometimes the Court

5    has -- has talked about clear statement rules in terms

6    like "Congress must make unmistakably plain."                 I'm not

7    sure it rises to that level, but what the Court has said

8    is that jurisdiction granted by statute exists unless

9    Congress has affirmatively displaced it and that the

10   Court is unwilling to -- to defeat jurisdiction by mere

11   implication.

12               So, I think it -- it may be something a

13   little less than -- than what this Court has sometimes

14   referred to as a clear statement rule, but it is a

15   requirement that Congress act --

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Do you have anything more

17   than implication here?

18               MR. NELSON:        No.        There -- there's not even

19   implication here, Justice Scalia.             There's -- there's

20   really nothing at all.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You -- you'd have --

22   the same private right of action that could be brought

23   in State court without subsection 5 at all, right?

24               MR. NELSON:        I -- I think that's very

25   likely, Your Honor.      I mean, under -- under Tafflin, and

1    going back to the -- to over a century ago in Claflin,

2    there's a presumption that concurrent jurisdiction over

3    a transitory cause of action created by Federal law

4    exists in State courts.     But as the Court pointed out in

5    Tafflin, that -- that presumption has sometimes, as in

6    the antitrust cases, been found to have been displaced

7    by implication from Federal policy.

8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              What is the basis --

9    you assert that you could bring this -- bring a Federal

10   cause of action in Federal court.

11               MR. NELSON:     Pardon me?

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              You think that you

13   can bring the Federal cause of action in Federal court.

14               MR. NELSON:     Yes.       I --

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              What is -- what is

16   the basis for -- putting aside jurisdiction, what is the

17   basis for the Federal cause of action?

18               MR. NELSON:     Oh, you mean the existence of

19   the cause of action at all?

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Yes.   Yes.

21               MR. NELSON:     I mean -- the -- you know, what

22   this Court has -- has, I think, said in its

23   interpretation of statutes is that where a statute

24   creates a right of recovery from A to B in a court under

25   circumstances Y, that is a right of action.               And the --


                                    5

                                   Official


1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               But we -- we said

2    that 40 years ago.    More recently, we've said that

3    Congress must be fairly express in creating a private

4    cause of action.   And my -- my concern is if you put it

5    against that context, that our cases require fairly

6    direct evidence, express evidence, that Congress meant

7    to give a private right of action, in that context the

8    existence of an express State cause of action or Federal

9    cause of action that can only be brought in State court,

10   the implication that there isn't one that can be brought

11   on its own in Federal court is fairly strong.

12                MR. NELSON:      Well, I think that's not

13   correct.   I think, Your Honor, that that is actually

14   confusing the concept of whether there's a right of

15   action, which is a substantive right of recovery that

16   can be pursued in a court, and the question of

17   jurisdiction, which is in what court may that be

18   brought.

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, that -- I

20   understand that -- that proposition.                Assuming that

21   distinction is correct and that there is no

22   free-standing Federal cause of action, what good does

23   having Federal jurisdiction give you?

24                MR. NELSON:      Well --

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Because I take it


                                      6

1    that at that point everybody can immediately --

2    defendants can remove -- never mind.               Cross that off.

3                 What benefit do you have if as soon as you

4    file your action, everybody says congratulations, you

5    have Federal jurisdiction, and you're kicked out of

6    court because you have no cause of action?

7                 MR. NELSON:     Well, what I'm saying, Your

8    Honor, is that -- is that it is not in fact the case

9    that there's no right of action.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              No, no.   I'm

11   assuming that we don't see a cause --

12                MR. NELSON:     If there were no right of

13   action that -- that is available somehow in Federal

14   court, then, of course, it does no good to be in Federal

15   court.   But that's not how the Court has -- has treated

16   rights of action.   Limitations on the court in which a

17   right of action can be brought are not part of the right

18   of action.   They're matters of jurisdiction.

19                JUSTICE ALITO:         Can Congress create a cause

20   of action that does not arise under Federal law?

21                MR. NELSON:     No, I don't really think it

22   can.   Congress doesn't have the power to enact State

23   law.   So, if Congress creates a cause of action and --

24   and establishes Federal law that governs it, that is

25   necessarily a cause of action that arises under Federal

1    law.

2                   JUSTICE ALITO:         And there's no dispute that

3    there is a cause of action here that was created by

4    Congress; isn't that right?

5                   MR. NELSON:     Yes, that -- that's correct.         I

6    mean, you know, this is not an implied right of action.

7    It's an express right of action.             Congress said in

8    227(b)(3) that if this right is violated, you can

9    recover X amount, $500 per violation or up to three

10   times that much in the case of a willful violation.             And

11   the question is simply whether by saying that it may be

12   filed in State court, the court has -- that Congress has

13   displaced the jurisdiction that would otherwise be

14   available --

15               JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.    So, the basic

16   reason seemed to me that it might mean "may," and I'm

17   following up on the Chief Justice here, who withdrew

18   this interesting part of his question.             The -- the

19   Congress seemed to want to have ordinary people be able

20   to go into small claims court in a State and bring an

21   action for $500 because they were pestered by these

22   salesmen on the phone in violation of the Act.

23               Now, if you're right, they could go into

24   Federal court.    But so could the defense.           And so, any

25   case they bring in small claims court, I guess, could be

1    removed, couldn't it?       And how is that -- am I right

2    about that?

3                   MR. NELSON:     It's theoretically possible

4    that it could be removed --

5                   JUSTICE BREYER:        Well --

6                   MR. NELSON:     -- Justice Breyer, yes.

7                   JUSTICE BREYER:        Well, why wouldn't they --

8    I mean, you know, if they're really pests -- I'm not

9    saying they're all pests; some might be.              But if they're

10   pests and they want to drag it out, what they do is they

11   just remove it from small claims court.              They tell their

12   lawyer:   Remove everything, remove everything.             And so,

13   what was Congress's objective, seemingly to provide a

14   simple, clear, easy thing for the average American to do

15   when he's pestered, suddenly becomes a major legal

16   problem since the defense lawyer is instructed remove

17   every case to Federal court.              Now, that's something

18   that's bothering me.      So, I'd like to know what your

19   response is.

20                 MR. NELSON:      Yes, Justice Breyer.        Well,

21   there are several -- several parts to the answer.              The

22   first is that -- that the strategy itself is

23   self-defeating.    If you have a $500 claim being brought

24   by an individual in a small claims court, to pay a

25   lawyer, to pay the filing fee to remove it --

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Oh, it's not

 2   self-defeating, because we keep it up, and the word will

 3   get around.

 4                 MR. NELSON:     Well, when you're --

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:        And in case, by the way,

 6   anyone doubts it, before he even files it -- one of the

 7   things that we'll instruct our salesmen to say is:          If

 8   you sue us, we're going to remove it to -- you know,

 9   there are many ways of it getting around.

10                 MR. NELSON:     Well, Justice Breyer --

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Okay, what's the second?

12                 MR. NELSON:     To begin with -- now I want to

13   -- I want to -- I want to stay on this one because --

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Okay.

15                 MR. NELSON:     -- before I go on to the next

16   one.

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:        All right.

18                 MR. NELSON:     The -- the reason that that

19   strategy doesn't really work with respect to individual

20   plaintiffs filing in small claims court is they're not

21   necessarily -- in fact, they're most likely not going to

22   be repeat players.    So, they don't have any real way to

23   find out about it, absent -- absent the -- the

24   telemarketer telling them in the phone call that you

25   have a right of action, which seems even more unlikely.

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I'm not sure I'm

 2   understanding your answer, because I have one of the

 3   same problems as Justice Breyer.            Of -- the design of

 4   this statute, from what I can infer what the

 5   congressional intent was, is for an individual person to

 6   be able to go into small claims court.            And the

 7   defendant will usually be the telephone company that

 8   wants to remove it to Federal court and, as

 9   Justice Breyer said, instruct the attorneys always go to

10   Federal court; the word will get out.            And you're

11   saying, oh, don't worry about that; that won't happen?

12   That will happen.   That's exactly what's going to

13   happen.

14               MR. NELSON:      Justice Kennedy, I think that

15   word getting out is very unlikely to happen if you're

16   talking about the individual, uncounseled --

17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Whether the word gets out

18   or not, they will all go to Federal court.

19               MR. NELSON:      But -- and I'd also --

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Do we have any

21   information on the -- I mean, there are small claims

22   courts in State court.     Is there any practice of

23   removing $500 claims and paying much more than the $500

24   that's at stake?

25               MR. NELSON:      No.        No, Justice Ginsburg, and

 1   that was the -- the second part of the answer --

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:         But is there any reason to

 3   think before you brought this suit that people thought

 4   they could remove it to Federal court?

 5                MR. NELSON:      Well, in fact, in the Seventh

 6   Circuit, defendants have been aware for the past 6

 7   years, I believe, that they can remove these claims to

 8   Federal court.    And the ones that have been removed are

 9   large class actions.

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            In this -- in this case,

11   could -- could this case have been brought in a small

12   claims court?    Where does it come from?

13               MR. NELSON:       It comes from Florida, Your

14   Honor.   It could not have been brought in small claims

15   court for two reasons.      The complaint on its face

16   alleges 12 calls and more, and at -- at the $1,500,

17   trebled -- the 500 trebled, that would far exceed the

18   $5,000 jurisdictional limit of a Florida small claims

19   court.

20               The action also seeks injunctive relief,

21   which is not available.

22               JUSTICE BREYER:          All right.   Aside from the

23   individual ones, what's actually worrying me, which I've

24   tried to bring out, is I'm pretty certain Congress in

 2   calls.   That's their object.

 3                 And I can think that if you can bring this

 4   suit in Federal court, so can the defendants.

 5                 MR. NELSON:       And --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:          And, therefore, I think,

 7   gee, I'm not so sure about this.              They don't gain much

 8   advantage, the plaintiffs, by being able to go into

 9   Federal court, and there could be some advantage on the

10   defense side to making things more complex, raising

11   legal fees.    Okay?

12                 So, that's where I am at this moment.           Now,

13   I'm asking you this because I would like your best

14   answer to disabuse me of this notion which cuts against

15   your case.

16                 MR. NELSON:       Well, I think -- I think the

17   further thing that cuts against it, Justice Breyer, is

18   you've received three amicus briefs on the other side

19   from people who participate in the industry, and what

20   they all say repeatedly is that there are tremendous

21   benefits to both plaintiffs and defendants to being in

22   small claims court in the truly small claims.

23                 The defendant -- you know, if the defendant

24   removes, it's the defendant that's going to be racking

25   up the legal fees, not the pro se small claims

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But why is that?

 3   Wouldn't the -- I think you're fighting Justice Breyer's

 4   hypothetical.    Wouldn't the -- I can imagine if you've

 5   got a, you know, small claim type case because you got

 6   the -- one of these calls, and the first thing you get

 7   is the notice of removal and this.                I mean, you're going

 8   to say forget about it; I'm not going to hire a lawyer.

 9   Right?    I mean, the idea is they would drop it right

10   away.

11                MR. NELSON:      Well, I mean, the -- the

12   experience is, I think -- and there's an interesting

13   article in a -- in a publication called the Consumer

14   Finance Law Quarterly Report from the spring of 2002

15   called "Defending TCPA Actions in San Diego Small Claims

16   Court."

17                And there are some repeat players on the

18   plaintiffs' side in small claims court, and the advice

19   that the author gives is, whatever you do, don't try to

20   escalate with those people; don't even remove it up to

21   the -- to the State court of general jurisdiction,

22   because you're just going to find yourself in a morass;

23   it's going to cost you the defendant much more money to

24   move this claim out of small claims court.

 1   claims be brought in State court as class actions?

 2               MR. NELSON:        Well, that depends, Justice

 3   Ginsburg, on the State.        As the Court probably may

 4   recall, in the State of New York you probably couldn't

 5   bring this action as a class action because of --

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But you could remove it

 7   to the Federal courts, and then you could.

 8               MR. NELSON:        Right.       In Federal court, I

 9   think that although there's -- there's actually some

10   disagreement among the courts of appeals on this point

11   between the Second and Third Circuits over whether State

12   procedural law would apply in Federal court, we think

13   the best answer is Federal procedural law applies when

14   the claim is brought in Federal court.             Then in some

15   States, there has been a recent decision in New Jersey

16   where a New Jersey court said that a class action was

17   not superior for --

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But it's up to -- it's up

19   to the State.

20               MR. NELSON:        It's up to the State --

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Congress --

22               MR. NELSON:        -- if it's brought in State

23   court, Your Honor.

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Congress said you bring

25   it according to your law and your rules of procedure.

 1   So, the State could make it -- Congress may have been

 2   interested in the small claims court, but it certainly

 3   didn't limit the States to bringing -- to putting these

 4   claims in small claims court.

 5                MR. NELSON:      No.        And -- and in fact, number

 6   one, it probably couldn't.         Number two, the -- you know,

 7   the statute creates rights to recovery and a right to

 8   injunctive relief.    That's actually the first listed

 9   claim for relief that the private right of action gives

10   you.   That is -- you know, injunctive relief claims are

11   virtually by definition beyond the scope of -- of

12   jurisdiction of small claims courts.               So, it created a

13   right of action that in some instances would be

14   appropriate for small claims court.

15               And I think the incentives are that -- that

16   those that are really truly small claims court matters,

17   they'll be brought there, they'll stay there.               Those

18   that are not, cases where it's worth litigating in

19   Federal court or worth litigating in a State court of

20   general jurisdiction and claims that may be possibly

21   suitable for class action status will be brought in

22   other types of courts, such --

23               JUSTICE KAGAN:         Mr. Nelson, it's an odd

24   provision, this little clause, "if otherwise permitted

25   by the laws or a court of a State."               What -- what is

 1   your account of that provision and what it's doing here?

 2               MR. NELSON:      Well, I think -- I think what

 3   it does is, principally, it displaces what would

 4   otherwise be the rule of Testa v. Katt, that --

 5               JUSTICE KAGAN:        And why did Congress want to

 6   do that?   I mean, you would think -- and this goes back

 7   to Justice Breyer's point -- you know, most of these

 8   claims, they're small claims, they typically are better

 9   situated in a State's small claims court, and yet here

10   Congress says, well, the State doesn't have to entertain

11   these, in which case they could only be brought in

12   Federal court.

13               MR. NELSON:      Well, it's not clear that it

14   means, you know, how much freedom it gives them not to

15   entertain them.   It may -- and again, you know, that's

16   an issue that the -- that the State supreme courts are

17   divided on, although it's a theoretical division at this

18   point because no State has actually precluded these

19   claims at this stage.

20               But, you know, I think that, especially read

21   against the backdrop of the general principle that,

22   while States can't discriminate against Federal rights

23   of action, they're also not required to create courts

24   that have jurisdiction over them, that what this statute

25   was intended to do was -- was recognize the flexibility

 1   that the courts would have to define which courts and

 2   under which procedures it would entertain these actions.

 3               JUSTICE ALITO:        Well, if the State thought

 4   that its courts were just being overwhelmed by these

 5   cases, even the small claims courts, there were so many

 6   of them, would they be permitted to bar them completely?

 7               MR. NELSON:      That's a possible reading of

 8   the statute, Justice Alito.         That's what the Texas

 9   Supreme Court has held.      In fact, the Texas Supreme

10   Court has held that the State has to affirmatively

11   authorize them.   Other State supreme courts have said

12   that what it means by "if otherwise permitted" is if

13   there's a court of general jurisdiction that hears cases

14   like this and we haven't affirmatively excluded them.

15   And then some State supreme courts such as Illinois have

16   said we don't even have the power to exclude them.              But

17   I -- you know, that is one of the readings of the

18   statute.

19               But -- but what's clear is that the "if

20   otherwise permitted" does mean -- mean something.

21   It provides a statutory standard for when the action may

22   be brought in a State court, which is a matter of --

23   it's certainly not superfluous.

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               But is it just when

25   the action can be brought in State court or when the

 1   action can be brought at all?           It says you may bring an

 2   action -- and that's what I understood your basis for

 3   the Federal cause of action to be -- if it's permitted

 4   by the law or rules of -- of a court of that State.

 5                MR. NELSON:     Well, I think what it says is

 6   "may," may bring an action in the courts of that State

 7   if otherwise permitted.      And I think if you think about

 8   what the -- what reason Congress would have to put "if

 9   otherwise permitted by State laws or rules of court,"

10   it's very unlikely that it would use that phrase to

11   denote --

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Yes.

13               MR. NELSON:      -- when you have a right of

14   action in Federal court --

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               What you can

16   always --

17               MR. NELSON:      -- as opposed to which State

18   court you would go to.

19               I'm sorry.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So, if -- could an

21   individual -- you say there's a Federal cause of action

22   in this case apart from the State cause of action that's

23   provided.   Could that Federal cause of action be brought

24   in State court even though the State cause of action

25   could not be?

 1                MR. NELSON:      Mr. Chief Justice, with all due

 2   respect, I don't think that this statute creates a,

 3   quote, "State cause of action."            It creates a Federal --

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Right.   Let's say

 5   you have two --

 6                MR. NELSON:      -- Federal cause of action that

 7   may be brought in both State and Federal court.

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Got it, got it.     But

 9   just to follow up.    The cause of action could be brought

10   in both, except if the State courts say it can't be

11   brought there.    The State cause of action can't be

12   brought in State court because of this "if otherwise

13   permitted," right?

14                The Federal cause of action, though -- I

15   thought the State courts couldn't discriminate against

16   the Federal cause of action, any Federal cause of

17   action.   So, you can sue in State court and say:               I'm

18   bringing my Federal cause of action; so, the fact that

19   you don't permit a State cause of action doesn't bar me.

20                MR. NELSON:      Again, I think that the premise

21   of the question is really not correct.

22                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           This goes back to

23   Justice Alito's point --

24                MR. NELSON:      The statue does not create --

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Justice Alito said this

 1   claim arises under Federal law; the substantive law that

 2   governs is not State law.

 3                MR. NELSON:     Exactly right, Justice

 4   Ginsburg.

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          It's a --

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But that's fine.

 7   That may be exactly right.        But the cause of action

 8   under subsection (3) asks whether or not this action --

 9   it provides an action that can be brought in State court

10   if otherwise permitted, right?

11                MR. NELSON:     It provides an action, says

12   that that action may be brought in State court if

13   otherwise permitted.    That is the creation of a Federal

14   right of action over which State courts have

15   jurisdiction if their laws otherwise allow.               It's not

16   the creation of two causes of action, one State and one

17   Federal.

18                And that's why "if otherwise permitted" may

19   give the States some leeway, maybe more than they would

20   have under Testa v. Katt, to exclude them.               But it

21   doesn't actually affect the availability of the action

22   in Federal court.   Although even if it did, Chief

23   Justice Roberts, in this case there has been no

24   dispute --

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              What about --

 1                MR. NELSON:     -- that this action is

 2   otherwise permitted by Florida law.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              What about a

 4   diversity action?   You could not bring this action in

 5   State court because it's contrary to the law, the rules

 6   of the court of that State, but there's diversity.                 Can

 7   you bring that diversity action in Federal court?

 8                MR. NELSON:     Well, there's a -- there's a

 9   split in the circuits over that question at this point.

10   But my answer is yes, because it's -- it's a Federal

11   cause of action governed by substantive Federal law, as

12   the -- as the Second Circuit's opinion in Gottlieb held.

13   The implication of that is if there's any basis for

14   jurisdiction, whether diversity or Federal question, you

15   have the right of action in Federal court, and it's not

16   contingent on whether State law allows the -- the right

17   of action.

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, how is that?          I mean,

19   the description of the right of action is that it exists

20   only if permitted by the laws or rules of court of a

21   State.

22                MR. NELSON:     I think, again, Justice --

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:        That's --

24                MR. NELSON:     Justice Scalia, that's --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:        What -- what is a

 3   description of the cause of action then?

 4                MR. NELSON:     The description of the cause of

 5   action is that if the statute is violated --

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Where is it in the statute?

 7   I mean, I'm reading the section --

 8                MR. NELSON:     It's in --

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- that says -- under

10   "Protection of subscriber privacy rights," subsection

11   (5) is entitled "Private right of action," and the only

12   right of action it describes is that a person who has

13   received more than one telephone call -- blah, blah,

14   blah -- "may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or

15   rules of court of a State, bring in an appropriate court

16   of that State" actions.      Now, even if you say that that

17   cause of action is bringable in Federal court, why

18   wouldn't it be still governed by the laws of a State?

19                MR. NELSON:     Well, it -- it goes to the

20   question again -- and back to my answer to Chief Justice

21   Roberts -- of what you consider "if otherwise available"

22   to modify.   And to me, I think the most natural reading

23   is that it modifies "may bring in State court," because

24   that is the only thing that it makes sense to have State

25   rules of court affect.

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:          That's fine.        Then where is

 2   the creation of a private right of action bringable in

 3   Federal court apart from State laws?                Where does that

 4   exist in this statute?      I don't see it here.

 5               MR. NELSON:       It's in the section as a whole.

 6   I think you're looking at (c)(5).            (B)(3) is the one

 7   that's actually at issue here, but its -- its phrasing

 8   is the same.    It's at 10a in the blue brief.              And the

 9   Act -- the statute as a whole creates an entitlement to

10   bring an action that yields certain recoveries.

11               And, you know, this Court has never looked

12   at statutory provisions that create rights of action and

13   say they may be brought in particular courts.                It hasn't

14   read the reference to "may be brought in the courts" as

15   limiting the right of action.            In Tafflin, for example,

16   the RICO statute says you may bring an action in Federal

17   court to recover damages for a violation of

18   that section.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, do you

20   know -- do you know why the Solicitor General is not

21   here defending the proposition that Federal law provides

22   a Federal cause of action that can be brought in Federal

23   court?

 1   reasons why, Mr. Chief Justice.              I think --

 2                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Is it because the FCC

 3   once took a position that the action was limited to

 4   State courts?

 5                  MR. NELSON:     No, the FCC has never taken the

 6   position that it's limited to State courts.               They have,

 7   in a number of things that they have written about the

 8   statute, said in the words of the statute that an action

 9   may be filed in State court.              They have never stated one

10   way or another a position on the question whether it may

11   be filed in Federal court.          In the Charvat case, they

12   did file an amicus brief in the Sixth Circuit, taking

13   the position that the right of action created by the

14   statute is in all respects governed by substantive

15   Federal law.    They didn't say anything one way or

16   another about whether the Sixth Circuit actually had

17   jurisdiction.    It would seem kind of odd if they took

18   the view that it didn't, that they wouldn't have

19   mentioned it.    But --

20               JUSTICE BREYER:           What happens --

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Could you clarify one

22   point for me.    You indicated that no State has said that

23   you cannot bring an action, and yet -- then you said

24   that Texas said it has to be specifically authorized.

25   Did the legislature of Texas specifically authorize it?

 1                  MR. NELSON:     Yes, it --

 2                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Don't let me misstate what

 3   you said.

 4                  MR. NELSON:     It's -- the Texas legislature

 5   has enacted statutes that says a plaintiff may go to

 6   court and bring an action under the TCPA, in those -- in

 7   so many words, in addition to whatever right of action

 8   it may have under Texas law.

 9                  If there are no further questions, I'll

10   reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

17   and may it please the Court:

18                 Whether this Court concludes that a

19   12(b)(1) or a 12(b)(6) label is the better fit, it

20   should hold that Congress did not intend for private

21   TCPA claims to be brought in Federal court under 28

22   U.S.C. 1331.    The private right of action that Congress

23   expressed is distinct in three different and meaningful

24   ways.   And if you look at the right of action, which is

 1               JUSTICE KAGAN:        Mr. Garre, you don't contest

 2   the background rule, do you, which is that when Congress

 3   creates a cause of action, there is Federal question

 4   jurisdiction unless Congress does something to divest

 5   the Federal courts of that jurisdiction?

 6               MR. GARRE:     We don't, and we haven't

 7   contested that the action here arises under

 8   Federal law.   But what you've got is the question of the

 9   interplay between two statutes, 1331 and the private

10   right of action here, in the same way the Court has

11   dealt with the interaction between section 1983 and

12   other private rights of action, for example, the City of

13   Ranchos Palos Verdes v. Abrams case.             And in that

14   context, the Court hasn't said, oh, if it's covered by

15   1983, of course you've got to bring it under -- you can

16   bring it under 1983 unless Congress has unmistakably

17   cleared that you can't.

18               JUSTICE KAGAN:        But if you say, if you don't

19   contest the background principle, then the question is

20   whether Congress has clearly enough divested the Federal

21   courts of jurisdiction over this case essentially by

22   giving jurisdiction to the State courts.             And we've had

23   a number of cases going the other way that suggest that

24   you don't divest one court of jurisdiction by giving

25   jurisdiction explicitly to another court.             And the


                                    27

                                    Official


 1   question here is why is this any different, and has

 2   Congress by granting jurisdiction to one court spoken

 3   with the kind of clarity needed to divest the Federal

 4   courts of their pre-existing jurisdiction?

 5                  MR. GARRE:    And all of those cases dealt

 6   with the constitutional presumption of concurrent State

 7   court jurisdiction.      And, of course, where the question

 8   is whether the -- whether the Constitution has been

 9   displaced, this Court has required Congress to speak

10   with unmistakable clarity.          This case is the first case

11   where this Court is confronted with the question of

12   whether there's any similar presumption going the other

13   way.   There's no constitutional foundation for that

14   presumption.    It's just the interplay between statutes.

15   And for that reason we think the section 1983 paradigm

16   is more important.

17                JUSTICE KAGAN:         But nobody has ever said

18   that Federal question jurisdiction as granted by 1331 is

19   some kind of junior sister when it comes to

20   jurisdiction, is some kind of weaker jurisdictional

21   default provision.     I mean, once Congress has granted

22   Federal question jurisdiction by 1331, that's the

23   background rule.    The Federal courts have jurisdiction

24   in the same way that the background rule is that the

25   State courts have jurisdiction.

 1                  MR. GARRE:    Well, no.        The background

 2   rule -- the -- right.       There's a background rule

 3   provided by a statute which Congress can displace by a

 4   later enacted more specific statute, and then there's

 5   the background rule provided by the Constitution.              And

 6   our position is that usually when the Court talks about

 7   Congress displacing, disrupting the traditional balance

 8   of powers protected by the Constitution, it does require

 9   Congress to speak with unmistakable clarity.

10                It doesn't apply that kind of presumption

11   when you're talking about an earlier more general

12   statute and a later more specific statute.             In fact, in

13   that situation, the Court's general rule is that the

14   later more specific statute trumps the earlier more

15   general one.    And I don't think there's any reason to

16   carve 1331 out, as venerable as it is.

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Garre, do you have

18   any example, other than this statute which is odd -- is

19   there any other example of a claim that arises under

20   Federal law, as this does under Federal statute -- the

21   substantive law is Federal -- that one may not bring in

22   State court?

23                MR. GARRE:      I can't cite you another

24   example.   The Shoshone case is another anomaly.            It's a

25   little bit different.       But I think -- I think the Court

 1   should give credit to what Congress did here.                 And if

 2   you look at the right of action, it's distinct in three

 3   different ways.

 4                  First, Congress only spoke of bringing suits

 5   in State courts.     Petitioner hasn't identified another

 6   Federal cause of action where Congress has done -- done

 7   that.

 8                  Second, Congress modified the entire right

 9   of action based on "and otherwise permitted by the laws

10   or rules of the court of a State."                 Under the rules of

11   grammar, there's no question that that clause modifies

12   the "may," not anything else that follows in the

13   statute.

14                And the third way it's distinct, Justice

15   Ginsburg, is that Congress spoke of the limitations on

16   State courts and State laws before it even expressed the

17   violation.   In the typical way that Congress expresses a

18   private right of action -- and I've looked at a lot of

19   them in the last few days -- Congress talks about the

20   violation, and then it at times provides as a

21   descriptive matter where it could be brought.                Here, in

22   the first --

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is the law any different,

24   the violation and the governing law, any different than

25   if the Attorney General had brought suit or if the FCC


                                      30
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   sought to enforce this law?         I mean, the substance of

 2   the law -- whoever sues, the Attorney General, the FCC,

 3   the Federal law that governs is the same, isn't it?

 4                MR. GARRE:    Well, I think there's separate

 5   provisions that allow the State attorneys general to go

 6   into Federal court, and the FCC has its own enforcement

 7   authority.   They aren't conditioned by this limitation.

 8   We're talking about this private right of action.

 9                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But I'm talking about the

10   claim of the -- the violation, the wrongful conduct is

11   the same whether the Attorney General is suing, whether

12   the FCC is enforcing.

13                MR. GARRE:    I think the basic elements of

14   the cause of action are going to be the same, but State

15   law can limit the availability of that cause of action,

16   the ability to bring it in a court.              And under -- for

17   example, by a class action rule or just saying you can't

18   bring those claims at all or statute of limitations.

19                Petitioner's view is that a plaintiff can

20   circumvent those limitations altogether, authorized by

21   Congress in the most important clause of this private

22   right of action, simply go into Federal court and be

23   gone with those limitations.

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:        Can --

 1   logic of your position?      Congress does a whole study

 2   about how these harassing calls and e-mails and other

 3   things are to citizens, and all of a sudden it's going

 4   to limit the rights of those citizens to recover under

 5   the Act to those States that are going to say okay.           Why

 6   even bother passing a Federal law if it was going to

 7   give States the option to protect against this kind of

 8   conduct alone?

 9               MR. GARRE:     Well, it created a public

10   Federal right.   Congress all the time creates Federal

11   legal protections --

12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          But generally it does.

13   You've just admitted --

14               MR. GARRE:     -- but it doesn't give private

15   right of actions.

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          You've just admitted to

17   Justice Ginsburg nowhere else has it created a Federal

18   right with a private cause of action in which it's

19   limiting the protections of the Federal law to those

20   States that decide they want to do it too.          I mean,

21   generally Congress creates a Federal right because they

22   don't think the States are doing enough.

23               MR. GARRE:     And there's no question that

24   they would have a Federal right.           And, of course, this

25   -- this private right of action is distinct.          My point


                                    32

 1   is only it's not unusual for Congress to create a

 2   Federal right and not provide a private right of action;

 3   for example, under the provision in Gonzaga v. Doe --

 4                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Unquestionably.   But

 5   it's -- it is unusual for them to create a Federal right

 6   with a cause of action and then limit its application to

 7   those States that say it's okay.            I go back to my

 8   question --

 9                 MR. GARRE:    Well, it wouldn't --

10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Why not simply say to

11   the States, please, do something about this problem?

12                 MR. GARRE:    I think that -- I would point

13   you to the statutory findings and, if you thought it

14   appropriate, look at Senator Hollings' statement as

15   well.   And the reason why it makes sense is Congress is

16   dealing with a situation that, when it acted, the vast

17   majority of States had passed laws to allow consumers to

18   deal with this problem at the State level.           They

19   identified this interstitial void that Your Honor spoke

20   about in your opinion on the Second Circuit, and

21   Congress acted to close that enforcement loophole to

22   authorize States to allow consumers to go after

23   interstate calls.

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Mr. Garre, was it really

25   a loophole?    What would -- I mean, if this -- if conduct

 1   -- if the telemarketers are calling from out of State,

 2   but the impact is in the State, the person who is being

 3   called, it seems to me that there certainly would be

 4   jurisdiction over the out-of-State tortfeasor who's

 5   doing something out of State that has this impact.             It

 6   targets the State, and it has its impact.

 7               MR. GARRE:       I've struggled over that, too,

 8   Justice Ginsburg, but the one thing I can say is that

 9   Congress perceived that enforcement gap that's

10   identified in the statutory findings reproduced in the

11   addendum here.   And Congress, you would presume, acted

12   to fill the gap that it saw, and it did this by keeping

13   it at the State level, keeping in mind that we're

14   talking about something with an enormous potential for

15   volumes of claims.

16               JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, this is the part

17   that's worrying me.      On your side, it's hard, and it's

18   an unusual statute, but the -- certainly -- and I agree

19   with you that the language of the statute suggesting a

20   kind of reverse pre-emption, something like that, and

21   certainly Senator Hollings' comment, and certainly the

22   fact that they specifically provide for an attorney

23   general to bring an action in State court suggests that

24   they wanted the smaller private actions in State -- I

25   mean, in Federal court -- in State court; that favors

 1   you.

 2               All right.      But then I thought, as you were

 3   speaking, what about diversity jurisdiction?              And -- and

 4   I don't see why there wouldn't diversity jurisdiction in

 5   terms of trying to get these out-of-State people.              And

 6   if there's diversity jurisdiction, why in heaven's name

 7   would they want to say but there is no "arising under"

 8   jurisdiction?

 9               MR. GARRE:      Well --

10               JUSTICE BREYER:          So, I'm -- so, I'm pushed

11   the other way by that.      So -- so, what do you think?

12   What do you think?

13               MR. GARRE:      Well, ultimately, all of the

14   Federal circuits that have grappled with this problem

15   have concluded that recognizing diversity jurisdiction

16   isn't fundamentally incompatible with saying there's no

17   Federal question jurisdiction, for a couple of reasons.

18               JUSTICE BREYER:          I know.      But why, if you

19   were sitting in Congress and somebody did tell you --

20   Senator Hollings apparently never thought of this -- but

21   say to Senator Hollings, Senator, there will be

22   diversity jurisdiction here.             And he, when he thinks

23   about it, says, hey, great, that's wonderful, because

24   these people are all in State A, and they're phoning

25   people in State B.

 1               Now, if that was his reaction, then someone

 2   would say what about "arising under" jurisdiction?               And

 3   what I'm thinking is, if I imaginatively put myself in

 4   his position, I think, huh, why not?

 5               MR. GARRE:     For two reasons, Justice Breyer.

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:         What?

 7               MR. GARRE:     The first is amount in

 8   controversy.   Diversity has an amount in controversy

 9   requirement of $75,000, which makes it more likely,

10   where a plaintiff has that, it would be in a situation

11   where it would incur the costs of an attorney and other

12   expenses to go into Federal court.               Federal question has

13   no amount in controversy after --

14               JUSTICE BREYER:         That's true.       So, there's a

15   "flooding the courts" problem.

16               MR. GARRE:     Exactly, and the amount in

17   controversy checks that.

18               The second reason is that, to the extent

19   that Congress created this unique Federal right and

20   intended it to behave like State laws, as Judge

21   Calabresi described it on the Second Circuit, then it's

22   more natural to think of diversity jurisdiction allowing

23   the Federal courts to entertain what is in effect a

24   State cause of action than it would be for Federal

25   question jurisdiction where you have the anomalous

 1   situation of someone going into Federal court and saying

 2   I'm not bound by the State law limitations, for example,

 3   the limitation on the class action, because I can bring

 4   this Federal private right of action under Federal

 5   question for $500 wherever it is.             I mean --

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How about supplemental

 7   jurisdiction?   Which says it doesn't have an amount in

 8   controversy.

 9               MR. GARRE:       We would put that in the same

10   category of diversity, which is to say -- I mean,

11   ultimately, I think it -- particularly if you look at

12   this as the private right of action, Congress did not

13   express a private right of action for someone to go into

14   Federal court here.      If this Court looked at it through

15   the lens of its private right of action jurisprudence,

16   the Court would say, I would think, you did not confer a

17   private right of action to go into Federal court in the

18   unique way that you express it here.

19               If the question was, if this private right

20   of action said you can sue an in-State company and a

21   plaintiff came here saying, well, it says in-State but

22   they didn't say you can't sue an out-of-State, this

23   Court would say, no, Congress said in-State; we --

24   that's the private right of action it created.

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But Congress -- Congress

 1   also -- it made -- for attorney general suits, it said:

 2   And Federal court jurisdiction is exclusive.           So, it's

 3   given Federal court exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate

 4   this claim, because the claim, as you -- I think as you

 5   recognize, is the same whether it's brought by the FCC,

 6   the attorney general, or private.           So, if you use the

 7   word "exclusive" there, it said nothing in this private

 8   right of action about the State courts being exclusive.

 9                MR. GARRE:    And I think on that -- I mean,

10   first, it makes sense that they would authorize Federal

11   jurisdiction for the State attorney generals' actions

12   because they authorized the FCC to intervene there.            It

13   also makes sense that they said "exclusive" there

14   because there they were dealing with the constitutional

15   presumption that State courts have concurrent

16   jurisdiction unless Congress affirmatively says they

17   don't.   This Court had decided Tafflin a year earlier.

18   And so, it -- to give Congress its due, it would make

19   sense if you presume they're aware of this Court's

20   decisions, that it would say "exclusive" there.          The

21   constitutional --

22               JUSTICE ALITO:        You -- you seem to be

23   arguing for a three-tier standard for displacing

24   jurisdiction.   So, if Congress wants to make a Federal

25   claim cognizable only in Federal court, it has to be


                                    38

 1   very, very clear.     If it wants to displace diversity

 2   jurisdiction, it doesn't have to be that clear, but

 3   maybe it has to be certain -- clear to a certain degree.

 4   If it wants to displace Federal question jurisdiction,

 5   it doesn't have to be nearly as clear.

 6                  MR. GARRE:    But we're not.

 7                  JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, what --

 8                  MR. GARRE:    We're certainly not arguing for

 9   a distinction between diversity and Federal question.

10   And ultimately, if pushed, we would take the position

11   that because Congress was clear it wasn't authorizing

12   suit in Federal court, we think diversity should go,

13   too.

14               My response to Justice Breyer was that it --

15   it's a closer call because of the -- the amount in

16   controversy and the extent to which Congress created a

17   right --

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:           When there is suit in

19   Federal court, let's say these attorney general suits,

20   what are the suit -- what is the suit governed by?            Is

21   it governed by State law?

22               MR. GARRE:       I think it would be governed by

23   Federal law.    I think to the extent there's a --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, I mean, I -- Federal

25   law mirroring State law?

 1               MR. GARRE:      No, because the -- the public

 2   right of action isn't conditioned the same way that the

 3   private right of action is.          And --

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Well, it's the authority to

 5   enforce, right?

 6               MR. GARRE:      If you look at the public right

 7   of action, it's not --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Civil actions brought under

 9   the subsection.

10               MR. GARRE:      Right.       The public right of

11   action isn't brought under (b)(3), which is a private

12   right of action.   And the anomalies arise when you think

13   of allowing these claims in Federal court --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:          So, you have a different --

15   a different -- a different law applied if -- and the

16   State law limitations don't apply if it's a suit in

17   Federal court by -- by an attorney general?

18               MR. GARRE:      The State law limitations apply

19   to the private right of action.           The Congress didn't

20   say, here's the Federal --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:          I mean, it's so weird.     I

22   can't understand that.

23               MR. GARRE:      But, Your Honor, it's only weird

24   if you say they can bring the private right of action in

25   Federal court.    If you say that Congress meant these to

 1   be limited to State court, it makes perfect sense.

 2   Congress was making clear:        States, you have authority

 3   to address this problem; you can address it under your

 4   own law and rules of court.

 5                JUSTICE KAGAN:       I think, Mr. Garre, what

 6   Justice Ginsburg and Justice Alito were suggesting, is

 7   that this is a momentous thing for Congress to do to, to

 8   deprive the Federal courts of jurisdiction over a cause

 9   of action that has been created by Congress and a cause

10   of action that has Federal law as the rule of decision.

11   The usual presumption is that, of course, Federal courts

12   have jurisdiction over those matters under section 1331.

13                And this is one peculiar way of divesting

14   those Federal courts of jurisdiction.            Obviously,

15   Congress knew how to write an exclusive jurisdiction

16   statute.   It didn't here.      So, why should we give

17   Congress the benefit of the doubt and sort of say, well,

18   Congress must have had something else in mind, even

19   though Congress didn't articulate that?

20                MR. GARRE:    And if Congress has to say

21   "exclusive," then we lose.        I'm not arguing otherwise.

22   But I think our position is, is what Congress did here

23   was unmistakably different and clear enough.            And the

24   flip side of what you've just said is to say that

25   Congress meant nothing when it went out of its way to


                                    41
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   create what all agree is an extraordinarily unique

 2   private right of action.

 3               JUSTICE KAGAN:        No, I don't think that's

 4   right because this is not superfluous, because of the

 5   that provision that, you know, the Testa provision which

 6   says that State courts don't have to entertain this

 7   cause of action.   So, in the usual case, State courts

 8   would have to entertain this cause of action.            Here,

 9   Congress is saying, no, if they feel as though that

10   would deluge State courts, they have an out.

11               MR. GARRE:     And if Congress had intended

12   that, Your Honor, I think the more natural way for it to

13   have said would -- would have been something like, in an

14   action brought in State court, it may be limited by the

15   laws or rules of that court.            Here Congress cabined the

16   entire right of action:      "may" comma -- subordinate

17   clause which modifies the "may."           And there's just -- in

18   any other case, I think, Your Honor, the Court would

19   read the "if otherwise permitted" clause as modifying

20   the "may" and, therefore, the entire right of action.

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Can Congress create a

22   Federal -- can Congress in effect delegate to the States

23   the contours of a -- a Federal cause of action?           I mean,

24   you keep talking about it as a Federal cause of action.

25               MR. GARRE:     I think --

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:        But it's not really, if --

 2   if its existence or non-existence depends upon State

 3   law; or at least it depends upon State law, you say, if

 4   it's brought in State courts; however, if it's brought

 5   in Federal court by the Attorney General, you have a

 6   totally different law applying, a Federal law.

 7                MR. GARRE:    I think in the Shoshone case

 8   Congress created a right of action whose content was --

 9   was supplied by State law.        So --

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           In which case?   I

11   didn't --

12                MR. GARRE:    The Shoshone Mining case.

13   It's -- it's cited in our brief.

14                JUSTICE KAGAN:       But that is not this case.

15                MR. GARRE:    No --

16                JUSTICE KAGAN:       Nobody thinks that that's

17   this case.

18                MR. GARRE:    No, but we're not saying that

19   this case is on fours with that case, but I think it's

20   an example where State law would fill the content of the

21   Federal right.

22                JUSTICE BREYER:        Well, why wouldn't the --

23   the problem that Justice Scalia just identified or you

24   were talking about suggest -- actually favor their side,

25   that that "in conformity with State law" is talking

 1   about procedure?

 2                 I mean, imagine that State law has a 2-year

 3   limitation period or a 1-year.           You see -- I don't know

 4   what the limitation period is here.               It may be longer.

 5   And so, what happens is where you go into -- if the

 6   attorney general brings the action, you're going to say

 7   it's 4 years, but if it's in a State court and a private

 8   person, it would be 1 year?          That doesn't seem to me to

 9   make sense.

10                 It then seems to make sense if you interpret

11   that provision as saying what court you could go into in

12   the State.    If the State permits you to go to the

13   superior court or the small claims court or the -- in

14   other words, procedural rules.

15                 MR. GARRE:    Well, and Congress didn't just

16   say "procedure," it said "laws or rules of court of the

17   State."

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:        It did, but look what --

19   well, how do you get out of the mess then -- what

20   happens when the State attorney general brings an action

21   in a Federal court, as he is permitted to do?              What

22   statute of limitation or substantive rule do you apply?

23                 MR. GARRE:    It would be the general 4-year

24   Federal statute of limitations.           I mean, the way --

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:        But that's now really odd

 1   because we are then going to get different statutes of

 2   limitations, depending upon whether a State attorney

 3   general or an individual --

 4               MR. GARRE:     But it's not odd if you give

 5   effect to the language of (b)(3), which in a sense says

 6   we're going to leave this up to the States.                  Congress

 7   contemplated through this language that there could be

 8   50 different rules about how private TCPA claims would

 9   be brought in State court.        I think that's undisputed.

10               The question is whether or not you --

11   plaintiffs can just say I want out of that and go into

12   Federal court, and conversely whether a defendant can

13   remove any claim brought in State court --

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               I'm having --

15               MR. GARRE:     -- into Federal court.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Im sorry.    I'm

17   having trouble, Mr. Garre, figuring out what exactly is

18   at issue here.   It seems to me that there are two

19   possible views on it.     First is, is there Federal

20   jurisdiction over one of these actions?               The second of

21   all is, is there a private right of action apart from

22   the one that can be brought under subsection (b)(3),

23   which is one in State court?

24               MR. GARRE:     Right.

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Now, which -- which

 1   are we supposed to decide?         I can see the Federal

 2   question jurisdiction issue being straightforward.

 3   Federal law creates this cause of action; therefore, you

 4   can say that it is -- under 1331, there's jurisdiction,

 5   but then you can't do anything once you're in Federal

 6   court because the private right of action is limited to

 7   State court.

 8                MR. GARRE:     And our position is ultimately

 9   both are at issue.    Certainly, the focus of this case

10   has been on the jurisdictional question, which is the

11   12(b)(1).   But if the Court thinks that there's Federal

12   jurisdiction, then it should say the cause of action

13   fails under 12(b)(6) because both arguments are based on

14   the same exact statutory language.

15               This Court has recognized, for example, in

16   the Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals case, that the

17   availability of a private right of action intersects

18   with jurisdiction.    The Court recognized the same point

19   in the National Passengers Association case, 414 U.S.

20   453.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Let's go back to the --

22   this -- this claim -- unlike the Shoshone Mining, this

23   claim arises under Federal law.           There's no question

24   about that, is there?

25               MR. GARRE:      We don't dispute that, Your

 1   Honor.

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Okay.   So, Federal law

 3   creates the cause of action, and when Federal law

 4   creates the cause of action, the rule has always been

 5   there's 1331 jurisdiction.

 6               MR. GARRE:     Unless a later-enacted statute

 7   precludes that rule.     And here the later-enacted statute

 8   doesn't win it --

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But the later-enacted

10   statute doesn't say that Federal law no longer creates

11   the cause of action.

12               MR. GARRE:     The later-enacted statute

13   creates the cause of action.            Federal -- 1331 doesn't

14   create a cause of action.       It's jurisdictional only.

15   They need to have a cause of action.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            You have jurisdiction

17   when Federal law creates a cause of action.

18               MR. GARRE:     Unless it has been displaced by

19   a later-enacted provision.        And I --

20               JUSTICE KAGAN:        Mr. Garre, do you have any

21   examples of that, places where we've said Congress has

22   divested the court of Federal question jurisdiction and

23   by what means?

24               MR. GARRE:     I don't have an example in 1331.

25   I have do have section 1983, which I think is a perfect

 1   parallel, because there you've got a venerable, general

 2   provision, section 1983, which is actually older than

 3   1331, and the question comes along from time to time

 4   whether a later-enacted Federal right can be enforced

 5   through 1983.    And the Court, in that context, says

 6   although we generally presume that you can go through

 7   1983, if there's a later-enacted specific enforcement

 8   mechanism, we give the facts of that --

 9                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       And how specific does it

10   have to be?    I mean, how vague are we willing to go here

11   and say, okay, Congress has done a good enough job

12   because somehow we have some idea that they wanted these

13   cases to end up in small claims court?

14                 MR. GARRE:    I think, if you look at the City

15   of Rancho Palos Verdes case, which I would encourage you

16   to look at, I think it doesn't have to be nearly as

17   specific as my friend is claiming.

18                 I think you look at all signposts of

19   congressional intent.      Here you've got the language

20   which is unmistakably distinctive.                The State-law,

21   State-court-focused.     You've got a structure of an act

22   where Congress, when it wants concurrent jurisdiction or

23   Federal jurisdiction, it says so.            It provides the rules

24   for venue and what not.       You've got legislative

25   statutory findings indicating that Congress both was

 4   then if you choose to look at it, you've got the

 5   legislative history of the sponsor of this very unusual

 6   provision saying --

 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             When Congress creates a

 8   Federal claim, it usually doesn't.                 I mean, the

 9   assumption is that it's going to be concurrent

10   jurisdiction.

11               MR. GARRE:       Yes, and we're not -- I mean,

12   the question is whether or not that assumption should be

13   displaced here, and we're saying that Congress's

14   expressions of intent displace it here.                And, again, I

15   think if Petitioner --

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Can we go back to your

17   1983 example?   Because I was thinking about that, and

18   you said, well, the later specific statute is another

19   Federal statute.   You have -- Congress has another

20   Federal statute that makes the more general 1983 not

21   available because you have the more specific Federal

22   statute.

23               MR. GARRE:       And I think that's why the

24   parallel seems apt to us here.             You -- instead of

25   dealing with Congress displacing case -- State court

 1   jurisdiction with constitutional presumption, you have

 2   an earlier-enacted Federal statute, 1331, and the

 3   later-enacted statute, the TCPA private right of action

 4   here.

 5                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        Yes, but the difference is

 6   that the 1983 cases don't deal with what this deals

 7   with, which is displacement of the jurisdiction of

 8   Federal courts.     And we are jealous of our jurisdiction,

 9   not only in the constitutional cases that you refer to,

10   but in all cases.

11               And I had thought that the general rule that

12   you have to be clear when you take cases out of the

13   Federal courts -- I thought that that applies not just

14   where you're dealing with a constitutional jurisdiction

15   but also where you're dealing with already-conferred

16   statutory jurisdiction.        And why shouldn't I apply that

17   presumption?

18               MR. GARRE:       But I think this Court has a

19   more generous attitude toward section 1983.          And I think

20   in your opinion in the Rancho Palos Verdes case, you

21   spoke of a rebuttable presumption that Congress doesn't

22   mean to -- to displace section 1983, but yet you found

23   it there because of a specific enforcement mechanism.          I

24   think the enforcement mechanism here is much more

25   specific and meaningful than even the one in the Rancho

 1   Palos Verdes --

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:        It didn't deal with the

 3   jurisdiction of Federal courts.         That's what gets our

 4   hackles up --

 5               MR. GARRE:     It did not --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- when you're telling us

 7   we have been ousted of jurisdiction.

 8               MR. GARRE:     It did not --

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:        We don't like that.

10               (Laughter.)

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Counsel, I -- we've

12   been talking about where this provision fits, basically,

13   into our general jurisprudence in this area.             But I've

14   never seen a statute remotely like this before.             Is

15   there any one, where you have a Federal -- where you

16   have Congress creating a cause of action that can be

17   brought in State courts unless the State court says it

18   can't, saying nothing at all about whether there's a

19   Federal cause of action?     This is the strangest statute

20   I've ever seen.

21               MR. GARRE:    We totally agree, but I think

22   the important point from our perspective is either

23   Congress meant what it said, and this Court should give

24   effect to what it said in its very distinct and unusual

25   way, or it's rendered, you know, largely meaningless,

 1   except in the most generalized sense, because if

 2   Petitioner's right, you can bring a claim in State or

 3   Federal court.    The claim that you bring in Federal

 4   court is in no way limited -- limited by the laws or

 5   rules of a State court.       And all of the stuff that

 6   Congress said about the State courts and the

 7   State-law-focused language at the very beginning of its

 8   cause of action is meaningless, because Congress didn't

 9   have to say any of this to authorize people to go into

10   State court under concurrent jurisdiction conferred by

11   the Constitution.

12               And our position is, is that this Court

13   should give effect to the words in the private right of

14   action, distinct as it is, that Congress created, and

15   hold that Congress did not intend for plaintiffs to be

16   able to bring -- to circumvent these limitations by

17   going into Federal court under 1331.

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Could you tell me why

19   you seem to be taking somewhat contradictory positions?

20   You seem to be conceding that this is not a Federal

21   subject matter jurisdiction issue, but the scope of the

22   cause of action that was created.            The judgment was on

23   the basis of lack of Federal subject matter

24   jurisdiction.    Aren't you trying to alter the judgment?

25   And didn't you need to cross-petition to do that?

 1               MR. GARRE:    Well, I probably wasn't clear

 2   enough, Justice Sotomayor.       Our position is that

 3   ultimately there is no Federal question jurisdiction;

 4   that although it arises under 1331, the specific

 5   provision here was never intended to be enforced through

 6   1331 and, instead, was only authorizing State courts.

 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So, you're saying that a

 8   State could, if it chose, say we're only going to award

 9   actual damages, not the $500 statutory --

10               MR. GARRE:    No, I don't think the State

11   could actually alter what Congress said.         It can -- it

12   can alter, as Congress said, the ability to bring a

13   right of action.

14               Now, I do think this Court could affirm --

15               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         But it can.   It could

16   choose not to enforce that Federal right of action.

17               MR. GARRE:    And in that case, a private

18   citizen would go to a State attorney general and say

19   bring this action on behalf, or go to the FCC and bring

20   an enforcement action.    There are public rights --

21   public ways to enforce that.

22               Just to be clear, we think this Court could

23   affirm on the alternative ground of 12(b)(6), that there

24   is Federal question jurisdiction, but this private right

25   of action doesn't confer a right to go into -- into

 1   Federal court.    My friend has said that that position

 2   has been waived.     Under 12(h) of the Federal Rules of

 3   Civil Procedure, we haven't waived 12(b)(6); we just

 4   haven't asserted yet.

 5                  It's clear that Federal courts can convert

 6   12(b)(1) motions into 12(b)(6) motions, and there'd be

 7   no reason for this Court to remand simply for us to

 8   assert a 12(b)(6) -- put a 12(b)(6) label on the same

 9   position that we would be back before the courts

10   arguing, transforming judicial review into something

11   close to a ping-pong game.

12               JUSTICE ALITO:          Wouldn't that be the oddest

13   creature that's ever been seen, a cause of action

14   created by Congress that is not a claim arising under

15   Federal law?    That's what you'd be saying.

16               MR. GARRE:       No, it would be a claim arising

17   under Federal law without a private right to bring it in

18   Federal court.    And it would be odd, Your Honor, and our

19   position -- we agree with our friends -- that this is an

20   odd statutory provision.        We ask this Court to give

21   effect to its language, which both sides agree is odd

22   but, we think, points to the conclusion that Congress

23   meant for these claims to be brought in State court and

24   not in Federal court under Federal question

25   jurisdiction.

 1               JUSTICE KAGAN:        But I guess that's the

 2   question, Mr. Garre.     If both sides agree it's odd, and

 3   all nine Justices agree it's odd, I mean, I think we can

 4   say this statute is odd.      And the question is, where do

 5   we go from there?   And where -- you know, what's the

 6   default position?   If it's odd and we can't figure it

 7   out, the default position seems to be Federal courts

 8   have jurisdiction over Federal questions.

 9               MR. GARRE:     But I think that that

10   deprives -- yes, it's odd, but it's odd in a way that

11   one must presume that Congress actually meant what --

12   what it was doing in several different ways here.              I

13   think it gets to a point where you just can't presume

14   that Congress didn't mean the impact of its words here.

15   So, we would urge this Court to give effect to them.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, counsel.

21                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

22               MR. NELSON:      I want to start where Justice

23   Kagan left off, which is the presumption of the

24   existence of Federal jurisdiction unless Congress

25   affirmatively displaces it.

 1               My friend suggested that that may not apply

 2   or may not apply as strongly when we're talking about

 3   Federal statutory jurisdiction and specifically 1331.

 4   But this Court's decision in Colorado River, cited in

 5   our reply brief, says exactly the opposite:               that a

 6   subsequent more specific Federal statute does not

 7   displace the general grant of Federal jurisdiction under

 8   1331, absent -- absent some clearer indication than the

 9   mere existence of an optional State court jurisdiction

10   over the claim.

11               As to the oddness of the statute, a point on

12   which we all seem to now agree, the point I would make

13   there is I think that Respondent's position makes this

14   statute even odder, because it suggests that somehow

15   "may" means it may only be brought in Federal court, yet

16   it doesn't mean it may only be brought in Federal court

17   if there's diversity or 1367.

18               But as Judge Easterbrook said in Brill, if

19   "may" really means "may" only, then it wipes out

20   diversity and 1367 as well.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Are you arguing only

22   about "arising under" jurisdiction or are you arguing

23   also about a Federal cause of action that can be brought

24   in Federal court?   In other words, I am trying to figure

25   out what we're being asked to decide in this odd case.

 1   I understand the idea -- and I'm sorry to take up your

 2   time -- I understand the idea that this is a Federal

 3   question because it's created by a Federal law.

 4                 Can you go -- get into Federal court, and

 5   then we'll have another case about whether you can bring

 6   a cause of action there?

 7                 MR. NELSON:     Well, I certainly hope not,

 8   Your Honor.    I mean, I think if you look at what the

 9   question presented is and what the judgment below is,

10   it's a question of subject matter jurisdiction, a

11   12(b)(1) dismissal, and a question presented as to the

12   existence of 1331.    But, you know, our point is not to

13   get people into Federal court so that they can be told

14   that they have no right of action.                And the answer to

15   that point is that the -- the reference to State courts

16   in the provision is not a limitation on the right to

17   recovery.

18                 Congress often actually creates rights of

19   action that refer to a particular court.                It's -- it's

20   the Federal court in -- in every case but this one.                But

21   as in RICO, as in the Carmack Amendment that was the

22   subject of the 1912 case of Galveston, Harrisburg, and

23   San Antonio Railway cited in our briefs, where the

24   Carmack Amendment said that persons damaged might make

25   complaint in any circuit or district court of the United

 1   States.   And the Communications Act provisions that we

 2   cite on page 10 of our reply say people have certain

 3   rights to recover, and they may bring them in Federal

 4   court.

 5               But those references to the courts have

 6   never been considered to be a limit on the right of

 7   action.   Creating the ability to go into a court and

 8   obtain a recovery creates a right of action, and it's

 9   transitory; it can be brought in any court of competent

10   jurisdiction.   And the reference in the statute to a

11   court that has jurisdiction over it does not mean that

12   the -- that the cause of action somehow does not exist

13   outside of that court.

14               The cause of action exists, and the question

15   is, is whether there's a jurisdictional basis.          And

16   that's practically at this point, I think, been

17   conceded, that this statute arises under Federal law.

18   And there's really no indication whatsoever that merely

19   by saying "may" be brought in State court, that Congress

20   intended to displace Federal jurisdiction or to create a

21   right of action that, uniquely among Federal rights of

22   action, is only available in the State court.

23               Now, it's true, "may" -- or "if otherwise

24   permitted," as my friend said, modifies "may," but it

25   doesn't just modify "may" in isolation.          It's "may"

 1   what?   May if otherwise permitted bring an action in

 2   State court.   So, the "if otherwise permitted" modifies

 3   the conditions on which the action may be brought in

 4   State court.   But it really makes no sense whatsoever to

 5   import State court rules into whether the action is

 6   available in a Federal court.

 7               Now --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:          Except that that's the only

 9   section that creates a private right of action.

10               MR. NELSON:       That's right.          The private

11   right of action is created, but the private right of

12   action is not contingent on that "if."               It's the ability

13   to bring it in State court.
