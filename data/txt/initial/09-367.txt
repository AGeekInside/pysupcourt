 7                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN

 8                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                  MS. KARLAN:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10   and may it please the Court:

11                  The Mandatory Victim Restitution Act makes

12   restitution a mandatory part of a defendant's sentence

13   for certain crimes, and it sets out two paths by which a

14   district court can meet its responsibilities.

15                  First, section 3663A(a)(1) authorizes

16   district courts to impose restitution when sentencing a

17   defendant; that is, at the same time that they impose

18   terms of imprisonment, fines, probation, or the like.

19   Second, section 3664(d)(5) of the Act allows final

20   determination of the amount of restitution to occur

21   during a period not to exceed 90 days.

22                  Once those periods and the general deadlines

23   for correcting or appealing a sentence have passed, a

24   court's judgment is final, even if it fails to order

25   restitution.     In this, the Mandatory Victim Restitution


                                          3

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Act is like all other mandatory sentencing provisions,

 2   and as this Court confirmed 2 years ago in Greenlaw v.

 3   United States, when a court fails to impose a mandatory

 4   sentence, that error can be corrected only by following

 5   what this Court called the dispositive direction

 6   regarding sentencing errors.

 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Excuse me.   Is your

 8   argument that if the district court -- for whatever

 9   reason, unlikely as it may be -- starts a hearing the

10   day after the rest of the sentence was imposed and has

11   to continue that hearing for 91 days before it can

12   render a judgment --

13               MS. KARLAN:        No.

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             -- that it's now barred

15   from entering that judgment?

16               MS. KARLAN:        No.     If I understand your

17   question correctly, the district court has imposed

18   sentence on day one announcing imprisonment.              Any time

19   during the next 90 days, it has a power to set a date

20   and make final determination of the restitution amount.

21   Once that 90-day period has run -- in this case, on

22   October 28th, because the sentencing occurred on

23   July 30th -- the district court loses the authority to

24   impose restitution.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:           And the sentence is not


                                       4

 1   final until then?

 2                  MS. KARLAN:       That's our position.

 3                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           And -- and what if -- what

 4   if the court does set a date for additional sentencing?

 5   Then it's not final until then, right?

 6                  MS. KARLAN:       No, Justice Scalia.          It would

 7   be that once a court has started the sentencing process,

 8   it has 90 days within which to complete that process, if

 9   it announces at the initial sentencing that it intends

10   to hold open the sentence for final determination of

11   restitution.

12                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             I -- I'm not sure I

13   understood your response to my question.                  It must impose

14   that restitution order, complete all its proceedings

15   within the 90-day period?

16                  MS. KARLAN:       Yes, that's correct.

17                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So it can't hold a

18   hearing over from the 90th day to the 91st day?

19                  MS. KARLAN:       No, it cannot do that.          And if

20   it were to do that in a case where restitution were

21   mandatory, the sentence would become final, the

22   government would file an appeal, and that appeal would

23   certainly succeed, because it's plain error not to have

24   to imposed the restitution.

25                  JUSTICE ALITO:            Your position is that if the


                                          5

 1   court puts off the order of restitution for 90 days,

 2   during that period, the defendant cannot take an appeal?

 3                MS. KARLAN:        If the court has announced at

 4   the initial sentencing that it intends to do so, no, then

 5   it cannot.

 6                JUSTICE ALITO:             Isn't that dramatically

 7   contrary to the way criminal appeals have been handled

 8   for a long time?    There's a very short period of time

 9   for a defendant to file a notice of appeal in a criminal

10   case, and you're saying that that is dramatically

11   extended by the possibility of -- of restitution later

12   on or by the fact that the restitution order will be

13   entered later?

14                MS. KARLAN:        No, Justice Alito.       What I'm

15   saying is that a defendant can only appeal from a final

16   sentence, and until the restitutionary term is imposed

17   within the time period allowed by the MVRA, there is not

18   a final sentence.    Then he has from the time that

19   restitution is --

20                JUSTICE ALITO:             Yes, I understand that.     But

21   you're saying the defendant is -- the defendant is

22   incarcerated, let's say; is convicted, is sentenced to

23   prison.   The defendant wants to take a quick appeal.

24   The defendant thinks he's going to win on appeal.                 And

25   you're saying, well, no, you have to wait 90 days

 1   before you can file your notice of appeal?

 2                MS. KARLAN:       I believe that's correct,

 3   because he has to have a final judgment before he can

 4   appeal.

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, what -- what do you

 6   do about the further provision that at any time later,

 7   if the government -- or the victim finds additional

 8   basis for restitution, so long as after discovering it,

 9   within 60 days after that, the victim can come to the

10   court and ask for restitution?              What does that do?

11                Does that --

12                MS. KARLAN:       Well --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I mean, doesn't that

14   necessarily mean that there are indeed two final

15   judgments?   That -- that one has to be -- has to go up

16   on its own, doesn't it?

17                MS. KARLAN:       That's correct, but section

18   3664(o) of the statute says that the initial restitution

19   amount constitutes a final judgment, even though there

20   can be amendment after it's been entered.

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Where is that?

22                MS. KARLAN:       In our brief, it's on page --

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Oh.     Oh -- "a sentence that

24   imposes an order" --

25                MS. KARLAN:       It's on page --

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- "is a final judgment,

 2   notwithstanding the fact that" --

 3               MS. KARLAN:        Yes, petition appendix 60a.

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Got you.

 5               MS. KARLAN:        So that's why that has to be in

 6   there, because otherwise the defendant really would be

 7   in the position that Justice Alito --

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Is there any circuit

 9   court who has addressed this issue of when an appeal is

10   timely, in a situation in which a restitution order has

11   not been entered at the initial sentencing?

12               MS. KARLAN:        Not in precisely that way.

13   There are a couple of cases that are -- that kind of

14   circle around that.

15               So for example, Kapelushnik, which we cite

16   in our petition for certiorari and in our brief as the

17   wisest way of thinking about this, held that once the

18   90 days has lapsed, the judgment is final by operation

19   of law.

20               There's an opinion by Judge Posner in the

21   Seventh Circuit that's not on restitution but on a

22   related issue, which says that if you have several

23   components to the sentence, until that last component is

24   entered, the time for filing an appeal under F.R.A.P. 4

25   does not begin to run.       And that's --

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                In this -- when the

 2   judge did not enter a date for restitution, did you

 3   object to that?

 4               MS. KARLAN:       We were not required to do so,

 5   so we did not.

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, why not?        It

 7   seems that that's when the violation occurred.                    The

 8   statute said the court shall set a date if they're not

 9   ready to calculate the restitution, and he didn't do

10   that.

11               MS. KARLAN:       Well, that's correct,

12   Mr. Chief Justice, but the statute doesn't say when he

13   has to set the date.     The statute simply says the date

14   has to be set so that final restitution will occur

15   during the period -- and here I quote again from the

16   statute -- "not to exceed 90 days."                    So he can set that

17   date once he gets the information from --

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, I thought it

19   says -- maybe I am misreading it.               It says the court --

20   this is at sentencing.      When sentencing -- you look at

21   the previous provision -- what is it?                   3663A(a)(1) --

22              MS. KARLAN:      Yes.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- talks about what

24   you do when sentencing it.

25               MS. KARLAN:       Right.

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And the statute

 2   says, "the court shall set a date for the final

 3   determination" ... "not to exceed 90 days."                 And he didn't.

 4                  MS. KARLAN:       That's correct, he did not set

 5   it.     But the statute -- I'm now looking at petition

 6   appendix 55a, which is where section 3664(d)(5) of the

 7   Act is set out.     It says, "The court shall set a date

 8   for the final determination of the victim's losses, not

 9   to exceed 90 days after sentencing."

10                  The 90 days modifies the final

11   determination.     It doesn't modify the setting of the

12   date.     So within that 90-day period, I think

13   that what was --

14                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, I think that's

15   right.     I -- I agree with you that.

16                  MS. KARLAN:       Yes.

17                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                In other words, the

18   final determination -- the date for the -- the final

19   determination can't exceed 90 days --

20                 MS. KARLAN:      Right.

21                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- but that doesn't

22   mean that the provision saying the court shall set a date

23   can wait -- that he can wait 89 days to do that.

24                  MS. KARLAN:       No, I think it would be very

25   unwise for a district court to do that, but the court


                                         10

 1   can't really set the date until it receives the

 2   information that it hopes to receive from the probation

 3   office or from the victim.             So that --

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  No, no, no --

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              It can say 90 days.         It

 6   can say 90 days.

 7                MS. KARLAN:         It -- it could, yes.           Or it

 8   could say, as the district court did here, I'm going to

 9   hold open the date.       But it can only hold open that date

10   until the point at which it actually imposes the

11   restitution, within the 90 days.

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              This is a -- this is, in

13   one respect, Ms. Karlan, a technical argument, is it

14   not?   Because it's true that this defendant, from the

15   probation officer's report, knew within the 90 days what

16   restitution was going to be recommended.

17                MS. KARLAN:         Yes.       He knew within the

18   90 days what the government's claim was going to be, but

19   the court did not hold the hearing and did not impose

20   the judgment.     And so the August 8th judgment became

21   final by operation of law on October 28th, because that

22   was 90 days after the July 30th sentencing.

23                At that point, the government could have

24   filed an appeal in this case, and, quite frankly, they

25   would have won.     As it was --

 1                JUSTICE ALITO:          How is your position -- how

 2   is your position consistent with the thrust of the

 3   victims' rights legislation that Congress has enacted in

 4   recent years, including the statute that's before us

 5   here?

 6                Now, in this case, the victim -- the

 7   victim's medical bills were paid by the United States.

 8   But that isn't always going to be the case, and

 9   sometimes victims are going to have a lot of lost

10   income.   So you have the victim, like the victim here,

11   who is beaten to a pulp by a defendant and loses a

12   substantial amount of future income as a result, and you

13   say that if the judge makes a mistake, it's just too bad

14   for the victim.   The victim gets nothing because the

15   judge waited too long.

16                MS. KARLAN:       No, I don't --

17                JUSTICE ALITO:          Do you think that's what

18   Congress had in mind?

19                MS. KARLAN:       I don't say that, and I don't

20   think that's what Congress had in mind.                 First, what

21   Congress had in mind was to strike the balance it struck

22   in this statute, which was to give victims the right to

23   receive restitution as part of a criminal sentence, as

24   long as it was done within 90 days of sentencing.

25                Second, the government can appeal if a court


                                       12

 1   doesn't follow the rules.

 2                 Third --

 3                 JUSTICE ALITO:           Yes, but wasn't -- wasn't

 4   the whole thrust of the victims' rights legislation that

 5   up to that point, Congress thought prosecutors were not

 6   sufficiently attending to the rights and the interests

 7   of victims?     They were doing their own prosecutorial

 8   thing, but they weren't involving victims, making sure

 9   they knew about court proceedings, and so forth.

10                 And you're saying, well, if the court makes

11   a mistake and the prosecution falls down in its

12   responsibility, the person who suffers is the victim who

13   gets victimized again.

14                 MS. KARLAN:        No, that's not what I'm saying.

15   What I'm saying is Congress struck a balance.                     They

16   wanted to give restitution to victims.                     They also wanted

17   final sentencing for defendants.                 Congress struck that

18   balance by giving a 90-day extension.                     It didn't provide --

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, you're not

20   really -- you're not really answering Justice Alito's

21   question.     He says he understands that, as I understand

22   the question.     We understand that argument.

23                 But it doesn't address the fact that the net

24   result of your argument is (a) unfair to the victim and

25   (b) inconsistent with the whole design and thrust of the


                                         13

 1   Victims Act.

 2               MS. KARLAN:        It's --

 3                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And you, it seems to me,

 4   have to say:     So be it; the technical rule prevails.

 5   That's too bad.

 6                  I mean, that's your argument, it seems

 7   to me.

 8                  MS. KARLAN:       No, my argument is Congress

 9   struck that balance, and in some cases, yes, too bad --

10                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Of course, the same thing

11   would happen if the trial judge makes a mistake of law

12   which causes the -- the defendant to be acquitted, so

13   that he not only escapes the liability to the victim, he

14   escapes any -- any criminal punishment.                       It happens all

15   the time.   The judge makes a mistake; society pays for

16   it.

17                  MS. KARLAN:       That's correct, and Congress

18   here has said 90 days.         And they meant it.                If they had

19   meant to say, at any time, a victim can receive

20   restitution, they would have said that.

21                  JUSTICE BREYER:           But Congress says -- to

22   paraphrase and not get it accurate -- that the

23   Department of Transportation shall enact a rule

24   governing tire safety within 9 months from the

25   effective date of this legislation.                       And the Department

 1   of Transportation fails to do that.                      It doesn't

 2   promulgate its law for 18 months.                 Is that law invalid?

 3   The rule?

 4                MS. KARLAN:        No, generally, under this --

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:            Of course, it isn't.

 6                MS. KARLAN:      Because that's --

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:            So how is this different?

 8                MS. KARLAN:        Well, this is a criminal

 9   sentencing statute which is different than a civil

10   agency action.

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I understand that point.

12   I'm just asking what's a relevant difference?

13                 MS. KARLAN:       That is the incredibly relevant

14   difference, for the following reason --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Because?

16                 MS. KARLAN:       -- that finality in sentencing

17   is important, because otherwise a defendant cannot even

18   appeal his conviction.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Why couldn't he?

20                 MS. KARLAN:       Because he --

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:           You just read us the

22   provision.

23                 MS. KARLAN:       It's not a final --

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:           The judge enters a -- an

25   order, a final order.       And that final judgment, as was


                                        15

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   true here, says:    I haven't decided restitution yet.            He

 2   can appeal.    Then what it says is when you get around to

 3   the restitution, then enter another judgment, and you'll

 4   appeal that, as happens precisely in the case of

 5   the 60 days -- you know, that extra stuff that Justice

 6   Scalia was referring to.          That's a possible

 7   interpretation of the Federal Rules of Appellate

 8   Procedure.    I don't see, you know, the appeals thing.               I

 9   don't see anything -- I don't have in front of me the

10   language on filing an appeal, but I can't think of

11   anything that's contrary.

12                 MS. KARLAN:       What's contrary to that is

13   that the Federal courts of appeals only have

14   jurisdiction to decide cases that come up, in criminal

15   cases, on final judgment or under the collateral order.

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:           That's right.

17                MS. KARLAN:      This is not --

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:           It's a final judgment, and

19   because there is another provision that says an order of

20   restitution is itself a final judgment.

21                 MS. KARLAN:       No.      With all respect,

22   Justice Breyer, there is no provision that says an order

23   of restitution --

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:           You read it to us.   I mean

25   the one you read to us.


                                        16

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                MS. KARLAN:       No.      That says --

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:           What?

 3                MS. KARLAN:       -- that a sentence that

 4   includes a term of restitution can be a final judgment,

 5   even though that 60-day provision to which

 6   Justice Scalia pointed is on the books.

 7                But you can't have a final judgment in a

 8   criminal case that involves several different components

 9   of a sentence until those aspects of the sentence have

10   actually been imposed.

11                JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, why isn't the --

12                MS. KARLAN:       Justice Scalia, I believe, was

13   referring to the 60-day provision.

14                JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes, the same problem.

15                MS. KARLAN:       The 60-day provision is

16   specifically immunized from the final judgment rule by

17   section 3664(o) of the statute.               The 90-day provision is

18   not.   So until a defendant -- perhaps I could -- perhaps

19   I could use a slightly different example, which is:

20   Suppose a defendant is supposed to be a sentenced to a

21   fine, a mandatory fine --

22               JUTICE BREYER:         I see.

23                MS. KARLAN:       -- and a mandatory prison sentence.

24   If you sentence him to the mandatory prison sentence and

25   say I still need to calculate the fine -- there is no


                                       17

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   final judgment.     He cannot appeal that sentence.

 2                  JUSTICE ALITO:          But isn't there a difference

 3   between those two situations?               A fine is a criminal

 4   penalty.     It goes -- it -- the prosecution is brought in

 5   the same of the sovereign.             The fine goes to the

 6   sovereign.     It's a traditional criminal penalty.

 7                  Restitution is not a traditional criminal

 8   penalty.     It's much like, arguably, attorneys' fees in a

 9   civil case.     It is -- it is like -- it is really a -- a

10   benefit for the victim.          It is not something that inures

11   to the benefit of the sovereign.

12                  And so why doesn't it make sense to view

13   that judgment of restitution as a separate judgment,

14   just as the award of an attorney's fees is a separate

15   final appealable order in a civil case?

16                  MS. KARLAN:       Well, because this judgment of

17   restitution is not a civil judgment.                      It is part of the

18   defendant's criminal punishment, and, therefore, it is

19   not like attorneys' fees, something that's separate.

20                  As we point out in our reply brief, in order

21   to calculate the amount of imprisonment, in order to

22   calculate the fine, the Federal criminal sentencing

23   provisions -- and I should note that section 3664(a)

24   appears in Title 18 in the section under miscellaneous

25   sentencing provisions, not civil provisions.                      All of


                                         18

 1   those things interact.        And so you can't calculate one

 2   of those without knowing all of them.

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But, functionally, isn't

 4   it a substitute for the remedy that the victim of a

 5   crime might have?    Wasn't what Congress was trying to do

 6   was to spare the victim the necessity of suing the

 7   defendant and having his kind of civil restitution

 8   tacked onto the criminal proceeding?

 9                 MS. KARLAN:       That's certainly Congress's

10   purpose, but they did it within the context of

11   sentencing.    So, for example, Justice Ginsburg, if this

12   really were a civil penalty, defendants would not be

13   entitled to the assistance of counsel in challenging the

14   amount of restitution, because the Sixth Amendment would

15   not apply.    The dates for filing an appeal would be

16   different.    There would be a jurisdictional bar that

17   doesn't exist in criminal cases.

18                 This Court said several times that

19   restitution under these kinds of circumstances -- in

20   Hughey, under the predecessor to this Act, and in Kelly

21   v. Robinson -- is a penal statute.                  Justice Sotomayor in

22   her opinion for the Second Circuit in Varrone said this

23   is a penal statute.

24                 So there is no question here that this is a

25   substitute for a civil remedy or a supplement for a


                                        19

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   civil remedy, but it is a criminal punishment.                 And

 2   Congress has said that you have to order it at

 3   sentencing or within 90 days, or else it is error that

 4   can be corrected through Rule 35 or by appeal, but not

 5   otherwise.

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Now, what -- what can the

 7   defendant do within that 90 days?                He has to wait

 8   90 days before he appeals the sentence that he has been

 9   given; is that right?

10                MS. KARLAN:       That's correct.          There is not a

11   final judgment in his case.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:           That's 3 months that --

13   that he has to sit on his hands.

14                MS. KARLAN:       That's correct.

15                JUSTICE BREYER:           Where does it say that?

16                MS. KARLAN:       Well, the final judgment rule

17   says that.

18                JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, this is a court-made

19   rule of what counts as a final judgment.

20                MS. KARLAN:       Right.         And -- and --

21                JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.       Is there

22   anything in the decisions of this Court interpreting

23   that rule?   I mean, you could have collateral orders.               You

24   could have all kinds of things.               And doesn't it boil down

25   to the same question?


                                       20

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               I mean, I agree with you that if Congress

 2   wanted to make a 90-day deadline, you really have to do

 3   it, and you can't restitute thereafter.                  All right.

 4   That's one thing.     But if they didn't, why didn't they

 5   equally intend the judgment without the restitution

 6   order to be a final judgment?

 7               MS. KARLAN:       Well --

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:           And then later on, just as

 9   in (o), if the judge does impose an order of restitution,

10   then of course, that's appealable, and that's a different

11   judgment.   Is there -- what in the law prevents the --

12   that interpretation?

13               MS. KARLAN:         I think two things prevent that

14   interpretation.

15               JUSTICE BREYER:             Yes.

16               MS. KARLAN:         One is this Court's precedent,

17   and let me talk about that.             And two is a proper reading

18   of section 3664(o).      So I'll turn first to the

19   precedent and then to 3664(o).

20               JUSTICE BREYER:             So you have precedent.

21               MS. KARLAN:         So the precedent is, for

22   example, this Court said in Parr v. United States, which

23   is cited on page 12 of the reply brief, among other

24   places, that "a judgment or decision is final for purpose

25   of appeal only when it terminates the litigation between the


                                        21

 1   parties on the merits of the case, and leaves nothing to

 2   be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined."

 3                 Until restitution has been determined, a

 4   case does not fit within Parr.             Parr is, I believe, an

 5   interpretation of 1291, 28 U.S.C. 1291, which is the

 6   provision that gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction.

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              So you can -- under

 8   your view, you can change the amount of jail time up to

 9   the point at which you have to set the restitution.               The

10   judge says:    I'm going to sentence you to 3 years, and

11   I'm going to figure out the restitution.

12                 He looks, and the restitution turns out to

13   be a lot more than he thought.             So he says:    Well, I'm

14   only going to give you 2 years.             Or it's less, and he

15   says:    I'm going to give you 4 years.

16                 Because the judgment is still open, he can

17   do that?

18                 MS. KARLAN:     I believe, Your Honor, that he

19   can.    And the reason for that is the sentencing statute

20   itself -- 18 U.S.C. section 3553, I believe it is --

21   talks about how a court, in sentencing a defendant, is

22   supposed to be considering all of these penalties and

23   how they interact with one another.

24                 So if a defendant can make restitution to a

25   victim by, for example, being put on community release



                                        22

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   or probation rather than serving time in prison, a court

 2   can take that into account in setting the sentence.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Must take it into account --

 4               MS. KARLAN:      Yes.

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:          -- if you read 3553 the way

 6   it's written.

 7                MS. KARLAN:       Yes, I think they must take it

 8   into account.   Now, whether -- how they'll actually

 9   strike that balance is --

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is there no -- is there

11   no possibility that a judge could say:                  I want to make

12   this analogous to 54(b) under the civil rules; that is,

13   I don't want to delay the time that the defendant can

14   appeal from the -- from the -- from the sentence.                  So

15   this order is final, and 3 months later, I'll take up

16   the question of restitution when all the information is

17   in.   The court is prevented from doing that?

18                MS. KARLAN:       I'm unaware of any criminal

19   rules analogue to Rule 54(b) in the civil context, because

20   in general, as I understand the way this Court's

21   precedents have worked, there have been what might look

22   like interlocutory appeals in criminal cases, but they've

23   always involved collateral issues.

24                And the problem here, for the reason that

25   Justice Scalia just pointed to, is restitution and the


                                       23

 1   amount of imprisonment are not collateral to one

 2   another; that is, they may interact.                    And a fine

 3   certainly isn't, because the statute itself says you

 4   can't impose a fine to the extent that it will impair

 5   restitution.   So if --

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So the judge -- but the

 7   judge could say -- once she thinks she needs -- that

 8   they need time for more information:                    I'm going to

 9   defer the whole sentencing.            So, Defendant, you'll have to

10   wait 3 months to find out how much time you're going to

11   serve.   That would be all right.             You could use the

12   90-day period to extend the time for imposing the

13   sentence.

14               Well, in effect, you're saying the sentence

15   isn't final, so she could change it any time within the

16   90 days?

17               MS. KARLAN:       There's a slight complication

18   there, but I think the answer to your question is yes;

19   that is, the judge could delay the entire sentencing

20   under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.

21               Look, we're not saying that you couldn't

22   get restitution in a case like this.                    We're simply

23   saying that you have to follow the rules.

24               JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.         Well, what about

25   that as a possible answer?          If we accept -- the -- the judge,


                                       24

 1   of course, could say to the defendant:                   I'm not going to

 2   sentence you; I'm not going to put that sentence -- I'm

 3   not going to sentence you at all --

 4               MS. KARLAN:        That's correct.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:           -- for 100 days.

 6               MS. KARLAN:        That's correct.

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:           And your remedy, then,

 8   might be to ask for mandamus, if that was too long a

 9   period?

10               MS. KARLAN:        It -- it might be.                I --

11               JUSTICE BREYER:           And -- and -- so why

12   wouldn't that be similar here?             If the judge is going to

13   go after the 90 days, he'd have the power to do it,

14   but it would be like a continuance, and he'd have to

15   exercise that reasonably.

16               MS. KARLAN:        Because you have to follow the

17   rules as laid down.

18               JUSTICE BREYER:           No, no.          I know.     You're

19   interpreting it literally, and --

20               MS. KARLAN:        Yes.      Yes.

21               JUSTICE BREYER:           -- and that's --

22               MS. KARLAN:        -- that is, there are many

23   mechanisms for ensuring that a victim --

24               JUSTICE BREYER:           But I mean, if I thought,

25   for argument's sake --

 1             MS. KARLAN:        You can't --

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:        -- that Congress doesn't care about

 3   whether it's after 90 days -- it was just to sort of

 4   speed things up -- on that assumption, wouldn't you

 5   still have a remedy, because it would be like the

 6   unreasonable continuance?

 7                 MS. KARLAN:      That's correct.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:        That is correct?        I've got

 9   it?

10                 MS. KARLAN:      If -- if you -- you can't have

11   a continuance from the 90 days.             You can have a

12   continuance --

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:        No, no.         I'm thinking of --

14                 MS. KARLAN:      -- of sentencing itself.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:        I'm thinking of the

16   general problems --

17                 MS. KARLAN:      Yes.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:        -- of continuances for

19   sentencing.

20                 MS. KARLAN:      Yes, that's correct.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:        And your argument is that

22   90 days is long enough?

23                 MS. KARLAN:      That's correct.

24             JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay.       I've got it.

25                 MS. KARLAN:      And I'd like to reserve the

 1   remainder --

 2               JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask you one

 3   question?

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I -- I have a question going

 5   just to that.   It seems to me that if 3553, as -- as I said

 6   -- maybe you shouldn't have agreed -- requires the

 7   sentencing court to consider the totality of the

 8   sentence it's imposing, including the restitution,

 9   that would mean that the judge cannot impose a sentence

10   before the expiration of the 90 days; that is, has to

11   wait until the restitutionary issue is resolved to

12   impose the incarceration part of the sentence.              No?

13               MS. KARLAN:        I think the way that the

14   statute is written contemplates that the judge will do

15   the regular sentencing at which he imposes these other

16   terms, but may keep it open for 90 days.

17               JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask this question

18   before you sit down?      Are you aware -- maybe you cite

19   them in the briefs and I didn't catch it -- of any cases

20   in which the courts -- a court of appeals has

21   dismissed an appeal because it was taken before the --

22   the civil remedy had been imposed?

23               MS. KARLAN:        I'm not aware of a case that

24   does that directly under the Mandatory Victims

25   Restitution Act.

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, counsel.

 2                Mr. Heytens.

 3                ORAL ARGUMENT OF TOBY J. HEYTENS

 4                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 5               MR. HEYTENS:           Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 6   and may it please the Court:

 7                To begin by addressing the question just

 8   raised by Justice Stevens, the government agrees that we

 9   are not aware of any cases that directly confront this

10   finality question.      There are, however, at least four

11   cases in the courts of appeals where one of two things

12   happened:   Either the defendant took an appeal from the

13   original term of his imprisonment, then later took an

14   appeal from the order of restitution and the appeals

15   were consolidated.      That happened, among other things,

16   in the Cheal case, which is the First Circuit decision

17   cited in our brief.       There are at least two other

18   circuit court cases that do that as well.

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Was it within the 90 days?

20                MR. HEYTENS:          No.      It --

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:             The restitution sentence

22   was after the 90 days?

23                MR. HEYTENS:          That's correct,

24   Justice Scalia.   Now --

25                JUSTICE STEVENS:             In those -- in those -- in


                                         28

 1   that case, or any of those four cases, did they discuss

 2   the problem of whether there was -- both appeals were

 3   proper?

 4                MR. HEYTENS:        Justice Stevens, I'm not

 5   aware of any case that squarely --

 6                JUSTICE STEVENS:           They just went ahead and

 7   consolidated?

 8                MR. HEYTENS:        That's correct, Justice

 9   Stevens.   I'm not aware of any case that directly

10   confronts this issue.      Now --

11                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Under your view of

12   things, however, that's fortuity that the underlying

13   conviction was still in the appeal process, because

14   there is no statute of limitations under your reading.

15   A victim could come 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 100 years

16   later and say:   I'm entitled to restitution.

17                MR. HEYTENS:        The statute --

18                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             And absent prejudice to

19   the defendant, that would be okay?

20                MR. HEYTENS:        Absent prejudice or some sort

21   of double jeopardy problem, that's correct.              The

22   statute, by its terms, says as long as the victim comes

23   forward within 60 days of the discovery of his losses,

24   (d)(5) expressly says that the victim can do that.               So I

25   think this --


                                       29

 1                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              I'm sorry, that's

 2   60 days after the restitution order has been issued.                       Am

 3   I --

 4                 MR. HEYTENS:         I believe that's incorrect,

 5   Your Honor.    The provision that we're referring to,

 6   subsection (d)(5), is reproduced on page 6A of the

 7   appendix to the government's brief.                       It's the, I

 8   believe, second sentence of (d)(5) that we're

 9   discussing right now that states:                  "If the victim

10   subsequently discovers further losses, the victim shall

11   have 60 days after the discovery of those losses in

12   which to petition the court for an amended restitution

13   order."

14                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              That 60 days says after

15   there has been an -- a restitution order.                       I'm positing

16   the situation where the victim comes 10 years later.

17                 MR. HEYTENS:         That's correct.

18                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              That says there's no

19   restitution order.      It's the initial action.                   And

20   you're saying that's okay?             It's an endless statute?

21                 MR. HEYTENS:         It is -- it is certainly not

22   okay, Your Honor.     Congress has directed that this

23   determination must be made and that it must be made

24   within 90 days.     And Federal district courts are

25   required to comply with that obligation.

 1               But what Congress has not done is to specify

 2   a consequence that occurs in the situation where the --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:              But it -- it -- it's sort

 4   of a ridiculous consequence that 5 years later, and

 5   the judge who tried the original case is dead.

 6               I think it's bad enough to have the issue of

 7   whether this victim suffered $100,000 damages

 8   decided by the judge, if that's what you're going to be

 9   sentenced to, but at least it's being decided by the

10   judge who tried the case.            And under your proposal, it

11   can be decided by some other judge who is just -- just

12   pulled in, because the -- the trial judge has -- has

13   been deceased.     That doesn't seem to me to make any

14   sense at all.

15               MR. HEYTENS:           Your Honor, I don't think it

16   is our proposal.     Congress has not specified -- Congress

17   has certainly required this to be done within 90 days.

18   That meant Congress wanted it to be done within 90 days.

19   But Congress has not specified a consequence for --

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, the

21   consequence is the usual consequence when trial courts

22   make errors, which is to appeal.

23               MR. HEYTENS:           Your Honor, I think this Court

24   said in Montalvo-Murillo what the consequence is in this

25   category of cases, which is when a trial court fails to


                                         31

 1   comply with a mandatory time limitation for doing

 2   something that the court is required to do, the remedy

 3   is -- unless Congress provides otherwise, such as it

 4   does in the Speedy Trial Act, the remedy is not a loss

 5   of the power on the part of the court to act.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Doesn't the statute

 7   establish time limits for filing an appeal?

 8               MR. HEYTENS:           The statute does, Your Honor.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Does it -- does it state a

10   remedy for it?     I don't think so.               But if you don't

11   comply with the time limit, you're too late; you can't

12   file the appeal.

13               MR. HEYTENS:           Justice Scalia --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Same thing here.

15               MR. HEYTENS:           There's a critical difference

16   between a statute of limitations for filing a notice of

17   appeal and what's happening here that's illustrated by

18   the example given by Judge Gorsuch in his opinion for

19   the courts of appeals.

20               There can be two kinds of time limits.                    The

21   first kind can say, if you want to do something -- you're

22   not required to do it -- but if you want to do it,

23   you have to do it within a certain time.                  That's what a

24   statute of limitations is.

25               The second kind of time limit is to say you


                                         32

 1   must do something and you must do it within a second --

 2   within a certain amount of time.                This case is the

 3   second category, just as the statute at issue in

 4   Montalvo-Murillo was in the second category of cases, and

 5   just as --

 6                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Except that that was a

 7   bail question, where there's not issues of finality at

 8   play, and bail is a question that repeats itself

 9   throughout the proceedings.             Defendants are denied bail

10   and then make a different showing of other

11   resources or less danger or whatever, and they get out.

12   And vice versa, defendants are out and are put in.

13   That's it.   There are no finality questions there.

14                What do you do in this situation when you're

15   dealing with a criminal sentence where there are

16   finality rules?

17                And I'm going to tie that back to my starting

18   point, which is I'm looking in your brief for the

19   precedent and/or legal basis for us to treat restitution

20   as not part of the final judgment in this criminal

21   action.   What -- what other examples do we have in the

22   criminal context?

23                MR. HEYTENS:         We cited the things we cite in

24   our brief.   There is, however, also a statute; I

25   apologize to the Court, it is not cited in our brief,

 1   but it is section 18 U.S.C. section 3582(b).                  That

 2   provision is captioned Imposition of a Sentence of

 3   Imprisonment.    Subsection (b) -- subsection (b) of that

 4   provision says Effect of Finality of the Judgment.                   It

 5   then says, "Notwithstanding the fact that a sentence of

 6   imprisonment can subsequently be" modified or altered in

 7   certain ways, and then this is the critical language: "a

 8   judgment of conviction that includes such a sentence

 9   constitutes a final judgment for all other purposes."

10                 In this case there was a judgment of

11   conviction.    It was entered on July 3, 2007.                And that

12   judgment of conviction imposed a sentence of

13   imprisonment on Mr. Dolan.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay, now suppose -- now

15   we're getting to exactly the point where I thought your

16   co-counsel, your sister counsel had a good point that I

17   wasn't -- hadn't thought through, and that is what

18   happens now in -- on day -- we're finished the

19   trial.   The sentencing is over.               They got the

20   presentence report, and the judge enters -- suppose he

21   entered a judgment but didn't say anything about

22   restitution, because he says:              I'd like to give you a

23   chance to appeal this.        And I'm not going to deal with

24   restitution for a month when the victim recovers -- all

25   within the 90 days.

 1               Can the defendant appeal that piece of

 2   paper?

 3               MR. HEYTENS:          Yes.

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:             The answer is because of

 5   this provision?

 6               MR. HEYTENS:          We think because of that

 7   provision and because of general principles of law.

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:             Whoa, whoa.      What about

 9   what the -- what -- what you just heard quoted,

10   forgetting this particular sentence in the code, was that

11   a judgment isn't final -- you can only appeal a final

12   judgment until all the parts that are there, and the

13   restitution is part of it.            And so until it's final, you

14   can't appeal it.    That's what -- that's what the case

15   Parr, which it quoted.        What is -- what is your response

16   to that?

17               MR. HEYTENS:          That certainly establishes the

18   general rule that this Court has said repeatedly --

19              JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.

20               MR. HEYTENS:          -- that the jurisdiction of the

21   Federal courts is established by Congress.

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, I just want to make

23   clear where we are.      Justice Breyer said, can the

24   defendant appeal?     You said yes.             Suppose he said, must

25   the defendant appeal?

 1                MR. HEYTENS:        The defendant in our view is

 2   required to appeal --

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Must?

 4                MR. HEYTENS:        Once the district court enters

 5   a judgment that imposes a sentence of imprisonment, if

 6   the defendant wishes to appeal that sentence of

 7   imprisonment he has 14 days to do so following the entry

 8   of the judgment, yes, which is the normal rule in

 9   Federal criminal cases.

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And if he misses --

11                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Even though -- even though

12   he says the restitution shall be held in abeyance

13   pending receipt of information?

14                MR. HEYTENS:        Well, to the extent that he

15   has an objection to the district court's -- it depends

16   on the precise circumstances of the case, Justice

17   Kennedy.   To the extent what he says is, I think the

18   district court needs to, when it imposes the sentence of

19   restitution, take into account the other aspects of the

20   sentence, at that time the issues become interrelated.

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Let me see if I understand

22   this.   He has 14 days to appeal that.                  And if he doesn't

23   do that, then later within the 90 days or even after the

24   90 days, a sentence of restitution is imposed, he can --

25   he can appeal that sentence of restitution, right?

 1               MR. HEYTENS:         Absolutely.

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:            On the same grounds on

 3   which he would have appealed the -- the sentence of

 4   imprisonment, right?

 5               MR. HEYTENS:         Well, it -- to the extent --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:            If -- if it's an error in

 7   the trial, he claims:      I was innocent.

 8               MR. HEYTENS:         No, Justice Scalia.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:            No?

10               MR. HEYTENS:         To the -- his time for

11   appealing from the judgment of conviction runs from the

12   entry of the judgment of conviction, which is

13   contemporaneous with the imposition of the sentence of

14   imprisonment.   If he wants to appeal that, he needs to do

15   that like any other --

16               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, I suppose it's no -- no

17   imprisonment; it's supervised release.                  Now what

18   happens?

19               MR. HEYTENS:         If it's -- if the judge imposes a

20   sentence of supervised release, I am not aware if there

21   is a specific statute.

22               JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes, but I mean, what's

23   bothering me about this, and I'm not aware -- but you're

24   quoting a sentence that wasn't in your brief and what I

25   hadn't taken in at all is the extent to which this is

 1   inextricably mixed up with the rules of appeals, which are

 2   very important.

 3                So unless I have in my own mind how -- how

 4   this all fits together, I -- I don't know how to decide

 5   this case.   I don't want to say something in here that's

 6   going to muck up the -- the rules of appealing from a

 7   criminal case.

 8                Now, what you've told me is I'm supposed to say

 9   that within 14 days of a -- of a judgment imposing imprisonment,

10   he has to appeal, but of course if it's supervised release,

11   he doesn't, or I'm not sure.

12                MR. HEYTENS:     Justice Breyer, first and

13   foremost, the Court doesn't need to say anything about

14   any of these issues.

15                JUSTICE BREYER:       Why not?

16                MR. HEYTENS:     For one very simple reason:

17   The only thing that this defendant has ever attempted to

18   appeal at any point is the order of restitution.          He

19   never attempted to appeal from his guilty plea.

20                JUSTICE BREYER:       Yes, but if -- but I have

21   to be able to write my reasons, and in doing that I have

22   to respond to the argument of the other side, which is

23   that the strongest reason for thinking Congress intended

24   this to be final and not beyond 90 days is that if you

25   don't do that, you muck up the rules of appeal.          Now,

 1   explain to me why that isn't so.

 2                 MR. HEYTENS:        A couple of reasons, Your

 3   Honor:    First of all, I think it's actually one of the

 4   strongest arguments against their position, because it

 5   creates the unlikely scenario where it will be

 6   routinely -- we know that Congress has authorized these

 7   determinations to be made up to 90 days after the

 8   imposition of sentence.         So their rule would create the

 9   situation where it would be completely consistent with

10   Congress's intent to routinely create a situation where

11   a Federal criminal defendant has to wait 3 months after

12   sentencing until he can appeal.

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Which is just what you say

14   he has to do if the sentence is supervised release.

15                 MR. HEYTENS:        What I'm saying, Justice

16   Breyer, is I -- I -- I know there is a statute that

17   governs imprisonment.       I believe there is a similar

18   statute that governs a sentence of probation.

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           What was that statute on

20   imprisonment?

21                 MR. HEYTENS:        18 U.S.C. 3582(b), Justice

22   Scalia.    I know there is a statute that governs that.

23   We also know there is a statute governing a term of

24   restitution itself.      That's the provision cited, 3664(o),

25   which is reproduced at 11a of the appendix to our

 1   brief --

 2                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           I've got it.

 3                  MR. HEYTENS:        -- which is the rules

 4   governing finality with regard to an order imposing

 5   restitution.

 6                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Heytens, one problem

 7   with the -- we have said that notice of appeal -- that

 8   that time limit is jurisdictional, which means if the

 9   defendant misses that deadline, no appeal.                  And we're

10   leaving this in a nebulous state if the judge says,

11   within -- this is -- this is a judgment of conviction

12   and sentence, but I'm still thinking about the

13   restitution.

14                  The defendant has to know at that point,

15   must I appeal that first judgment?                   Because if I don't,

16   I'll never be able to appeal it.

17                  But on your reading, the defendant can't

18   wait.   When the judge imposes a sentence, the defendant

19   must meet the time clock for notice of appeal from the

20   sentence.

21                  MR. HEYTENS:        That's correct,

22   Justice Ginsburg.     In our view, the defendant -- when

23   the judgment of conviction was imposed on this case,

24   which imposed a sentence of imprisonment on Mr. Dolan,

25   the time for appealing the judgment of conviction and


                                         40

 1   the term of imprisonment began to run.

 2                 If I could go back to Justice Breyer's

 3   question --

 4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But that -- that would

 5   mean even if the judge says, I'm going to impose the

 6   restitution order 10 days from now, defendant's time

 7   clock for notice of appeal would begin at -- at the time

 8   the sentence is imposed, not 10 days later when

 9   restitution is --

10                 MR. HEYTENS:        That's correct.            He files a

11   notice of appeal when the judgment of conviction

12   is entered, and then 10 days later he can file a second

13   notice of appeal, and courts of appeal can consolidate

14   that case in the ordinary course.

15                 You don't -- to answer Justice Breyer's very

16   specific question about the supervised released, I have

17   been advised that a district court cannot impose a term

18   of supervised release unless it also imposes a sentence

19   of imprisonment.    So that particular hypothetical that

20   Justice Breyer raised wouldn't arise.                    The court

21   can't just --

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, let's --

23   let's suppose there's no 3664(d)(5), and we're back to

24   just 363(a)(1), which says when sentencing a defendant,

25   the court shall order restitution.                  What if the


                                        41

 1   judge doesn't -- is that mandatory?                     It has to be when

 2   sentencing the defendant?

 3               MR. HEYTENS:         I don't think so, Your Honor.

 4   I think what --

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So you think even

 6   without 3664(d)(5), the judge can say:                    I know it says

 7   when I'm sentencing I've got to order restitution.

 8   But 2 months later, he can do it?

 9               MR. HEYTENS:         Mr. Chief Justice, let me

10   amend my answer slightly.          He -- the judge is required

11   to do it when sentencing --

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Yes, but nothing

13   happens if he doesn't.       Is that --

14               MR. HEYTENS:         Well, the question then

15   becomes one of a remedy.         The court is required to do it,

16   and the question becomes what is the remedy when the

17   court does not.   And what the Court said in

18   Montalvo-Murillo is that we presume that Federal

19   district courts will comply with the law, and that it is

20   inappropriate in situations where Congress doesn't

21   specify a remedy for courts to impose their own remedy.

22   That was exactly the situation in Montalvo-Murillo.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:            Why don't we go back to my

24   hypothetical --

25               MR. HEYTENS:         Sure.

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:            -- and just substitute the

 2   word "fine" for "supervised release."

 3                MR. HEYTENS:         Justice Breyer, I'm -- I'm fairly

 4   certain there is a statute that addresses the finality

 5   when it comes to a sentence that imposes a term of a

 6   fine, which is similar to the statute that addresses

 7   finality of a judgment of conviction that imposes only

 8   a term of imprisonment.

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:            I'm not -- I'm not an

10   expert in this area, as you can see.                     And -- and I need

11   to have a place to go to look so that I can see that

12   these things, in your view, all work out, and you're

13   not creating some odd appellate system.                     Do you have any

14   suggestions for me as to what I could go and read and

15   look at that would help me?

16                MR. HEYTENS:         Justice Breyer, to address

17   your very specific fine question, there is in fact a

18   statute that addresses that as well.                     That is 18 U.S.C.

19   3572(c).   It's structured very similarly to the -- the

20   section regarding judgments of imprisonment that I

21   quoted to the Court earlier, and Congress has addressed

22   that.   It says:   "Notwithstanding the fact that a

23   sentence to pay a fine can subsequently be altered in

24   various respects, a judgment that includes such a

25   sentence is a final judgment for all other" --

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:           Can the (o) -- you

 2   remember -- you know what I'm referring to by (o)?

 3               MR. HEYTENS:        Yes, Justice Breyer.

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.        Can that be

 5   read to refer to initial -- an initial judgment of

 6   restitution as well as an amended judgment?

 7               MR. HEYTENS:        Absolutely, Justice Breyer.

 8   That's exactly what the First Circuit said in the Cheal

 9   case, which is cited in our brief.                The First Circuit in

10   that case addressed an initial judgment that said,

11   similarly, somewhat, to the judgment in this one -- the

12   original judgment, if you recall, in this case says the

13   Mandatory Victims Restitution Act is applicable;

14   however, the court does not have sufficient information

15   to calculate restitution at this time.                 What the First

16   Circuit reasoned in Cheal is that that can be

17   interpreted as a judgment imposing a restitution

18   obligation, which is thus final under subsection (o).

19   If you conclude that, you don't need to look at any

20   other statute to resolve --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Even though there's no

22   amount given?

23               MR. HEYTENS:        Yes, Justice Scalia.           Because

24   the one thing we know for certain is that even if it had

25   stated an amount, the fact that the amount can be amended


                                      44

 1   later doesn't deprive the judgment of finality.

 2                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask this --

 3                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Simply because when you

 4   state an amount, that amount can be amended later, that

 5   leads to the conclusion that you need not even state an

 6   amount?     Do you do the same thing for imprisonment?             You

 7   say:    I'm going to send you to prison; I'm not sure how

 8   many years, but I'm going to send you to prison.              Is

 9   that appealable right away?

10                  MR. HEYTENS:        Well, Justice Scalia, the

11   district court is not permitted to do any of this.

12   Congress has required the district court to set the

13   amount --

14                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           I understand that, but

15   district courts don't always do what they are supposed

16   to.    And it seems to me a very strange result that

17   you're --

18                  MR. HEYTENS:        It's true that, regrettably,

19   district courts sometimes don't do what they are

20   supposed to.     What this Court has said, most notably in

21   Montalvo-Murillo, is that we should assume that they

22   will, and that it's inappropriate for courts to craft

23   legal rules that are based on the presumption that they

24   are going to violate their legal obligations.

25                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask this

 1   hypothetical?   Supposing the defendant fails to appeal

 2   when he's sentenced, and then 90 days later, they impose

 3   a restitution order and he appeals from that.               May he

 4   raise the issues about guilt and innocence and error in

 5   the trial in that appeal?

 6               MR. HEYTENS:         Justice Stevens, just to make

 7   sure I understand -- I want to make sure I understand

 8   the hypothetical -- it's that the district court

 9   sentences him, enters a judgment of conviction, and then

10   90 days later imposes an order of restitution?

11               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Correct.

12               MR. HEYTENS:         Okay.        In that situation, no.

13   It is the government's view that he has -- the time for

14   appealing the judgment of conviction and the sentence of

15   imprisonment has run.

16               JUSTICE STEVENS:            But he -- he can appeal

17   just the restitution order.

18               MR. HEYTENS:         Just the restitution order, in

19   that situation, yes.      Now, if he has appealed them both,

20   they can be consolidated, which has been done in several

21   cases in the courts --

22               JUSTICE STEVENS:            No, I understand that.

23               MR. HEYTENS:         -- in the circuit court of

24   appeals.

25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You attach no significance


                                       46

 1   to the fact that in this case the judge said:               I shall

 2   order restitution?      It's the same as if he said nothing

 3   at all about restitution, so far as you are concerned?

 4               MR. HEYTENS:           We think this makes it an

 5   easier case, in terms of it establishes that there is no

 6   conceivable prejudice to Mr. Dolan as a result of the

 7   delay in this case.

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Let me ask you this

 9   question:   If we conclude there's a hole in the statute

10   that Congress has to amend, is it more likely that

11   Congress will cure the statute if we rule for you or if

12   we rule against you?        It's pretty clear, the answer to

13   that, isn't it?

14               MR. HEYTENS:           Yes, Justice Stevens.        I think

15   Montalvo-Murillo supplies the answer to that.

16   Montalvo-Murillo says, where Congress does not supply a

17   remedy for violation of a statutory time obligation, it

18   is inappropriate for courts to invent their own in order

19   to coerce district courts into complying --

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               So this then becomes a

21   goal, not a time line -- a deadline?

22               MR. HEYTENS:           I think -- at some point, it

23   becomes a debate over precise wording, Justice Ginsburg.

24   I think it is a deadline.            I think Congress intended for

25   district courts to do this.              I think district courts who


                                         47

 1   have sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and laws

 2   of the United States are required to do it.

 3               The question is:           What is the remedy in the

 4   rare, regrettable situation where they do not do it?                  And --

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So a -- a defendant

 6   who is sentenced to a week in prison, and he decides,

 7   that's no big deal, I'm not going to appeal, and then

 8   finds out, you know, 90 days later he has got to pay a

 9   million dollars in restitution, is just out of luck,

10   right?

11               MR. HEYTENS:        Well, that would be -- yes.

12   That would be our view, Mr. Chief Justice.                  Now, what I

13   would say is, it is, first of all, our view that the Court

14   doesn't need to resolve any of this.                   But, second of all,

15   one of the reasons is there is another way the Court

16   could resolve this, which is to follow the approach the

17   Court took in its decision in Corey v. United States,

18   which is cited in the blue brief.

19               Now, Corey involved a statute.                  It's

20   presentence -- it's pre-Federal sentencing guidelines.

21   It involves a statute that said if, at the time of the

22   sentencing, the district court feels like it needs more

23   information to decide how long to send the defendant to

24   jail for, it may commit the defendant to the discretion

25   of the Attorney General for a period of either 3 to


                                      48

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   6 months; get, essentially, a PSR, before there were

 2   PSRs; and then make a determination then.

 3                 The Court in Corey faced the question:                     When

 4   the district court does that -- it says, I'm going to

 5   give you to the Attorney General, and we'll come back in

 6   6 months and decide what your sentence will be -- when

 7   does the defendant have to appeal?                  That was the

 8   question before the Court in Corey.

 9                 What the Court said in Corey is that the

10   defendant may appeal either at the time he is committed

11   to the discretion of the Attorney General or at the time

12   the district court imposes the final sentence.                     The

13   reason the Court said that -- this is the language

14   that's cited in the blue brief -- is the Court said it

15   would be extraordinary to tell a Federal criminal

16   defendant that he might have to wait up to 6 months in

17   order to take a notice of appeal from his judgment of

18   conviction.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Look, you straightened me

20   out, from your point of view.              But now you've mixed me

21   up again.

22               (Laughter.)

23                 MR. HEYTENS:        Sorry.        I didn't realize,

24   Justice Breyer.

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Because I think you said


                                        49

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that the defendant is just out of luck.                 But, previously,

 2   you had said that (o) applies, so I thought what you

 3   were saying was that the sentence of imprisonment is

 4   immediately appealable and must be appealed within

 5   14 days because of that 3582.

 6                MR. HEYTENS:        That's our --

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:           And then you said (o)

 8   applies, and (o) says that a sentence that imposes an

 9   order of restitution is a final judgment.                So if (o)

10   applies, when, 8 months later or 20 months later,

11   that restitution is made final and embodied in another

12   judgment, that is a final judgment which can't be

13   appealed.

14                So if you're right about (o) applying, then

15   the answer to the question is, no, he is not out of

16   luck.   Now, don't just agree with me because I seem to

17   be on your side in this question.

18               (Laughter.)

19                MR. HEYTENS:        No --

20                JUSTICE BREYER:           I've got to figure this

21   out.

22                MR. HEYTENS:        I apologize, Justice Breyer.

23   The government's position is that at the time the

24   judgment of conviction and the sentence of imprisonment

25   are entered, that is the time at which the defendant has


                                       50

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to appeal and, in our view, he may appeal.               Later, when

 2   the sentence of restitution is imposed, that is when

 3   he appeals that.

 4               What I was suggesting is that, to the extent

 5   the Court has any concern about that, the alternative

 6   way of resolving this issue would be the same way the

 7   Court approached the issue in Corey, and you could say

 8   that the defendant could appeal at either time.

 9               Now, we think that would be incorrect, but

10   it would be open to the Court to do so to -- or to leave

11   the issue open in order to resolve this case.              Because

12   as I said before, this defendant never attempted to

13   appeal his judgment of conviction or his original term

14   of imprisonment.    So it's not, in this case, necessary

15   to decide what exactly would have happened had he

16   attempted to do so.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:             This criminal judgment of

18   restitution -- I assume it's the judge who finds that the

19   victim suffered so much money?

20               MR. HEYTENS:          That's correct,

21   Justice Scalia.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Does he find that beyond a

23   reasonable doubt?

24               MR. HEYTENS:          No, Justice Scalia.      The

25   burden --

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Just more likely than not?

 2               MR. HEYTENS:         That's correct.

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:            And it's a criminal --

 4   it's a criminal judgment?

 5               MR. HEYTENS:         That's what Congress has

 6   provided.   And in this Court's decision in Oregon v.

 7   Ice, the Court, admittedly in dictum, stated that

 8   restitution determinations are a category of

 9   determinations that have been historically made by the

10   court, not by the jury.        And regardless of what anyone

11   thinks is the answer to that question, it is certainly

12   not within the question presented.                 It has not been

13   raised at any point by the Petitioner in this case.

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I suppose that an answer to

15   the Chief Justice's concern about the 1-week sentence and

16   -- and he's not concerned -- is that all criminal

17   defendants know that an adjudication of guilt is

18   preclusive of later issues with -- with respect to civil

19   -- civil liability, and they take their chances.

20               But that -- that points up a difference

21   between this case and Montalvo-Murillo.                 In this case,

22   finality is central to the system, and that wasn't --

23   that's not really -- wasn't really true in Montalvo.

24               MR. HEYTENS:         That's certainly correct,

25   Justice Kennedy.   That was by its terms a bail


                                       52

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   determination, which by its nature is not a final

 2   determination in the sense that a criminal statute is,

 3   though the Court's language doesn't really suggest that

 4   that would make any difference.                And I would say that

 5   some of the other cases in this same line of cases,

 6   including some of the ones Justice Breyer mentioned, did

 7   raise finality concerns.          There was a very strong

 8   finality concern raised in the Peabody Coal case.                There

 9   were finality concerns raised in Brock, that Congress

10   had said this needs to be done, and once it's done, it

11   needs to be done.    And so, there are -- some of the

12   cases in this same line have also involved finality,

13   admittedly not in the criminal context.

14                But I think the -- the most important thing

15   that the Court said in -- the two most important things

16   that the Court said in Montalvo-Murillo, as are relevant

17   here, is that, first, when Congress doesn't specify a

18   remedy -- and Congress has not specified a remedy in

19   this case -- it's inappropriate for courts to impose

20   their own.

21                The second thing that the Court said is that

22   we should presume that Federal district courts are going

23   to comply with legal obligations, and we shouldn't make

24   rules based on the assumption that they won't.

25                And third is that when courts do impose


                                        53

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   remedies, they shouldn't make -- impose a remedy where

 2   there's a profound lack of fit between the violation that

 3   occurred and the remedy that the defendant is asking

 4   them to impose.

 5               Let me give you an example on that.                  The

 6   general rule in Federal criminal litigation is that the

 7   Federal district court is supposed to impose sentence

 8   without unnecessary delay.             Now, say the district court

 9   violates that obligation.            It takes too long to impose a

10   sentence.   I think it would be extraordinary to suggest

11   that the remedy of a district court's unnecessary delay

12   in sentencing the defendant means the defendant should

13   get off scot-free.

14               The remedy is to tell the district court you

15   have taken too long to impose the sentence; impose the

16   sentence forthwith.

17               The same thing is true here.                  Congress has

18   told the district court you need to impose restitution

19   in every case where the defendant is convicted of a

20   crime of violence.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   So, your argument is

22   "not to exceed 90 days" means the same thing as "without

23   undue delay"?

24               MR. HEYTENS:           We don't think it means the

25   same thing, Mr. Chief Justice.                What we think it means


                                         54

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   is the violation should have the same consequences.                      The

 2   violation is to say if you don't do what you are

 3   supposed to, the remedy is to do it immediately.                   The

 4   remedy isn't to say you don't have to do it anymore.

 5                  If there are no further questions, the

 6   government urges that the judgment of the court below be

 7   affirmed.

 8                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

 9                  Ms. Karlan, you have 4 minutes.

10               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN

11                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12                  MS. KARLAN:       I have three points -- excuse

13   me -- to make:     The first goes to what the remedy is

14   here and what the error is here.                 The error here

15   occurred when the district court did not impose

16   restitution.     The government should have filed a timely

17   appeal under Rule 4.        They had 30 days to do so.             The

18   government did not appeal the failure to make

19   restitution.

20                  That error is not before this Court now.

21   What's before this Court is a second judgment.

22                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             They couldn't do that

23   until the end of the 90 days.               If the judge has 90 days

24   to order restitution, that's a vicious cycle argument.

25                  MS. KARLAN:       No, Justice Sotomayor, because


                                         55

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   had the -- had the government on October 28 looked and

 2   said, there's no restitution order in this case, they

 3   could have filed an appeal then under Rule 4, and they

 4   would have won.    They didn't do so.

 5                Second --

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, that's rather

 7   theoretical because if that -- I mean, the -- the judge

 8   surely would have acted before he could process an

 9   appeal.

10                MS. KARLAN:        Well, he lacks actually the --

11   the power to do that.       Once the appeal is taken, he

12   can't do that.    And may I just say that here I think the

13   critical rule to understand is one sentence, one appeal.

14   So turning first --

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              But that's not true.     I

16   don't know if you've had time to look at 3582 or 35 --

17                MS. KARLAN:        Yes, I have.

18                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Those do appear to say

19   that once there's a term of imprisonment, that that

20   constitutes a final judgment.

21                MS. KARLAN:        But they do so in the context

22   of Section 3553(a), which is cited on page 6 of the

23   yellow brief, which says "the court shall impose a

24   sentence."

25                Now, the different components can each be


                                        56

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   added together.    But there is one sentence in a criminal

 2   case on a particular charge, and that sentence can

 3   include restitution, it can include a fine, it can

 4   include imprisonment.       That doesn't make it three

 5   sentences.    And only when all of those have been imposed

 6   is there a final judgment.           Until then, the judgment --

 7                 JUSTICE ALITO:         It can also include

 8   forfeiture.    What's -- what is the rule for forfeiture?

 9                 MS. KARLAN:      I don't know the rule for

10   forfeiture.    I do know the rule for all of the other criminal

11   proceedings, which is 3582(b), to which the government

12   refers; 3572(c) for fines; 3562(b) for community

13   release; and 3664(o) for restitution.                    All of those have

14   to make one sentence, and then there is one appeal.

15                 Under our rule, which I think comports with

16   the plain language of the statute, we know when an

17   appeal takes place, and there will be one appeal.                   Under

18   the government's rule --

19                 JUSTICE ALITO:         What is the difference -- in

20   response to the last argument that your opponent made,

21   what is the difference between the provision here and

22   Rule 32(b)(1) of the criminal rules, the court must

23   impose sentence without unnecessary delay?

24                 MS. KARLAN:      There, the question is, did it

25   do it without unnecessary delay?               Here the question is,


                                        57

 1   did it do it within 90 days?              When it didn't, the

 2   government had to appeal.            The government did not do

 3   that.

 4                  JUSTICE ALITO:          So if the -- I didn't

 5   understand the answer.         If the sentence is not imposed

 6   without unnecessary delay, the consequence is that there

 7   can be no sentence?

 8                  MS. KARLAN:       No.      This Court has never

 9   decided what the rule means there.                   But this is a

10   statute.     And if I could turn to the question of what

11   the statute --

12                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Before you do that, tell me

13   what the government appeal would consist of.                       The 90 days

14   has expired --

15                  MS. KARLAN:       And the judgment of August 8th

16   became final.

17                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           And you -- you tell

18   me the court -- the court has no ability to impose

19   restitution after 90 days.

20                 MS. KARLAN:      That's right.              The --

21                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           What's the use of appealing?

22                  MS. KARLAN:       Because on appeal you say the

23   court erred, and it imposed an illegal sentence --

24                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           And the appellate court says

25   too bad --


                                         58

 1                MS. KARLAN:     No --

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA -- 90 days are up.

 3                 MS. KARLAN:      No, Justice Scalia.       In the

 4   same way that if a court failed to impose a mandatory minimum

 5   sentence and there was a final judgment, the government

 6   could appeal.    And the fact that the initial sentence

 7   didn't do that doesn't mean anything at that point.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           There is no time limit on

 9   the mandatory minimum.

10                 MS. KARLAN:      But the -- but -- but, Your

11   Honor, if the government appeals an illegal sentence,

12   that sentence can be corrected and the new mandate from

13   the court of appeals saying you erred in not imposing

14   mandatory restitution starts the 90-day clock again.

15   Now, this is --

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Could you go back to --

17   could you go back to Justice Alito's question,

18   because --

19                 MS. KARLAN:      Yes.

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:           -- that was exactly the

21   same thing.    I think what he may be saying, though, is

22   it makes more sense to read these statutes as saying

23   imprisonment or community -- or community service, a

24   form of supervised release, or fines -- I don't know

25   about forfeiture -- can be appealed as separate final

 1   judgments, because then you don't have to wait for

 2   90 days.

 3               MS. KARLAN:       No.

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:           And if you read it that

 5   way, it's fairer to the defendant, and you don't have to

 6   worry about the restitution appeal because of (o).

 7               Now, what blocks the reading -- what blocks

 8   the reading I just gave?

 9               MS. KARLAN:       The principle that there must

10   be one sentence that determines each of the punishments

11   for a particular crime.

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

13               The case is submitted.
