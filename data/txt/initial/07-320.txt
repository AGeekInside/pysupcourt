 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We'll hear argument

 4   first today in Case 07-320, Davis v. The Federal

 5   Election Commission.

 6   Mr. Herman.

 7                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW D. HERMAN

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

 9                 MR. HERMAN:       Mr. Chief Justice and may it

10   please the Court:

11                 This case involves the constitutional

12   question of whether the government may regulate the

13   personal spending of a candidate on behalf of his own

14   campaign.   This is an activity that constitutes

15   political expression at the core of the First Amendment,

16   yet BCRA Section 319 seeks to deter and, failing that,

17   penalizes such protected political expression.                    Even if

18   this Court finds that the harms upon speech of Section

19   319 are modest, the provision still fails to satisfy any

20   constitutional standard.          It furthers no legitimate

21   governmental purpose and conversely increases the undue

22   influence of contributions upon Federal candidates.

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                There is no

24   restriction whatsoever on the wealthier candidate.                   He

25   can spend as much of his money as he wants.


                                         3

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                MR. HERMAN:         That's correct, Your Honor.

 2   The harm from Section 319 is that he is burdened from

 3   the beginning of his campaign throughout every step with

 4   the knowledge that any time he spends money he is going

 5   to be providing his opponent with an advantage; he is

 6   going to be enhancing his opponent's speech.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, what if, for

 8   example, somebody takes out a television ad that says

 9   smoking this type of cigarette is actually, is not

10   harmful to you.   The government is free to take out a

11   contrary ad saying, no, it is and so you shouldn't do

12   it, right?

13                MR. HERMAN:         Of course, Mr. Chief Justice.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So governmental

15   responses to the exercise of free speech are not

16   automatically -- don't automatically burden the exercise

17   of that speech.

18                MR. HERMAN:         That is absolutely correct,

19   Mr. Chief Justice.

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well then, why does

21   it burden it for the government to make it easier for

22   private citizens to respond to that speech.

23                MR. HERMAN:         Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it's

24   making it easier for a self-financed candidate's

25   opponent to respond to that speech.                       In essence, what

 1   Section 319 says is, we are going to make it easier for

 2   your opponent to beat you.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Herman, can the

 4   government respond to political speech?                  The government

 5   can have a position on smoking cigarettes, it can have a

 6   position on a lot of things, but can it have a position

 7   on whether the Republican Party or the Democratic Party

 8   should win the next election?

 9                MR. HERMAN:        Absolutely not, Justice Scalia.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Isn't that a distinction

11   here?

12                MR. HERMAN:        Yes.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What case supports

14   that proposition?

15                MR. HERMAN:        That the government cannot

16   take --

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Government can't

18   engage in political speech.

19                MR. HERMAN:        Your Honor, Buckley is on --

20   there is not anything --

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How is the government

22   speaking?   You have already acknowledged that the

23   wealthy candidate can spend as much as he or she wants

24   and the end result of this scheme is that there will be

25   more, not less, speech because the non-affluent opponent


                                         5

 1   will now have money to spend that he didn't have before.

 2   So I think you have to concede that overall the scheme

 3   will produce more political speech, not less.

 4                  MR. HERMAN:       Well, Justice Ginsburg, I can't

 5   concede that, and this is the reason why.                 If Section

 6   319 operates as it's intended to, it will deter

 7   self-financed candidates from ever reaching that

 8   $350,000 threshold and triggering the, quote unquote,

 9   "more speech."     What it is really designed to do at

10   every single step --

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Has it done it?   I mean,

12   we do have some experience under the statute now.

13               MR. HERMAN:          We have very little experience

14   under the statute, Justice --

15               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Well your clients -- wasn't

16   your client's latest filing that he intended to spend a

17   million dollars.

18               MR. HERMAN:          For the 2006 campaign?

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:              I think that's --

20               MR. HERMAN:          That is correct.

21               JUSTICE SOUTER:              So it didn't deter him.

22   You're in the position in which it clearly didn't deter

23   your client.    He says, I'm going to spend three times as

24   much as the threshold figure, and there is no empirical

25   evidence that it's deterring anybody else.

 1               MR. HERMAN:          Well, Justice Souter, in fact

 2   it did deter my client.          If you look at his election in

 3   its totality, his opponent spent over $5 million.

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Do we usually evaluate

 5   restrictions on First Amendment rights on the basis of

 6   whether the chill that was imposed by the government was

 7   actually effective in stifling the right?

 8               MR. HERMAN:          No, Your Honor.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:              If the person goes ahead

10   and speaks anyway, is he estopped from saying that the

11   government was chilling his speech nonetheless?

12               MR. HERMAN:          Absolutely not, Justice Scalia.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Isn't that's what's going

14   on here?

15               MR. HERMAN:          Absolutely.

16               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Don't we expect a chill

17   argument to at least have a ring of plausibility?              And

18   your chill argument is that it is deterring.              It didn't

19   deter your client.      There is no indication that it would

20   deter anybody else and I have to say I don't see why it

21   would.

22               MR. HERMAN:          Justice Souter, respectfully, I

23   don't think that you can categorically say that it did

24   not deter my client when he was outspent by $3 million

25   in that campaign.     As he went through the campaign


                                          7

 1   against his --

 2               JUSTICE SOUTER:             You mean if the -- if the

 3   other side had not had an enhanced spending capacity,

 4   your client would then have spent $2 million?

 5               MR. HERMAN:         Your Honor, he actually did

 6   spend $2 million.

 7               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Whatever it is, I mean are

 8   you saying that if the -- if the client -- if the

 9   opposing party had not had an enhanced spending capacity

10   your client would have spent even more?

11               MR. HERMAN:         Potentially.             Potentially.

12               JUSTICE SOUTER:             That seems to substantiate

13   the, at least the ostensible basis for this statute.

14               MR. HERMAN:         Your Honor, if the basis for

15   the statute is to, quote unquote, "level the playing

16   field," to equalize the candidates, I haven't received

17   an explanation from the government or from the district

18   court that explains how a statute designed to do that

19   would have allowed my client's opponent to have raised

20   another $1.4 million even though he had already outspent

21   my opponent by $3 million.

22               JUSTICE ALITO:           Is there any reason to think

23   that this statute will have any greater or different

24   effect of Mr. Davis in the upcoming election than it did

25   in the last election?

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                MR. HERMAN:       There is, Justice Alito.

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:         Why?

 3                MR. HERMAN:       Because his incumbent opponent

 4   from the last two elections has announced his retirement

 5   and so Mr. Davis will now be facing very likely primary

 6   challengers, and then if he were to prevail in the

 7   primary he'll be meeting a non-incumbent challenger in

 8   the general election as well.             So it's an open seat.

 9                And again, one of the great deficiencies of

10   319 is that it fails to take into account any of the

11   advantages of incumbency, not just the financial

12   advantages but the inherent advantage that each and

13   every incumbent brings to an election when he or she

14   runs for re-election, the fact that the incumbent has

15   much greater status as --

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:            The government says that in

17   fact more and quite a bit more incumbents went over the

18   $350,000 personal funding limits than non-incumbents.

19   Something like -- I don't know, 14-2 or something like

20   that in the last election, is that right?

21               MR. HERMAN:        First of all, the statistics

22   here are incomplete because basically the briefing in

23   this case was concluded in early September of 2006,

24   before a lot of primaries occurred for the 2006 House

25   election.   And so I think referring to those numbers --

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


1    the FEC has never -- we've never received any additional

2    numbers for the effect, but --

3                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But it was a four-year

4    record and the numbers are rather startling that -- is

5    it 110 senators or representatives qualified for the

6    enhanced contributions and only 6 of them were

7    incumbents?

8                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes.

9                  MR. HERMAN:       The other number that was cited

10   is that only 2 of 60 incumbents actually triggered the

11   Millionaires' Amendment in those --

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Of course, that could mean

13   that the millionaires have already been elected and are

14   now pulling up the ladder after them.

15                 (Laughter.)

16                 MR. HERMAN:       That's certainly our argument,

17   Justice Scalia.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Right.

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, if that's so, one

20   of the reasons that has been given for this statute is

21   that it encourages the parties to favor the wealthier

22   candidates; it deters people who are non-affluent but

23   highly meritorious.      So -- and it gives the public the

24   perception that the seats in our Congress are there to

25   be bought by the wealthiest bidder.                      And if there's


                                        10
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


1    anything to that -- well, do you reject that out of hand

2    as what the statute is all about?

3                MR. HERMAN:        Justice Ginsburg, I believe

4    that the -- the fact that the statute expands the

5    supposedly anti-corruptive $2300 to $6900 and allows a

6    national party to make coordinated communications of an

7    unlimited amount in response to the, what Buckley called

8    "ameliorative speech" by a self-financer, would also

9    increase the perception that -- that our candidates are

10   there to be bought.     It seems to me that if Mr. Davis

11   had sat down and read all of this Court's jurisprudence

12   before he decided to run, he wouldn't have seen a word

13   in there about leveling the playing field.

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But I thought -- I

15   thought your brief -- and correct me if I'm wrong --

16   said at one stage that there is -- what Congress was

17   driving at is a valid concern, but there are less

18   restrictive alternatives.         And I was trying to find what

19   those less restrictive alternatives were.

20               MR. HERMAN:        Well, Justice Ginsburg, I can

21   think of one off the top of my head which is not this

22   case, and that's public funding.              If Congress were truly

23   concerned about providing a boost to minor party

24   candidates who may not be able to raise the $2300 to

25   begin with, much less take advantage of the benefits of


                                      11

1    319, or wanted to boost self-financed candidates who,

2    say, like Mr. DeRossett in the amicus brief, in his

3    amicus brief, who mortgaged his house or others who have

4    encumbered their pensions and raised $350,000 or

5    $400,000 and then triggered the amendment, if they

6    wanted to foster all of those people of modest means to

7    participate, then the easiest way and the way sanctioned

8    by this Court in Buckley is to institute a public

9    funding system and allow them to choose.                 They can raise

10   private funds if they'd like; they could do it

11   personally with their own money; or they could take

12   whatever amount that the -- that the State was willing

13   to give them --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:             But that wouldn't level the

15   playing field.    I mean, the other side, the millionaire,

16   won't take the public funding and he'll spend his

17   millions and whoever gets the public funding -- or are

18   you saying the public funding should match whatever the

19   other side pays?

20               MR. HERMAN:         No, Your Honor --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well then --

22               MR. HERMAN:         But this Court's analysis in

23   Buckley -- the public funding analysis in Buckley does

24   not center on leveling the playing field or providing

25   equality for all candidates.             It --

1                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Do you think that's a valid

2    constitutional objective, to level the playing field?

3                MR. HERMAN:        I --

4                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Do you think we should

5    trust our incumbent senators and representatives to

6    level the playing field for us?

7                (Laughter.)

8                MR. HERMAN:        Absolutely not, Justice Scalia.

9    And there's a reason why there's a distinction between

10   an anti-corruptive purpose and a

11   leveling-the-playing-field purpose.                     When Congress

12   legislates to deal with the actuality or appearance of

13   corruption, they are legislating uniformly and they're

14   not taking an interest in the outcome, in the

15   competitiveness.   When they are talking about leveling

16   the playing field, one of the players on that playing

17   field are incumbent members of Congress.                     It's like

18   saying that we're going to trust basketball players not

19   -- to call their own out-of-bounds plays.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But isn't there something

21   different between what the statute was at the time of

22   Buckley, that a lid on, you can't spend more than X

23   amount of money, and a statute that says we're going to

24   let you spend, the sky is the limit for you, but we're

25   going to give a boost to your opponent?

1                MR. HERMAN:        Justice Ginsburg, in Buckley

2    there -- there was no lid on personal expenditures.               The

3    Court struck down that aspect of Buckley and upheld the

4    public funding provision.          So the Court was --

5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I'm talking about the

6    statute as it was originally enacted by Congress did

7    have expenditure limits and this Court said that was no

8    good.   This statute doesn't have that problem because it

9    doesn't put a lid on the candidates self-financing.

10               MR. HERMAN:        That's correct, Your Honor.

11   But -- but again, if you're going to make a comparison

12   to the public funding system in Buckley that was

13   approved by this Court, that system was indifferent to

14   the -- the source or the amount of funds.               All the Court

15   said there -- or the equality -- that that statute was

16   indifferent to whether the playing field was level.               All

17   -- all Buckley said and all Congress said in enacting

18   the public funding was we want to take the allegedly

19   corruptive private funds out of the system, and we want

20   to replace it with public funds and --

21               JUSTICE ALITO:          Even if -- even if leveling

22   the playing field is not generally a compelling or maybe

23   even a permissible interest, is it a stronger interest

24   when one of the reasons why the playing field is not

25   level is other action that Congress has taken?              If there


                                       14

1    weren't expenditure limits, then self-financed

2    candidates wouldn't perhaps have as much of an advantage

3    as they do.    So if we accept the world in which

4    contribution limits are constitutional, it -- does that

5    provide a basis for Congress to try to rectify at least

6    in part what it itself has done by imposing the

7    contribution limits?

8                  MR. HERMAN:       Justice Alito, leveling the

9    playing field is -- I'm not quite sure how Congress

10   would start to do that without implicating their own

11   interest.   When you say that you're going to level the

12   playing field, Congress has to look at the whole playing

13   field.   They can't just carve out a section that applies

14   to other people and not talk about their interest in

15   leveling the playing field.             I think it's a very

16   difficult road to go down.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           What we're talking about in

18   leveling the playing field, I guess, is leveling the

19   amount of speech that each side has, to make sure that

20   each side has the same amount of speech.                 Is that -- is

21   that what's going on here?

22                 MR. HERMAN:       Well, it's an attempt to do

23   that.    And again, in Buckley this Court said that --

24   that Congress has no interest in determining whether

25   speech is excessive or unwise or wasteful.                That's --


                                        15

1    that's ultimately the purview for the voters, and that's

2    really the fallacy in 319 at its heart, is there's no

3    such thing as secret self-funders.                 They will --

4    everything that they do is disclosed in the same way

5    that all other expenditures and contributions are

6    disclosed in quarterly and pre-election reports.

7    Certainly, in many cases, their opponents are going to

8    make the case that this wealthy person is out of touch,

9    they don't represent the district, your vote is not to

10   be bought.   And then ultimately the voters will have the

11   determination on what kind of candidate they want.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Are we -- are we talking

13   wealthy people here?      What's the average price of a home

14   in the United States?      I think it's a good deal above

15   $350,000, isn't it?

16                MR. HERMAN:       It certainly is in this area

17   and in many congressional districts in the United

18   States.   And that's a very good point, Justice Scalia.

19   This provision affects less -- about a quarter of what

20   it costs to run a competitive race in 2006.                    So

21   certainly it's not as if Congress said, well, if you

22   spend some disproportionate amount of money to a

23   congressional race, if you go ten times over what it

24   should cost, we're going to step in.                    They said --

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You don't think that

1    would be any more constitutional than this, do you?

2                MR. HERMAN:         I think it would be equally

3    unconstitutional, Mr. Chief Justice.                     But if you're

4    talking about the tailoring of the statute, I think that

5    that is certainly something that's relevant.

6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I'd like to ask about the

7    provisions of the statute which allow the candidate who

8    doesn't have the personal funds -- what was the name of

9    the challenger in this case?             Not Davis -- Reynolds?

10               MR. HERMAN:         Tom Reynolds.

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Reynolds -- - to receive,

12   is it, unlimited contributions from his own party?

13               MR. HERMAN:         He can receive up to 100

14   percent of whatever that OPFA number is -- the --

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Yes.

16               MR. HERMAN:         -- the purported difference in

17   funds.

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Suppose you had a statute

19   which either explicitly said or has the effect, as this

20   does, that the less wealthy challenger, the challenger

21   in Reynolds' position, has more access and more support

22   from his party than the challenger does from his party?

23   What is your best case that indicates that that is

24   unconstitutional, and what is your argument that that is

25   unconstitutional?

1                   MR. HERMAN:       I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy?

2                   JUSTICE KENNEDY:           That concerns me in this.

3    What is your best argument that differential treatment

4    of the candidates vis-a-vis support from their

5    respective parties is unconstitutional?

6                   MR. HERMAN:       Well, again, Your Honor, if

7    you're making a distinction -- when you talk about the

8    --

9                   JUSTICE KENNEDY:           The statute makes that

10   distinction.

11               MR. HERMAN:          Well, the statute talks about

12   the less wealthy candidate.

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              And it seems to me that

14   that distinction is somewhat questionable, and I'm

15   asking you for your best statement of the theory as to

16   why it's unconstitutional and your best case to show

17   that it's unconstitutional.

18               MR. HERMAN:          The best argument, Justice

19   Kennedy, is that money and speech are synonymous in an

20   electoral context, and it's inappropriate for the

21   government to say that you, as the purportedly wealthier

22   candidate, have too much speech; that that's enough

23   speech from you.

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But you make that argument

25   to the statute generally.            Is there any more specific

1    argument that you can make in the context of the less

2    well-funded candidate having more support from the party

3    than the well-funded candidate had?

4                   MR. HERMAN:       Well --

5                   JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It seems to me that that's

6    a particular vice of the statute, and I want to know if

7    there is a formulation that's more precise than the

8    general attack that you made -- that you make.

9                   MR. HERMAN:       I --

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Could you clarify with

11   respect to that question two things:                      The party is not

12   at liberty to give anything it wants.                      You explained

13   that it would be -- it's tied to that formula.                      So the

14   wealthy person could still have a lot more to spend.

15   But the party also is -- there's no obligation of the

16   party to give one cent to anybody that it doesn't choose

17   to give money to; is that right?

18               MR. HERMAN:          No, Justice Ginsburg.              Of

19   course, the party would have to make a determination if

20   they felt that this person was --

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But the party for the less

22   well-funded candidate has the option to have much closer

23   ties, much greater involvement, than the party for the

24   other candidate; and that seems to me highly

25   problematic.    And I want to know the best case that you


                                         19

1    have for that proposition and the best statement of law

2    that can you give me for why that is unconstitutional.

3                MR. HERMAN:       Well, Justice Kennedy, if you

4    refer to Colorado II, where this Court talked about the

5    facts that -- where this Court upheld limitations on

6    party, unlimited party- coordinated communications,

7    because that -- allowing the party to do so would raise

8    the possibility of evading the contribution limits.                   And

9    so accordingly they upheld the 42 -- the $42,000 limit

10   on coordinated communication.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, you said

12   earlier that money is -- money is speech in this area.

13   So I take it you think that the restrictions, otherwise

14   applicable restrictions on the less wealthy candidate,

15   raise problems under the First Amendment?

16               MR. HERMAN:       Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So this law eases

18   those problematic restrictions.             It's less violative of

19   the First Amendment.

20               MR. HERMAN:       It is less violative of the

21   First Amendment, but, again, this Court has made the

22   distinction between contribution limits, which it found

23   was a reasonable burden on the Constitution, and

24   expenditure limits, which -- which are not.                This --

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:           It doesn't limit those


                                      20
                        Alderson Reporting Company

1    restrictions on your candidate.

2                   MR. HERMAN:       It does not limit the

3    restrictions.

4                   JUSTICE SCALIA:           It simply makes the

5    imposition of the restrictions uneven.

6                   MR. HERMAN:       That is, that is correct.               But

7    --

8                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, but your

9    candidate isn't subject to any restriction at all on

10   what he can spend and his opponent is subject to less

11   restrictions.    It seems to me the First Amendment comes

12   out better.

13                 MR. HERMAN:        He is -- my candidate, my

14   client, is subject to restrictions.                       The statute in its

15   entirety --

16                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Why can't he go out and

17   raise funds?    Does the statute prohibit him from raising

18   funds from third parties?

19                 MR. HERMAN:        Absolutely not, Justice

20   Stevens.   But for many -- for many self-financed

21   candidates, the fact that --

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Doesn't it prohibit -- I

23   thought it prohibited him from raising funds in the

24   amount from as wealthy donors as his opponent can now go

25   to?   Don't those limits on contributions continue to

1    apply to him?

2                  MR. HERMAN:       The contribution limits apply

3    to him as they would to any other candidate except for

4    his opponent.

5                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And he cannot have the

6    support from his party that the opponent can have from

7    the opponent's party.

8                  MR. HERMAN:       He cannot have the same level

9    of support.

10                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Not the same level of

11   support.

12                 MR. HERMAN:       That's correct.

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And is party support

14   sometimes important in an election?

15                 MR. HERMAN:       Of course, it can be vital in

16   an election, and it can be vital for a candidate who may

17   be a candidate of modest means.               That would be certainly

18   one way for them to generate support.                    Did he convince

19   their party that they were worthy of that support?

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Does anything in Colorado

21   indicate that there can be a differential between the

22   party support given to one candidate and the party

23   support given to the other?

24                 MR. HERMAN:       Not -- only as determined by

25   the party's decision as to how they feel about the


                                        22

1    candidate's positions.

2                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Well, but they certainly

3    can allocate funds more generously to one candidate than

4    another; can't they?

5                MR. HERMAN:       They certainly have that

6    opportunity, but under -- under a limit, under the

7    $42,000 limit, as opposed to essentially an infinite

8    limit when you're dealing with a self- funded candidate.

9                And incidentally, Justice Stevens, to

10   address something else that you just brought up, for

11   many self-financed candidates the fact that they don't

12   take money from their party or from donors or from PACs

13   is a significant issue for them in their campaign.           I

14   mean certainly for Mr. Davis, the fact that he is

15   independent and can make his own determinations --

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Who is more incorruptible

17   than the millionaire, right?

18               MR. HERMAN:       He is the ultimate independent.

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:           The ultimate incorruptible.

20               (Laughter.)

21               MR. HERMAN:       You cannot corrupt yourself.

22   And, again, the voters will get to decide whether they

23   want someone who is like that or they want someone who

24   is more in tune with, say, what the party wants or with

25   what his donors want.     I mean, that's really the essence

3    obviously you're correct that this system benefits

4    incumbents, but it benefits your client in a particular

5    way as well.   The parties are certainly interested in

6    candidates who will fund themselves because that

7    presents less strain on the party's resources.

8                 MR. HERMAN:       Mr. Chief Justice, they are

9    interested in those candidates only inasmuch as they get

10   elected.   The moment that the public turns on them, they

11   won't be interested.      And certainly the public was not

12   particularly interested in Mitt Romney, who spent a

13   significant amount of money on his own behalf, and many

14   other spectacular flameouts.

15               (Laughter.)

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I'm not sure we need

17   characterizations of the political candidates --

18               (Laughter.)

19               MR. HERMAN:        I apologize.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 -- in this forum.

21               MR. HERMAN:        Let me just add -- let me just

22   add one other thing.      The government's own experts, all

23   of their information is derived from an individual who

24   is quoted as saying that self- financed candidates

25   rarely win, and when they do, it's usually for some

1    other reason.    The fact of the matter is they don't

2    always make great candidates because they're not within

3    the mainstream.

4                  I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

5                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

6    Mr. Herman.

8                    ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT

9                         ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

10                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may

11   it please the Court:

12                 Appellant's claim here is an odd sort of

13   First Amendment complaint.           He does not suggest that

14   Section 319 has limited his own spending at all.                 In

15   fact, he has twice spent a substantial amount of his own

16   money in excess of the statutory triggers.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It has penalized his own

18   spending.

19                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well -- and we can talk

20   about that as well, but I think it's worth recognizing

21   that his own spending is unlimited both in theory and in

22   fact.    And, if anything, he has announced his intent

23   this next time around to spend even more of his own

24   money.   And the other thing that I think is relevant is

25   his experience is not atypical in this regard.


                                        25

1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           That just means he is

2    willing to accept the penalty in the next election even

3    if this case doesn't come out in his favor.

4                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well, Justice Scalia --

5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It doesn't prove that it

6    isn't a penalty.

7                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well, I don't think in any

8    way it's a penalty.     And I think in order to understand

9    it as a penalty you have to accept the proposition that

10   you start out with a constitutional entitlement to speak

11   freely without the opportunity for the other side to

12   respond, and I don't think the Constitution recognizes

13   this.

14               This isn't a context where they forced the

15   Appellant to pay for the other side's speech, as in

16   Tornillo, or carry the speech, as in PG&E.              And I don't

17   think it's fair to look at the record here and suggest

18   that what Congress was trying to do here was actually

19   limit or deter self-financing.

20               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, isn't there something

21   very -- isn't there something very strange about having

22   different contribution limits for candidates in an

23   election?   Do you think it would be constitutional for

24   Congress to say that the -- the contribution limits for

25   incumbents is X, but for challengers it's 2X or one-half

1    X?

2                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well, I think 2X would be

3    constitutional.   And I think most people would be

4    surprised if Congress passed the statute that gave more

5    generous contribution limits to challengers, but I think

6    it would be a perfectly appropriate regime because it

7    would recognize that incumbents have certainly built-in

8    advantages such that the relatively low hard money

9    contribution caps have a greater influence, greater

10   impact on a --

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You think that's really a

12   proper function of government, to look out over there

13   and say, we're going to even the playing field in this

14   election?   What if some -- one candidate is more

15   eloquent than the other one?            You make him talk with

16   pebbles in his mouth or what?

17               (Laughter.)

18               GENERAL CLEMENT:            Justice Scalia, I think

19   there's an important distinction that was suggested in

20   one of Justice Alito's question, between the government

21   trying to level the playing field in the abstract and

22   the government looking out, not at the eloquence of

23   candidates, but at its own campaign finance regime after

24   this Court's decision and recognizing that, look, the

25   differential --


                                       27
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


1                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           But the campaign finance

2    regimes we've approved up to now, the significant

3    limitations, have had an anti-corruption rationale.

4    There is no anti-corruption rationale here.                 The only

5    purpose of this is to level the playing field.                 And I am

6    deeply suspicious of allowing elections to be conducted

7    under a regime whereby Congress levels the playing

8    field.    That seems to be very dangerous.

9                  GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well, again, Justice

10   Scalia, though, you start with the anti-corruption

11   rationale that underlies the hard money contribution

12   caps.    And what Congress has recognized is that after

13   Buckley and after this Court said that a candidate's

14   ability to self-finance is unlimited, it's recognized

15   that in a subset of elections where somebody is going to

16   spend an awful lot of their own money to self-finance,

17   the ordinary hard money contribution caps are going to

18   have a potentially skewing effect.

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It's not just money.     It's

20   not just money.    It's the quality and kind of speech.

21   You're saying, the government is saying, the statute

22   says, that the underfunded candidate has less access to

23   coordinated expenditures with the party than -- than the

24   other party -- than the other candidate.                 And the cases

25   have acknowledge, the statute acknowledges, that


                                        28
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


1    coordinated expenditures have a particularly potent

2    force, and you are saying candidates are treated

3    differently in the access to this kind of speech.

4                And I know of no precedent of this Court

5    that says one party is entitled to assistance from a

6    certain segment and another party is not, based on

7    the -- the content of the speech.               And that's exactly

8    what this is.

9                GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well, Justice Kennedy,

10   what I would say is, if you analogize to a system where

11   Congress decided that because of the advantage that

12   incumbents have, there is a greater scope for

13   coordination of the party with the challengers, I would

14   certainly be here defending that statute.

15               I would like to make clear, though, Justice

16   Kennedy, in fairness, that this focus on the coordinated

17   expenditures of the parties has really not been the

18   focus of Appellant's challenge in this case.

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But it's in the statute

20   and it's part of the challenge.             I agree that it's been

21   given a relatively minor position, but it's of great

22   concern to me because it puts this Court, it puts this

23   statute, in the position of preferring one kind of

24   speech over another.     And we simply do not do that.

25               GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well, Justice Kennedy, let


                                      29
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


1    me say two things about the fact that this was not the

2    gravamen of the challenge here, because one reason I

3    think that's clear is if you look at the record here, at

4    the point that the record closed in this case no party

5    had taken advantage of that coordinated expenditures

6    provision.

7                   JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Are you saying that

8    argument is not properly before us when we are judging

9    the validity of the statute that's been challenged?

10                GENERAL CLEMENT:             I'm saying that this

11   record would not allow you to invalidate the statute on

12   that ground.    The record at the time that it closed

13   should -- there was no time that a party had taken

14   advantage of that.      Now, I understand that it's outside

15   the record, but I understand after the record closed

16   there were some coordinated expenditures.

17                But another thing I would certainly want to

18   know before I considered that challenge, Justice

19   Kennedy, is whether this particular Appellant had

20   coordinated expenditures from his own party up to the

21   limit, because we know as a general matter that there

22   is -- parties will fund different candidates differently

23   or may fund --

24                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But the provisions --

25                GENERAL CLEMENT:             -- some and not others.

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


1                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:            The provisions of the law

2    which prefers one candidate over the other with respect

3    to coordinated expenditures has an impact on campaign

4    strategy.

5                  GENERAL CLEMENT:            Well, again, Justice

6    Kennedy, in fairness, though, I mean, one would expect

7    if that were the nature of the claim, that at a minimum

8    we would know two facts that I don't know, aren't in the

9    record.     One is whether or not his candidate reached the

10   cap from his party's coordinated expenditures, because

11   if he didn't I don't see why that individual would have

12   standing.

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Mr. Solicitor General,

14   you're defending this statute on its face, I take it.

15                 GENERAL CLEMENT:            Well, I am defending --

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And it seems to me that

17   this is a facial invalidity of substantial proportions.

18                 GENERAL CLEMENT:            Well, Justice Kennedy, I

19   always thought it was harder to bring a facial

20   challenge, not easier to bring a facial challenge.               And

21   I realized that we relaxed the normal rules about

22   as-applied challenges in the First Amendment context,

23   but I think there has to be a limit to that, too.                And I

24   think in a case where we don't know the fundamental

25   facts that at least I'd want to know before even


                                         31

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


1    evaluating that challenge, I think it would be bad for

2    us to invalidate the statute, it would be wrong for us

3    to invalidate the statute on those grounds.                      And I think

4    I would still be here defending it.                       --

5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             I thought that that's what

6    a facial challenge essentially consists of.                      You don't

7    look to see whether in fact the harmful First Amendment

8    effect has occurred; you look to whether it opens up the

9    possibility for that to occur.

10                GENERAL CLEMENT:             But I don't think mere

11   theoretical possibility is enough, even in the First

12   Amendment context.      And I still think you ask the

13   question:   Does this individual even have standing to

14   bring the First Amendment challenge?                      And I would think

15   an element of standing to bring the First Amendment

16   challenge Justice Kennedy has in mind would be a

17   candidate who, first of all, his opposing candidate took

18   substantial amounts of excess contributions.                     But at a

19   bare minimum, I would think that the plaintiff would

20   have to say that, look, I took up to the cap of the

21   coordinated contributions from my party and I would have

22   loved to have gotten more, the party was willing to give

23   me more, but I wasn't able --

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:             You can't go in before the

25   election and say:     Look, I'm about to be terribly

1    disadvantaged; my opponent is about to have all of these

2    coordinated expenses and I'm not able to.                 And you're

3    going to say:   Oh, we have to wait until the election is

4    over to see whether in fact that happens.                 It seems to

5    me this is precisely the kind of a situation a facial

6    challenge is designed for.

7                GENERAL CLEMENT:            With respect, Justice

8    Scalia, there is two things.            There is whether you can

9    bring a facial challenge or not and there's when you can

10   you bring it.   And I think if you go in and allege that

11   all of those things are likely, then you probably have

12   standing at the outset.

13               But those allegations weren't made here.

14   The focus of this case has always been on the

15   contribution levels and the contribution provisions of

16   this statute.   At the end of the day the analysis is

17   quite similar, so I'm not --

18               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Isn't one of the virtues

19   of the independent self-financed candidate is he can

20   emphasize his independence?            So he very rarely is going

21   to complain about not being able to get too much money,

22   enough money from outside sources.                 And isn't it a fact

23   that most of them do finance a very significant

24   percentage of their total campaign costs?

25               GENERAL CLEMENT:            I think all that's right,


                                       33

1    Justice Stevens.   And as you suggest, it's an unlikely

2    challenge to be brought because often times the

3    self-financer is advertising his independence from party

4    and contributors here.

5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Do you want us to write an

6    opinion which says that independently wealthy candidates

7    generally have different sorts of views than other

8    people?

9                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           No, I don't think that's

10   true.   But I think that they do have different ways of

11   raising the funds necessary to mount their campaigns.

12               And I think -- to get back to the focus of

13   this, I think all that the Court needs to recognize is

14   that the Buckley decision itself has created a potential

15   anomaly, because if you want to think about

16   self-financing, you can think about it as being the

17   ultimate form of soft money, because the Constitution

18   itself precludes Congress from limiting the amount of

19   self-funding.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 General, we haven't

21   talked yet about the disclosure, the special disclosure

22   requirements in that money is speech, and in a First

23   Amendment area it strikes me as very problematic that

24   the government requires you to disclose in a

25   differential way how you intend -- when you're spending


                                       34
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


1    a particular amount of money and on such precise

2    day-by-day requirements.

3                I mean, is there any other area -- if you're

4    writing a book, you don't have to disclose to the

5    government when you're going to publish it and how far

6    along you're getting in the draft.                And yet, it just

7    seems this is the same sort of thing in the election

8    context.

9                GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

10   there are other contexts within the election area where

11   there are comparable disclosure requirements.                    And I

12   think I would point you to the McConnell case and the

13   fact that this Court approved a 24-hour disclosure

14   requirement for electioneering communications.

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But those are

16   applicable across the board.           These are special

17   disclosure requirements for people who are going to

18   engage in additional speech.

19               GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well, I mean, I'm not --

20   I'm not sure that's right in a sense that these are

21   disclosure requirements that apply across the board.

22   The timing is triggered particularly by a candidate's

23   contribution to their own campaign.                    So that's the way

24   in which they're different.           But I think it's worth

25   focusing on that, because I actually think the


                                      35
                        Alderson Reporting Company

1    constitutional issues that are implicated by a

2    disclosure of a candidate's contribution to his or her

3    own campaign are actually less significant than

4    generally is true of campaign finance disclosure,

5    because what this Court talked about in Buckley as the

6    primary concern in the disclosure context was the

7    associational rights that are reflected when somebody

8    contributes to a candidate or an organization makes an

9    electioneering communication on behalf of a candidate.

10               I think those associational interests are

11   obviously not implicated when all you're forcing someone

12   to disclose is the amount that they spent on their own

13   campaign.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So wouldn't you

15   think they would require more detailed and more

16   expeditious disclosure of the associational link than of

17   the self-funding?    And yet it's the exact opposite?

18               GENERAL CLEMENT:             No.      I would think the

19   Constitution would be more concerned about the

20   disclosing the associational link because there is more

21   than one constitutional interest at issue.                  And I think

22   if you look at this as a whole there really isn't a

23   differential regime.       Every electioneering communication

24   from the first $10,000 has to be disclosed.                  If

25   anything, the complaint should be the electioneering


                                        36

1    communication should come in here complaining about the

2    fact that these self-financing candidates get a free

3    pass for the first $350,000 of their financing, before

4    the disclosure requirements kick in.

5                  So I mean, I really think this is a

6    relatively modest disclosure provision and it arises in

7    a context where there aren't associational interests.

8                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The problem is it's every

9    $10,000.   As you pointed out, it doesn't require more

10   disclosure.   All of this information would be disclosed

11   under the system without this 24-hour, and that I think

12   is the complaint, the burden of having every time you

13   spend $10,000 to file something.

14                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           But Justice Ginsburg, I

15   think that's the same in the electioneering

16   communications, which is it's triggered for $10,000 but

17   I think it continues to be triggered.                    Now, it isn't the

18   nature of the challenge, so I may be wrong about that,

19   but I think that's the way that that works.

20                 In any event, I think it's a fair point here

21   that the fact that you trigger additional disclosures

22   with each $10,000 I think is useful in informing the

23   electorate; but I also think it's fair to say is

24   necessary in order for the substantive provisions of the

25   statute to operate, because what they want to do is they


                                        37

1    want to enable as a self-financed candidate spends

2    additional money as the election date approaches, they

3    want to put the opponent, if they have otherwise reached

4    the cap of what they can raise in additional funds in a

5    position to continue to raise additional funds.

6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   What if the -- what

7    if the restriction were more tailored, if Congress

8    decided the one area where the wealthy really have an

9    advantage is buying television time, so that's what

10   we're going to restrict.           If the wealthy individual buys

11   a certain amount of television time, we're going to

12   allow contributions to the less wealthy candidate to buy

13   television time.   They think the money is not as big a

14   deal in the other areas.           Would that be all right?

15               GENERAL CLEMENT:              I think it would be

16   constitutional, Mr. Chief Justice.                   I think it's

17   reacting to the same basic phenomenon, which is one

18   aspect of the campaign finance regime gives self-

19   financers an ability to spend a tremendous amount of

20   money and creates a potential disparity.                   What creates

21   the disparity is the fact that you have relatively low

22   hard money contribution caps, and Congress recognized --

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:              What if one party has more

24   time on his hands?      He's -- he's unemployed, so he --

25   you know, he can go around, whereas the other party has

1    to -- has to hire people to speak for him.                      He has -- he

2    has a job most of the time.             Are you going to even that

3    disparity, too?

4                  GENERAL CLEMENT:           No, Justice Scalia, and

5    again I think there's an important distinction between

6    trying to level the playing field in every respect --

7                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           I can understand leveling,

8    leveling contribution limits when you're worried about

9    corruption, I can understand that.                  But doing it just to

10   -- to make sure that there is an even playing field, I

11   -- there's just no end to that.               And it just isn't money

12   that makes it an even playing feed.                      A lot of other

13   factors -- incumbency, the war chest that incumbents

14   have which -- money from the last election, that isn't

15   counted for -- for the millionaires' provision.

16                 There are so many factors that -- that go to

17   making the even playing field that I -- I'm just very

18   reluctant to acknowledge a congressional power to -- to

19   sit in judgment of our elections that way.

20                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well, Justice Scalia, I

21   mean, in an odd way I think this principle is actually

22   implicit in the plurality opinion against -- in Randall

23   v. Sorrell.   I know you didn't join that opinion, but in

24   that opinion this Court said, the plurality said, that

25   contribution limits can in some ways be too low because


                                        39
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


1    if they're too low they preclude the ability for

2    somebody to raise enough money and that exaggerates the

3    advantages that incumbents have.              And I think Congress

4    really made an analogous judgment here.                I'm not

5    suggesting it was constitutionally compelled, but they

6    made an analogous judgment, which is there is more than

7    one source of advantage; one source of advantage is the

8    self-financing candidate's ability to spend unlimited

9    amounts of their own money.           They respected the fact

10   that that's a constitutional entitlement, but they said

11   it's not that in the abstract that's the problem; it's

12   the combination of unlimited self-financing and

13   relatively low hard money contribution caps --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:           But --

15               GENERAL CLEMENT:           -- and they relaxed the

16   one thing that they could control, which was the cap.

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So what if Congress

18   decided that a debate on a particular issue was

19   distorted by the wealth of owners of newspapers?                 And so

20   it passed a law saying that people who are responding to

21   that are relieved of the tax burden they would otherwise

22   have to pay, on whatever their -- you know, sales tax on

23   pamphlets that they want to sell.               Would that be all

24   right?

25               GENERAL CLEMENT:           I --

1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                To level the playing

2    field on the debate on that particular issue?

3                GENERAL CLEMENT:           I think it might be and

4    it's not that radically different than what this Court

5    approved in Ragan against Taxation Without

6    Representation.

7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No -- so you can tax

8    -- you can tax a newspaper, but you cannot -- you don't

9    have to tax people who are responding to the newspaper?

10               GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well --

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                The taxing power is

12   an -- is a limit on the exercise of First Amendment

13   rights?

14               GENERAL CLEMENT:           Maybe there are

15   differences in that particular context.                Maybe the

16   Freedom of Press clause informs the analysis.                But this

17   Court has upheld the regime that withheld tax benefits

18   to an organization if it engaged in lobbying; and at the

19   same time this Court said that it was okay to give those

20   tax benefits --

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But that's any --

22   any organization that engaged in lobbying.

23               GENERAL CLEMENT:           Yes, but the next couple

24   of lines of the opinion said:            And it's okay if we give

25   those tax benefits back to a veterans organization, but


                                      41
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


1    only veterans organizations.           So I just think what that

2    case shows up is that the Court has recognized that the

3    government has a fair amount of flexibility.

4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So is there no

5    limitation on the rationale of leveling the playing

6    field throughout the First Amendment?

7                GENERAL CLEMENT:           No, there is -- there is a

8    limiting principle, and I think that, importantly, there

9    is a limiting principle that's very applicable to this

10   very context, which is I think if Congress went to the

11   point where they weren't doing what I think they're

12   doing here, which is not trying to limit the amount of

13   self-financing, but using it as a mechanism here to

14   identify particularly costly races where they should

15   raise the contribution limits, if they went further and

16   basically said we're going to give you public financing

17   if your opponent self-finances, and we're going to give

18   you two dollars for every dollar that your opponent

19   self-finances, I think at that point as a practical

20   matter the regime would operate as a ban on -- as a cap,

21   just like this Court held in Buckley.

22               But I think that's the way to approach this

23   issue, which is to basically say if what Congress is

24   doing is really trying to effectively cap

25   self-expenditures, then Congress cannot do that; but if


                                      42
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


1    what Congress is doing is giving candidates choice and

2    is trying to react to the regulatory environment created

3    by self-financing --

4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, it's trying --

5    it's certainly trying to chill self-financing by

6    burdening it when it reaches a certain level.

7                GENERAL CLEMENT:           I mean, I really don't

8    think that's an accurate description of what happened

9    here, because if you look at the legislative record here

10   -- I know not everybody likes to do that -- but if you

11   look at the legislative record here, you will see that

12   both parties in this, the opponents and the proponents

13   of this amendment, realize that they couldn't limit

14   self-financing and that they were unlikely to limit

15   self-financing because it's such an attractive option

16   for parties and for candidates.             And both parties took

17   it as a given that the effect of Section 319 and its

18   Senate counterpart would be to put more money, not less

19   money, into electoral speech.

20               JUSTICE ALITO:         How is it that there is a

21   serious corruption problem in most instances if a

22   contributor gives more than $2,300 to a candidate, but

23   there is no serious -- presumably Congress doesn't think

24   there is a serious corruption problem when this statute

25   kicks in and somebody gives $6,900 to a candidate?


                                      43
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


1                GENERAL CLEMENT:             Well, Justice Alito, what

2    I would say is that what the relaxation of the

3    contribution limits reflects is an adjustment of other

4    interests; and I don't think in principle what Congress

5    has done here is different from what a number of States

6    do, which is they say for the race for governor the

7    contribution cap limit is going to be 2,000; for State

8    auditor it will be a little less; and for local

9    representative it will be substantially less.

10               Now, I suppose somebody could have come in

11   and said, look, you know, the race for governor you can

12   give $2,000; you can only give a 1,000 for this

13   representative race, so surely that's irrational because

14   the State has recognized that a contribution of $2,000

15   is noncorrupting.    It's not the way it's ever proceeded

16   and I think this Court's --

17               JUSTICE ALITO:           Isn't there a difference,

18   because it may take -- it may take more money to

19   campaign for a particular office, and so the -- it might

20   take a greater amount to have a corrupting influence on

21   -- on that particular race than on a race where the

22   total amount spent is -- is lower.                  But here you're not

23   talking about different offices.

24               GENERAL CLEMENT:             No.      But I think you're

25   talking about Congress using a mechanism that is equally


                                        44
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1    effective in identifying races that are likely to be

2    more expensive.   When one party is spending more than

3    $350,000 of their own money, that's every bit as likely

4    to be a more expensive race than the race for governor

5    or State treasurer or a local representative.            And

6    that's why I think this is so responsive to the problem

7    that Congress recognized with the combination --

8                 JUSTICE ALITO:         But it applies different

9    limits to different in the same -- to candidates in the

10   same race.   So why would Mr. Davis be subject to

11   potential corruption if he got $2,300 -- $2,301 from a

12   -- from a contributor, but his opponent in exactly the

13   same race would not be exposed to corruption if he got

14   $6,900?

15                GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well, can I say two things

16   in response to that?      One is it would not be

17   unprecedented for this Court to approve a regime where

18   the choices of the candidates led to different

19   contribution levels in the exact same race for the exact

20   same office, because that's what happens in Buckley in

21   the public financing scheme that this Court approved.

22   If somebody accepts public financing for the general

23   election for presidency, they are effectively agree to a

24   zero contribution limit; whereas, their opponent, minor

25   party opponent for example, would be subject to higher


                                       45
                         Alderson Reporting Company

1    contribution level.

2                JUSTICE SCALIA:           That's the price of

3    accepting the government subsidy.               They're -- nobody is

4    accepting a government subsidy here.                   The man is

5    spending his own money --

6                GENERAL CLEMENT:           But one --

7                JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- for a speech.

8                GENERAL CLEMENT:           But one of the prices of

9    accepting the government subsidy in Buckley was to agree

10   to limit your own financing of your own campaign to

11   $50,000.

12               Now, their whole theory of this case is that

13   somehow a benefit to their opponent is the same thing as

14   a detriment to themselves.         And it seems to me that -- I

15   mean, the base lines here are sufficiently manipulable;

16   the analogy is exactly the same.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:           Can you back to Justice

18   Kennedy's question, where as I took it he identifies a

19   problem that he sees in this portion of this act which,

20   should the limit be exceeded by our opponent, then we

21   can go to the party and the party can give us more?

22   Now, assume for the sake of argument that he has

23   correctly identified a problem with that.                  Now, my

24   understanding is that once the limit is exceeded and you

25   have this extra amount, three things happen:                  One, an


                                      46
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


1    individual could contribute two or three times the

2    amount to the party directly.               A second possibility is

3    an individual who has exceeded the global amount now

4    gets a bump up and can contribute.                   And the third thing

5    is the party thing.

6                  So focus on that statute where this is

7    written.     In your opinion, if, for the sake of argument,

8    there were a problem with the party, would that

9    particular form of words in the statute be severable

10   from the rest of it?

11                 GENERAL CLEMENT:            It certainly would,

12   Justice Breyer, and one thing to keep in mind in

13   interpreting the statute is that it has Section 401 of

14   the original BCRA -- I think we have it at page 28 of

15   our brief -- is what I would describe, I think, as a

16   "super-severability" clause, because it says not only

17   are unconstitutional provisions severable, but even

18   unconstitutional applications of the same provision are

19   severable.

20                 And I think there would be no problem

21   effectively leaving the statute with the disclosure

22   requirements in place and two of the three means of

23   taking advantage of additional opportunities that the

24   statute affords challengers.

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             It --

1                GENERAL CLEMENT:           So I certainly think it

2    would be severable.

3                JUSTICE SCALIA:           On the theory that it

4    doesn't make much sense anyway?             Is that why --

5                GENERAL CLEMENT:           No.

6                JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- we can chop it up this

7    way?

8                GENERAL CLEMENT:           No.      To the contrary, on

9    the theory that this statute operates on this record

10   without that provision being implicated at all.              I mean,

11   in the first applications of this, the entirety of the

12   2004 election cycle, no party took advantage of the

13   coordinated --

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But I thought that --

15               GENERAL CLEMENT: -- contributions.

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- that Justice Breyer's

17   question, General Clement, was he asked you to assume

18   that that was unconstitutional, and you were answering

19   if it was unconstitutional.           But there is one person

20   whose speech is being discouraged in the picture, and

21   that's the contributor to the self-financed candidate.

22   You have to recognize that that one can't speak as much

23   vis-a-vis the contributors to the other candidate.

24               GENERAL CLEMENT:           I mean, I would concede

25   that there will be these differential limits, but it's


                                      48

1    based on the choice of the candidate to engage or not in

2    self-financing, and -- I mean, the restriction there is

3    much more substantial than the public financing scheme

4    approved by this Court in Buckley, because in the

5    general election if the candidate decides that it's

6    going to -- that a candidate is going to take the public

7    financing scheme then in the general presidential

8    election I can't give even a dollar to that candidate.

9                And it's also I think worth recognizing that

10   in Buckley this Court recognized that, for

11   constitutional and associational rights purposes, it's

12   really the ability to associate with the candidate by

13   giving any contribution, rather than the amount of the

14   contribution, that satisfies that limit.

15               In all events, this is not a challenge

16   that's being brought by contributors.                  And I think it's

17   worth recognizing that Appellant, even though some of

18   its challenge, and I would say the gravamen of the

19   challenge, sounds -- his challenge sounds in equal

20   protection terms, he doesn't really want a leveling-up

21   where the opportunity would be for contributors to both

22   candidates to make triple the $2300 limits.                 He really

23   wants to keep the yoke of relatively low contribution

24   limits on his opponents.        And that's why I think this is

25   such an odd First Amendment challenge.

1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What if the law

2    expressed a displeasure at the introduction of

3    self-financing and said that, as you have these very

4    rapid disclosures, that the less wealthy candidate can

5    accept contributions whatever, twice the amount of

6    whatever the self-financed candidate is spending on his

7    campaign?    Is that all right?

8                  GENERAL CLEMENT:           I mean, I'm not sure I

9    have the hypo.    If he can spend twice as much?

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, he -- you

11   know, the millionaire, as we are talking about, spends

12   -- discloses that he has spent $500,000.                  Then the

13   contribution limits are off the table for the less

14   wealthy candidate to the tune of a million dollars, in

15   other words twice as much as the self-financed

16   candidate.

17                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           If I'm understanding the

18   hypo which we were just talking about contribution

19   limits, because there are no expenditure limits, if I'm

20   understanding the hypo right, I think that would still

21   be okay.    I mean, I think if Congress had decided here

22   that if a self-financer spends beyond a certain amount,

23   then what is important is that then the contribution

24   limits would be lifted entirely.                I suppose Congress

25   could do that, as long as they maintained what they


                                        50
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1    called the "parity principle" or the "proportionality

2    principle," which is in no circumstance will the

3    opponent be able to raise more than the amount of the

4    additional spending.      And if your hypo is suggesting

5    that that would be relaxed so that they could raise

6    twice as much, I think that would raise more difficult

7    constitutional questions.

8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, why not?

9    Because as -- your point in this case, rather than the

10   hypothetical, is that the self-financed candidate is not

11   burdened in any way, but simply that his opponent has

12   benefited.   And it seems to me that would be true in the

13   case of my hypothetical as well.

14                GENERAL CLEMENT:           Again, if I'm

15   understanding the hypo right, I think you would say

16   there that the candidate is effectively burdened because

17   if you get to the point where you're past what I would

18   call "parity" and you actually -- by spending an

19   additional dollar, you're allowing your opponent to

20   spend $2 additional additionally, I think at that point

21   a rational candidate is not going to engage in

22   self-finance.   And so in practice, the provision would

23   operate as an absolute cap, rather than the way it

24   operates here, which is not as a cap.                   And I think if

25   you look at the numbers in the record, joint appendix

1    page 89 --

2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I would have thought

3    all the arguments that you gave before, like the

4    self-financed candidate wants to be able to say he

5    doesn't rely on contributions and so on, those would

6    still be equally applicable.

7                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           They would, but I do think

8    the statute in practice would operate quite differently.

9    And that's why I think it's very helpful that we have a

10   record here in this case that we can cite to.

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So it's not a --

12   it's not a qualitative argument you're making but a

13   quantitative.   At some point, the benefit to the

14   opponent gets to be too much of a chill on the

15   self-financed candidate, but under this system you think

16   it's below the line.

17                GENERAL CLEMENT:           I would put it differently

18   and say we're not arguing for a principle without

19   limits, but what I would say is that we really benefit

20   here from the fact that this Court found no standing for

21   the challenge to the Millionaires' Provision in

22   McConnell, and we have a record of actual experience.

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Suppose we found -- we were

24   of the view that all of the provisions, that the

25   benefits given to the other side here are bad.                 I


                                       52
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1    suppose we could even -- re-even the playing field by

2    either denying those benefits to the candidate opposing

3    the Appellant, the Petitioner here, or we could do the

4    opposite and eliminate similar restrictions upon -- upon

5    the Petitioner.   Do you have any idea which way we ought

6    to go?

7                GENERAL CLEMENT:            May I answer the question?

8    I mean, you're right that to the extent that this says

9    this really sounds as an equal protection case more than

10   a First Amendment case, at the remedial stage you'd ask

11   the question:   Should we level up and have both

12   candidates have a larger cap or should we level down and

13   hold them both to the $2300 level?

14               I would say two things, if I may.               One is

15   it's no accident that Appellant isn't asking you to

16   level up because what -- they're not interested in doing

17   additional financing; they're really taking --

18   interested in taking advantage of keeping the opponent

19   down to the $2300 level.

20               The only other thing that I would say about

21   this choice between leveling up and leveling down is I

22   would say that the statute that would have relaxed the

23   caps for both candidates would pose the same First

24   Amendment issue as this statute.               And so it really is,

25   at bottom, an equal protection claim that you have

1    before you.

2                  Thank you.

3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, General

4    Clement.

5                  Mr. Herman, you may take five minutes.

6                  REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW D. HERMAN

7                      ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

8                  MR. HERMAN:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

9                  First of all, let me answer this -- the

10   discussion about the quote "parity principle."                 In this

11   case, Mr. Davis was outspent by $3 million, yet the

12   parity principle would have allowed his opponent to

13   raise another $1.4 million.             The district court has

14   never answered-- never answered that flaw in the

15   statute.   I haven't seen any explanation of how that

16   creates parity when the higher fund --

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Where did the money come

18   from?   Was it a war chest left over from prior

19   campaigns?

20                 MR. HERMAN:       For his opponent?

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Yes, because he didn't --

22   his opponent did not take advantage of the relaxed

23   contribution limits.

24                 MR. HERMAN:       He went into the election,

25   Justice Ginsburg, with about a $1.15 million war chest.


                                        54

1    And then he --

2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Because he was just a

3    good fundraiser?   That --

4                MR. HERMAN:        He was a chairman of the NRCC.

5    He was an excellent fundraiser.

6                (Laughter.)

7                JUSTICE ALITO:          Can you address Justice

8    Scalia's question about leveling up and leveling down?

9                MR. HERMAN:        I would agree with -- with my

10   friend that we have no interest in leveling up.                     That's

11   -- that's -- as an independent candidate, Mr. Davis is

12   forgoing, for the vast, vast majority of his funding,

13   contributions from private sources, and he has no

14   interest in fostering higher contribution limits for

15   anyone.

16               Let me also discuss the intent -- excuse me

17   -- the disclosure very briefly.              There has been some

18   discussion about how this is -- it's very similar to

19   independent-expenditure disclosure.                     It's really not.

20               What the -- what the statute requires is

21   that a self-financed candidate declare, at the very

22   start of his campaign, whether he intends to spend more

23   than $350,000.   That, as the government's brief

24   acknowledges, has no analogue in any other disclosure

25   provision, and it serves -- it serves no purpose.                     It


                                       55

1    doesn't -- it doesn't inform the electorate of anything

2    other than that this gentleman is going to be

3    self-financing.

4                  It certainly doesn't address corruption.

5    It's simply -- simply harassment of a self-financer

6    requiring them to go on the record --

7                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, it advises the other

8    side that they should get ready to raise more money.

9                  MR. HERMAN:        That's exactly right.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well -- I mean if you say

11   all of the rest of the statute is okay, that's certainly

12   reasonable.   If you're going to let the guy go above the

13   limits that would otherwise apply, it's useful to let

14   him know in advance so he can start, you know, beating

15   the bushes, right?

16                 MR. HERMAN:        Certainly.               And then, finally,

17   there is a reference to this -- this is the ultimate

18   soft money.   We would submit this is the ultimate hard

19   money.   This is money that was raised by Mr. Davis.                     He

20   earned it.    He is entitled to spend it as he wishes, and

21   he is certainly entitled to spend it furthering his

22   candidacy.

23                 Now, if there are no further questions --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you

25   Mr. Herman.
