 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  We will hear

 4   argument next in Case 08-1332, the City of

 5   Ontario v. Quon.

 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHLAND

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9               MR. RICHLAND:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               Under the less restrictive constitutional

12   standards applied when government acts as employer, as

13   opposed to sovereign, there was no Fourth Amendment

14   violation here.

15               First, Ontario Police Sergeant Jeff Quon had

16   no reasonable expectation of privacy vis-à-vis the

17   Ontario Police Department in text messages on his

18   department-issued pager in light of the operational

19   realities of his workplace, which included the explicit

20   no privacy in text messages policy.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  The written policy?

22               (Laughter.)

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  The whole -- the

24   argument here, of course, is that that was modified by

25   the instructions he got from the lieutenant.                  Do we


                                         3

 1   follow the written policy or the policy they allegedly

 2   enforced in practice?

 3                MR. RICHLAND:           That is the argument,

 4   Mr. Chief Justice.      But, in fact, there was no

 5   inconsistency between the no privacy in text messages

 6   aspect of the written policy and the oral information

 7   he was given.

 8                First of all, the written policy itself was

 9   broad enough to cover text messages.                      It stated, for

10   example, at Appendix 152, that it applied to city-owned

11   computers and all associated equipment.                      And again at

12   152:   "City-owned computer equipment, computer

13   peripheral, city networks, the Internet, e-mail, or

14   other city-related computer services."                      And, finally, the

15   agreement to the policy was that it applied -- this is

16   at Appendix 156 -- to city-owned computers and related

17   equipment.

18                So certainly the written policy itself was

19   broad enough to cover text messaging pagers, but in

20   addition to that, nothing in the oral statements made by

21   Lieutenant Duke undermined the no-privacy aspect of the

22   written policy.

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, we are dealing

24   with Mr. Quon's reasonable expectations, right?

25                MR. RICHLAND:           Yes, yes.

 1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  And even with the

 2   written policy, he has the instructions -- everybody

 3   agrees -- you can use this pager for private

 4   communications.

 5                  MR. RICHLAND:           That's correct.

 6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  We're not going to

 7   audit them.     Right?      That's what he said.              He has to pay

 8   for them.     Right?    Now, most things, if you're paying for

 9   them, they're yours.          And this -- it particularly covered

10   messages off-duty.

11                  Now, can't you sort of put all those

12   together and say that it would be reasonable for him to

13   assume that private messages were his business?                     They

14   said he can do it.        They said, you've got to pay for

15   it.   He used it off duty.             They said they're not going

16   to audit it.

17                  MR. RICHLAND:           Not when he was told at the

18   same time that these text messages were considered

19   e-mail and could be audited, and that they were

20   considered public records and could be audited at any

21   time; that is, it has to do with a different aspect of

22   what the policy -- the oral policy --

23                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              In addition to -- that

24   was said at the meeting -- and Lieutenant Duke, who was

25   the same one who later says:                I'm not going to monitor

 1   as long as you pay the difference.                   There was the

 2   statement at the meeting by that same person.                   Wasn't

 3   there something in writing by the police chief to follow

 4   up after that meeting?

 5                MR. RICHLAND:           Yes, there was,

 6   Justice Ginsburg.     There was a memo that was sent that

 7   memorialized the statements at the meeting, that

 8   specifically stated that the text messages were treated

 9   as e-mail under the written policy.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Let me ask you --

11                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Counsel --

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Let me ask you to

13   put the written policy aside.               Hypothetical case:         There's

14   no written policy.      Would he have a reasonable

15   expectation in the privacy of his personal e-mail, text

16   messages, in that case?

17                MR. RICHLAND:           Not --

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  In other words,

19   all we know is the list that I went through earlier.

20                MR. RICHLAND:           Yes.       Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

21   Assuming all the other factors in this case were

22   present --

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Yes.

24                MR. RICHLAND:           That is, he is using his

25   department-issued pager; he is a police officer and


                                          6

 1   indeed a member of the high-profile SWAT team of the

 2   police department.      He should be aware just by virtue of

 3   that fact that there is going to be litigation involving

 4   incidents that the SWAT team gets involved in where there

 5   will be requests for the communications that are made on

 6   that official department-issued pager.

 7                And, in addition, he should be aware of the

 8   fact -- and this is something that the dissenters to

 9   denial of en banc said below.               He should be aware that

10   there may be inquiries from boards of the police to

11   determine whether the conduct of the police in a particular

12   incident is appropriate.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Mr. Richland, a little

14   earlier you referred us to page 152 and 156 of --

15                MR. RICHLAND:           Of the appendix to the

16   petition.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Oh, the appendix to the

18   petition.

19                MR. RICHLAND:           Yes, and that's the policy.

20   That is the written policy, Justice Scalia.                   I'm sorry

21   for the confusion.

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, that's the

23   written policy.

24                MR. RICHLAND:           That is the written policy,

25   and the --

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But the policy

 2   itself, from the point of view of Officer Quon, is a

 3   little bit more complicated than that.

 4              MR. RICHLAND:         Well, of course, what the --

 5   what Officer Quon's point of view is must also be

 6   tempered by what we are reasonably going to accept as a

 7   society of his understanding of the circumstances.

 8              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Counsel --

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You would agree, I

10   think, that if the SCA, the Stored Communications Act --

11              MR. RICHLAND:         Yes.

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                If that made it illegal

13   to disclose these e-mails, then he would certainly be correct

14   that he has a reasonable expectation of privacy; isn't that

15   right?

16              MR. RICHLAND:         No, Mr. Chief Justice.           We

17   would not agree with that.

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                It's not reasonable

19   to assume that people are going to follow the law?

20              MR. RICHLAND:         Well, for several reasons.

21   Number one, this Court has repeatedly stated that the

22   mere fact that something is contrary to the law does not

23   in itself permit a reasonable expectation of privacy.

24   Just two terms ago, in Virginia v. Moore, this Court

25   said precisely that.    And of course it said it earlier


                                       8

 1   in California v. Greenwood, and in a number of other

 2   cases -- Oliver v. United States.

 3               Because the effect of that, of course, would

 4   mean that we would be constitutionalizing every positive

 5   law that might be enacted by a State or the

 6   Federal legislature.

 7               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, on that point, do we

 8   take it as the law of the case or as a given that it was

 9   illegal for I think Arch to turn over the transcripts to

10   the police department?       What do we do with that part of

11   the case?

12               MR. RICHLAND:          Justice Kennedy, I don't

13   believe it is law of the case that is binding on this

14   Court, since this Court is a higher court.              Although it

15   is true that this Court denied certiorari on that issue,

16   I don't believe it is bound by the Ninth Circuit

17   determination of that, and in fact it is our contention

18   that that was incorrectly decided.

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            On remand -- has there been

20   a final judgment issued as to Arch, or is that just

21   being held --

22               MR. RICHLAND:          I don't believe so,

23   Justice Kennedy.   I believe that everything has been

24   stayed pending the determination by this Court.

25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Counsel, let's assume

 1   that in this police department, everyone knew, the

 2   supervisors and everyone else, that the police

 3   department people spoke to their girlfriends at night.

 4               MR. RICHLAND:         Yes, Justice Sotomayor.

 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             And one of the chiefs,

 6   out of salacious interest, decides:                    I'm going to just

 7   go in and get those texts, those messages, because I

 8   just have a prurient interest.             Does that officer have

 9   any expectation of privacy that his boss won't just

10   listen in out of prurient interest?

11               MR. RICHLAND:         Justice Sotomayor, as to the

12   first aspect, the question of reasonable expectation of

13   privacy, the motive should have no impact.                    The motive

14   of looking should have no impact.               The question of

15   reasonable expectation of privacy must be analyzed

16   according to the relationship between the officer and

17   his -- and his employer.

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But if in fact -- and

19   whether we agree with this conclusion or not, we accept

20   the lower court's views that there was an expectation

21   that the chiefs were not going to read these things,

22   some expectation of privacy --

23               MR. RICHLAND:         Yes.

24               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             -- the limits of it have

25   to be limited for all of the reasons you've said, doesn't

 1   this case begin and end on whether or not what the jury

 2   found is reasonable grounds for what the city did?

 3               MR. RICHLAND:         I think that what this case

 4   begins and ends with, if we assume that there was a

 5   reasonable expectation of privacy, is under the

 6   plurality opinion in O'Connor:             Whether the search

 7   itself was reasonable.      And the jury did, of course,

 8   make a determination as to the purpose of the search.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:           I guess we don't decide

10   our -- our Fourth Amendment privacy cases on the basis

11   of whether there -- there was an absolute guarantee of

12   privacy from everybody.       I think -- I think those cases

13   say that if you think it can be made public by anybody,

14   you don't -- you don't really have a right of privacy.

15               So when the -- when the filthy-minded police

16   chief listens in, it's a very bad thing, but it's not --

17   it's not offending your right of privacy.              You expected

18   somebody else could listen in, if not him.

19               MR. RICHLAND:         I think that's correct,

20   Justice Scalia.

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:           I think it is.

22               MR. RICHLAND:         And I think the reason why

23   you must have the two-step analysis in a case of this

24   sort -- that is, first look at the question as to

25   whether there's a reasonable expectation of privacy,


                                      11

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   and then determine, if there was, whether the search was

 2   reasonable -- is precisely for the reason that, without

 3   that, what we will have in every case is the claim that

 4   there was a salacious reason, that that was the reason.

 5   And we'll be litigating every one of those cases --

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Then, according to what

 7   you just said, the jury determination was superfluous.

 8   If there was no reasonable expectation of privacy

 9   because the officers were told this is just -- we

10   treat this just like e-mails, it can be monitored, it

11   can be made public, then there would be no reasonable

12   expectation of privacy and there would be no question to

13   go to the jury.

14               MR. RICHLAND:           That's correct,

15   Justice Ginsburg.    And it is our position that this

16   should never have gone to the jury, that summary

17   judgment should have been granted in favor of the

18   Ontario Police Department.

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             So you have two arguments:

20   One, that it's -- there's no reasonable expectation of

21   privacy; even if there were, that this was a reasonable

22   search.

23               MR. RICHLAND:           That's correct.

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Is reasonable expectation

25   of privacy a judge question or a jury question?

 1               MR. RICHLAND:           Well, if there is a conflict

 2   in the facts, I presume the jury must resolve those --

 3   that factual conflict.        But in this case, I don't

 4   believe there is a conflict in the facts, and, therefore,

 5   it is a judge question.

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Did your client

 7   treat on-duty text messages different from off-duty text

 8   messages?

 9               MR. RICHLAND:           It did, once there was an

10   initial determination made as to the --

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Why did it do that?

12               MR. RICHLAND:           Excuse me.            I'm sorry.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Why did it treat

14   them differently?    Under your theory, they're all the

15   same -- no expectation of privacy.

16               MR. RICHLAND:           It treated them differently

17   out of -- because there were two aspects to the case.

18   One aspect was the initial determination that Chief

19   Sharp ordered to say:       I just want to know, is our

20   character limit efficacious here, or do we need to have

21   a higher character limit?           And for that purpose, they

22   needed to just look at all of them.                      And they did; they

23   looked at all of the text messages.

24               But then when they saw that some of them may

25   have involved violations of department regulations, then


                                        13

 1   it was sent to Internal Affairs, and they redacted the

 2   off-duty messages because they were --

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Is that something like the

 4   plain view argument?      In search and -- search and --

 5                MR. RICHLAND:         I suppose.

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, I'm serious.        In

 7   other words, there is, under your view --

 8                MR. RICHLAND:         Yes.

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           -- legitimate grounds to

10   look at the messages, and then once they see it, they

11   don't have to ignore it.

12                MR. RICHLAND:         I think that's correct,

13   Justice Kennedy.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, why did -- I'm

15   sorry.   I still don't understand.               It redacted them,

16   right?

17                MR. RICHLAND:         Redacted because the inquiry

18   -- the second stage of the inquiry in Internal Affairs --

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Yes.

20                MR. RICHLAND:         -- was simply to determine how

21   much time was being spent on duty sending personal messages.

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Right.

23                MR. RICHLAND:         So the Internal Affairs

24   Department said:   We don't need to look at the off-duty

25   messages.   We're going to redact them.                 Why get into all


                                       14

 1   of that?     We don't have to look.

 2                  The department was pretty scrupulous.                And I

 3   think that's part of what makes the entire approach that

 4   they took to this reasonable.               It makes the search

 5   aspect of the case reasonable.                And I think it's

 6   important, in that regard, to look at the nature --

 7                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           Excuse me.       You said they

 8   did get to the off-duty text messaging later?

 9                  MR. RICHLAND:         No, it was the other way

10   around.     They looked at the on-duty text messaging at

11   the later stage, at the Internal Affairs stage.                   But

12   they looked at all of the text messages when the only

13   purpose for the inquiry was to determine how many of the

14   text messages in general are job-related and how many

15   were personal?     Because the question was:                Do we need to

16   raise the character limit --

17                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, you don't have

18   to look at the messages to determine that with respect

19   to the off-duty messages, right?

20                  MR. RICHLAND:         Well -- well, you did,

21   because of the fact, Mr. Chief Justice, that there were

22   job-related communications even while there was

23   off-duty.     These officers were SWAT team officers.                   They

24   were on duty, as Sergeant Quon said, 24/7.                   That was one

25   of the reasons why they had the text messaging pagers.

 1                  JUSTICE ALITO:          If someone wanted to send a

 2   message to one of these pagers, what sort of a device

 3   would you need?     Do you need to have another pager, or

 4   can you -- could you send a message to one of these

 5   devices from some other type of device?

 6                  MR. RICHLAND:         No, there were messages that

 7   were sent from various other devices.                     Is the question

 8   whether that could be physically done, electronically

 9   done?     Because, yes, clearly that was --

10                  JUSTICE ALITO:          Yes.      What other type of

11   device could you use to send a message to one of these

12   pagers?

13                  MR. RICHLAND:         It -- oh.            I'm not certain

14   if it was something other than another text messaging

15   pager.    It did appear that there were some e-mail

16   entries in the transcripts themselves, which suggested

17   that there might have been a way to communicate to them

18   with e-mail, but that's just -- that's all in the record

19   that suggests that.

20                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           You know, if they were

21   on duty 24/7, there weren't any off-duty messages, were

22   there?

23                  (Laughter.)

24                  MR. RICHLAND:         Well, I may have misspoke.

25   They were on call 24/7.          They were the SWAT team, and

 1   they had to respond to emergencies.

 2                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            If we take it that the

 3   Stored Communications Act does say that the provider may

 4   not give out the transcripts, if we take that as given,

 5   then how can the department lawfully use the

 6   transcripts?

 7                  MR. RICHLAND:         Well, Justice Ginsburg, first

 8   of all, there was no -- there is no current claim that

 9   anything that the department did with respect to the

10   Stored Communications Act was unlawful.                      So it may be

11   that the other entity, Arch Wireless, violated the

12   Stored Communications Act, but that would not preclude

13   the department -- which was, after all, the subscriber

14   -- from requesting to see what, in fact, the transcripts

15   disclosed.

16                  But in addition to that, there is also the

17   fact that, as I said before, a reasonable expectation of

18   privacy couldn't be based simply on the fact that there

19   was a statute, and particularly not a statute like the

20   Stored Communications Act, because that's a statute that's

21   extremely, extremely technical.                 And there is a --

22   one has to determine whether an entity was working

23   either as an electronic communications service or a

24   remote computing service, and so on.                      Courts are all

25   over the board on this.          As this Court noted in United

 1   States v. Payner, a complicated law like that simply

 2   cannot be the basis for a reasonable expectation of

 3   privacy.

 4                 And if I may reserve the rest of my time,

 5   thank you.

 8                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL,

 9       ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

10                    SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

11                 MR. KATYAL:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

12   and may it please the Court:

13                 Millions of employees today use technologies

14   of their -- of their employers under policies

15   established by those employers.                When a government

16   employer has a no-privacy policy in place that governs

17   the use of those technologies, ad hoc statements by a

18   non-policy member cannot create a reasonable expectation

19   of privacy.    Put most simply, the computer help desk

20   cannot supplant the chief's desk.                 That simple, clear

21   rule should have decided this case.

22                 Instead, the Ninth Circuit found that the

23   1999 policy applied to pagers, but then concluded that

24   that 1999 policy was informally modified years later.

25   And that decision should be reversed.                    It disregards

 2   the Chief Justice's opinion in Engquist v. Oregon about

 3   the greater amount of leeway that the government has

 4   when it acts as an employer.             And it also is not

 5   consistent with the plurality opinion in O'Connor, which

 6   observed that when the government adopts a policy that

 7   its employees lack privacy, no reasonable expectation of

 8   privacy exists.

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Let me ask you this:

10   Suppose the department asks for opinion of legal

11   counsel whether or not transmittal of the transcripts by

12   Arch to the department was a violation of the Act, and

13   the counsel said:    This was a violation of the Act; they

14   had no right to send them to you.                 Would the department

15   then still have had a right to look at the transcripts?

16                 MR. KATYAL:       So the question is if the

17   Stored Communications Act is violated?

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.       Yes.

19                 MR. KATYAL:       We don't think the Stored

20   Communications Act was --

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           No, but -- no, my

22   hypothetical is that the -- that there is a legal

23   counsel's opinion that this was in violation of the Act,

24   and let's say the district court said it is in violation

25   of the Act.    Let's say we say it's in violation of the

 1   Act.   Is that the end of case?              The department cannot

 2   look at the transcripts?

 3               MR. KATYAL:         Oh, absolutely not.               I mean, I

 4   think this Court has repeatedly said that -- that

 5   various privacy laws don't determine the scope of the

 6   Fourth Amendment.    I think it said so most clearly in

 7   California v. Greenwood.          And I think that's for a very

 8   simple reason, that things like the Stored

 9   Communications Act, Justice Kennedy, the Electronic

10   Communications Privacy Act, came about --

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, California v.

12   Greenwood was a question of -- of a Fourth Amendment

13   standard that had to be nationwide.                      So you say it's the

14   same -- same thing here?

15               MR. KATYAL:         I -- I do think it's the same,

16   and for this simple reason, that when you have a

17   nationwide standard or a State standard, it's to fill

18   the gap, whatever isn't necessarily protected by the

19   Fourth Amendment.    And here --

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, but Greenwood was in

21   the -- in the context of the exclusionary rule in

22   criminal proceedings.       I certainly think that States --

23   at least we could make the reasonable argument that

24   States can have different policies with respect to their

25   employees, that have to be respected.

 1                  MR. KATYAL:       Absolutely, Justice Kennedy.             I

 2   don't disagree with that.            I think the only question is,

 3   if the -- if I understand your question it's, does a

 4   Federal statute about privacy somehow matter to the

 5   Fourth Amendment analysis about reasonable expectations

 6   of privacy?     And there our contention is, no; it's

 7   precisely because Congress enacted the Stored

 8   Communications Act to fill gaps in Fourth Amendment law.

 9   That -- that's why it's enacted.

10                  And for -- for this Court to then use that

11   very Act to be the template on which reasonable

12   expectations of privacy may spring I think would be a

13   very -- it would be a novel proposition.                  Nor should --

14                  JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, that's -- that's a

15   little bit puzzling because there are -- electronic

16   communications are stored all over the place in -- and

17   there isn't a history -- these are -- these are

18   relatively new.     There isn't a well-established

19   understanding about what is private and what isn't

20   private.     It's a little different from putting garbage

21   out in front of your house, which has happened for a

22   long time.

23                  If -- if statutes governing the privacy of

24   that information don't have any bearing on reasonable

25   expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment, it's

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   some -- I -- I'm at something of a loss to figure out

 2   how to determine whether there is a reasonable

 3   expectation of privacy regarding any of those things.

 4                 MR. KATYAL:       Well, Justice Alito, I do think

 5   that the underlying premise of your question is one with

 6   which we entirely agree.          These are technologies that

 7   are rapidly in flux, in which we don't have intuitive

 8   understandings the way we do about, say, trash and so

 9   on.   And it's precisely for that reason I think the

10   Court should be very careful to constitutionalize and

11   generate Fourth Amendment rules in this area at the

12   first instance.

13                 To do so I think really does freeze into --

14   into -- into place something that the legislature can't

15   then fix, going to Justice Kennedy's opinion in, for

16   example, Murray v. Giarratano, in which he said that

17   constitutionalizing in that area -- constitutionalizing

18   may pretermit legislative solutions.

19                 Now, here the Stored Communications Act is

20   not violated under any way, shape, or form.              The Stored

21   Communications Act has two different provisions in it,

22   one having to do with remote -- remote computing

23   services, RCSs.    That's when an entity offers storage

24   facilities.    And the other is for an electronic

25   communications service.         That is essentially transmission

 1   of messages from point to point.

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Your point that you

 3   made just a moment ago, that we don't want to freeze into

 4   place the constitutional requirements with respect to

 5   new technology, I wonder if it cuts the other way.                  We're

 6   dealing with an amendment that looks to whether

 7   something is reasonable.          And I think it might be the

 8   better course to say that the Constitution applies, but

 9   we're going to be more flexible in determining what's

10   reasonable because they are dealing with evolving

11   technology.

12                 MR. KATYAL:       Well, I think that the -- the

13   best way -- I think the most -- the easiest way for the

14   Court to resolve this is to simply say that when we are

15   dealing with what is reasonable, we look to the policy.

16   And here there's a policy by the employer, it says that

17   computer-associated -- computer-related equipment and

18   others, there's no expectation of privacy.                 You have a

19   person who is told that repeatedly.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, but that puts

21   a lot of weight -- I mean, there are some things where we

22   don't bind them.    You know, you get the usual parking

23   garage thing that has got all this small print on the

 1                But in here, I just don't know.                   I just

 2   don't know how you tell what's reasonable -- I suspect

 3   it might change with how old people are and how

 4   comfortable they are with the technology -- when you have

 5   all these different -- different factors.

 6                You know, they're told you can use it for

 7   private; you've got to pay for it.                 I think if I pay for

 8   it, it's mine, and it's not the employer's.

 9                MR. KATYAL:       Well, I think the clearest way,

10   Mr. Chief Justice, to decide what is reasonable and what

11   isn't is actually the terms of the policy.                    And it seems

12   to me very little is more unreasonable than expecting

13   a right to privacy after you've been told in a

14   policy you have no privacy.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Suppose we find a right of

16   privacy.   Is that the end of the case?                   I mean, wouldn't

17   you also -- in order to sustain this lawsuit, wouldn't

18   you also have to find that it was an unreasonable --

19                MR. KATYAL:       Absolutely.              There are two

20   arrows in the city's quiver, and I think they're right

21   as to both of them.     But --

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:           What's the government's

23   position on the unreasonableness of the search?

24                MR. KATYAL:       The government's position is

25   that the Ninth Circuit just from the get-go got the


                                       24

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   standard wrong by citing -- by using a Schowengerdt test

 2   which was, was this -- was this search the least

 3   restrictive alternative?        And we think this Court has

 4   repeatedly said that's the wrong way of thinking about

 5   it, that that puts judges in the position of

 6   second-guessing searches on the ground, that they're

 7   not really fully -- fully equipped to do so.

 8               So I do think that is a possible way to

 9   resolve this, Justice Scalia, but --

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Maybe an easier way, huh?

11               MR. KATYAL:       Well, I don't know that it's

12   easier, in the following sense:              I think that thousands

13   of employers across the country rely on these policies

14   and millions of employees.          And the Ninth Circuit's

15   decision puts that reliance in some jeopardy, because it

16   said that you can have an official policy and it can be

17   taken back by what some ad hoc subordinate says.                And

18   that is, I think, a very destructive notion to the idea

19   of reliance on these policies and setting --

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So, your -- your

21   position would require people basically to have two of

22   these things with them, two whatever they are,

23   text messager or the BlackBerries or whatever, right?

24   Because assuming they're going to get personal things,

25   you know, some emergency at home, they're also going to


                                      25

 1   get work things --

 2                MR. KATYAL:         To the -- under this policy,

 3   yes.   You might have an employer that sets a different

 4   policy and allows for some de minimis use and a zone of

 5   privacy in that use.        You can have a variety of

 6   different things.     But what I think would be dangerous

 7   is to have a blanket rule that constitutionalizes and

 8   says you always have reasonable expectations of privacy

 9   in this technology.       The result may be,

10   Mr. Chief Justice, that employers then won't give that

11   technology at all to their employees and -- and

12   eliminate even that de minimis use.

13                Mr. Chief Justice, you had also asked before

14   about the standpoint of Quon in -- in evaluating

15   the reasonableness of the search -- of the search in his

16   perspective of the policy.             We think that is the wrong

17   way of looking at it.        Instead, we think the proper test

18   is the written policy, what it says, and that is the

19   simplest way, I think, to provided administrability to

20   the lower courts.     They can simply say was this policy

21   in existence, and not get into those questions of is it

22   like a parking ticket, did I flip through it too

23   quickly, did I understand that the policy and the like.

24                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               You want to -- you want

25   to -- you want to undo O'Connor's operational realities

 1   of the workplace and say the minute you issued a written

 2   policy that renders all searches okay, even if the

 3   operational realities are different?

 4               MR. KATYAL:       Not at all, Justice Sotomayor.

 5   I take it the language about operational realities in

 6   the workplace, what is right next to it is looking to

 7   whether or not there are regulations in place, and here

 8   a policy is a regulation.         And so --

 9               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             You may have an argument

10   that the nature of the policy here and all of the

11   activities related to it don't prove an operational

12   reality of privacy, but I don't know why -- you want a

13   flat rule that says once you have a written policy,

14   there' no expectation of privacy.

15               MR. KATYAL:       And I think that is -- that is

16   what O'Connor says with respect to the -- as long as the

17   policy is in place, that -- that's what O'Connor

18   permits.

 1   skipping over is -- is -- and both the lower courts

 2   recognize this -- that the computer policy that the

 3   department had didn't apply to the pagers on its own.

 4   It -- it only came into play after Lieutenant Duke

 5   modified that policy and told people at the -- at the

 6   meeting that was referred to earlier that the pagers are

 7   now going to be applying with -- with this policy.

 8   It -- it --

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Why is -- why is that so?

10   I mean, it did say associated equipment.                 And -- and if

11   an employee is told now e-mails aren't private, so we're

12   warning you, we can monitor them, wouldn't such an

13   employee expect the same thing to apply to the pager?

14                 MR. DAMMEIER:         Well, the policy itself has

15   two components to it.       One is, don't use our equipment,

16   all associated equipment for personal business.

17                 The other part of that policy deals with the

18   no privacy, and it informs the people there could be

19   monitoring.   And specifically on the acknowledgment form

20   of that policy, which is at Appendix 156 of the

21   petition, it specifically says the city will

22   periodically monitor e-mail, Internet use, and computer

23   usage.

24                 And -- and, again, I think this is why the --

25   both lower courts came to the conclusion that the


                                        28

 1   computer policy on its own wasn't in play until

 2   Lieutenant Duke announced that, hey, now the pagers are

 3   going -- are going to be in play with this computer

 4   policy.   This is the same Lieutenant Duke --

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But my question is, an

 6   employee reads this policy and says, oh, my e-mails are

 7   going to be subject to being monitored --

 8               MR. DAMMEIER:          Sure.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Wouldn't that employee

10   expect that the policy would carry over to pagers?                  I mean,

11   would -- when you think of what's the reason why they want

12   to look at the e-mails, wouldn't the same reason apply?

13               MR. DAMMEIER:          Well, I'm sure the same

14   reasons could apply, but the -- the city is the one that

15   writes the rules here.       The -- if they want to make it

16   clear on what it applies to, it certainly should be on

17   them to write them clear so the employee understands.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Maybe -- maybe

19   everybody else knows this, but what is the difference

20   between a pager and e-mail?

21               MR. DAMMEIER:          Sure.       The e-mail, looking at

22   the computer policy -- that goes through the city's

23   computer, it goes through the city's server, it goes

24   through all the equipment that -- that has -- that the

25   city can easily monitor.         Here the pagers are a separate


                                       29

 1   device that goes home with you, that travels with you,

 2   that you can use on duty, off duty, and --

 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You can do that with

 4   e-mails.

 5                  MR. DAMMEIER:         Certainly, certainly.           But in

 6   this -- in this -- in this instance with the pagers, it went

 7   through no city equipment; it went through Arch Wireless

 8   and then was transmitted to another -- another person.

 9                  So, again, to Duke -- Duke is the one that

10   said:    Hey, this -- this comes into play.                 But

11   Lieutenant Duke is also the one that gave the privacy

12   guarantee to the SWAT team members and said:                      As long as

13   you pay the overages, we're not going to look at your

14   pagers; we're not going to look at the messages.                     So if

15   -- if you couple both of those modifications, both by

16   the same lieutenant -- and he wasn't just some

17   subordinate; he was the lieutenant in charge of the

18   administrative bureau; he was the administrative bureau

19   commander.

20                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I thought that he said --

21   he was saying:     But as far as billing is concerned, I'm

22   not going to look at these; if you use more than 25,000

23   characters, you pay the extra, and that will be the end

24   of it.     If you contest that, then I'll look to see

25   whether those in excess of 25,000 characters were for

 1   work purposes or private purposes.

 2                And so he's talking about the billing.                      He

 3   hasn't retracted what was said at the meeting about -- that

 4   these text messages are subject to audit.

 5                MR. DAMMEIER:         This -- this is what Sergeant

 6   Quon testified to, that he attributed to Lieutenant

 7   Duke:   If you don't want us to read it, pay the overage

 8   fee.

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:           But what's wrong with his

10   deciding:   I don't like to do this anymore?                   I don't

11   want to collect all this money; it's too complicated;

12   and so I don't know how many of these messages are

13   related to work and how many they are just mucking

14   around prying into each other's business.

15                MR. DAMMEIER:         He can certainly --

16                JUSTICE BREYER:           So I would like to know, so

17   therefore I'm going to look and see.                    Now, what's

18   unreasonable about that?

19                MR. DAMMEIER:         Well, he certainly could say

20   I don't want to do this anymore, and he could --

21                JUSTICE BREYER:           Oh, no.

22                MR. DAMMEIER:         And he could tell everybody.

23                JUSTICE BREYER:           I'm saying what's

24   -- the city owns the pager.            It's a pager used for work.

25   They are giving a privilege to people if they want to


                                       31

 1   use it off work.     It seems to be involving a big amount

 2   of collection, and so what he wants to do is he wants to

 3   see how much of this is being used for work and how much

 4   is of this not being used for work.

 5               My question, which I just repeated, is why

 6   is that an unreasonable thing?

 7               MR. DAMMEIER:            I don't think that request is

 8   unreasonable, Your Honor.

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:              Fine.       And then if that's

10   not unreasonable, why is what went on here that is

11   any different?

12               MR. DAMMEIER:            Well, here the jury -- the

13   only fact that was determined by the jury was the reason

14   for the search.     And that's found at the appendix to the

15   petition page 119.      This is the only finding that the

16   jury made as to the purpose of the search:                    To determine

17   the efficacy of the existing character limits to ensure

18   that officers were not being required to pay for the

19   work-related expenses.

20               JUSTICE BREYER:              How does that differ from

21   what I just said?

22               MR. DAMMEIER:            Well, it -- it comes into

23   play on -- on the scope of the search.                    Again --

24               JUSTICE BREYER:              No, I understand.           I thought

25   it's just a more -- a few more words to say just what I


                                         32

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   said.    That they wanted to look into this because they

 2   are tired about collecting so much money.

 3                It's the third time I've said the same

 4   thing; probably it's my fault I'm not being clear.                But

 5   it looked as if they wanted to know how many are being

 6   sent for work purposes, how many for private purposes

 7   including prying into people's business, which wasn't

 8   too desirable, and -- and -- so that they could get

 9   the -- the charges right.

10                Now, that sounds like what the jury said they

11   were doing, too.   And my question was -- I don't see

12   anything, quite honestly, unreasonable about that, where

13   you're the employer, where it's a SWAT team, where --

14   where -- where you're paying for this in the first

15   place.   So the reason I ask it is I would like you

16   clearly to explain what's unreasonable about it.

17                MR. DAMMEIER:          The scope of the search was

18   unreasonable.

19                JUSTICE BREYER:            That's the conclusion.     Now,

20   what's your reason?

21                MR. DAMMEIER:          Under -- under -- looking at

22   O'Connor, you have to -- you have to look to make sure

23   that the search is not excessively intrusive.             Here,

24   what they did was they took all the messages and started

25   reading them.   Given the purpose, the limited purpose


                                        33

 1   that was found by the jury for the search, they didn't

 2   need to do that.

 3                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, explain that one to

 4   me.

 5                  MR. DAMMEIER:         They --

 6                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Being naive about this, if

 7   I had a -- like, 20, 30,000 characters in 1,800 messages

 8   and I wanted to know which are personal and which are

 9   work-related, a good way to get at least a good first

10   cut would be to read them.

11                  (Laughter.)

12                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay?       So I start off

13   thinking that seems to be reasonable to me.                   That's what

14   I would do.

15                  MR. DAMMEIER:         Well, that's certainly one --

16                  JUSTICE BREYER:           So all right.       Now you tell

17   me why that isn't reasonable.

18                  MR. DAMMEIER:         That's one of the ways they

19   could have done it.       They could have got -- they could

20   have got consent from the officers first to do it.                    They

21   could have had the officers themselves count the

22   messages.     After all, the officers were the ones that

23   were paying for the overages.

24                  JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.       But the

25   officers might say:       I don't want you to read these

 2   activity of some of my coworkers and their wives and me,

 3   which happened to be the case here.

 4                 MR. DAMMEIER:         Right.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So I guess if you had asked

 6   for consent, the officer would have said no.

 7                 (Laughter.)

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Now, he says, I still want to

 9   know.   I will be repeating it.              All right.     So what -- that

10   didn't sound very practical.             What's the other way?

11                 MR. DAMMEIER:         Well, they could have -- they

12   could have had the officers themselves count the

13   messages.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, the officer is going

15   to say, hey, these are all big -- work-related.                  I'll

16   tell you that.    I only had two.

17                 MR. DAMMEIER:         Well --

18                 (Laughter.)

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay.       What's a third way?

20                 MR. DAMMEIER:         Okay.       They -- the lieutenant

21   could have said, hey, we're going to stop this practice

22   that I started, and from this month forward make sure

23   all you do is business-related.                No more --

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:           That would have been rough

25   on them.    Because you want to let them have a few; you

 1   need pizza when you're out on duty.                     You want to -- there

 2   are --

 3               MR. DAMMEIER:          The --

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:            Look, so far I listened to four

 5   things, and I'm just being naive about it.                    I'll read it

 6   more closely, but I don't see why these four things are

 7   so obviously more reasonable than what they did.

 8               MR. DAMMEIER:          They also -- they could have

 9   had the officers redact the private messages and then

10   given it -- given it to the department.

11               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              But suppose that their

12   application of what -- how much was being spent on

13   business-related, all of your suggestions about having

14   the officer do things does nothing about their application.

15               MR. DAMMEIER:          Well --

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              You're -- you're

17   relying on the very person you're auditing to do the

18   audit for you.   That doesn't seem either practical or

19   business-wise.

20               MR. DAMMEIER:          Well, other than my one

21   sample of -- example of saying, hey, let's -- let's stop

22   the personal use and we're going to have a test month

23   to determine exactly how many messages we need for our

24   business-related purposes.

25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              That goes back to -- I

 1   don't understand that.        You're still relying on the

 2   person you're auditing to say to you I'm only using

 3   it for business.    That -- that's just not logical.

 4                MR. DAMMEIER:          Well, but the -- the sole

 5   purpose of the search was only to find out if officers

 6   were paying for business-related messages that they

 7   didn't need to pay for.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:            But the question, in the

 9   Constitution, the word is "unreasonable."                   Is it a

10   reasonable or unreasonable?             So the question -- what I

11   asked is not maybe you would have gotten a better result

12   if you had hired Bain Associates and Bain would have

13   done a 4-month study at a cost of $50,000.

14                But I could say a person who doesn't want

15   to hire Bain and who doesn't want to rely on the

16   unverified word of the officers who were using these for

17   God knows what is not being unreasonable.                   That's the

18   ultimate issue.    And that's why I'm putting it to you

19   to show me that what they did was unreasonable.

20                MR. DAMMEIER:          I think it comes down from

21   that perspective on the excessiveness of the search.

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 The only reason --

23   the only reason the officer would not be accurate -- I

24   mean, I don't understand why the redaction is such a bad

25   idea.   He just says these are private.                  And that allows


                                        37

 1   -- and then you could look at everything else.                   You can

 2   see if he's going too far because then everything else

 3   would be there.     But in terms of -- the jury found this

 4   was not done to find out what was in the messages, so

 5   they don't need to find out what's in the messages.

 6   That's just a question.          He has to pay for everything he

 7   -- he redacts.

 8                  MR. DAMMEIER:         That -- that's exactly what

 9   we're saying.     I mean, the interest here is -- is for

10   the officer to be upfront as far as what's

11   business-related     to -- if he's paying for things that he

12   shouldn't be paying for, I'm sure he would -- he would be

13   forthright about that.

14                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I mean, it's no

15   different than the police coming in and saying, well,

16   we're going to look at, you know, what's in every drawer

17   and then -- you know, then if it turns out to be

18   personal and private, we won't -- you know, we won't --

19   it just happens that we came upon, I guess, is

20   Justice Kennedy's point.           It's kind of the plain view

21   doctrine, except they get to decide how broad what they

22   can view is.

23                  MR. DAMMEIER:         That's true.         I agree with

24   that.

25                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           Can I ask you this question

 1   about the basic background of a reasonable expectation

 2   of privacy?    This is SWAT team work.                    Supposing it was an

 3   officer answering 911 calls or things like that.                      Isn't

 4   there sort of a background expectation that sooner or

 5   later, somebody might have to look at communications for

 6   this particular kind of law enforcement officer?

 7                 MR. DAMMEIER:         Well, certainly -- certainly

 8   that could happen in any number of --

 9                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           I mean, wouldn't you just

10   assume that that whole universe of conversations by SWAT

11   officers who are on duty 24/7 might well have to be

12   reviewed by some member of the public or some of their

13   superiors?

14                 MR. DAMMEIER:         But that -- that could be a

15   possibility on any -- on anything that they do in their

16   lives, whether it be their personal life or --

17                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Well, but it's over

18   official -- it's over the official communications

19   equipment that they use for purposes of law enforcement.

20                 MR. DAMMEIER:         Correct.             Correct.

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I certainly -- criminal

22   defense attorneys challenging probable cause would want

23   to look at these.    They would want to see if there is

24   exonerating evidence, under the rule that all

25   exonerating evidence has to be submitted.                      It would seem

 1   to me that it's quite likely, as Justice Stevens'

 2   question indicates, that there is going to -- that these

 3   are going to be discoverable.

 4                 MR. DAMMEIER:         Well, it's just like my mail

 5   that I might send out to somebody.                  It might be

 6   discoverable in litigation, but that doesn't --

 7                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But you're not -- you're

 8   not a police officer who is making arrests.                      I mean,

 9   this -- this is part and parcel of determining probable

10   cause and mitigating evidence.

11                 MR. DAMMEIER:         No, it -- obviously, there

12   are different reasons that could come into play that

13   would legally produce these messages, certainly.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Mr. Dammeier, you could say

15   the same thing about private phones.                      There are

16   obviously circumstances in which whether you were making

17   a call between certain times becomes relevant to

18   litigation.    So you could say that destroys the

19   expectation of privacy?         I'm not sure.               I hope we don't

20   say that.

21                 MR. DAMMEIER:         No.      No.         It's like -- this

22   -- in O'Connor, all nine Justices in O'Connor found an

23   expectation of privacy in Dr. Ortega's desk, because

24   even though it was a state-owned desk, you still have an

25   expectation of privacy.

 1                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Yes, but there's no

 2   normal reason for going through somebody's desk; whereas,

 3   there would be a very ordinary -- ordinary reason for

 4   reviewing calls made to the SWAT -- members of the SWAT

 5   team, it seems to me.

 6                MR. DAMMEIER:           Well, there are -- as talked

 7   about in O'Connor, there are certainly a lot of valid

 8   reasons to go through a public employee's desk, if you're

 9   looking for a file or if you're looking for --

10                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Yes.

11                MR. DAMMEIER:           Or for -- or for an

12   investigation.     But still, there was that expectation of

13   privacy.   You're talking about employees that -- in

14   today's society, I think work and private life get

15   melded together.     Here, we're talking about SWAT people

16   24/7 --

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, to say that there's

18   an expectation of privacy in the desk doesn't say that

19   every intrusion into that expectation of privacy is an

20   unreasonable one.     There could be that expectation of

21   privacy and, still, for some reason -- let's assume there

22   has been a theft in the building, and it's known that

23   what was taken has not gotten out of the building.              It's

24   conceivable that that would be a valid reason to intrude

25   upon the expectation of privacy, right?

 1               MR. DAMMEIER:          Correct.             I don't think we're

 2   taking away the government's ability to do searches

 3   under proper circumstances.

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, why isn't this a

 5   proper circumstance?

 6               MR. DAMMEIER:          The initial circumstance

 7   might be proper, but how they effectuated it was not.

 8   It was excessively intrusive.             They did not -- the

 9   purpose was to find out if they were paying for enough

10   work-related messages.       They did not need to look at

11   these, what they knew were going to be private messages.

12   They knew -- the lieutenant had this arrangement that they

13   could use this for personal purposes.                    They knew what

14   they were going to be looking at.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:            They didn't know which ones

16   were private messages, did they?

17                MR. DAMMEIER:         Not until they read them.

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Not until they read them.

19                MR. DAMMEIER:         But there certainly -- they

20   certainly knew what might be coming because of the

21   arrangement that Lieutenant Duke had in place.

22                Here -- here I think that's --

23                JUSTICE ALITO:          What was the arrangement

24   that Lieutenant Duke had in place?                 I thought all he

25   said was:   I don't have an intent to read these,

 1   because it's too much trouble, so if you go over and you

 2   pay me the extra, I'm not going to read them.

 3               MR. DAMMEIER:          His --

 4               JUSTICE ALITO:           Did he ever say that -- that

 5   I'm not -- that you have a privacy right in these

 6   things?

 7               MR. DAMMEIER:          No, but according -- according

 8   to Sergeant Quon's testimony, he told him:                 As long as you

 9   pay the overages, we're not going to read them.                    And that --

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Did he say "we"?         He -- even

11   Quon didn't say that.      Duke said he wouldn't do it.               But

12   earlier, the -- at the meeting, the statement was made

13   that these are open to audit.             Didn't say only by

14   Lieutenant Duke.

15               MR. DAMMEIER:          True.       True.    I agree.    But

16   it was Lieutenant Duke, the one that was making the

17   announcement that now these pagers are going to fall

18   under the computer policy, the same lieutenant who then

19   gave the assurance that as long as you pay the overages,

20   we're not -- we're not going to look at them.

21               I mean, when you're talking about the

22   operational reality of O'Connor, that was the

23   operational reality.      The SWAT members knew:             As long as

24   I pay the overages, my messages aren't going to be

25   reviewed.

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What happens, just

 2   out of curiosity, if you're -- he is on the pager and

 3   sending a message and they're trying to reach him for,

 4   you know, a SWAT team crisis?             Does he -- does the one

 5   kind of trump the other, or do they get a busy signal?

 6                MR. DAMMEIER:         I don't think that's in the

 7   record.   However, my understanding is that you would get

 8   it in between messages.        So messages are going out and

 9   coming in at the same time, pretty much.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And would you know

11   where the message was coming from?

12                MR. DAMMEIER:         I believe so.         It identifies

13   where it's coming from.        It identifies the number of

14   where it's coming from.        If you know the number, you

15   know where it's coming from.

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And he's talking with

17   a girlfriend, and he has a voice mail saying that your

18   call is very important to us; we'll get back to you?

19                (Laughter.)

20                MR. DAMMEIER:         Well, I think with the text

21   messages -- and that's what we are talking about the

22   transcripts of, were the text messages that were data

23   transferred from device to device, and here, you know,

24   we come back to -- I did want to touch a little bit on

25   the Stored Communications Act having play on somebody's

 1   expectation of privacy -- you know, it's -- lawfully,

 2   those messages were protected.               And I think, looking at

 3   people's expectation of privacy, that should be a

 4   component.   It certainly may be not the end-all to the

 5   question, but it should be a factor in determining

 6   whether or not there's going to be an expectation of

 7   privacy.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Did -- did he know about

 9   that statute?    I didn't know about it.

10                MR. DAMMEIER:          That's not in -- that's not

11   in the record.    That is not in the record.                But --

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Can we assume he didn't?

13                MR. DAMMEIER:          Right.        Well, we can assume

14   that, but we also --

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:            And what difference would that

16   make?

17                MR. DAMMEIER:          I still don't think anything,

18   given the operational realities --

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't see how it can affect

20   his expectation of privacy, if he didn't even know about it.

21                MR. DAMMEIER:          Well, it's -- it's just like

22   the California Public Records Act.                  We should also

23   assume he didn't know about that as well, because the --

24   Petitioners make an argument that because there is this

25   California Public Records Act, that that may diminish

 1   one's expectation of privacy.             Certainly, if we're

 2   going to have that, then we should also be having the

 3   Stored Communications Act that might enhance the --

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Ignorance of the law is no

 5   excuse, is what you're saying?

 6                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Do you have any theory,

 7   or do you make any argument that Florio, Trujillo, and

 8   Quon's wife can succeed in their Fourth Amendment

 9   claims, if Quon can't?

10                MR. DAMMEIER:         I do.       We, in our brief, try

11   to analogize that to the mail.              I think when they sent

12   messages to -- to Sergeant Quon, that was a letter that

13   I sent.   And here, the department didn't go get that

14   letter from Sergeant Quon after -- after delivery,

15   meaning go get it from his pager.                They went to the

16   equivalent of the Post Office, which was Arch Wireless,

17   and got a copy off of their server.                     So I -- I think --

18   and, again, analogizing to the mail, they have an

19   expectation of privacy while that message is in the

20   course of delivery.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well --

22                JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, suppose it was

23   perfectly clear that -- I mean, suppose that the department

24   gave Mr. Quon a policy -- a statement that says:                     Sign

25   this, you acknowledge that your pager is to be used only

 1   for work and that you have no privacy interest in it

 2   whatsoever; we're going to monitor this every day.

 3   And then these other individuals sent him messages.

 4   You would still say they have an expectation

 5   of privacy in those messages?

 6               MR. DAMMEIER:          Until the point that it's on

 7   Quon's pager.   I think under that scenario, that they

 8   could have obtained the messages from Quon, but they

 9   went over to Arch, the equivalent of the Post Office,

10   and got them from them.

11               It's like if I -- I make a copy of a letter

12   before I send it to somebody.             You know, down the road,

13   I might not know what happens and I might lose my

14   expectation of privacy down the road, but that copy I

15   kept, I think there is still an expectation.

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, what -- when you send

17   a text message to somebody else, aren't you quite aware

18   that that text message will remain confidential only to

19   the extent that either the recipient keeps it

20   confidential -- and he can disclose it -- or somebody

21   else who has power over the recipient or over the

22   recipient's phone chooses to look at it?                Don't -- isn't

23   that understood when you send somebody a text message?

24               MR. DAMMEIER:          I -- I agree with that, and --

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, so she should have


                                       47

 1   understood that, you know, whoever could get ahold of

 2   his phone lawfully can read the message.                  In other

 3   words, I don't see that she's in a -- in a different

 4   position from Quon himself.

 5               MR. DAMMEIER:          I think it's just a slightly

 6   different one.   I mean, first of all, they didn't

 7   lawfully get it; there was a violation of the Stored

 8   Communications Act to get it.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, that's a different

10   issue.

11               MR. DAMMEIER:          But here, again, had they

12   gotten consent from -- from Quon and got it from him

13   directly, that's a -- that's a different story.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, again, it depends

15   upon their reasonable expectation.                 Do any of these

16   other people know about Arch Wireless?                  Don't they just

17   assume that once they send something to Quon, it's going

18   to Quon?

19               MR. DAMMEIER:          That's -- that is true.           I

20   mean, they expect --

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, then they

22   can't have a reasonable expectation of privacy based on

23   the fact that their communication is routed through a

24   communications company.

25               MR. DAMMEIER:          Well, they -- they expect

 1   that some company, I'm sure, is going to have to be

 2   processing the delivery of this message.                      And --

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, I didn't -- I

 4   wouldn't think that.        I thought, you know, you push a

 5   button; it goes right to the other thing.

 6                (Laughter.)

 7                MR. DAMMEIER:           Well --

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:             You mean it doesn't go

 9   right to the other thing?

10                (Laughter.)

11                MR. DAMMEIER:           It's -- I mean, it's like

12   with e-mails.   When we send an e-mail, that goes through

13   some e-mail provider, whether it be AOL or Yahoo.                      It's

14   going through some service provider.                      Just like when

15   we send a letter or package, it's going through -- some

16   provider is going to move that for us, until it gets to

17   the end recipient.      And like the mail, that message enjoys

18   an expectation of privacy while it's with the Post

19   Office --

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Can you print these things

21   out?   Could Quon print these -- these spicy

22   conversations out and circulate them among his buddies?

23                MR. DAMMEIER:           Well, he could have

24   ultimately, sure.

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well --

 1                MR. DAMMEIER:         And -- and like, when I get a

 2   piece of mail from somebody, I could do that as well,

 3   but that doesn't mean that the government gets to go to

 4   the Post Office and get my mail before I get it.                 I

 5   think -- I think that, you know, certainly adds a little

 6   bit to the correspondence that dealt with --

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But just -- just to

 8   be clear:   You think if these messages went straight to

 9   Quon that there'd be no problem from the point of

10   view of the senders?      I mean, no problem in searching --

11   getting them from Quon?

12                MR. DAMMEIER:         I think it's certainly a

13   harder argument for me to make --

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Yes.

15                MR. DAMMEIER:         -- that they have an

16   expectation after -- after Quon has it.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So we have to assume

18   for your argument to succeed that they know that this goes

19   somewhere else and then it's processed and then it goes

20   to Quon.

21                MR. DAMMEIER:         Yes, but I think in today's

22   -- I think in today's society that's -- that's a

23   reasonable assumption to make.              One --

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes, I didn't know.

25                MR. DAMMEIER:         I think it might have been


                                       50

 1   Florio testified that she actually called her carrier to

 2   find out, you know, if -- if the messages that she would

 3   transmit would be maintained and that was -- that they

 4   didn't maintain a copy.         So there was some understanding

 5   of how the process worked.

 6               JUSTICE ALITO:            Can an officer who has one

 7   of these pagers delete messages from the pager --

 8               MR. DAMMEIER:           Yes.

 9               JUSTICE ALITO:            -- so that they can't be

10   recovered by the department if the pager is turned into

11   the department?

12               MR. DAMMEIER:           Sure.       Yes.

13               JUSTICE ALITO:            They can delete them?

14               MR. DAMMEIER:           They can delete them.     Just

15   like if they received a letter, they could be put in the

16   shredder.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Suppose I sent somebody a

18   letter and -- and I have privacy in that letter, and

19   let's assume it's intercepted at the Post Office, but I

20   have also published the letter in a letter to the editor

21   of the newspaper.    I have written the following letter

22   to Sergeant Quon.    Do I still have a right -- a right of

23   privacy in that letter?

24               MR. DAMMEIER:           Well, I think then certainly

25   your expectation may be diminished.

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, but that's the

 2   situation here.     The -- the central location that stores

 3   the message is one thing, but she's made -- made the

 4   message public effectively by sending it to Quon.                       Once

 5   it gets to Quon, she knows that Quon can make it public

 6   or that the employer can -- can find out about it.

 7               MR. DAMMEIER:            But that would create a

 8   free-for-all in service providers.                   If -- if while this

 9   message, after it's sent and it's in transit --

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Right.

11               MR. DAMMEIER:            It's a free-for-all.           The

12   government could just go in and --

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Exactly.         That -- and

14   that's why you have the statute, because the Fourth

15   Amendment wouldn't solve the problem, because you are

16   effectively making it public by sending it to somebody

17   whom you don't know is immune from disclosure.                     So, in

18   order to stop the intermediary from making it public,

19   you needed the statute.          Otherwise you wouldn't need it;

20   the Fourth Amendment would solve the problem, right?

21               MR. DAMMEIER:            Well, certainly, obviously

22   the statute could come into play in addition to the

23   Fourth Amendment.     But here, you know, I come back to

24   the mail analogy.     Just because at the end of the line

25   somebody might disseminate my letter doesn't lose an

 1   expectation in the copy that I make that I may keep or

 2   that in the course of delivery the Post Office might

 3   keep.   I still enjoy an expectation -- and the Fourth

 4   Amendment certainly protects that copy, that either I

 5   kept or the Post Office is keeping in the course of

 6   delivery.

 7               Certainly, at the end of the line, that letter

 8   could be published to the world, but that's not the same

 9   thing as the government coming in and getting a copy of

10   it while it was being delivered.

11               JUSTICE ALITO:           Are you sure that -- are you

12   sure about your answer to the question of deletion?

13   It's not like deleting something from a computer which

14   doesn't really delete it from the computer?

15               MR. DAMMEIER:          Honestly, I'm not -- that's

16   not in the record, and the -- how that pager works as

17   far as deleting, I couldn't be certain that it would be

18   deleted forever.   I would certainly not.

19               One -- one of the points to -- to raise,

20   too, was that most of these texts took place off duty

21   when dealing with Sergeant Quon.               So, again, back to

22   looking at the actual practice that O'Connor has us look

23   at, you know, here again --

24               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              I thought the factual

25   record was the opposite, that in fact most of the calls


                                       53

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   were -- not most, but a huge number of calls were

 2   happening on duty.

 3               MR. DAMMEIER:            There were -- there were a

 4   large number on-duty.        I think it was broken down to

 5   where the average was 27 in a work shift and the most on

 6   one day was 80.     But also they talked about -- they took

 7   about 15 seconds.     So you're talking about an average

 8   of about 7 minutes during -- during a work day.

 9               But the testimony of Sergeant Quon was that

10   most of these were actually off-duty.                     And, you know, I

11   certainly -- I think that should come into play, given

12   the department -- they gave them pagers.                     And it wasn't

13   a one-way use; it wasn't, hey, this is, you know, for the

14   benefit of the employee.           The department received a benefit.

15   I mean, they wanted to be able to have these SWAT guys

16   show up quickly, respond quickly, and there was a mix on

17   -- on the reasons for these pagers.

18               The exchange was, we're going to let you

19   use these for personal purposes, and given that reality,

20   you should be able to have some -- some expectation of

21   privacy in that use.        It's like if I pick up a phone and

22   I'm a public employee and I call my wife, I should be

23   able to have some expectation of privacy in a

24   conversation, especially given, you know -- you talk

25   about guys that are on 24/7.              Do they have no private

 1   life, now?   Do they not have --

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I thought the policy was

 3   limited personal use.

 4                MR. DAMMEIER:         The computer policy was

 5   limited personal use.      Again, depending on how that

 6   comes into play with what Lieutenant Duke --

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But the -- the notice was

 8   we're going to treat these just like e-mails, and

 9   e-mails were limited personal use.

10                MR. DAMMEIER:         Correct.             With -- with the

11   additional modification by -- by Duke, that you could

12   also use them for personal purposes, from day one when

13   the pagers were issued.

18             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. RICHARDS

19                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

20                MR. RICHLAND:         Thank you.             I would first

21   like to just make it clear that what it is being claimed

22   was the guarantee of privacy by Lieutenant Duke is

23   really absolutely not that at all.                 And I would refer

24   the Court to Joint Appendix page 40, which does summarize

25   that, and it says -- here is what precisely what

 1   Lieutenant Duke said:        "Because of the overage

 2   Lieutenant Duke went to Sergeant Quon and told him the

 3   city-issued two-way pagers were considered e-mail and

 4   could be audited."      So that's what he said first.

 5               Then he said -- he told Sergeant Quon it was

 6   not his -- his intent to audit employees' text messages

 7   to see if the overages were due to work-related

 8   transmissions.

 9               He advised Sergeant Quon he, Sergeant Quon,

10   could reimburse the city for the overages so he, Duke,

11   would not have to audit the transmission and see how

12   many messages were non-work-related.                      Lieutenant Duke

13   told Sergeant Quon he is doing this because if anybody

14   wished to challenge their overage, he could audit the

15   text transmissions to verify how many were

16   non-work-related, and then, finally, Lieutenant Duke

17   added, the text messages were considered public records

18   and could be audited at any time.

19               That is what is being characterized as a

20   guarantee of privacy.        It's hard to see how that in any

21   way undercuts the official written policy.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Mr. Richland, do you take

23   any position on whether Jerilyn Quon, April Florio, and

24   Steve Trujillo stand in the same position as Sergeant

25   Quon insofar as this lawsuit is concerned?

 1                MR. RICHLAND:           We do, with respect -- in at

 2   least one respect, and that is:                 If Sergeant Quon loses,

 3   then we think the other plaintiffs must also lose.

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why?

 5                MR. RICHLAND:           Yes.       The reason for that is

 6   that this Court has held on many occasions that, once

 7   one has sent a communication or an object to another

 8   person, they lose their expectation of privacy in --

 9                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               That means the

10   government can set up an interception mechanism on

11   telephone transmissions, on e-mail, computer

12   transmissions --

13                MR. RICHLAND:           It -- it does not mean that,

14   Justice Sotomayor.

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               If it doesn't mean that,

16   answer his argument that, yes, you could take anything

17   from Quon, but the storage -- you went to the storage

18   facility, which is a Post Office.

19                MR. RICHLAND:           And he says it's a Post

20   Office, but the truth is that all of these plaintiffs

21   admitted that they knew that this was a

22   department-issued pager, and this wasn't a Post Office.

23   Arch Wireless was the department's agent.

24                These text messages were being sent to

25   someplace.   Both the written policy and the oral policy

 1   indicated that they were being stored ---

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              So you have to get

 3   into who owned --

 4                MR. RICHLAND:          Excuse me.

 5                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Whether this was a -- we

 6   have to get into the Storage Act and figure out whether

 7   this was an RCN or ACS?

 8                MR. RICHLAND:          Well, I think that -- I

 9   don't know that it's necessary to do that, because I

10   think that all that must be determined is -- and I don't

11   think whether it's an ECS or RCS is -- you would require

12   that to determine who owned it, because it was clear

13   that Arch acted solely as the city's agent.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Whoa, whoa.      I'm not sure

15   you're doing the city a favor by making Arch the city's

16   agent --

17                MR. RICHLAND:          I understand --

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- as opposed to an

19   independent contractor who is doing business with the

20   city.

21                MR. RICHLAND:          The point is --

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:            You sure you want to live

23   with that?

24                MR. RICHLAND:          I don't mean "agent" in -- in

25   the most literal sense, Justice Scalia.

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Oh, okay.

 2               MR. RICHLAND:         What I mean is that they

 3   were -- in effect, when there was a delivery to Arch

 4   Wireless, it was a delivery to the city.                And all of

 5   these individuals knew that this was city equipment, and,

 6   therefore, this was being delivered to the city.

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel. 


 8               The case is submitted.
