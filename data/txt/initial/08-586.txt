 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 We will hear

 4   argument first this morning in Case 08-586, Jones v.

 5   Harris Associates.

 6              Mr. Frederick.

 7             ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

 8                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9              MR. FREDERICK:          Thank you,

10   Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

11              In 1970, Congress amended the Investment

12   Company Act to provide a cause of action when an

13   investment adviser breaches its fiduciary duty with

14   respect to compensation.

15              The Seventh Circuit upheld summary judgment

16   for Respondent under a legal standard for fiduciary duty

17   that Respondent here no longer defends.

18              For three reasons, the Seventh Circuit's

19   judgment should be reversed.           First, under the Court's

20   longstanding precedent, in this context a fiduciary duty

21   requires a fair fee, achieved through full disclosure

22   and good-faith negotiation.

23              Second, the best gauge of a fair fee is what

24   the investment adviser charges at arm's-length in other

25   transactions for similar services.


                                      3

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               And, third, applying that standard here,

 2   Harris charged twice as much in percentage terms for

 3   providing virtually identical advisory services in

 4   arm's-length transactions with institutional investors.

 5               With respect to the first point, the

 6   standard for fiduciary duty has been clear from this

 7   Court's cases, at least since Pepper v. Litton, in which

 8   the Court said that a fair result in the

 9   circumstances -- a fair fee -- was an important

10   component of a fiduciary duty.

11               Congress was aware of that standard when it

12   enacted the 1970 amendments to the Investment Company

13   Act.   The SEC brought the case to the Congress'

14   attention, and that standard, we submit, is one that

15   Congress intended to incorporate.

16               Applying that standard, where Pepper said

17   that the best gauge of a fair fee is what the person --

18   the fiduciary charges in arm's-length transactions,

19   applied here, the best way to understand how that

20   fiduciary duty is being breached in this context is what

21   Harris is charging for same or similar services at

22   arm's-length to institutional investors.

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Is Harris a fiduciary in

24   the same sense as a corporate officer and a corporate

25   director?   Or does his fiduciary duty differ?           Is it


                                       4

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   higher or lower, same with a guardian, same with a

 2   trustee?

 3              I mean, the word "fiduciary" -- does

 4   fiduciary imply different standards, depending on what

 5   kind of fiduciary you are?

 6              MR. FREDERICK:          The basic concept,

 7   Justice Kennedy, is the same.           There are two components,

 8   where there must be full disclosure of information and a

 9   fair result, and that fair result translates in

10   different contexts in different ways.                 Here, because of

11   the statutory references to fiduciary duty with respect

12   to compensation, one focuses on the fairness of the fee

13   charged.

14              But, as Professor Dumont points out in her

15   amicus brief, the idea of a fiduciary duty is one that

16   is well known in various circumstances of the law, and

17   as applied here the concept goes to the fairness of the

18   fee.

19              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, would the test for

20   compensation in this case be the same as any director or

21   any officer of a corporation?

22              MR. FREDERICK:          The difference here, Justice

23   Kennedy, is that in those circumstances the indicia of

24   an arm's-length transaction may be achieved.                 The

25   directors can fire the head of a company.                 They can call

 1   for changes.

 2              Here, the investment adviser has appointed

 3   the members of the board.        As this Court said in the

 4   Daily Income Fund case, the earmarks of an -- of an

 5   arm's-length transaction are absent precisely because --

 6              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I just want to know, is

 7   the fiduciary duties the same?            Is the fiduciary

 8   standard the same, without getting into how its applied?

 9              Is the fiduciary standard the same for

10   Jones, for a guardian, for a trustee, for a corporate

11   officer or a corporate director, always the same?

12              MR. FREDERICK:          Yes.       The concept is fair

13   result through full information and good-faith

14   negotiations.

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:            And for lawyers?

16              MR. FREDERICK:          For lawyers --

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Lawyers have a fiduciary

18   obligation to their clients; right?

19              MR. FREDERICK:          That is true.

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:            So courts should review

21   lawyers' fees for -- on the basis of whether it's a fair

22   result.

23              MR. FREDERICK:          That is how courts do it

24   every day in this country, Justice Scalia, when they are

25   asked to make fee applications for reasonableness.

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, but this is

 2   different.   I mean, this is part of an expense of a

 3   fund.   They don't get fees, but -- but they get -- they

 4   have to pay for the lawyers, just like they have to pay

 5   for management advice.

 6                So why wouldn't you review the lawyers' fees

 7   to make sure they are fair?

 8                MR. FREDERICK:         The lawyers' fees in which

 9   context, Mr. Chief Justice?            I'm not sure I understand

10   the question.

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel for the

12   fund.

13                MR. FREDERICK:         Counsel for the fund is --

14   that is actually not at issue here, but the issue of

15   what constitutes reasonable expenses may arise in

16   various circumstances.

17                The statute prohibits fees that are

18   unreasonable in terms of their unfairness to the fund.

19   The concept here is that the board cannot fire the

20   investment adviser.      So in evaluating the fairness of

21   the fee the adviser is charging the fund, the normal

22   indicia of an arm's-length transaction is absent, and

23   that is the key principle here because this adviser is

24   using the same manager to provide the same research

25   analytics from the same research group, from the same


                                       7

 1   meetings, buying the same stocks, and simply allocating

 2   them to different accounts and charging those to whom it

 3   owes a fiduciary duty twice what it is getting at

 4   arm's-length.

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But there was in this

 6   record, was there not, a submission by the adviser

 7   comparing what mutual funds this fund was charged, what

 8   institutional funds were charged, but explaining the

 9   differential in terms of the services provided, that

10   more services were provided to the fund and less

11   services were provided to the institutional investors.

12               MR. FREDERICK:          And, Justice Ginsburg, that

13   is where there is a disputed issue of fact for which

14   summary judgment is not appropriate, because the

15   plaintiffs submitted evidence that in fact the services

16   provided to the institutional investors were greater,

17   even though they were being charged a lower amount of

18   money.

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Who would have the

20   burden?   You said that is an issue that has not been

21   decided, it's a disputed issue of fact, appropriate for

22   remand.   Who -- would you have the burden if they came

23   forward and said, look, this is what our situation is.

24   These are the services.       Would you have the burden to

25   show that in fact they were comparable and the


                                       8

 1   differences did not warrant the differences in the fee?

 2                 MR. FREDERICK:         Yes.

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           You would have the

 4   burden?

 5                 MR. FREDERICK:         We have the burden.

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           That's different from

 7   normal trust law, isn't it?

 8                 MR. FREDERICK:         It is.

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Normally where you are a

10   fiduciary, it's up to you to prove that it was

11   reasonable.

12                 MR. FREDERICK:         That's true.

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           So Congress evidently did

14   not mean ordinary trust law to apply in this context.

15                 MR. FREDERICK:         We disagree with that last

16   part, Justice Scalia.       We agree that Congress did make

17   modifications to the way a cause of action ordinarily

18   would have been brought at common law for breach of

19   fiduciary duty in several respects, including imposing

20   the burden of proof on the investor.                    Where we disagree

21   is that when they used the phrase "fiduciary duty" they

22   intended to mean something less than what fiduciary duty

23   had meant at common law.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               What if -- if you

25   are having courts decide -- review what is fair, a fair


                                        9

 1   fee, what if the adviser had given such good advice that

 2   the fund beat the industry average for his category of

 3   fund by 5 percent over the last 5 years.                 Does he get

 4   double the normal compensation of the average fees?

 5   Does he get triple?      50 percent more?              How is the court

 6   supposed to decide that?

 7              MR. FREDERICK:           Well, there is an issue of

 8   fact as to how relevant performance is.                 They didn't

 9   give the money back when their performance lagged behind

10   the market, Mr. Chief Justice, in this case.                 So the

11   question of whether or not a performance metric is

12   relevant is certainly a factor that will be entitled to

13   less --

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, surely you

15   think it is.   When you say they don't give the money

16   back, you are not suggesting that the amount of the fees

17   should be the same regardless of whether they outperform

18   by 10 percent or not?

19              MR. FREDERICK:           My point, Mr. Chief Justice,

20   is that when they charge the same amount, buying the

21   same stocks, to institutional investors and achieve the

22   same performance, there is no reason why the mutual fund

23   should be charged twice as much.

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, but there is

25   different parameters, right, in the sense that you're


                                      10

 1   trying -- the company is trying to attract investors to

 2   the mutual fund.    If you are advising a pension fund, it

 3   is not the case that they are trying to attract

 4   pensioners who have other choices.

 5              MR. FREDERICK:            But the investor doesn't

 6   gain because of the marketing skill of the adviser.

 7   Simply having a larger asset pool which increases the

 8   fee that the adviser can charge doesn't inure to the

 9   individual benefit of the investor.                     And the point of

10   this statute was to provide protection against investors

11   so that when the adviser charged excessive fees that

12   excess would be returned to the fund for the pro

13   rata benefit --

14              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              You said that Congress

15   used "fiduciary" in a special sense.                    Then -- then, I

16   have to conclude that your earlier answer is confusing

17   for me, because I thought you were going to tell us that

18   this investment adviser has the same fiduciary standard

19   that officers and directors of corporations have.                    Then

20   you say that Congress used it in this special sense.                       So

21   that doesn't quite square.

22              MR. FREDERICK:            Well, Justice Kennedy, let

23   me just add the extra words of the statute, because what

24   Congress said was a fiduciary duty "with respect to

25   compensation."    And so when I say special sense, I mean


                                       11
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that Congress used additional words to elaborate on the

 2   circumstance in which the fiduciary duty would be

 3   examined.

 4                 Here what is happening is that an

 5   arm's-length transaction for the same services -- the

 6   same manager is going out and touting his services to

 7   the institutional investor, but simply charging them

 8   half as much money for providing the same portfolio of

 9   management.

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Do technological

11   changes make a difference in terms of disclosures

12   required?   These days all you have to do is push a

13   button and you find out exactly what the management fees

14   are.   I mean, you just look it up on Morningstar and

15   it's right there and you can make -- as an investor you

16   can make whatever determination you'd like, including to

17   take your money out.

18                 MR. FREDERICK:         The fact that an investor

19   may know going in what the fee is does not address the

20   problem Congress was intending to address, which is that

21   as larger and larger sums of assets were accreted to the

22   mutual fund, the investor was not obtaining the benefits

23   of economies of scale.        And that's the central point --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So we could look

25   at -- you know, as the fund grows bigger and he doesn't


                                       12

 1   get those benefits he can go look at another fund.                It

 2   takes 30 seconds.

 3              MR. FREDERICK:             And that again doesn't

 4   address the problem Congress was trying to get at, which

 5   is to protect the company, not the individual investor.

 6   The individual investor might lessen the damages that

 7   that investor suffers, but the fund, the people

 8   remaining, continue to pay excessive fees.

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:              No, but he protects the

10   company ultimately, because when investors leave the

11   company that is charging excessive fees to go to other

12   companies, the company that they are leaving sees that

13   something's wrong and has to lower its compensation to

14   its adviser.   Why doesn't that affect the company at

15   issue?

16              MR. FREDERICK:             A large number of assets

17   under management in mutual funds, something like 26 to

18   35 percent according to materials that are in the

19   record, are from 401(k) plans, where the investor is

20   essentially locked into the fund that his or her company

21   chooses to make that investment.                 And even as to

22   investors who are not locked in, there are significant

23   tax consequences where over time an investor might be in

24   the Oakmark Fund and have to suffer large tax

25   consequences in order to get the benefit of the

 1   statute --

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Companies --

 3   companies change who they invest with under the 401(k)'s

 4   all the time.   The employees are not happy with the

 5   return they are getting because the company has limited

 6   their choices, they change.           It happens all the time.

 7                MR. FREDERICK:         And Mr. Chief Justice, as

 8   the Court recognized in the Daily Income Fund case, this

 9   is a unique cause of action in which Congress was

10   intending to protect the entire corpus of the investors

11   in the fund, because --

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               You told me just a

13   little while ago, or told somebody, Congress wasn't

14   interested in protecting investors; they were interested

15   in protecting the companies.

16                MR. FREDERICK:         The company is comprised of

17   the investors, Mr. Chief Justice.                What the right of

18   action does not do is to provide individual damages to

19   the investor who brings the suit.                The recovery inures

20   to the entire benefit of all the investors.

21                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Counsel, can I unpackage

22   your argument a little bit.           Because using the word

23   "fair fee" in my mind is meaningless, because it has to

24   be fair in relationship to something.                  And so what is

25   your definition of what that something is that it's fair


                                      14

 1   to, and -- or unfair against?           And start from there,

 2   because I understood the Seventh Circuit to be saying:

 3   Look, a fair fee is paying market value.                If one takes a

 4   sort of reading -- whatever negotiation goes on between

 5   the two, as long as there has been full disclosure as

 6   required, that's the market.           So that's fair.       You're

 7   saying it's something else.          What's that something else?

 8              MR. FREDERICK:          Well, what the Court said in

 9   pepper is that fair is what is reflective of what an

10   arm's-length agreement would produce.

11              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             All right.      So you start

12   there.

13              MR. FREDERICK:          Yes.

14              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             All right.      So let's

15   stop confusing this -- the articulation of the standard,

16   which is -- that's fair.       What would an arm's-length

17   transaction produce?    And let's go to what seems to be

18   part of your argument and sort of what everyone's

19   skirting around, which is what's the proof that a

20   particular transaction is not arm's-length?

21              The Seventh Circuit appeared to be saying,

22   it's arm's-length when the parties have done all of the

23   disclosure that is required, because then the buyer can

24   decide whether they want to pay that fee or not, and

25   once they choose to it's a fair price.                It's an arm's-


                                     15

 1   length transaction.       You are saying not, and that's

 2   what -- that's where I am trying to get to the nub of

 3   why not?   Why is --

 4                 MR. FREDERICK:         Because the directors can't

 5   fire and walk away from the advisor.                    In any arm's-

 6   length transaction, if I sell you a car and you don't

 7   like the price can you walk away.

 8                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            That's -- now, that's

 9   begging the question, because Congress hasn't said a

10   reasonable fee.    It did say fiduciary duty, but it

11   didn't -- there is a subtle but very important

12   difference between reasonable and -- a reasonable fee

13   and a fiduciary duty with respect to fees.

14                 MR. FREDERICK:         True.        There are two

15   components:    Was there full information and good faith

16   negotiating; and was the result fair.                   In Pepper, the

17   Court said if the result is not fair there can be a

18   breach of fiduciary duty.

19                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            I'm still begging the

20   question, fair against what.

21                 MR. FREDERICK:         Fair against what the

22   adviser actually charged for same or similar services to

23   an outsider who had the right to walk away.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Mr. Frederick, I don't

25   understand your statement that they can't fire the

 1   investment adviser.      Maybe they can't fire him, but they

 2   can insist that he accept a lower fee, right?             Surely

 3   they can do that, can't they?

 4                MR. FREDERICK:           They --

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Can they insist that he

 6   accept a lower fee?      Can they do that.

 7                MR. FREDERICK:           In practical terms, no.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why?

 9                MR. FREDERICK:           Because the adviser picks

10   the board of directors.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Oh, no, that's something

12   different.   Let's assume you have a disinterested board

13   of directors, which is what the statute requires.             You

14   tell me even though they are disinterested, they can't

15   fire the adviser.     It seems to me, while they can't fire

16   him, they can say:     We are going to cut your fee in

17   half.   Whereupon they don't have to fire him.            He will

18   pack up and leave, and they will get a new adviser.

19   Doesn't that work?

20                MR. FREDERICK:           There is actually no

21   evidence in any record I am aware of where that has

22   actually happened.     The directors have no leverage.             And

23   that's the problem the Court -- this Court recognized in

24   the Daily Income Fund case.

25                If I could reserve the balance of my time,

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

 4              ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON

 5               ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 6                       AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 7                SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

 8              MR. GANNON:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10              The fiduciary duty imposed by section 36(b)

11   prohibits an investment adviser's fee from being outside

12   the range that arm's-length bargaining would produce.

13   The courts below erred by failing to consider evidence

14   about what the investment adviser in this case charges

15   its unaffiliated clients when it provides services that

16   Petitioners claim are, in fact, comparable to the

17   services at issue here.

18              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Do you think Congress used

19   the term "fiduciary" in a very special sense here?                 I

20   will just tell you the problem I'm having with the case.

21   If I look at a standard that the fees must be reasonable

22   and I compare that with what a fiduciary would do, I

23   thought a fiduciary has the highest possible duty.                 But

24   apparently the submission is the fiduciary has a lower

25   duty, a lesser duty than to charge a reasonable fee.                   I


                                        18
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   just find that quite a puzzling use of the word

 2   "fiduciary."

 3              Now, if Congress uses it as a term of art or

 4   in some special sense, fine.

 5              MR. GANNON:       Well, we do think that --

 6              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But it seems to me an odd

 7   use of the term "fiduciary."           I don't know why Congress

 8   didn't use some other word.

 9              MR. GANNON:       Well, we do think that the term

10   "fiduciary duty" is here used to counterbalance the lack

11   of arm's-length bargaining that exists between the board

12   of directors and the investment adviser, and we do think

13   that it drew upon the established term of art in

14   Pepper v. Litton, the case that counsel for Petitioners

15   was already referring to.        That's a case that actually

16   involved corporate directors and there the same test,

17   the same ultimate standard, was stated, which is whether

18   the bargain carries the earmarks of an arm's length

19   bargain and whether it's inherently fair.

20              And so we do think that in the development

21   of the legislation in 1969, the memorandum that the SEC

22   submitted to Congress in 1969 explained that the shift

23   from reasonableness to fiduciary duty largely achieved

24   some procedural objectives of shifting the focus from

25   the board of directors to the investment adviser, and


                                     19
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the text of the statute specifically makes it a

 2   fiduciary duty with respect to receipt of compensation.

 3                 We think one salutary affect of that was to

 4   -- to make it clear that the Court's burden here, the

 5   Court's duty here, wasn't just to establish what the

 6   single most reasonable fee would be, but harking back to

 7   the Pepper v. Litton test, whether the bargain fell

 8   within the range of what arm's length bargaining

 9   otherwise would have achieved.

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Counsel, if we are

11   going to have regulation of what fees can be charged,

12   you cite in your brief the various regulations the SEC

13   has issued.    It makes a lot more sense to have the SEC

14   regulate rates than to have courts do it, doesn't it?

15                 MR. GANNON:      Well, in the abstract, it might

16   make more sense, Mr. Chief Justice.                     I think the choice

17   that Congress made here was to counterbalance the --

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               You are not

19   suggesting the SEC wouldn't have authority to do that,

20   are you?

21                 MR. GANNON:      Well, even under this statute,

22   the SEC has the authority to file suits under section

23   36(b).

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Has it filed any?

25                 MR. GANNON:      It hasn't filed any since --

 1   since 1980, Justice Ginsburg.             I think that the SEC in

 2   this context -- it has -- it has primarily directed its

 3   resources and energies into encouraging there to be

 4   better disclosure of fees, both the disclosure of

 5   information to the board, disclosure to investors,

 6   better education to shareholders so that they would be

 7   able to go --

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Well, it must be aware of

 9   the -- of the divergence between the fees that

10   investment advisers charge to these companies and what

11   they charge to other clients.             Isn't the SEC aware of

12   that?

13                 MR. GANNON:      It is aware of that.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          And yet has brought no

15   suits against this industry?

16                 MR. GANNON:      Since 1980 it hasn't used

17   section 36(b).    It has used less formal mechanisms in

18   the context of examinations and investigators -- -

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          For disclosure, just for

20   disclosure.    But that suggests to me that the SEC may

21   think that this is indeed a self-contained industry and

22   that the comparison with investment advice given to

23   other entities is -- is not a fair one.

24                 MR. GANNON:      Well, when the SEC helped draft

25   the statute in the 1960s, it recognized that there was


                                       21

 1   this systematic disparity between the amounts that

 2   mutual funds were being charged by investment advisers

 3   and the amounts that investment advisers were charging

 4   their unaffiliated clients, and in the 1969 memorandum

 5   that I referred to, which is reprinted in an appendix to

 6   the amicus brief by John Bogel in its entirety, the SEC

 7   mentioned that comparison as being something that may

 8   well be relevant in proving in an individual case that

 9   that particular investment adviser's fees are excessive.

10              And we think that the test here of whether

11   under all the circumstances, which is what section

12   36(b)(2) points the Court towards, of having to weigh --

13   having to weigh the board's approval of fees in light of

14   all the circumstances, that those circumstances include

15   things like the evidence that petitioners have presented

16   here.

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Gannon, the -- all

18   the circumstances, that comes from the Second Circuit's

19   Gartenberg case?

20              MR. GANNON:         Well, it also comes,

21   Justice Ginsburg, from the text of section 36(b)(2).

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But in -- in that case,

23   at least there was a footnote that seemed to say, you

24   don't have to engage in a -- in the comparison with what

25   institutional investors are paid.


                                       22

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               MR. GANNON:       The footnote that you are

 2   talking about did point out that in that case the

 3   comparison that the plaintiffs were attempting to draw

 4   between the money market fund at issue and a pension

 5   fund wasn't a particularly relevant one, because the

 6   services at issue were so different.                   And here the

 7   parties appear to dispute how different the services

 8   are.   And at the summary judgment stage, the Respondent

 9   stated that it disputed how comparable the relevant

10   services were.

11               The district court and the court of appeals

12   considered that dispute immaterial because, instead of

13   comparing, instead of determining whether this

14   investment adviser is selling the same services at half

15   the price to its unaffiliated clients who actually can

16   engage in arm's length bargaining, those courts simply

17   said that if it -- if it falls within the range that is

18   charged by other mutual funds, that would be acceptable.

19   And we --

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, the statute

21   does not say, in considering the rates you look at all

22   the circumstances.    Am I right?            It says, in considering

23   whether to defer to the board, you look at all the

24   circumstances.

25               MR. GANNON:       It does say that you should

 1   give the board --

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   The board.

 3              MR. GANNON:          -- such consideration as is

 4   deemed appropriate under all the circumstances.                   That's

 5   correct.

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Right.   But isn't

 7   that different than saying, in looking at what the rates

 8   should be or whether they are excessive, you look at all

 9   the circumstances?     It may well be that you don't defer

10   to the board, but that doesn't mean it's a free-for-all

11   in deciding what you do look at.

12              MR. GANNON:          Well, I think that it

13   demonstrates that the Court is obligated to look to all

14   the circumstances simply to determine whether the

15   board's approval -- how much weight it should be given.

16              And as this Court explained in Daily Income

17   Fund, the entire point of section 36(b) is to provide an

18   independent check, the -- independent of the fact that

19   the directors approved the fees.                 We think that an

20   appropriately informed board that asks the right

21   questions, that gets the right information and fully

22   considers the sort of factors that are discussed --

23              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Even if they agree to

24   pay double the price?

25              MR. GANNON:          We think that -- that the right


                                        24

                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   process followed by the board would be probative, but

 2   something like double the price may -- may demonstrate

 3   that that is an unfair bargain.

 4              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             That -- that's what --

 5   are you advocating that there is a stand-alone cause of

 6   action or breach of duty when there isn't full

 7   disclosure, even if the fee is within arm's length --

 8   normal -- begging the question of what's normal, but

 9   assuming that it's within an arm's-length transaction

10   range in the market?

11              MR. GANNON:       If there was a lack of full

12   disclosure, that might in the abstract be a breach of

13   fiduciary duty even under the Seventh Circuit's test.

14   We think that if it didn't actually have an effect on

15   the fees, then it wouldn't be actionable here because

16   there would be no actual damages flowing from the lack

17   of disclosure.

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:           But even if there is full

19   disclosure, your position is in every case a court must

20   decide whether the fee is reasonable or not.

21              MR. GANNON:       A court would need to decide

22   whether the plaintiff has met its burden of proving that

23   it falls outside the range of fees that arm's-length

24   bargaining would have arrived at, and that's a cause of

25   action that would be --

 1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Well, how much deviance,

 2   and what is the scope of the range?

 3               MR. GANNON:       Well, I think that the term of

 4   art of "fiduciary duty" doesn't necessarily demonstrate

 5   how much deviance away from the range there would be.                   I

 6   think that depending upon the segment of the market the

 7   range might be more or less narrow.

 8               In segments of the market where services are

 9   more commodified and standardized, perhaps with index

10   funds, there might be a much narrower range of fees that

11   are arrived at through arm's-length bargaining, and even

12   -- and smaller disparities might be inappropriate there.

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            How is the -- how is the

14   standard you've just described different from a standard

15   of reasonableness?

16               MR. GANNON:       It -- I think that the chief

17   way it differs from reasonableness, Justice Kennedy, is

18   in saying that the Court doesn't actually have to decide

19   what the single most reasonable fee is.                But as the SEC

20   explained in 1969, the shift from reasonableness to --

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, I would be very

22   surprised if "reasonableness" always meant one -- one

23   figure.   It could mean a range.

24               MR. GANNON:       Well, I think reasonableness

25   is - is inevitably going to be part of the inherent

 1   fairness inquiry that this Court referred to in Pepper

 2   v. Litton as being part of the fiduciary duty status as

 3   to whether the transaction --

 4                JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask you a question

 5   going back to Justice Kennedy's early question?                   Do you

 6   think the fiduciary status of the defendant in this case

 7   is different from the fiduciary status of a president of

 8   a corporation?

 9                MR. GANNON:      I -- I -- I think that it is

10   different from the status of a president of a

11   corporation; that -- that the term of art, "fiduciary"

12   which Congress was invoking here can mean different

13   things in different circumstances.

14                Pepper was a case that involved corporate

15   directors.   The chief difference here and what Congress

16   was intending to counteract was the inherent structural

17   impediment to arm's-length bargaining between the

18   investment adviser and the board of directors.                   And

19   that's what makes that high burden that was used in

20   Pepper v. Litton for controlling shareholders the

21   relevant analogy, we believe.

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, counsel.

 1                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 2                 MR. DONOVAN:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 3   please the Court:

 4                 The point that Mr. Gannon just made and that

 5   Mr. Frederick made before, that there was some

 6   structural impediment to negotiations between a mutual

 7   fund board and adviser, is at the heart of this dispute,

 8   because that is a judgment that Congress made.                  The

 9   Investment Company Act in the first instance delegates

10   responsibility to the board of directors to approve

11   fees.     A fee may not be approved that does not have the

12   consent of a majority of the independent trustees in the

13   first instance.

14                 The independent check on fees that is

15   erected by section 36(b) --

16                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Let's assume -- let's

17   assume that all of the independent board of director

18   members vote for a particular fee, but the fee is

19   negotiated by an insider, and the insider is the one who

20   does the evaluation, looks at them and says:                  I think

21   this is really a great deal, guys.                  And they just fell

22   for it.     Is that a process that would guarantee an

23   arm's-length transaction in the sense that Congress

24   intended in this act?

25                 MR. DONOVAN:        It may not and it may give

 1   rise to a cause of action.            But as I started --

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Which cause of action --

 3                MR. DONOVAN:         A cause of action --

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              -- under what?

 5                MR. DONOVAN:         It may give a cause of action

 6   under section 36(b) if the circumstances you described,

 7   Justice Sotomayor are -- have an impact upon the fee.

 8   And the reason --

 9                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              So, then their process

10   is part of your definition of "fiduciary duty"?                 A court

11   has to look at the nature of process?

12                MR. DONOVAN:         If there is an impact upon fee

13   that is outside of the range of what could have been

14   bargained.   The reason for that --

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Now -- now you are

16   adding what has been added, which is outside of the

17   range, correct?

18                MR. DONOVAN:         Yes.

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              All right.

20                MR. DONOVAN:         If I understand your question

21   correctly, will a process flaw alone justify a

22   section 36(b) cause of action?               My answer is no.     Will a

23   process flaw that affects a fee justify a 36(b) action?

24   Yes, it will.

25                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              All right.   But what you


                                        29

 1   are -- but what you are arguing is, if the process is

 2   fair, even if the fee is outside the range of an arm's-

 3   length transaction, there is no cause of action?

 4               MR. DONOVAN:         No, I -- I -- I doubt that as

 5   well.   There are two separate causes of action, I can

 6   imagine, under 36(b):       One, a process flaw that has a

 7   fee impact; and second, a fee that is so far outside of

 8   the bounds of what could have been bargained that it

 9   justifies independent review.

10               The question under 36(b) is whether, having

11   delegated responsibility in the first instance to a

12   board, there is a reason to second-guess their judgment.

13   And the independent check that Mr. Gannon referred to at

14   section 36(b) or (a) should not be a de novo judicial

15   review of the size of the fee for a couple of reasons,

16   the first of which is section 36(b)(2).                     That statute

17   instructs courts to give such consideration as they

18   consider due to the deliberations of the board.                      What

19   did they see?    What did they get?               Did they negotiate?

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's a wonderfully clear

21   command, isn't it?    Such consideration as is

22   appropriate?    What is the language?                   Read it.   What is

23   it?

24               MR. DONOVAN:         The language is "such

25   consideration that the court considers due under the

 1   circumstances."

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Wow.

 3                 (Laughter.)

 4                 MR. DONOVAN:       But there would be no reason

 5   for that instruction at all, Your Honor, if a court were

 6   to make its own judgments about what is fair and

 7   reasonable.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          No, it's meaningless.           It

 9   tells the court to make its own judgment.                   Such

10   consideration as the court deems due.                   Give it

11   whatever -- whatever consideration you -- you feel like.

12   It's utterly meaningless to me.

13                 MR. DONOVAN:       What I think Congress was

14   doing was considering what the source of the common law

15   had been before.     The corporate context,

16   Justice Kennedy, I think was what inspired.                   At

17   corporate law, a decision would not be second-guessed by

18   a court unless there was a reason to do so, unless the

19   judgment of directors and the presumption of regularity

20   that attached to their decisions could for some reason

21   be second-guessed.     Was there a process flaw?                  Was it so

22   far out of bounds?

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, what is "so

24   far out of bounds"?      In other words, you are saying, you

25   can look at what the directors did if it's, as you said,

 1   too far out of bounds, but 10 percent off, 50 percent

 2   off?

 3                MR. DONOVAN:         Mr. Chief --

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Double, as they say

 5   is the case here?

 6                MR. DONOVAN:         I'm sorry?

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Double, as they say

 8   is the case here?

 9                MR. DONOVAN:         As the plaintiffs say is the

10   case here.

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Yes.

12                MR. DONOVAN:         I suggest there is no

13   numerical basis, because in fact every kind of mutual

14   fund and ever stripe of mutual fund is different.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, then you say:

16   Look to see if it's outside the bounds, and now you tell

17   me there is no way to look to see if it's outside the

18   bounds.

19                MR. DONOVAN:         Well, I think -- the first

20   comparative would be other funds of a similar stripe.

21   So, for example, you could imagine that a mutual fund

22   with the same investment objective and style that is two

23   times might be inappropriate.              You could also imagine a

24   different circumstance where, passively managed funds

25   for example, a multiple of fees would be inappropriate.

 1                You could also, though, imagine a case where

 2   there is substantial risk taken, where the types of

 3   securities that are invested in are unusual, where

 4   substantial differences could be justified.

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Is that the test that the

 6   court of appeals here applied?

 7                MR. DONOVAN:        Pardon?

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Is that the test that the

 9   court of appeals here applied, whose judgment you want

10   us to affirm?

11                MR. DONOVAN:        The court of appeals did not

12   apply the test.    Judge Easterbrook --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:           So we should remand it for

14   application of the test that you propose?

15                MR. DONOVAN:        I don't think you have to.

16   And the reason is because of what the district court

17   did.    And there I get to, Justice Ginsburg, what you

18   said.    The -- the argument is made that services are the

19   same.    In fact, that is not the record.               And if you look

20   at page 161 of the Joint Appendix and following, there

21   is a list of services that the trust -- the investment

22   adviser gave to the trustees in this case, about all of

23   the services that they did for their fee in the case.

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Surely that's a disputed

25   fact, isn't it?    And you want us to dispose -- or you


                                       33

 1   want this to be disposed of on summary judgment.                      The

 2   other side says the services aren't that much different.

 3                 MR. DONOVAN:       They are very different.               Page

 4   161 and following will tell you how.                    And the district

 5   court at page 360 -- 16a, excuse me, of the district

 6   court's opinion, notices that the services were

 7   different.    So, under --

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          It wasn't talking about

 9   this particular case.       It was talking about in general,

10   wasn't --

11                 MR. DONOVAN:       No, he was talking about this

12   case, Justice Scalia.

13                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Except that they claim

14   that you were receiving additional payment for the

15   services, or some or at least a substantial number of

16   the services, that you claim are attributed by the

17   difference.    So they're saying if you compare apples to

18   apples, you are charging twice the amount.                   If you

19   compare apples to oranges, there are differences because

20   the oranges were different, but you were getting paid

21   for those oranges separately.             I think that was their

22   argument.

23                 MR. DONOVAN:       That is their argument and

24   it's not accurate, Your Honor.

25                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Well, that's the issue

 1   of disputed fact.     So let's go back.                  Are you disavowing

 2   the Seventh Circuit's approach?                Because I read your

 3   brief and it doesn't appear as if you are defending

 4   their market approach that says so long as the process

 5   was fair, any fee is okay.            That's how I thought they

 6   had reached their conclusion.

 7               MR. DONOVAN:          I think what Judge Easterbrook

 8   said, and we don't agree, is if there is deceit of

 9   directors that would justify a cause of action under

10   36(b).   But in the absence of, in his words, "pulling

11   the wool over the eyes of the trustees" --

12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               That's what I'm talking

13   -- I am using his words in terms of case --

14               MR. DONOVAN:          I do --

15               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               And you're disavowing

16   that?

17               MR. DONOVAN:          I do not defend that, because

18   I can imagine, as your hypothetical asked earlier,

19   directors or trustees who -- are not paying attention --

20               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Your positions is no

21   different than the solicitor general's, that there has

22   to be some measure of fair process and some measure of a

23   fair fee, at least within -- in terms of it not being

24   outside the range an arm's length transaction?

25               MR. DONOVAN:          The solicitor general gets it

 1   right when she describes Gartenberg as the standard.                 Is

 2   this a result that could have been fairly bargained at

 3   arm's length.     Where we part company is with respect to

 4   two things:     One is, she says and Mr. Gannon said today,

 5   that the most important consideration is a comparison to

 6   other kinds of fees, and that is required in the

 7   calculus in the district court.                In fact, that would

 8   make mandatory what the SEC rules only make

 9   discretionary.

10                 Chief Justice, you asked earlier about the

11   SEC's rules in this area.           And in fact, they compel

12   disclosure of fees charged by advisers to their funds

13   and their conflicts of similar investment objectives.

14   They do not require disclosure of accounts within an

15   advisor's business operations that are institutional

16   accounts.   Now to be sure --

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           That are what?

18                 MR. DONOVAN:        That are -- advisers --

19   institutional accounts adviser services.                 If --

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But the -- the fund

21   adviser here -- I mean, the investment adviser did

22   disclose -- that's in the record -- did disclose the

23   difference between what were charged mutual funds, what

24   were charged institutional investors, and then explained

25   that the services were different and that justified the

 1   difference.    But they weren't trying to think, no, we

 2   don't have to come forward with this information.

 3                 MR. DONOVAN:       That's precisely correct, Your

 4   Honor.   In this case the trustees did have the

 5   information.    The adviser did disclose it, but the SEC

 6   does not require them to ask that question.             All it

 7   requires them to do is if they do ask the question, if

 8   they do study the material, they must disclose the

 9   weight they put on to it.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Suppose you were appointed

11   to a committee, just set my pay, that might be helpful.

12   I'd say I'll pay you $50,000 a year to do it, as long as

13   I am satisfied with your results.

14                 Now, would you, for example, not have in

15   your mind, I would like to know what he's paid by other

16   people that don't have someone like me setting his pay?

17   Wouldn't that be in your mind?

18                 MR. DONOVAN:       It could be, sure.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Yeah, so wouldn't that be a

20   normal question to ask?

21                 MR. DONOVAN:       And the trustees did ask it

22   here.

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Well, I don't know if they

24   asked it -- I mean, I think we are reviewing the

25   district court opinion, I think we are reversing -- we

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:              I have laryngitis; I don't

 4   speak accurately.

 5              (Laughter.)

 6              JUSTICE BREYER:              I think we are reviewing a

 7   -- a decision of a court of appeals setting a standard,

 8   and so wouldn't, when we set the standard, say, we can't

 9   say if in every case you are not going to go out and ask

10   him what he charges when he mows the neighbor's lawn,

11   but we would like to know what he charges when he asks

12   for money from people who do not have this kind of

13   supervision, and we would like if it's a lot different

14   to ask him why.

15              MR. DONOVAN:           Justice Breyer --

16              JUSTICE BREYER:              Okay, so what's the problem

17   then with saying that in the opinion?

18              MR. DONOVAN:           There is no problem with

19   saying that if it is a relevant consideration.

20              JUSTICE BREYER:              Well, it's pretty unusual

21   that it won't be, and I think certainly you have in the

22   case in front of us a case where it would be relevant.

23   You may have an answer to the question.                  There may be a

24   perfectly good answer, so let's listen to it.

25              MR. DONOVAN:           The difference, Your Honor, is


                                        38

 1   that the Solicitor General and the plaintiffs would make

 2   the question and the answer dispositive in every case.

 3   I would acknowledge as --

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:           The answer dispositive?

 5   Well, I don't see it should be dispositive, maybe the

 6   answers would be quite different.

 7               MR. DONOVAN:        Precisely.

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.       So -- but you

 9   no objection, then I'm not sure there is much of an

10   issue.   There might -- I mean, maybe there is some.

11   That's the only issue, whether this should be

12   dispositive always, or whether it should be a factor to

13   take into account where relevant?

14               MR. DONOVAN:        It is a factor that I consider

15   that is likely to be relevant --

16               JUSTICE BREYER:           So you have no objection to

17   send it back and say look, of course this is relevant,

18   perhaps quite often relevant; why don't you look at it?

19               MR. DONOVAN:        My objection -- my objection

20   to sending it back is only that that analysis was done.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But did -- but in the

22   Seventh Circuit, Judge Easterbrook said, mainly you have

23   to look to see if there was full disclosure, and then

24   there might be cases where it's so out of line.               And he

25   said the comparison would be to other mutual funds.               He


                                      39
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   excluded the comparison with institutional investors.

 2   So to that extent, was the Second Circuit wrong, saying

 3   this is not a relevant factor; what other mutual funds

 4   pay investment advisors may be a relevant factor?

 5               MR. DONOVAN:        I think the Seventh Circuit

 6   made that comparison.      Judge Easterbrook did say that

 7   the services of institutional accounts ordinarily are

 8   different from mutual fund accounts.                   I agree that in

 9   the first instance, the first comparator usually should

10   be mutual funds, and regrettably Judge Easterbrook did

11   not cite to the record for the reasons to identify those

12   differences.   But it is in fact in the record, and there

13   is no other record that suggests that they were the

14   same.   All we had below was the assertion that on the

15   one hand, an advisory contract for an institutional

16   account said advisory services.              And in the other we had

17   a mutual fund advisory contract that said advisory

18   services.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                When you say you

20   should look at the range and how far it's off, do you

21   mean that in the Gartenberg sense -- in other words, if

22   it is way out of line, then you assume or can at least

23   look further at whether there was a fair process?                  Or do

24   you mean it in the normal case, in sort of setting the

25   rates you just look how far it is off.

 1                 MR. DONOVAN:       I look at it in the Gartenberg

 2   sense, Your Honor.    And the reason is because as I --

 3   from what I said the first question is, is when do you

 4   ask courts to substitute their judgment?

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               It's probably --

 6   you're not the person to -- to ask, but do you

 7   understand the Solicitor General's position to be your

 8   understanding of the Gartenberg sense or something else?

 9                 MR. DONOVAN:       I believe they interpret in

10   the Gartenberg sense.       I think that the Solicitor

11   General's position and the Respondent's, with respect to

12   the standard that you ought to apply, is Gartenberg.

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:          What do we do about

14   Gartenberg?    That is to say, the key sentence you can

15   read either way.    The key sentence could mean -- it just

16   depends on tone of voice.          You must charge a fee that is

17   not so disproportionately large that it bears no

18   reasonable relationship to the services rendered and

19   could not -- could not have been the product of

20   arms-length bargaining.        Or you could say, look, it's

21   unlawful where it's so large -- it doesn't -- where

22   there is no reasonable relationship.                    And if there is no

23   reasonable relationship, how could it have been the

24   product of arm's-length bargaining?

25                 MR. DONOVAN:       I agree you can turn the words


                                       41

 1   upside down.    I think they turned it upside down --

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:          You object if we turn them

 3   upside down?

 4                 MR. DONOVAN:       I think they turned them

 5   upside down for a reason, and the reason is 36(b)(1),

 6   which imposes the burden of proof upon --

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Well, I'm saying the tone,

 8   be a little careful here.

 9                 MR. DONOVAN:       Well --

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:          So we can say the substance

11   is -- I'm just trying this out -- the substance is to

12   look and see if it's reasonable, and if it's reasonable

13   it certainly is the product of arm-length bargaining, if

14   it's not reasonable, how could it be?                    Got to get an

15   answer to that, okay?       So, that way you see the tone is

16   be careful, you are a judge, you are not a rate-setter.

17   How's that?

18                 MR. DONOVAN:       I would accept the proposition

19   that it is reasonable if it is outside of what could

20   have been bargained at arm's length.                    I think they

21   turned it upside down the fact for the reason that the

22   statute reverses the burden of proof and I think that

23   they also acknowledge that it is a process-oriented

24   thing for judges to do, because after all you are asking

25   here a standard for judges to apply in a contested

 1   situation that recognizes the responsibility of the

 2   board in the first instance.            That's what 36(b)(2) is

 3   all about.

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Would -- would you give us

 5   the citations of the parts of the record that you say

 6   render it unnecessary for us to remand for the lower

 7   court to consider a comparison with non- -- with

 8   institutional charges?

 9                MR. DONOVAN:       Yes, Your Honor.        I start at

10   page 16a and 17a of the district court's opinion where

11   at page 16a at the bottom the district court said the

12   services supplied are different.               And --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:          At 16a of the Joint

14   Appendix you are talking about?

15                MR. DONOVAN:       I'm sorry, Your Honor, the

16   petition.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Of the petition.

18                MR. DONOVAN:       Correct, it's 16a of the

19   petition, which is Judge Kocoras' opinion.              At the

20   bottom of the page you will see that he said, the

21   services Harris provided to institutional clients varied

22   but in all events were more limited than those provided

23   the funds.

24                If you then go on to page 17, he goes

25   through with respect to each of these three funds and


                                      43
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   chronicles the fees they paid and by comparison the fees

 2   charged to institutional accounts with similar

 3   investment objectives.         The statement by the plaintiff,

 4   Petitioners here, that the fee charged was a 2X

 5   multiple, does not refer to that array of institutional

 6   accounts.     It takes one in order to make the comparison

 7   what it is.

 8                 And then, Justice Scalia, I would then go to

 9   page 32a of the district court's opinion where he

10   describes what appear to be disputed issues of fact.

11   And what he said those dispute issues of fact were about

12   were what the Petitioners claimed were flaws in the

13   negotiation process, in substance, what they would have

14   done had they been negotiating, rather than the

15   trustees.     It is not a dispute about the ultimate test,

16   was this fee so far out of bounds it could not have been

17   reasonable.

18                 To be sure, throughout a record that is as

19   large as this one, you could imagine the parties

20   disputed lots of things.          What you could not fairly

21   dispute is whether these fees, for these funds, using

22   comparable funds and using institutional accounts, as

23   Judge Kocoras did, were so far out of bounds, they could

24   not have been fairly bargained, and if that is the test,

25   there is no need for remand.

 1               If, as I suggest and as the Solicitor

 2   General suggests, Gartenberg is the appropriate

 3   standard, Gartenberg is what the district court applied.

 4               This Court has to be sure, on occasion, and

 5   it is rare, both announce the test and apply it in the

 6   same circumstances.

 7               In circumstances where courts are looking

 8   for guidance on what the standard is and how to apply

 9   it, I suggest this is a case in which affirming what the

10   district court did would be appropriate.

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What about the

12   petitioners' allegation that the investment adviser did

13   not provide full and accurate information?              And they

14   mention particularly concerning economies of scale,

15   profitability, and several other matters, that what

16   everybody agrees is necessary, full disclosure, had not

17   occurred.

18               Is that a disputed issue of fact or of

19   further inquiry?

20               MR. DONOVAN:         I don't think it is, Your

21   Honor.   And, again, I would go back to what Judge

22   Kocoras said on 32(a).

23               There was absolutely suggestions in the

24   record by the plaintiff that they would have negotiated

25   differently, but, for example, with respect to


                                       45
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   ostensible misrepresentations on -- among other things,

 2   profitability and the rest, this was because the

 3   plaintiffs' expert did an accounting and accounted for

 4   costs differently and said, had you accounted for costs

 5   and allocated them the way I did, you would have reached

 6   a negotiated result that was different.

 7                Well, that just isn't what happened.       That's

 8   why Judge Kocoras said, this goes to the integrity of

 9   the negotiation.     Would the negotiation have been

10   different?

11                The plaintiffs say, I would have done it

12   differently, but that's all they said, and it's not a

13   misrepresentation to say, I would have accounted for

14   costs differently.

15                Finally, I would -- the other question you

16   asked is where in the record -- Justice Scalia, I'm

17   sorry.   It's at page 161 and following, where the

18   background of all the difference in fees and the

19   difference in services is chronicled.

20                You can tell, from the pull-out charts at

21   page 171, what fee is charged for each of these mutual

22   funds and what fee is charged for institutional

23   accounts.

24                If you take the plaintiffs' point of view

25   and say that a comparison to institutional accounts is


                                       46

 1   always required and may be dispositive and is always a

 2   fraction of what mutual fund charges and that judges are

 3   the, in the first instance, the ones to decide who is

 4   fair and reasonable or what is fair and reasonable, as

 5   opposed to directors, I suggest you consign 8,000 mutual

 6   funds to a trial.

 7                On this record, these were funds that had

 8   best in class performance for fees that were at or below

 9   industry averages.

10                That is not a record upon which a reasonable

11   person could conclude that the adviser has over-reached.

12   That is at the heart of fiduciary duty.                  I see my time

13   is about to expire.

14                Thank you, Your Honor.

18           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

19                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

20                MR. FREDERICK:           At this recording here did

21   not make findings -- this was a summary judgment case,

22   and in fact, the Court didn't find that the disputes

23   were nonexistent.

24                In fact, on page 30a, the district court

25   said that the disputes were nonmaterial, and that's a

 1   very important distinction because the joint appendix

 2   that you have before you contains a lot of evidence in

 3   which it is disputed whether or not these were similar

 4   services.

 5                The Harris manager on page 6 -- JA 650, the

 6   portfolio holdings of the funds, are very similar.                   On

 7   512, the Harris fund manager testimony that, when he

 8   buys a stock, he buys it for all mutual funds and

 9   independent accounts, with the same investment

10   objective.

11                On 505 to 506, the Harris research director

12   testimony that the managers of the mutual funds and

13   independent accounts share equally all work done by the

14   research department, and 513 to 514, that the Harris

15   fund manager says all of our analysts do research for

16   all of our clients.

17                There is disputed evidence here as to what

18   constitutes similarity, Justice Sotomayor, these are

19   comparing apples to apples because the record indicates

20   that there are separate contracts for the additional

21   fees that they charge to the mutual funds for the

22   additional services provided.

23                We're simply talking about comparisons of

24   money management, but --

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Was your friend

 1   correct, that these funds have better than average

 2   performance and lower than average fees?

 3              MR. FREDERICK:            In one small aspect of the

 4   damages period, that is correct, and after that was

 5   found, they had lower than average performance and

 6   higher than average fees, Mr. Chief Justice.            It's a

 7   damages period that encompasses several years.

 8              If I could go back to the point, though,

 9   about the fiduciary duty, what Judge Cardozo, when he

10   was on the New York Court of Appeals, said, a fiduciary

11   represents the punctilio of honor, and that is

12   contrasted with the morals of the marketplace operating

13   at arm's-length.

14              It surely cannot be the case that, where you

15   are dealing with a fiduciary duty -- which is a higher

16   standard recognized in the law -- that you can charge

17   twice as much as what you are obtaining at arm's-length

18   for services that you are providing.

19              The Gartenberg court, Justice Breyer, in

20   fact, had the opposite language that you are averting

21   to, and that is at page 694 F.2nd 928, where the Court

22   said, "The test is essentially whether the fee schedule

23   represents a charge within the range of what would have

24   been negotiated at arm's-length in the light of all the

25   surrounding circumstances."

 1              JUSTICE BREYER:           I thought, by reversing

 2   that, picking out what the essence was, you would get

 3   pretty close to what you are arguing for, without

 4   getting into all this thing of whether it's just like a

 5   trustee or whether a lawyer should be a trustee or --

 6   you know, there are a lot of questions here that could

 7   float around, of any language we use.

 8              MR. FREDERICK:          That's right.        The Second

 9   Circuit that went on to flip it and say, we had to prove

10   a negative, which is not ordinarily what a plaintiff has

11   to prove in any law case, by showing it -- it is so

12   disproportionate it could not have been achieved at

13   arm's-length, and that is where we think the court --

14   courts have gotten this wrong.

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

16              The case is submitted.

17              (Whereupon, at 10:57 a.m., the case in the

18   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
