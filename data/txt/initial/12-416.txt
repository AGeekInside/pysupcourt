 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                       We'll hear argument

 4   next this morning in Case 12-416, the Federal Trade

 5   Commission v. Actavis.

 6               Mr. Stewart.

 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. STEWART:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               As a general matter, a payment from one

12   business to another in exchange for the recipient's

13   agreement not to compete is an paradigmatic antitrust

14   trust violation.     The question presented here is whether

15   such a payment should be treated as lawful when it is

16   encompassed within the settlement of a patent

17   infringement suit.      The answer to that question is no.

18               Reverse payments to settle Hatch-Waxman

19   suits are objectionable for the same reasons that

20   payments not to compete are generally objectionable.

21   They subvert the competitive process by giving generic

22   manufacturers an incentive to accept a share of their

23   rival's monopoly profits as a substitute for actual

24   competition in the -

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Why -- why are payments not

                                         3

 1   to compete different from, let's say, dividing a market?

 2   I mean, suppose there's a lawsuit, somebody challenging

 3   the validity of the patent and the patentee agrees to

 4   allow the person challenging the patent to have

 5   exclusive -- exclusive rights to sell in a particular

 6   area.

 7                 Does that violate the antitrust laws?

 8                 MR. STEWART:         I mean, there are really two

 9   differences between that -- that scenario and the one

10   presented here.    The first is that an exclusive license

11   is expressly authorized by the Patent Act, in Section

12   261 of Title 35, but -- but the second thing is -

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That -- that doesn't

14   impress me.    What else?        What's your second point?

15                 (Laughter.)

16                 MR. STEWART:         The second thing is that an

17   exclusive license doesn't give the -- the infringement

18   defendant anything that it couldn't hope to achieve by

19   prevailing in the lawsuit.              That is, if the -- at least

20   any right to compete that it wouldn't get by prevailing

21   in the lawsuit.

22                 If the infringement defendant won, it would

23   be able to sell wherever it wanted to.

24                 Now, there may be some -

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            In order to make money.   I

                                        4

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   mean, that's -- that's what it wants is money.

 2               MR. STEWART:           But the point of -

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:              So instead of giving them a

 4   license to compete -- you know, we'll short-circuit the

 5   whole thing, here's the money.                 Go away.

 6               MR. STEWART:           But the point here is that the

 7   money is being given as a substitute for earning profits

 8   in a competitive marketplace.                That is, in -- in the

 9   Hatch-Waxman settlement context, by definition, we have

10   a disagreement by parties as to the relative merits of

11   the infringement and -- and/or invalidity questions as

12   to the patent infringement suit.

13               The brand name is saying its patent is valid

14   and infringed.    The generic is saying either that the

15   patent is invalid or that its own conduct won't be

16   infringing or both.      And if the generic wins, it will be

17   able to enter the market immediately.                   If the brand name

18   wins, it will be able to keep the generic off until the

19   patent expires.

20               And so in that circumstance, a logical

21   subject of compromise would be to agree upon an entry

22   date in between those two end points, just as the

23   parties to a damages action would be expected to settle

24   the case by the defendant agreeing to pay a portion of

25   the money it would have to pay if it lost.                   That's an

                                        5

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   actual subject of compromise and we don't have a problem

 2   with that.

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Stewart, do you have a

 4   case in which the patentee, acting within the scope of

 5   the patent, has nonetheless been held liable under the

 6   antitrust laws -

 7                 MR. STEWART:         Yes.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- for something that it's

 9   done acting within the scope of the patent?

10                 MR. STEWART:         Yes, if you adopt Respondent's

11   conception of what it means to act within the scope of

12   the patent.    And let me explain.                 When the Respondents

13   say that the restrictions at issue here are within the

14   scope of the patent, what they mean is that the goods

15   that are being restricted are arguably encompassed by

16   the patent and the restriction doesn't extend past the

17   date when the patent expires.

18                 That's all they mean.                     And if that were the

19   exclusive test, the defendants in Masonite, in New

20   Wrinkle, in Line Material, they would all have been off

21   the hook because all of those cases involved

22   restrictions on trade in patented goods during the

23   period that the patent was in effect, and yet, the Court

24   found antitrust liability in each of these.

25                 Now, the way that Respondent tries to

                                        6

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   explain Masonite, for example, Masonite involved a

 2   resale price maintenance agreement in which the

 3   patentholder sold goods and then attempted to control

 4   the price at which they would be resold, and the Court

 5   said that under the rule of patent exhaustion, the

 6   patentholder didn't have the right to do that and

 7   therefore the patent laws provided no shield and the

 8   agreement was held to be a violation of the antitrust

 9   laws.

10                 Now, Respondents say, well, that's

11   consistent with their theory because the restriction

12   imposed went beyond the scope of the patent because the

13   right to control resale is not one of the rights that

14   the Patent Act confers.

15                 But if that's the test for whether a

16   restriction is within the scope of the patent, then we

17   would say that it's not met here because there's nothing

18   in the Patent Act that says you can pay your competitor

19   not to engage in conduct that you believe to be

20   infringing.

21                 And really that's the thrust of their

22   position, that if you have -- if a patentholder has a

23   non-sham allegation that a particular mode of

24   competition would be an infringement of its patent, the

25   patentholder can pay the competitor not to engage in

                                        7

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that competition.

 2                  Again, we are not talking about conduct in

 3   which there has been any judicial determination that

 4   infringement has occurred.               We are just talking about

 5   cases in which the patentholder has a non-sham

 6   allegation that infringement would occur.

 7                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Stewart, does this

 8   represent a change in the government's position?                 I got

 9   the idea from the briefs that at the time of this

10   Schering-Plough case, that was also before the Eleventh

11   Circuit, that the government was not taking that

12   position it is now taking.

13                  MR. STEWART:         Well, the FTC has consistently

14   taken this position.        The Department of Justice, up

15   until 2009, we didn't endorse the scope of the patent

16   test.   Indeed, in our invitation brief in Joblove we

17   specifically said that the scope-of-the-patent test

18   was -- didn't provide for enough scrutiny of these

19   settlements.

20                  But what we advocated -- what the Department

21   of Justice advocated, instead was a test that would

22   focus on the strength and scope of the patent.                 That is,

23   the likelihood that the brand name would off -

24   ultimately have prevailed if the suit had been litigated

25   to judgment.

                                         8

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 And in 2009, for the first time in an amicus

 2   brief filed in the Second Circuit, we took essentially

 3   the position that we're taking here, that is that

 4   agreements of this sort should be treated as

 5   presumptively unlawful with the presumption able to be

 6   rebutted in various ways.

 7                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And one way is to assess

 8   the validity or the strength of the infringement case?

 9                 MR. STEWART:         We would say that that's not a

10   way, that -

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             That's -- that's my

12   concern, is your test is the same for a very weak patent

13   as a very strong patent.           That doesn't make a lot of

14   sense.

15                 MR. STEWART:         Well, the test is whether

16   there has been a payment that would tend to skew the

17   parties' choice of an entry date, that would tend to

18   provide an incentive for the parties to -- for the

19   generic to agree to an entry date later than the one

20   that it would otherwise insist on.

21                 Now, it probably is the case that our test

22   would have greater practical import in cases where the

23   parties perceive the patent to be -

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Why wouldn't that

25   determination itself reflect the strength or weakness of

                                        9

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the patent so that the market forces take that into

 2   account?

 3               MR. STEWART:         Well, I think in the kind of

 4   settlement that we would regard as legitimate, where the

 5   parties simply agree to a compromise date of generic

 6   entry, then the parties would certainly take into

 7   account their own assessment of what would likely happen

 8   at the end of the suit.

 9               And so if the parties believe that the brand

10   name was likely to prevail, then if the brand name

11   agreed to early generic entry at all, it would

12   presumably be for a fairly small amount of time.

13               Conversely, if the parties collectively

14   believe that the generic -- that the brand name had a

15   weak case and the generic was likely to prevail, then

16   they would negotiate for an earlier date.             And the

17   problem with the reverse payment is that it gives the

18   generic an incentive to accept something other than

19   competition as a means of earning money.

20               I mean, to take another -

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:            This -- this was not a

22   problem, I gather, until the Hatch-Waxman amendments?

23               MR. STEWART:         These suits -- these types of

24   payments appear to be essentially unknown in other

25   lawsuits and other patent infringement cases.

                                     10

                       Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yes, and so -- and so do

 2   suits against this kind of payment.                    And I have -- I

 3   have the feeling that what happened is that Hatch-Waxman

 4   made a mistake.   It did not foresee that it would

 5   produce this kind of -- this kind of payment.

 6                And in order to rectify the mistake, the FTC

 7   comes in and brings in a new interpretation of antitrust

 8   law that did not exist before, just to make up for the

 9   mistake that Hatch-Waxman made, even though Congress has

10   tried to cover its tracks in later amendments, right,

11   which -- which deter these, these -- these payments.

12                MR. STEWART:         Congress has tried to reduce

13   the incentives for these payments to be made.                    I mean -

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:            So why should we overturn

15   understood antitrust laws just to -- just to patch up a

16   mistake that Hatch-Waxman made?

17                MR. STEWART:         Well, a couple things I would

18   say.   First, I don't think we're -- we're not asking you

19   to overturn established antitrust laws.                    To take along

20   analogy, for example, if Watson instead of developing a

21   generic equivalent to AndroGel, had developed an

22   entirely new drug that it believed would be better than

23   AndroGel for the same conditions and if Solvay had paid

24   Watson not to seek FDA approval and not to seek -- to

25   market the drug, I think everyone would agree that that

                                      11

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   was a per se antitrust violation, even though Watson's

 2   ultimate ability to market the new drug would depend on

 3   FDA approval that might or might not be granted.

 4                  And so when we say it's unlawful to buy off

 5   uncertain competition, it's unlawful to buy out

 6   competition, even when the competition might have been

 7   prevented by other means, we are just enforcing standard

 8   antitrust principles.

 9                  To focus on the distinction between

10   Hatch-Waxman and other patent litigation, Professor

11   Hovenkamp's conclusion is that the reason that you don't

12   see payments like this in the normal patent infringement

13   suit is that in the typical market if a patentholder

14   were known to have paid a large sum of money to a

15   competitor who had been making a challenge to the

16   patent, if other competitors knew that that had

17   happened, then they would perceive that to be a sign

18   that the patent was weak and that they would leap in.

19                  But he says Hatch-Waxman makes it more

20   difficult for that to be done because Hatch-Waxman gives

21   unique incentives to the first paragraph 4 filer.

22                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Is that the 18 -- the

23   18-month rule primarily?

24                  MR. STEWART:         It's a 180-day period of

25   exclusivity.

                                        12

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Right.       I mean 180 days,

 2   yes.

 3                  MR. STEWART:         Yes, and the way it works is

 4   that the exclusivity period is not good in and of itself

 5   for consumers.     That is, during the period when one

 6   generic is on the market and the others are not yet

 7   allowed to compete, you have essentially duopoly

 8   conditions, the price of the -- the drug drops but only

 9   by a little bit.

10                  Congress granted the 180-day exclusivity

11   period because it wanted generics to have ample

12   incentives to challenge patents that were perceived to

13   be weak.

14                  And if the first filer is able essentially

15   to be bought off, is able to set settle for something

16   other than early entry into the marketplace, then other

17   potential competitors face barriers to entry that

19   other industries.

20                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, that doesn't mean

21   that -- that's rather thin.               I don't know how -- I don't

22   have the ability to assess that, the significance of it,

23   empirically.     The thing I wonder, therefore, you said

24   it's common in antitrust?

 1   field, but I know there's an existence of something

 2   called the per se rule, let's price fix it.

 3               I know there's a rule of reason, and I know

 4   there's a sort of vague area that sometimes in some

 5   cases that Justice Souter mentioned in California

 6   Dental, there is something slightly in between, which as

 7   I saw those cases, they're very much like price fixing

 8   or -- or agreements not to enter.

 9               And what they seem to say is, Judge, pay

10   attention to the department when it says that these are

11   very often can be anticompetitive, and ask the defendant

12   why he's doing it.

13               I mean, is that what you want us to say?            It

14   didn't seem in your briefs as if you were.            If you were

15   asking us to produce some kind of structure -- I don't

16   mean to be pejorative, but it's rigid -- a whole set of

17   complex per se burden of proof rules that I have never

18   seen in other antitrust cases, I -- my question is, when

19   I say I've never seen anything like this before in terms

20   of procedure, I want you to refer me to a case that will

21   show, oh, no, I'm out of date.

22               MR. STEWART:         Well, the -- the Court has

23   recognized such a thing as the quick look approach, but

24   I think even though the case didn't use the term "quick

25   look," I don't believe it did, NCAA v. Regents of

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:            And are there others?

 4                 MR. STEWART:         Well, that's the -- that's the

 5   one I'm most familiar with.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Is there any other?     Are

 7   you familiar with any other?               Because I want to be sure

 8   I read all of them.

 9                 MR. STEWART:         I'll need to look back and see

10   what -

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, if there are few or

12   none, then I would say, why isn't the government

13   satisfied with an opinion of this Court that says, yes,

14   there can be serious anticompetitive effects.                 Yes,

15   sometimes there are business justifications, so Judge,

16   keep that in mind.     Ask him why he has this agreement,

17   ask him what his justification is, and see if there's a

18   less restrictive alternative.

19                 In other words, it's up to the district

20   court, as in many complex cases, to structure their case

21   with advice from the attorneys.

22                 MR. STEWART:         I think that would leave

 1   factors would be appropriate -

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            The same thing is

 3   appropriate as is appropriate in any antitrust case.

 4   Are there anticompetitive effects?

 5                 I have 32 briefs here that explain very

 6   clearly what you said in a sentence.                    It may be that

 7   they're simply dividing the monopoly profit.                    I

 8   understand that -- you know, I can take that in and so

 9   can every judge in the country.                  And what's complicated

10   about that.

11                 And then I have some very nice dark green

12   briefs that clearly say, four instances, maybe five,

13   where there would be offsetting justifications.                     I think

14   they can get that, too.

15                 MR. STEWART:         Well, certainly our proposed

16   approach accounts for that.              It provides -- it provides

17   really two different forms of rebuttal.                    First our

18   approach says, this is on its face an agreement not to

19   compete, the generic has agreed to stay out of the

20   market for a defined period of time, and the payment

21   gives rise to an inference that the agree -- that the

22   delay that the generic has agreed to is longer than the

23   period that would otherwise reflect its best assessment

24   of its likelihood of -- of success in the lawsuit.

25                 But then we say, there are basically two

                                       16

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   different types of ways in which the presumption could

 2   be rebutted.     First, the parties can show that the

 3   payment was not in consideration for delay, that there

 4   was some other commensurate value transferred, and the

 5   payment -- and that arrangement would have been entered

 6   into even without the larger settlement.

 7                  And then second, we're at least accepting

 8   the possibility that brand names and generics could come

 9   in and say, even though our payment was for delay, even

10   though we can't identify anything else that the payment

11   could have been consideration for, it's still, quote,

12   "competitive" under -

13                  JUSTICE BREYER:            And they mention at least

14   two others.     The first one they mention is because the

15   person's already in the market thinks that the next year

16   or two or three years is worth $100 million a year, and

17   the person who's suing thinks it's worth 30 million a

18   year.   And so he says, hey, I have a great idea, I'll

19   give him the 30 million and keep the 70.                 And -- and

20   that, I don't see why that's anticompetitive if that's

21   what's going on.

22                  And the second instance they bring up is

23   that it's very hard to break into a market.                 So for the

24   new generic to come in, he's thinking, giving me two

25   years isn't worth much because I'll spend a lot of

                                        17

 1   money, it's very hard for me to do it.                    But the

 2   defendant -- the defendant who wants this patent kept

 3   intact says, I will not only let -- I'll let you in a

 4   year earlier and I'll give you enough money so that you

 5   can start up a distribution system.                    The second seems

 6   procompetitive, the first, neutral.

 7                The problem of deciding whether other

 8   matters are or are not really payments for something

 9   else, a true nightmare when you start talking about five

10   drugs and different distribution systems and the matter

11   of whether you're paying for litigation costs, a matter

12   of great debate for the judge.                Okay, that's the

13   arguments that they make.           Go ahead.

14                MR. STEWART:         Let me say a couple of things

15   about the administrative nightmare.                    The first is that

16   to the extent that these inquiries are difficult,

17   they're difficult only by -- because the brand names and

18   the generics have made them difficult by tacking on

19   additional transactions to their settlement proposal.

20                And to take an analogy, there are government

21   ethics rules that say that -- what are called prohibited

22   sources.   Basically, people who have business before the

23   department can't give me gifts as a government employee.

24   Now, obviously, it would be absurd to have a rule that

25   said a prohibited source couldn't give me a Rolex watch,

                                      18

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   but could sell me a Rolex watch for a dollar.           And so

 2   the ethics rules treat as a gift an exchange for value

 3   in which fair market value is not paid.

 4                 And everybody understands that once you go

 5   down that route, occasionally, you will have hard cases

 6   in which people could legitimately agree, was this a

 7   legitimate arm's length exchange or was it a concealed

 8   gift?   But the prospect of those difficult cases doesn't

 9   mean that we get rid of a gift ban altogether.

10                 And certainly, Federal employees couldn't

11   bring the -- the ethics office to its knees by engaging

12   in such a proliferation of these side deals that the

13   ethics office decided it's not worth it.

14                 The second thing is that Respondent's

15   approach would apply even when there are no hard

16   questions.    Respondents would say that even if the

17   agreement provides for delayed generic entry until the

18   date the patent expires, and even if the only other term

19   of the agreement is the brand name pays the generic a

20   lot of money, that that would be a legitimate agreement

21   because the restriction would apply to arguably patented

22   drugs and it wouldn't extend beyond the date of patent

23   expiration.

24                 I guess the -- the other thing I would say

25   about the way in which these payments can facilitate

                                       19

 1   settlement really shows their anticompetitive potential.

 2   That is, suppose the parties were negotiating for a

 3   compromise date of entry, but they couldn't agree.

 4   The -- the brand name said beginning of 2017 is the

 5   earliest we'll let you in and the generic said beginning

 6   of 2015 is the latest date that we would accept.

 7                 Now, the Respondents use the term "bridge

 8   the gap," but there's obviously no way that a payment

 9   from the brand name to the generic could enable the

10   parties to agree on an entry date between 2015 and 2017.

11                 The brand name is never going to say, well,

12   I would insist on holding out until 2017, but if I'm

13   going to pay you a whole lot of money, then I'll let you

14   earlier and accept a -- a diminution of your profits.

15   The brand name is going to say, if I pay you money, I'm

16   going to insist on deferring entry even later than the

17   2017 date that would otherwise be my preferred

18   compromise.

19                 So the natural effect of these payments is

20   not to facilitate a -- a bridging the gap in the sense

21   of a picking of a point between the dates that the

22   parties would otherwise insist on.                      It is going -- it is

23   very likely to cause the parties to agree to an entry

24   date that's even later than the one the brand name would

25   otherwise find acceptable.

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Mr. Stewart, can we go

 2   back to Justice Breyer's question -- initial question.

 3   It's rare that we find a per se antitrust violation.

 4   Most situations we put it into rule of reason.

 5                You seem to be arguing that this is price

 6   fixing, a reverse payment like price fixing so that it

 7   has to fall into something greater than the rule of

 8   reason.

 9                MR. STEWART:          Not -- not price fixing, but

10   it's -- it's an agreement not to compete.                 That is, the

11   parties are not agreeing as to the prices they will

12   charge.   The generic is agreeing to stay off the market

13   first.    But that would be treated as per se -

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                But why is the rule of

15   reason so bad?   As an -- and that's really my bottom

16   line because you're creating all -- I think that's what

17   Justice Breyer was saying.              I mean, for -- for example,

18   I have difficult under -- understanding why the mere

19   existence of a reverse payment is presumptively gives -

20   changes the burden from the Plaintiff.

21                It would seem to me that you have to bear

22   the burden -- the burden of proving that the payment for

23   services or the value given was too high.                 I don't know

24   why it has to shift to the other side.

25                MR. STEWART:          Now, if you wanted to tweak

                                       21

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the theory in that way and to say that in cases where

 2   there is not just a payment and an agreement on the date

 3   of market entry, but there is additional consideration

 4   exchanged beside, if you wanted to say that the

 5   Plaintiff would bear the burden of showing that this was

 6   not a fair exchange for value.                 That -- that's not

 7   something we would agree with, but that would be a

 8   fairly minor tweak to our theory.

 9               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 So answer the more

10   fundamental question, why is the rule of reason so bad?

11               MR. STEWART:           The rule -- I mean, it's bad

12   for reasons both of administrability and it's bad

13   conceptually.    The reason it's bad for reasons of

14   administrability is that -- at least I take what you are

15   proposing to be that the antitrust court would consider

16   all the factors that might bear on the assessment of the

17   agreement, that those would include presumably a

18   strength of the patent claim, the subjective -

19               JUSTICE BREYER:              No.       No.   I mean, Professor

20   Areeda, who is at least in my mind a minor deity in the

21   matter, in this area, if not major, he explains it.                    He

22   says don't try for more precision than you can give.

23   The quality of proof required should vary with the

24   circumstances.

25               Do you know how long it took -- I mean, and

                                       22

 1   I -- of course, I -- I know a little bit of antitrust.

 2   But I mean, I think -- do you know how long it takes to

 3   take in your basic argument that these sometimes can be

 4   a division of profit, monopoly profit?                 It takes

 5   probably 3 minutes or less.             And judges can do that.

 6                So you say to the judge, Judge, this is

 7   what's relevant here.       And there's a rule of evidence,

 8   don't waste the jury's time.

 9                So -- so you shape the case as -- and this

10   is what goes -- used to go on for 40 years.                 You shape

11   the case in light of the considerations that are

12   actually relevant, useful, and provable in respect to

13   that case.   And district judges, that's their job.

14   So -- so what -- I'm not saying you'd lose the case.

15   They didn't side with the Eleventh Circuit.                 They said

16   there's no violation, okay?

17                I've got your point on that.                But -- but I'm

18   worried about creating some kind of administrative

19   monster.

20                MR. STEWART:         It's not atypical -- I mean -

21   and the Court did this in NCAA, for example, where it

22   said that the agreement it was looking at, which dealt

23   with the allegation of -- of -- allocation of rights to

24   televised football games was essentially a limitation on

25   output, and the Court said those are presumptively

                                      23

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   unlawful.   Long experience in the market has shown that

 2   they are suspect.

 3                The Court didn't say there was long

 4   experience in the market for television rights to

 5   football.   It just said output limitations have been

 6   established as disfavored.

 7                Nevertheless, because competitive sports by

 8   nature require a degree of cooperation between the

 9   people who compete against each other -- to establish

10   the rules of the game and so forth -- we will look to

11   see whether the parties have identified -- whether the

12   defendants have identified anything about their specific

13   industry that would justify our decision not to apply

14   the usual presumption, and it concluded that there was

15   nothing there.

16                And we're really asking the Court to take

17   the same approach here.           We're saying payments not to

18   compete are generally disfavored.                        The parties can -

19   when you have a Hatch-Waxman settlement, in which money

20   is passing from the brand name to the generic, it's an

21   unusual settlement to begin with because there's no way

22   that the suit could have culminated in the generic

23   receiving a money judgment.

24                And therefore, we'll -- we'll look upon this

25   with suspicion, but we'll give the parties adequate

 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY I. WEINBERGER

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 9                  MR. WEINBERGER:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may

10   it please the Court:

11                  I'd like to first respond to a question that

12   was asked of my friend by Justice Scalia a few minutes

13   ago.   He was asked if there were any cases in which the

14   Court has ever found a restraint outside the scope of

15   the patent to be unlawful, and the answer to that

16   question is no.

17                  That -- all of the cases that have found

18   violations of the antitrust laws based on a patent-based

19   restraint do so because the object of the agreement, the

20   restraint that's being achieved in the agreement, is

21   beyond the scope that could be legitimately achieved

22   with a patent.

 2   go beyond what a patent can protect.

 3               Every -- every case in which -

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  Why isn't this then?

 5   Meaning there is no presumption of infringement.

 6   There's no presumption that the item that someone else

 7   is going to sell necessarily infringes.

 8               MR. WEINBERGER:               That's correct.

 9               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  And so what you're

10   arguing is that in fact a settlement of an infringement

11   action is now creating that presumption.

12               MR. WEINBERGER:               No, Justice Sotomayor, I'm

13   not arguing that.     But -- but I do want to say that I

14   think our patent system depends upon the notion that you

15   don't evaluate from the anti -- the perspective of the

16   antitrust laws a patent restraint based upon whether you

17   could have proved in a litigation that that patent -

18   that the patent was infringed.

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  I don't know, but I

20   don't know why we would be required to accept that there

21   has or would be infringement by the product that has

22   voluntarily decided not to pursue its rights.

23               MR. WEINBERGER:               I think you're

24   not -- you're not accepting infringement.                  What you're

25   doing is recognizing there's a reasonable basis to

                                        26

 1   assert the patent, a bona fide, reasonable dispute, and

 2   the parties have the ability to settle the dispute.

 3                 Just as if the party -- if someone was

 4   entering into a license agreement with -- with someone

 5   who had a product that they claimed did not infringe the

 6   patent, they sat down, negotiated a license and resolved

 7   it -

 8                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               But there, you'd know

 9   that they're not sharing the profits.

10                 MR. WEINBERGER:            Yes.

11                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Meaning there you know

12   that a -- a product's been licensed and the -- that's

13   normal.    The infringer is now paying the other side

14   money to sell that product.

15                 MR. WEINBERGER:            But, Justice Sotomayor,

16   many other -

17                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               A reverse payment

18   suggests something different, that they're sharing

19   profits.

20                 I don't know what else you can conclude.

21                 MR. WEINBERGER:            Many license -- I don't

22   think that's correct, and that's because many license

23   disputes are, in fact, resolved by the -- the alleged

24   infringer exiting the market for a period of time, or

25   agreeing to stay off until a certain time.

                                       27

 1               And then the license -

 2               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                But not many for reverse

 3   payments.

 4               MR. WEINBERGER:             Yes, they are because -

 5   because, for example, it could be a license agreement

 6   where the infringer agrees to stay off the market for X

 7   number of years, and when it comes on it pays a certain

 8   royalty.

 9               Now, anybody could argue that that royalty,

10   if it were higher, could result in an earlier entry.

11   There's always an argument to be made with any delayed

12   entry situation that monopoly profits are shared.

13   That's just -- just inherent in the nature of it.

14               And if you take the FTC's argument to its

15   full force, it would mean that any situation where

16   anyone is agreeing to a delayed entry, and there's any

17   other value that's being exchanged in that situation,

18   that in effect in economic terms is a payment for

19   delayed entry.   There's no difference.

20               JUSTICE BREYER:             Yes.           But there, it's

21   not -- their point is not it's per se unlawful.                      What

22   they want is they want to cut some kind of line between

23   a per se rule and the kitchen sink.                      And if you look at

24   the brief supporting you, it is the kitchen sink.                        You

25   have economists attacking the patent system or praising

                                      28

 1   it, da, da, da, and here and there and the other.             They

 2   don't want the kitchen sink.

 3                Now, suppose I don't want the kitchen sink,

 4   but I have a hard time saying what the per se rule is.

 5   So what's your idea?

 6                MR. WEINBERGER:            I -- I've obviously given a

 7   lot of thought to whether there is any kind of an

 8   intermediary test that works and I don't believe there

 9   is.   Let me explain why.

10                First, you can't really measure whether

11   there were any anticompetitive effects from such a

12   settlement agreement without determining what would have

13   happened if the case hadn't settled and it would have

14   been litigated.   And if the patentee had won the

15   litigation, then there would be no anticompetitive

16   effects.

17                That's what the Second Circuit and the

18   Federal Circuit concluded in applying the rule of reason

19   test, and saying the first condition of such a test has

20   not been met because there's no demonstration of

21   anticompetitive effects.

22                And the cases -- both of those cases are

23   very good illustrations of what I'm talking about.

24   Those were the Tamoxifen and Cipro cases, where the

25   parties agreed to so-called reverse payment settlements

                                      29

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that FTC would say are basically per se lawful.

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Would it -- would it help

 3   if you were -- were thinking about rules and caps, to

 4   consider not what the branded company would have -

 5   would have made, but what the generic company would have

 6   lost?   And -- and use the latter as the limit?

 7                 MR. WEINBERGER:            Well, you really don't know

 8   unless you can assume when they could have entered -

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, you -- you have to

10   make an extrapolation, yes.

11                 MR. WEINBERGER:            Well, because it all

12   depends on what would have happened in the patent

13   litigation.    So that you can't really tell whether

14   there's any anticompetitive effect.

15                 I should also say with respect to the

16   generic losing, there's really no risk to the generic

17   here, which is one of the reasons you see these

18   settlements, that in this industry -

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, if the generic wins,

20   though, its -- everybody's profits are lower.               And you

21   can gear it to just what the -- what the generic would

22   have made.

23                 MR. WEINBERGER:            They're -- they're lower

24   than they would be under some other situation, but -

25   but the patent gave the patentholder the legal right to

                                       30

 1   exclude.     So unless there's a reason, there's some

 2   reason to believe that it couldn't reasonably assert

 3   that patent, it's entitled to monopoly profits for the

 4   whole duration of the patent.

 5                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Weinberger, can I just

 6   understand what you're saying, and maybe do it through a

 7   hypothetical.

 8                  MR. WEINBERGER:            Certainly.

 9                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Suppose you had a -- a

10   lawsuit and the generic sends the brand name

11   manufacturer an e-mail and the e-mail says, we have this

12   lawsuit, I think I have about a 50 percent chance of

13   winning.

14                  If I win, I take your -- your monopoly

15   profits down from 100 million to $10 million.               Wouldn't

16   it be a good thing if you just gave me 25 million?                All

17   right?     And then the brand name sends an e-mail back,

18   says -- you know, that seems like a pretty good idea, so

19   I'll give you 25 million.

20                  Now, as I understand it, your argument is, I

21   mean, that's just fine.           That's hunky dory.

22                  MR. WEINBERGER:            Well, what I'm saying is

23   that in -- in any given situation -

24                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Is that fine?

25                  MR. WEINBERGER:            I -- I think that if the -

                                        31

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   if it's a single situation and the evidence is that

 2   there's a reasonable basis to assert that patent and in

 3   truth, the patent has, which you say, has a 50/50 chance

 4   of prevailing, then I think that there could be a

 5   settlement like that, if it's in good faith.

 6                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Even though -- but what if

 7   it isn't in good faith?         It's clear what's going on here

 8   is that they're splitting monopoly profits and the

 9   person who's going to be injured are all the consumers

10   out there.

11                MR. WEINBERGER:            Any -- any situation in

12   which there's any -- in any patent dispute in which

13   there's a tradeoff, like the examples I mentioned

14   before, time for value, could -- that argument could be

15   made.

16                And, in fact, if that was true, if it was

17   true that the natural inference and the motivations of

18   the people were simply to divide these profits with no

19   other consideration, then what you'd expect to see is

20   that every single patent dispute, would, especially in

21   Hatch-Waxman, would result in a settlement that just

22   pays the generic until the end of the patent because

23   after all, the market would be -

24                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, Mr. Weinberger, I

25   think if we give you the rule that you're suggesting we

                                      32

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   give you, that is going to be the outcome because this

 2   is going to be the incentive of both the generic and the

 3   brand name manufacturer in every single case is to split

 4   monopoly profits in this way to the detriment of all

 5   consumers.

 6                 MR. WEINBERGER:             Let me address that, Your

 7   Honor.     I don't think that's realistic at all because -

 8   and let's take this industry specifically, that the

 9   ability to challenge a patent in this industry is lower

10   than any industry that I can think of, and that's

11   because a generic is given the right to certify against

12   the patent and then basically challenge the patent

13   without having actually developed the product, gotten a

14   marketing force, gotten a factory, putting the product

15   on sale and taking the risk that everyone else who

16   challenges a patent has to take.

17                 All they have to do is -- is file an ANDA,

18   which is roughly 300,000 to $1 million for these size

19   drugs, that's not a lot, and certify it.                 And the FTC's

20   own studies have shown that it takes a very small chance

21   of winning, something like 4 percent for a drug over

22   $130 billion to justify a generic suing a brand name

23   company.

24                 And what happens -- so what happens in these

25   cases -

 1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Is that in all cases or

 2   just Hatch-Waxman cases?

 3               MR. WEINBERGER:             It's Hatch-Waxman cases.

 4   It's because of -

 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Because it does skew the

 6   dynamics a lot.

 7               MR. WEINBERGER:             Yes.

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                You know, the Second

 9   Circuit recognized, even though it accepted your scope

10   of the patent, that there was a troubling dynamic in

11   what you're arguing, which is that the less sound the

12   patent, the more you're going to hurt consumers because

13   those are the cases where the payoff, the sharing of

14   profits is the greatest inducement for the patentholder.

15               MR. WEINBERGER:             The Second Circuit

16   recognized that, but then they said further -- upon

17   further reflection, further consideration of this, we

18   are not troubled by it.

19               One of the reasons they were not troubled,

20   it's what I was trying to answer Justice Kagan about, is

21   because the reality of the situation is with so many

22   potential challengers to the patent, all they have to do

23   is file an ANDA, there are 200 generic companies in this

24   industry, that if you try to adopt that strategy of

25   paying the profits of a generic, there's going to be a

                                      34

 1   long line of -

 2                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay.          Suppose -

 3                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, I don't think that

 4   that's true, Mr. Weinberger, and it's because of

 5   something that Justice Scalia suggested, that there's a

 6   kind of glitch in Hatch-Waxman.                   And the glitch is that

 7   the 180 days goes to the first filer.

 8                  And once the 180-day first filer is bought

 9   off, nobody else has the incentive to do this.

10                  MR. WEINBERGER:            That's clearly not correct

11   either by logic or by reference to actual experience.

12   It's true that the first filer is given a greater

13   incentive, but these products can last for 20 or

14   25 years.

15                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            But the -- the huge

16   percentage of the profits is done in the exclusivity

17   period.     I mean, it's true that it can go on for a long

18   time, but you're making dribs and drabs of money for a

19   long time.     Where you're really making your money is in

20   the 180 days.

21                  MR. WEINBERGER:            Experience doesn't show

22   that because if you look at Hatch-Waxman litigation,

23   we've cited in -- in the red brief and it's been

24   discussed by the antitrust economists and the Generic

25   Pharmaceutical Association in their amicus brief, that

                                        35

 1   many of these Hatch-Waxman cases involve multiple

 2   filers.

 3               You have 5, 10, as many as 16 companies

 4   challenging these patents, all of -- one of whom are not

 5   the first filer.   So there -- there must be an incentive

 6   for them to do this, and -- and they are.                      So I think

 7   experience says that that kind of extreme view of

 8   incentives is not really true.

 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:               What -- what do we look at

10   to verify what you say?          Is that -- is that all in the

11   briefs?

12               MR. WEINBERGER:              Yes, it's in the -- in the

13   Solvay brief.   I don't have the page -

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Because I had thought, as

15   Justice Kagan's question might indicate, that the

16   180 days is crucial, it allows you to go to the doctors,

17   to give them the name of your generic equivalent, et

18   cetera, and that that's a big advantage.

19               MR. WEINBERGER:              It's a big advantage -

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:               And now, you're -- now,

21   you're indicating that it isn't.

22               MR. WEINBERGER:              It's a big advantage.            It's

23   an incentive for the first six months, I don't debate

24   that, but after that, the market opens up.

25               JUSTICE BREYER:              Okay.          Suppose -- this

 1   sounds like an argument, a discussion that you have in

 2   the district court, so -- so why -- what's your reaction

 3   to this.   Say A, sometimes these settlements can be very

 4   anticompetitive, dividing monopoly profit.                  In deciding

 5   whether anticompetitive outweighs business practices

 6   without less restrictive alternatives, judge, you may

 7   take that into account.            Two, do not take into account

 8   the strength of a patent.             Three, do not try to

 9   relitigate the patent.

10                  Four, there are several possible

11   justifications, ones I listed before out of the briefs,

12   litigation costs -- the other products, different

13   assessments of -- of value.               Five, there could be, in

14   fact, no anticompetitive effect here because of what you

15   just said now in response to Justice Kennedy and Justice

16   Kagan, but there could be.               We don't know.     Okay?

17                  So start with where we were.               Could be

18   anticompetitive.        Give the defense a chance to go

19   through five, one through five, and if they convince you

20   there is a six, we're not saying there isn't, but we

21   can't think of one on the briefs, let them have the

22   sixth, too.     Okay?     Now, judge, weigh and decide.

23   That's what we do.        So we've structured it somewhat to

24   keep the kitchen sink out on the basis of the briefs

25   given to us.     What's wrong with that?

 1               MR. WEINBERGER:             Well, I think the first

 2   problem with it is that it's -- it's very unpredictable.

 3   It's really hard to figure out how that all gets sorted

 4   out, and the parties who are sitting down to do a

 5   settlement need, I feel, much clearer guidance -

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:             You can't -- you can't

 7   possibly figure it out, can you, without assessing the

 8   strength of the patent?

 9               MR. WEINBERGER:             That's right.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Isn't that crucial to -- to

11   the conclusion?

12               MR. WEINBERGER:             I -- I believe that the

13   only thing that brought -

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:             And to say you can consider

15   every other factor other than the strength of the patent

16   is -- is to leave -- leave out the -- the elephant in

17   the room.

18               MR. WEINBERGER:             I agree with that,

19   Justice Scalia.   I don't think that an alternative

20   test -- the only alternative test that could be

21   fashioned that would -- that would make sense is one

22   based on strength of the patent.

23               But there are so many reasons that that is

24   an undesirable result that I -- I don't think it's the

25   way this Court should go.

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               For whom?     And -- and -

 2   you know, the government is basically saying, we really

 3   don't want reverse payments, period.                   We want people to

 4   settle this the way they should settle it, which is on

 5   the strength of the patent.             And that means settling it

 6   simply by either paying a royalty for use or settling as

 7   most cases do, on an early entry alone, so there's no

 8   sharing of -- of -- of profits.                 What's so bad about

 9   that?

10                I mean, it doesn't deprive either side of

11   the ability to finish the litigation if they want to.

12                MR. WEINBERGER:            Let's say -- I wouldn't

13   concede that most cases settle like that.                   But let's -

14   let's accept that and take the case of a -- of a strong

15   patent or a patent with a long term.                   Let's say

16   it has -- you evaluate the strength of the patent and

17   you conclude that it has 10 or 15 good years remaining.

18                Now, you have a generic who is -- or many

19   generics who have sued with no risk or minimal risk in

20   Hatch-Waxman, and their response is, why would I -- why

21   would I drop this lawsuit to get an entry date in 2025

22   or 2028?   That doesn't meet my business needs, I have

23   shareholders, I have investors, I have to run a

24   business, and I'm going to keep on litigating unless you

25   give me something of value.

 1                So that's what these agreements are about.

 2   They're saying, well, what other -- remember, this is

 3   not just a cash payment.          There are all -

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, in the normal

 5   course, if the patent's really strong, if you get a year

 6   or two earlier entry, that has an inherent value, and

 7   that's what you'll pay for is what the government is

 8   saying.   That will be the determination the two parties

 9   will make, which is at what point is earlier entry worth

10   it -

11                MR. KATZ:      Well, first of all -

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               -- for the very strong

13   patentholder.

14                MR. WEINBERGER:            First of all, parties often

15   don't agree on the merits.             Parties tend to be

16   overconfident.   They both think they are going to win.

17   So it's sometimes very hard to come to a consensus where

18   entry date is the only bargaining chip available.

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, they pointed to

20   most settlements and say that is the vast majority.

21                MR. WEINBERGER:            I don't know where the

22   evidence would be for that.             I don't think -

23                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, we do know that

24   these reverse payments, except for recent times when

25   people figured out they were so valuable, were the

                                      40

 1   exception, not the rule.

 2                 MR. WEINBERGER:             Actually, we have ten years

 3   of experience since the circuit courts first began

 4   applying scope-of-the-patent tests to these settlements

 5   since 2003.     So we have a pretty good window as to what

 6   would happen.

 7                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                They have been

 8   increasing in number, not decreasing.

 9                 MR. WEINBERGER:             No, I think they have been

10   actually very steady.         They are roughly between 25 and

11   30 percent, pretty much constant and you don't really

12   see any huge blips depending on what a particular court

13   is ruling.

14                 If the FTC's kind of

15   the-sky-is-going-to-fall approach is right, that

16   everybody's going to run out and do this, you would have

17   thought that after the first Eleventh Circuit ruling,

18   after the Federal Circuit ruling, after the Second

19   Circuit ruling, after second Eleventh Circuit ruling,

20   that there would be huge increases in this, but we

21   haven't seen that.

22                 Some of the numbers increased last year, but

23   as a percentage of the total settlements they are very

24   steady.   They are pretty much the same.

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:               What about the

 1   consideration that seems to be driving the government?

 2   That is, the generic is getting an offer that they would

 3   never get on the street.            I mean, they have been paid

 4   much more than they would get if they won the patent

 5   infringement suit.

 6                  If they won the patent infringement suit,

 7   then they can sell their generic in competition with the

 8   brand.     But under this agreement they get more than they

 9   would get by winning the lawsuit.

10                  MR. WEINBERGER:            Justice Ginsburg, first of

11   all, every settlement agreement involving one of these

12   cases must be filed with the FTC.                        They have hundreds of

13   them.     And they haven't pointed to a single example

14   where that's the case.

15                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            But it's just an economic -

16                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, suppose -- suppose

17   that hypothetical is correct.                 That's was my concerns,

18   too.     What the brand company can lose is much greater

19   than what the generic can make.                   So why don't you just

20   put a cap on what the generic can make and then we won't

21   have a real concern with the restraint of trade, or

22   we'll have a lesser concern.                I think that's the thrust

23   of Justice Ginsburg's question and it's my concern as

24   well.

25                  MR. WEINBERGER:            Yes, and I want to make

                                        42

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   clear that I don't think that could happen because if a

 2   brand name company adopted that as a strategy to protect

 3   its patent, it would -- it would be held up.                It would

 4   be held up by the many generic companies that could

 5   easily challenge these patents without actually having a

 6   manufactured product, without putting it on sale, et

 7   cetera.

 8               So I think that the antitrust rule should

 9   not be fashioned to deal with a case on the extreme,

10   which hasn't been shown to happen, which logically from

11   an economic point of view is highly unlikely to happen.

12   And if for some reason that starts happening

13   empirically, then Congress -- and it is a loophole in

14   Hatch-Waxman that is causing that, and there is really

15   no evidence that that extreme example has happened -

16   then Congress can deal with it, just as it dealt with

17   the exclusivity provision.

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I thought the government

19   was telling us that that's this case, that the -- what

20   the generic is being offered in the way of sharing the

21   monopoly profits is more than it could ever make if it

22   wanted to and sold its drug.

23               MR. WEINBERGER:            Well, I don't see any

24   examples of that cited in their brief.                It's a theory,

25   it's a hypothetical theory, but there is no data.                We

                                     43

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   have had years of experience with this case.

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, but it's not

 3   hypothetical that if the generic wins everybody -- the

 4   brand companies profits are going to go way, way down

 5   right away and generic profits are not going to be that

 6   great.

 7                 MR. WEINBERGER:            Of course.      I think that's

 8   true in many -- many patent litigations.

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, but so then the

10   question still holds.        If you -- if you key your payment

11   to what the brand company will make, it's just a much

12   higher figure, and a greater danger of unreasonable

13   restraint.

14                 MR. WEINBERGER:            There is that hypothetical

15   risk.    What I'm -- I am trying to make the point that

16   it's not -- with the number of challenges you have here,

17   which is basically unlimited, that if you put a sign

18   around your neck that says, paying off all generic

19   companies their profits, whoever wants to challenge my

20   patent come do it, there is going to be a long line of

21   people, of companies doing it.

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Okay, I will grant you

23   that point that the 180 days is not that big a

24   difference, and that there are many generics out there.

25   But isn't that true in every industry?                  You said at the

                                       44

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   outset, oh, well, now in the drug industry there are a

 2   lot of people ready to pounce in.                        Isn't that true in

 3   any industry?

 4                MR. WEINBERGER:              It is true and that's why

 5   it doesn't happen.      It's -- it's more true here because

 6   it's much easier to challenge a patent.                        So in any other

 7   industry a potential challenger has to make a major

 8   investment in a product, has to get it manufactured, has

 9   to put it on sale, and then litigate.                        And if they lose,

10   they are going to be liable for enormous damages.

11                That's not the case under Hatch-Waxman.                          All

12   they need to do is file an ANDA.                    They have nothing at

13   risk.   If they lose, they haven't lost any damages.

14   They just walk away.        So there is an enormous difference

15   in the risks between Hatch-Waxman and other cases that

16   explains the particular form of some of these

17   settlements and why they happen.

18                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                 I see that as an

19   argument that there is an economic reality in

20   Hatch-Waxman that would require us not to apply any rule

21   we choose or accept here to other situations, only here.

22   That's the argument that you're creating for me, that

23   there's a different economic reality here that requires

24   a different rule.

25                MR. WEINBERGER:              Justice Sotomayor, I think

                                        45

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the economic reality cuts the other way.                 It doesn't cut

 2   in favor of making a rule that makes these more

 3   difficult.    What I'm saying is that -

 4                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Oh, but it does because

 5   in Hatch-Waxman Congress decided that there was a

 6   benefit for generics entering without suffering a

 7   potential loss to enter the market more quickly.

 8                 MR. WEINBERGER:            Justice Sotomayor, I don't

 9   think the legislation -

10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               And any settlement in

11   these cases deprives consumers of the potential of

12   having the benefit of an earlier entry.

13                 MR. WEINBERGER:            I don't believe there is

14   anything in Hatch-Waxman that supports the idea that the

15   purpose was to provide for generic entry prior to patent

16   expiration.    What the structure is designed to do is

17   encourage challenges because -

18                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Exactly, and what you

19   are doing with permitting settlements of this kind is

20   not permitting the process to go to conclusion.

21                 MR. WEINBERGER:            I don't think there is

22   anything in Hatch-Waxman that suggests, in any way, that

23   settlements or -- should be discouraged or that cases

24   should be mandated to proceed to judgment or that all

25   have to be litigated.

 1                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               It's encouraging

 2   infringement suits.

 3                  MR. WEINBERGER:            It's encouraging challenges

 4   and it has produced many challenges.                     And I can say -

 5   can say that with 10 years of the application of the

 6   scope-of-the-patent rule, there is no particular problem

 7   with Hatch-Waxman.      It's working very well.                The

 8   amount -- the number of drugs that have now gone generic

 9   from just ten years ago to today has increased

10   enormously.

11                  JUSTICE BREYER:            So why does it help you to

12   say, if the Court says or the FTC says when you get one

13   of these suits you can settle it by letting them in, but

14   you can't pay them money.             That that will help to stop

15   strike suits.     It costs them nothing to get in.                   They

16   have to really want to enter or they won't bring

17   lawsuits.     So why does that hurt you?

18                  MR. WEINBERGER:            Well, I actually think that

19   you raise a point that the generic -- in some of the

20   amicus briefs, some of the generic parties have talked

21   about, which is that their ability to challenge these

22   cases depends on their not having to litigate every one

23   of them to conclusion.          And that's not bad because most

24   patent cases settle.        Most -- most of these disputes

25   settle.     And if our system was one in which every case

                                        47

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   had to be litigated fully to judgment, it -- we would be

 2   unable to cope with that.

 3                 So -- so what I think the statute mandates

 4   or contemplates is that generics should be able to

 5   challenge, and should have strong incentive to

 6   challenge, but that doesn't mean that they should be

 7   required to litigate to conclusion.                      And if settlement

 8   is made more difficult, so that different perceptions or

 9   different business objectives can't be bridged with some

10   kind of a business settlement, that is going to mean

11   that fewer generics are going to challenge these patents

12   and that is contrary to the purpose of the Hatch-Waxman

13   Act.

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I think it's correct that

15   to develop a new drug sometimes you need not just

16   scientists and attorneys, you need investment bankers.

17   And you then need marketers because the cost of these

18   drugs can be hundreds of millions.                      Is there anything in

19   the record that shows the development cost of this drug?

20                 MR. WEINBERGER:            This particular drug, I

21   don't know.    I mean, there are lots of studies of how

22   much average drugs cost, and that figure is over a

23   billion dollars.

24                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             It can be a billion.

25                 MR. WEINBERGER:            Easily a billion dollars.

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Anything in this case?

 2               MR. WEINBERGER:            This particular drug -

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Anything in the record?

 4               MR. WEINBERGER:            No, because we are on a

 5   12(b)(6) motion on a motion to dismiss, so none of that

 6   was really developed, but -

 7               JUSTICE KAGAN:            I'm sorry, go ahead.

 8               MR. WEINBERGER:            But I was just going to say

 9   that the -- of course, any given drug development cost

10   doesn't even begin to tell the picture because for every

11   drug that succeeds, there are at least 10 that fail, and

12   all the costs that are involved in the drugs that fail

13   have to be covered with the one drug that succeeds.

14               JUSTICE KAGAN:            Could I just make sure I

15   understand the way the 180-day period worked?             The first

16   filer gets it, if I buy off -- if I'm a brand name

17   manufacturer and I buy off the first filer with one of

18   these reverse payments, you're suggesting that that's

19   not going to do me much good because they're all going

20   to be -- there's going to be a long line.             And that long

21   line of people, it's not just that they don't get the

22   180-day period, it's like even if one of those people

23   wins, the person whom I've paid off is going to get the

24   180-day exclusivity period, isn't that right?

25               MR. WEINBERGER:            Not completely.   First of

                                     49

 1   all, it depends on the -- the agreement.                 For example,

 2   in this case, that 180-day exclusivity was waived.

 3                JUSTICE KAGAN:            But if it's not waived by

 4   the parties, in other words, it's just like I don't get

 5   it so my incentives go down.              It's that my competitor

 6   gets it.   So why in the world am I standing in line

 7   to -- to challenge this if my competitor is going to get

 8   the exclusive period?

 9                MR. WEINBERGER:            This was the exact problem

10   that Congress addressed in 2003, when it amended

11   Hatch-Waxman and changed the exclusivity requirements.

12   So the way the law now reads is that subsequent

13   generics, subsequent filers can trigger that 180-day

14   exclusivity by continuing to litigate.                 So if the first

15   filer settles and these other folks are in line and

16   they're litigating, they can force that period to start

17   running and then they can come in right after.                 So it is

18   not correct that you can tie up the first filer in

19   settlement and prevent everybody else from entering.

20                And even before that amendment, the Eleventh

21   Circuit, Federal circuit in the Second, applying the

22   scope of the patent rule recognized that if the

23   agreement creates a bottleneck to other filers that goes

24   beyond what the statutory exclusivity provides, where

25   they agree not to give up their exclusivity or agree to

                                      50

 1   retain it, then that's beyond the scope of the patent.

 2   Because you can't achieve that kind of a restraint

 3   simply -- with a patent, you -- you're using the

 4   agreement to expand upon your patent rights to block

 5   other filers.

 6                 So I think that problem's been addressed by

 7   Congress.    And if somebody feels that solution's not

 8   perfect and they want to make it even easier for

 9   subsequent filers to come in, then I submit that

10   Congress can do that.        That they -

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Well, what was the change

12   that was made?

13                 MR. WEINBERGER:            The change that was made,

14   Justice Ginsburg, is that -- there were a number of

15   changes, but the one that's relevant here is that if

16   a -- if a subsequent filer -- strike that.

17                 You can trigger the exclusivity beginning to

18   run by getting the judgment.               So in the past, if a first

19   filer settled and they just didn't do anything -- may I

20   finish the -

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Yes, certainly.

22                 MR. WEINBERGER:            And they just didn't do

23   anything, that would prevent other generics from coming

24   to market.    But now anybody else who's litigating the

25   patent, if they go ahead and win their case, then

                                       51

 1   that -- that triggers the first filer's rights and if

 2   they don't exercise that -- those rights within 75 days,

 3   they're gone, they're forfeited.                 So that's the change.

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

 5               MR. WEINBERGER:            Thank you.

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Mr. Stewart, you

 7   have five minutes remaining.

 8               MR. WEINBERGER:            Thank you, Your Honor.

 9            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

10                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11               MR. STEWART:         Thank you.

12               Mr. Weinberger argued that in order to

13   determine whether a settlement of this sort has

14   anticompetitive effects, we would have to know how the

15   lawsuit would have turned out, but it's perhaps the most

16   fundamental principle of antitrust law that particular

17   conduct can be legal or illegal, depending on the

18   deliberative process that led up to it.

19               And to put that in concrete terms, if a

20   business charges a particular price for a particular

21   product because it's made the assessment that this will

22   maximize profits in a competitive environment, that

23   decision is almost immune from antitrust scrutiny.                       But

24   if the business charges the same price for the same

25   product in the same market because it's agreed with its

                                     52

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   competitor that it will charge that price, that's a per

 2   se antitrust violation.

 3               So it's not at all anomalous to say that

 4   this type of agreement can be deemed anticompetitive,

 5   even though the same result, namely, exclusion of the

 6   generic from the market might have been able to be

 7   obtained by other means.

 8               The second thing is, Mr. Weinberger said

 9   there are instances in which second and successive

10   filers will attempt to challenge the brand name even

11   after the first filer has been bought off.                     I think

12   we -- we disagree that it's as easy as he would say it

13   is, but we'll concede it happens occasionally.                     But the

14   fact that particular anticompetitive conduct doesn't

15   always work doesn't make it lawful.

16               It could often happen that two firms were

17   thinking about entering into a price-fixing agreement,

18   for instance, but thought to themselves, if we do that,

19   there's a third competitor in the market who will be

20   able to undersell us, and this would make our agreement

21   unprofitable.   And it might happen sometimes that two

22   firms try to proceed with a price-fixing conspiracy, but

23   they're thwarted because of the unexpected competition

24   from a third firm.

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     Well, I thought that

                                      53

 1   Mr. Weinberger's point was that this is always going to

 2   happen because it's very easy -- as he said, you put a

 3   sign on your neck saying, generics line up to get your

 4   payment.   That seems quite different than saying there's

 5   another firm out there in the abstract that -- that

 6   might want to enter into a similar market sharing

 7   arrangement.     This is a very different system.

 8                  MR. STEWART:         I mean, first, there certainly

 9   is no evidence suggesting that it has happened often,

10   although there is evidence that it has happened.                    But if

11   the brand name perceived on a systemic basis that the

12   likely result of paying off one competitor was that

13   another competitor would step in and couldn't be bought

14   off would litigate the suit to judgment, there would be

15   no incentive to make the reverse payment in the first

16   place.

17                  That is, in making the reverse payment, what

18   the -- the brand name is attempting to purchase is

19   protection from the possibility that it will have its

20   patent invalidated, and it will suffer a large

21   competitive advantage.          If a brand name thinks in a

22   particular instance there is somebody else who's going

23   to expose it to -- me to that risk, the -- the payment

24   wouldn't be expected to be made.                    So at least -

25                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            And what's your

 1   understanding of why there would not be a long line in

 2   some cases or in many cases?

 3                  MR. STEWART:         I think for the reasons

 4   that -- that your question suggested, that there is the

 5   180-day exclusivity period and leaving aside the cases

 6   in which that is waived, subsequent manufacturers would

 7   realize not only that they wouldn't get that period of

 8   heightened profits themselves, but they would have to

 9   wait in line for others, and they might focus their

10   attention on other patents that were perceived to be

11   weak as to which they could hope to -- to get the

12   180-day exclusivity contract.

13                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            And is there anything to

14   show what I think Justice Kennedy asked -- you know, how

15   much of one's profits comes from the 180-day period as

16   opposed to what happens after that?

17                  MR. STEWART:         I know it is the great

18   majority, I don't have a percentage figure.               And the

19   reason, as I indicated earlier, was that during the

20   180-day exclusivity period, you have only two

21   competitors.     Basically, a biopoly arrangement.            And my

22   understanding is that the generics would usually charge

23   around 80 to 85 percent of the brand name's price during

24   that period.     And after there is full competition, the

25   price would drop to a fraction of that.

                                        55

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               The next thing I would say is that our

 2   system encourages settlement, but not to the nth degree.

 3   And so for instance, if you had two -- two firms

 4   fighting over a million dollars and each firm decided

 5   internally, 600,000 is the least I will accept.                     If they

 6   stuck to their guns, the case couldn't be settled.

 7               Now, if the public could be made to kick in

 8   an additional 200,000, then each of the firms could get

 9   its 600,000 and walk away content.                     But we don't pursue

10   the policy in favor of settlement to that degree.                     But

11   that's essentially what's happening here.                     The -- the

12   way these payments facilitate settlement is by inducing

13   the generics to agree to a later entry date by

14   increasing the total pool of profits that are available

15   to the two firms combined and thereby maximizing the

16   likelihood that each firm will find its own share of the

17   profit satisfactory.

18               And the last thing I would say is I think

19   everyone who comes to this issue recognized that there

20   is a conundrum.   Our natural instinct is to compare the

21   settlement to the expected outcome of litigation.                     But

22   everyone also recognizes that it just isn't feasible to

23   try the patent suit.

24               And, therefore, our approach focuses on

25   whether the competitive process has been preserved.
