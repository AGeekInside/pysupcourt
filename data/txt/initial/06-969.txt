 5   Commission versus Wisconsin Right to Life, and Case

 8              ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT

 9      ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION

10               GENERAL CLEMENT:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may

11   it please the Court:

12               In McConnell against FEC this Court upheld

13   Title II's restrictions on electioneering communications

14   by unions and corporations against facial attack.                In

15   doing so, this Court reviewed a voluminous record and

16   concluded that the vast majority of the ads that had

17   been run in previous cycles and came within the

18   statutory definition could constitutionally be regulated

19   by Congress.   Accordingly, this Court rejected the

20   overbreadth challenge and upheld the statute on it face.

21   To be sure, the last time this case was before the Court

22   the Court made clear that nothing in McConnell

23   foreclosed an opportunity for as-applied challenges to

24   the statute and the Court remanded the case for that

25   purpose.   But to be consistent with McConnell's


                                        3

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   overbreadth decision, any as-applied challenge cannot

 2   have the effect of calling into question a substantial

 3   percentage of the statute's applications.                Yet the

 4   district court's decision below has precisely that

 5   forbidden effect.

 6              There is nothing atypical about the three

 7   ads that are before this Court.               Indeed, they closely

 8   resemble the Jane Doe hypothetical ads that this Court

 9   identified at page 127 as the prototype of ads that,

10   although they took the form of issue ads, nonetheless

11   were functionally equivalent to express advocacy.

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Maybe we were wrong last

13   time.

14              GENERAL CLEMENT:               Well, Justice Scalia, I

15   don't think you were wrong, and I suppose that obviously

16   you thought the rest of the Court was wrong in

17   McConnell, and if the Court wants to reconsider that

18   decision -- I mean, that's an option the Court can take

19   in the appropriate case.

20              I would suggest that this is not the

21   appropriate case for a number of reasons, not the least

22   of which is that I think it was briefed in this case

23   really as something of an afterthought, not as a

24   principal focus of the briefing.                In the McConnell case

25   this Court, as you well remember, had an unbelievably


                                         4

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   exhaustive record before it in making a judgment about

 2   the facial constitutionality of the law.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, we didn't have a

 4   concrete case such as this one, in which the assertions

 5   of the other side are very appealing as far as the

 6   rights of citizens to band together for an issue ad,

 7   even an issue ad that names somebody who's up for

 8   election within, within 90 days.               We didn't that have

 9   appealing case before us.          Now that we have it before us

10   and now that you tell us that this is a typical case,

11   maybe we were wrong about the overbreadth challenge

12   before.

13                GENERAL CLEMENT:           With respect, I don't

14   think you were.   And although you didn't have this case

15   before you, you had many, many concrete cases before you

16   that are really indistinguishable from this case.                 You

17   had the --

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                How are we supposed

19   to decide whether this case -- if you think it's

20   important to our resolution, how are we supposed to

21   decide whether this particular case is typical or not?

22                GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well, I guess it's hard

23   for me to say how you would decide whether it's typical.

24   I'm not sure that's the question.

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I think it's very


                                        5

 1   hard to determine.      Therefore, I think it's hard to

 2   determine in the abstract whether its inconsistent with

 3   the conclusion in McConnell that a vast majority of the

 4   cases would not be covered or if it's inconsistent with

 5   it.

 6              GENERAL CLEMENT:                Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

 7   let me try to come at it this way, which is to say I

 8   would have thought that if you're not going to overturn

 9   McConnell, you're just going to apply it and say, well,

10   what kind of as-applied challenges are left, I would

11   have thought that what you would have in mind is ads

12   that had an identifiable characteristic that marked them

13   as being outside of the mainstream and somehow different

14   from most of the ads.        And so --

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    That gets back to my

16   same question:   How do we know that this is or is not

17   outside the mainstream.          We have just the three ads that

18   are at issue here.      It's not as if we have a survey of

19   all the ads that are run during the blackout periods in

20   particular election cycles.               How do we tell whether this

21   is within the mainstream or not?

22              GENERAL CLEMENT:               One strong indicator that

23   these are in the mainstream is how close they are to the

24   Jane Doe hypothetical that this Court identified as the

25   prototype of the kind of ads that, although they took


                                          6

 1   the form of issue ads, they looked like issue ads, they

 2   really were indistinguishable from and the functional

 3   equivalent of express advocacy.

 4              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              General Clement, that

 5   Jane Doe ad was in the record last time.                 They were

 6   others, weren't there, the issue ads?

 7              GENERAL CLEMENT:             There were hundreds.         I

 8   mean, as you well remember, there were hundreds of ads

 9   in the record.   And this Court was able to draw

10   conclusions about them both by looking at some of the

11   specifics, but also looking at the forest, if you will.

12   One of the things they recognized, for example, is that

13   these ads weren't turning up uniformly wherever issues

14   were being debated.     These ads turning up in the close

15   elections, in the close races.              And there was --

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Counsel, the Court

17   in McConnell used the term, as you've used it this

18   morning, "vast majority."          What is that?         Is 70 percent

19   a vast majority, so that 30 percent of the ads are going

20   to be outside of that and would be candidates for this

21   as-applied challenge?

22              GENERAL CLEMENT:             No, no, Mr. Chief Justice,

23   because the Court used "vast majority," and I mean, that

24   could mean 70 percent, it could mean 80 percent, it

25   could mean 90 percent.       Equally importantly, on page 207


                                        7

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   of the opinion, when it was specifically addressing

 2   overbreadth, it made the argument, it made the

 3   conclusion, that both in absolute and relative terms

 4   this statute was not substantially overbroad.

 5              And it seems to me then at a minimum for any

 6   as-applied challenge to be consistent with that

 7   overbreadth determination, it can't have the effect of

 8   opening up the statute wide open such that on a going

 9   forward basis the majority, certainly a substantial

10   number, percentage, inconsistent with an overbreadth

11   holding, of the ads that would be run by unions and

12   corporations within the last 60 days of the election

13   would qualify for the exception.              That just seems

14   inconsistent with the overbreadth holding.

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, did that statement

16   refer only to issue ads, or did it refer to all ads?

17              GENERAL CLEMENT:             It referred to all ads

18   that would come within the statutory prohibition.

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Right, and here we are

20   dealing with a subset of all ads and that is issue ads.

21   So that statement doesn't necessarily speak to whether,

22   you know, a vast majority of all issue ads have to be --

23              GENERAL CLEMENT:             But with respect,

24   Justice Scalia, there were so many issue ads in the

25   record in McConnell that if issue ads were an


                                       8

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   appropriate category for as-applied challenges, it would

 2   have been impossible for this Court to reject the

 3   overbreadth burden.

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:             I don't know if that's so.

 5   So long as that statement applied to the totality of

 6   ads, many of which were ads just directed at defeating

 7   particular candidates, I don't see how you can see that

 8   we're bound by that statement.

 9                GENERAL CLEMENT:             Well, Justice Scalia, the

10   only other obvious candidate that we could carve out

11   would be express advocacy.           And the Court was clear in

12   footnote 18 of the opinion what percentage that was, 4

13   to 5 percent.    So as to the 95 percent of the ads that

14   didn't engage in express advocacy, this Court still had

15   no difficulty concluding that the vast majority of them

16   were within Congress' conception of the purposes of the4

17   statute --

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Everything that is not

19   express advocacy is an issue ad?                The world is divided

20   into express advocacy and issue ads?

21                GENERAL CLEMENT:             That's one way to divide

22   it.    You're using the term "issue ad."

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:             I wouldn't divide it that

24   way.   I would think there are a lot of express advocacy

25   ads.   I think there are a lot of non-express advocacy

 1   ads that are not issue ads.

 2                GENERAL CLEMENT:            Justice Scalia, you're use

 3   the term "issue ad" as if it's self-defining.                     I don't

 4   view it that way.    And I mean, even Appellee has tried

 5   to narrow it to grassroots lobbying.                     Now, of course

 6   there's a problem with the grassroots lobbying argument

 7   and that is it was made to this Court in McConnell, and

 8   at that time the nature of the argument wasn't, oh,

 9   grassroots lobbying, that's a sort of idiosyncratic or

10   atypical application that would give rise to a narrow

11   as-applied exception.

12                No, the argument there, and a great

13   illustration is Appellee's national affiliate, National

14   Right to Life.   At pages 6 and 7 of the reply brief in

15   McConnell, they argued about grassroots lobbying and

16   said, boy, this statute applies to grassroots lobbying,

17   therefore it's substantially overbroad.

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You're suggesting

19   the district court decision is not consistent with

20   McConnell.   But it seems that your approach today is

21   inconsistent with our decision last year that you can

22   have as-applied challenges.             You're suggesting that if

23   we allow this as-applied challenge to go forward that we

24   have to facially strike down the section.

25                GENERAL CLEMENT:            Oh, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm

 1   not saying that.   My point is that not all as-applied

 2   challenges are created equal.

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So tell me what one,

 4   an ad that would succeed in an as-applied challenge

 5   looks like, or what the standard would be that we would

 6   apply in a way that you think would not call into

 7   question the decision in McConnell about Section 203?

 8               GENERAL CLEMENT:            Well, let me give you a

 9   couple of as -- I mean, look, my job is to defend the

10   constitutionality of the statute on its face and as

11   applied.   So I'm not suggesting that any of these

12   as-applied challenges would necessarily success or I

13   wouldn't be up here trying to make some argument in

14   defense of the statute.

15               But let me give you --

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What you're saying,

17   though, is if this as-applied challenge succeeds you're

18   saying the only way we can do that is if we think that

19   the statute is facially unconstitutional.                 I'm just

20   trying to see if there's a way of --

21               GENERAL CLEMENT:            Sure.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 -- approaching this

23   as-applied challenge in a way that doesn't require us to

24   revisit that prior --

25               GENERAL CLEMENT:            Absolutely.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:           It doesn't your case, with

 2   me at least, for you to tell us that it is your job to

 3   say that no as-applied challenge will suffice.

 4                GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well then, let me give you

 5   an --

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I mean, that doesn't

 7   inspire me with confidence in what you're telling us.

 8                GENERAL CLEMENT:           Let me give you some

 9   inspirational as-applied challenges that would be better

10   as-applied challenges than this one.                    A challenge by a

11   501(c)(3) corporation that has difficulty separating up

12   a separate segregated fund.            Much better as-applied

13   challenge.   The challenge that was brought in the Maine

14   case that you have before you in another -- in another

15   petition or another appeal, that was a challenge to an

16   ad that was run in an unopposed primary.                    That starts to

17   sound like a pretty good as-applied challenge.

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:           No.     There is -- there is a

19   claim here that there -- that there was difficulty in

20   setting, setting up a fund in time to do what had to be

21   done with respect to this issue, which was a distinctive

22   issue that had come up and they said we didn't have time

23   to set up a - a - a - a separate PAC that, that would

24   effectively meet the problem.             Why isn't that

25   distinctive enough?

 1                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           With respect,

 2   Justice Scalia, it would be a better case if that were

 3   the claim.    There's no doubt that appellee has a, a PAC,

 4   a separate segregated fund.             To their claim isn't that

 5   they didn't have one.       Their claim is it was underfunded

 6   vis a vis what it would cost to fund these ads.                     But

 7   that itself is clearly a conscious decision, because if

 8   you look at how much money they had in their PAC in

 9   2000, they had 155,000 or something like that in their

10   PAC.   Plenty to pay for this ad.               This time around they

11   had 13,000.    Now why is that?            It's pretty clear from

12   the record that they shifted their emphasis not to

13   getting money for their PAC, but to get money in their

14   general corporate treasury to fund these ads.                  And so

15   they raised 300 million dollars in corporate funds.                       But

16   that's not hat doesn't make this a good as-applied

17   challenge.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Can I, can I

19   understand you to suggest we ought to draw a distinction

20   in as-applied challenges between a 501(c)(3)

21   organization and a corporation?

22                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           I think --

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That is not a

24   501(3)(3) corporation?

25                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           I think, I think a

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   501(c)(3) corporation has a much better as-applied

 2   challenge if they can bring it.               And that's the

 3   as-applied challenge that's sort of been discussed in

 4   some of the amicus briefs.           The problem is Appellee is

 5   not in a position to do that, because they are a

 6   501(c)(4) corporation.        Another example of a better

 7   challenge would be the Chief Justice's hypothetical from

 8   the earlier argument which would be a corporation that

 9   runs a series of ads and then wants to continue to run

10   them during the election cycle.

11                Well, that's not guilty this case, but it

12   well could be.    The filibuster issue isn't something

13   that came like a bolt out of the blue on the eve of the

14   election.    Throughout 2003, there were filibusters in

15   the Senate on a pretty regular basis.

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            We all -- we all know --

17   maybe -- I think, I think it's accepted, that the public

18   only tunes in to the political dialogue shortly before

19   the election.    That's the time in which you -- in which

20   you reach the public.       So the fact that the filibuster

21   has been going on for a long time is -- I don't think

22   answers the question as to how speech can be the most

23   effective.

24                GENERAL CLEMENT:            Well, Justice Kennedy, I

25   don't see -- you may be right that certainly people do

 1   tend to focus on issues in the context of an election.

 2   But I think the record in this case does not bear out

 3   the conclusion that people only care about them at those

 4   times or that groups don't bother running ads at other

 5   times.   I mean if you look at the 2005 time frame, the

 6   record reflects that a number of groups, not Appellee,

 7   but a number of groups had issue ads addressing the

 8   filibuster issue.    And what's interesting about that to

 9   me is if you look at joint appendix 45 and 46 for the

10   examples they were able to do it in terms of tag line,

11   "Earth, call the Senate."           And if, if Appellee had run

12   those same ads which would capture the issue, then they

13   wouldn't even have come within the statute.              So it does

14   illustrate both that this is an issue that drew enough

15   public interest to generate ads at different time

16   periods, not just in the reelection context, and even

17   when did it that, it was possible to engage on the issue

18   without coming within the confines of the statute.              So

19   it just seems like --

20

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Are, are there frequent

22   issues -- instances in the political process, do you

23   think, in which the public runs an ad against a, a

24   candidate knowing the candidate is probably going to win

25   anyway, he or she is from a safe district, or it's very


                                        15

 1   difficult.     But they want to run the ad anyway in order

 2   to affect his conduct or her conduct once they're

 3   reelected, so that they'll take a different position, a

 4   second look.

 5                GENERAL CLEMENT:             Justice Kennedy --

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             It -- it seems to me

 7   logically that's possible.            I just don't know if that,

 8   if that happens very often.

 9                GENERAL CLEMENT:             Justice Kennedy, it's

10   certainly possible.       I don't think it's common, though.

11   And the reason I say that is just to go back to the

12   record in McConnell, the one thing the record there made

13   pretty clear is when you got to the period 60 days

14   before the election, these ads were not being ran in a

15   way that would have some random distribution that you

16   might expect if they were just interested in the issues

17   or just interested uniformly in all reelections.               These

18   ads were really concentrated in the close districts.              I

19   mean one of the lines that stick out in my mind from the

20   record is in trying to fund money for these so-called

21   issue ads, the Club for Growth executives said "we need

22   money for these issue ads because they make all the

23   difference in close elections."

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well now -- but -- yes, it

25   may make the difference in a close election but it is

 1   also, it is also likely to be more effective with regard

 2   to the Senator that you -- whose vote you want on the

 3   issue.   Are you, are you going to waste your, waste your

 4   money in, in those districts where the Senator is not

 5   going to vote the way you want no matter what?                 The

 6   situation you pose is precisely the one where you would

 7   want your issue ad to run.

 8                GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well, Justice Scalia, if

 9   your point is that there may be an interest in trying to

10   leverage the upcoming election to get somebody's

11   attention --

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Of course.

13                GENERAL CLEMENT:           -- I think --

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:           To get the Senator's

15   attention.

16                GENERAL CLEMENT:           Sure.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:           The Senator who is, who is

18   at risk is likely, is likely to listen.                 The Senator who

19   has a safe seat is not.

20                GENERAL CLEMENT:           No doubt that's true.        But

21   I think it also implicates the, the interests of

22   Congress in the statute that this Court recognized and

23   upheld on its face.     When, when the whole point is,

24   we're not just interested in this issue in the abstract,

25   and we're not running this issue just because there's a

 1   pending vote in Congress; we're interested in running

 2   this ad because it's a pretty effective vehicle both to

 3   defeat this candidate's reelection chances, but if we

 4   don't succeed on that maybe we'll convince him to change

 5   his mind.

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           You can't tell which of the

 7   two they had in mind.       Whether they wanted the Senator

 8   defeated or they wanted to put enough pressure on the

 9   Senator that he would change his vote with regard to the

10   filibuster.    I would think that the latter is more

11   likely the motive than the former.                  And why do you

12   assume the worst?

13                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well -- I don't know, the

14   fact that by the time they ran these ads Senator

15   Feingold voted 20 times out of 20 to filibuster suggests

16   to me that they probably concluded that the best to get

17   a Wisconsin Senator who wouldn't filibuster was to

18   change senators not to change to change Senator

19   Feingold's mind.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The relevance of this

21   same group having a poll strongly opposed Feingold every

22   time he ran for election.           It's no secret that they were

23   opposed to his candidacy.

24                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           No.      That's absolutely

25   right, Justice Ginsburg.          And obviously the statute

 1   itself in its bright line test doesn't make you get into

 2   those kind of inquiries.           But if their claim, if they

 3   come into court and say well, we had a pure heart; we

 4   didn't have an intent to affect the election --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But this is -- this is the

 6   First Amendment.     We don't make people guess whether

 7   their speech is going to be allowed by Big Brother or

 8   not.   If you are going to cut off the speech, there

 9   ought to be a clear line.            Not whether -- whether I, I

10   had ads against Feingold in the past or whether Feingold

11   voted 20 times against this or, or half of the time

12   against this.     It seems to me you need a clear First

13   Amendment line.     And you're not giving us any.

14                 GENERAL CLEMENT:            Sure I am, Justice Scalia.

15   I'm giving you the statute, on its face, which couldn't

16   be clearer.     If you want to have as-applied exceptions,

17   if you want to go down the road, to quote the Chief

18   Justice in dissent in MCFL, of creating "barely

19   adumbrated exceptions," you may inject some vagueness.

20   Now that may be necessary.            And there may be as-applied

21   challenges out there that do the trick without creating

22   vagueness.    But I don't think this is the one.            And just

23   because the first as-applied challenge you see is a

24   problematic one doesn't mean this aren't better

25   as-applied challenges out there.

 1              If I could reserve the balance of my time.

 3   General Clement.

 4              Mr. Waxman.

 5              ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN,

 6      ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, ET AL.

 7              MR. WAXMAN:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 8   please the Court.

 9              I'd like to -- I'd like to address three

10   points that came up at the earlier part of the argument.

11   First of all, I'd like to, I think just with respect

12   correct a premise of one of Justice Scalia's questions.

13   Then I would like to address the two questions that I

14   think I heard the Chief Justice ask, which is how do we

15   know that the this is an atypical ad, and what would the

16   standard -- what standard would a court apply in

17   adjudicating as-applied challenges?

18              And then finally, assuming there's time

19   permitting I'd like to address the question of why we

20   shouldn't revisit McConnell which I think was posed both

21   by the Chief Justice and by Justice Scalia.

22              First, as to the premise, Justice Scalia,

23   and it relates to what the predicate was of the now

24   famous vast majority reference.               I'm quoting from --

25   it's entirely clear from this Court's opinion and I


                                        20
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   believe it's on page 207 that the referent was issue

 2   ads.   In fact, what this Court said was the precise

 3   percentage of issue ads that clearly identified a

 4   candidate and were aired during those relatively brief

 5   pre-election time spans but had no electioneering

 6   purpose is a matter of dispute between the parties and

 7   among the judges on the district court.                 Nevertheless,

 8   the "vast majority" of ads clearly had such a purpose.

 9               Chief Justice ROBERTS:                 Is that, is that

10   your test, if it has any electioneering purpose?

11               MR. WAXMAN:        We think the test is whether or

12   not it is as this Court indicated, I think, whether it's

13   the functional equivalent of express advocacy.                It

14   doesn't use the magic words but does it have the same

15   effect, that is, the test that this Court should -- not

16   this Court, a district court adjudicating an as-applied

17   challenge that is based on the content of the ad not the

18   sort of as-applied challenge brought in MCFL or Brown

19   versus the Socialist Workers Parties that relate to the

20   nature of the speaker, but one that's based on the

21   content requires the challenger to show okay, in a

22   context of a statute that is facially valid and can

23   constitutionally be applied to the vast majority of ads

24   that are covered by the definition of electioneering

25   communications, he needs to come in and show that with

 1   respect to this ad, it has characteristics such that no

 2   reasonable voter could view it as promoting, attacking,

 3   supporting or opposing a candidate.

 4              Chief Justice ROBERTS:                    Do we, do we usually

 5   place the burden when we're applying strict scrutiny

 6   under the First Amendment on the challenger to prove

 7   that they're allowed to speak, as opposed to the

 8   Government to prove -- to carry the burden that they can

 9   censor the speech?

10              MR. WAXMAN:           Well, you -- I think the rule

11   is quite clear that you never do that.                    This strict

12   scrutiny clearly applies here.                But in the context of

13   a -- the application of a statute that has already been

14   upheld as facially constitutional in the vast majority

15   of applications, the Government doesn't have the burden

16   of reconvincing the district court the -- what the --

17   the very things that the Supreme Court has already

18   decided.

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:               That vast majority thing,

20   is that a -- was that the holding of the case?                    I mean

21   --

22              MR. WAXMAN:           It --

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Every -- every -- every

24   word that we it uttered in that prior case is law?                      I

25   mean, what if -- am I free to think -- is the lower

 1   court free to think that maybe it is really not the vast

 2   majority?   But just because we said vast majority, it is

 3   like writing it into the statute?

 4               MR. WAXMAN:          It's -- well, we would have an

 5   awful lot of laws if everything you wrote constituted

 6   law and a holding.

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Yeah.

 8               MR. WAXMAN:          But that statement and a

 9   statement that follows shortly after it on the following

10   page were essential to this Court's decision that

11   applying the strictest possible scrutiny, this law was

12   very narrowly tailored.

13               JUSTICE ALITO:            But the test as to any ad is

14   whether any reasonable person could view the ad as -- as

15   an electioneering ad?

16               MR. WAXMAN:          I think -- well, an

17   electioneering ad, Justice Alito, I think puts too much

18   of a burden on it.

19               JUSTICE ALITO:            Any reasonable person could

20   view it as what?

21               MR. WAXMAN:          I think that what a district

22   court would say is could a reasonable voter in the

23   targeted electorate have understood that this ad was in

24   part promoting, attacking, supporting, or opposing?

 1               JUSTICE ALITO:          The same group has long had

 2   ads on a particular issue, and let's say a particular

 3   candidate's position on the issue is very well known to

 4   people who pay attention to public affairs.                     And let's

 5   say we're in the black out period and now important vote

 6   is coming up on Congress on that very issue.                     If the

 7   group continues to run the ad on that issue, that -- a

 8   reasonable person could view that as, as saying

 9   something about the election, couldn't it?                     Couldn't

10   that person?

11               MR. WAXMAN:        I, I would think so.               If it --

12               JUSTICE ALITO:          That would be prohibited?

13               MR. WAXMAN:        Well, it would depend, as your

14   question suggests, on the context in which the ad is

15   run.   Now I want to make two points with respect to your

16   inquiry.   Number one, as this Court has reiterated,

17   we're not talking about a ban here.                     Any one of these

18   ads can be run so long as it is funded the same way that

19   the election law requires them all to be funded.                     That

20   is, with money that --

21               JUSTICE ALITO:          What do you -- what do you

22   make -- what do you make of the fact that there are so

23   many advocacy groups that say this is really

24   impractical?

25               MR. WAXMAN:        I -- I love it.               And I'm going

 1   to give you the ACLU as an example because many -- their

 2   brief is quite powerful.           They and the other amici who

 3   provide a growing table of amicus briefs every time this

 4   issue comes up, have never, ever, brought their own

 5   as-applied challenge, although those these groups are

 6   not shy to litigate when they think important rights are

 7   in effect.     They have been in the three years since this

 8   Court decided McConnell, and in the year since this

 9   Court made clear what I think we had assumed, which is

10   this statute is -- it is open season on as-applied

11   challenges.     There have been precisely two as as-applied

12   challenges brought, both brought by the counsel in this

13   case.     The ACLU's brief which is as representative as

14   any other says look at these ads that we've been running

15   about really important issues:                The war in Iraq,

16   Guantanamo, etcetera, etcetera, here is the text of the

17   ad.     If we had put onto a tag line of that ad, please

18   call Senator so and so and tell him no, we wouldn't be

19   allowed to do it.

20                 Well, you know what?               With one exception

21   that I'll explain in a minute, in its 90-year history,

22   the ACLU has never -- way before Bickler was passed,

23   even outside the 60-day period, they never put that line

24   on.     And you know why?      It's because they have pledged

25   to their members and to the public that they will not

 1   engage in electioneering of any sort.                      They are

 2   completely nonpartisan and they don't ever want to be

 3   understood to the contrary, and so they never utter

 4   those words.

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I think it's an

 6   important part of their exercise of First Amendment

 7   rights to petition their senators and congressmen, and

 8   to urge others to -- as in these ads -- contact your

 9   senators, contact your congressmen.                      Just because the

10   ACLU doesn't do that doesn't seem particularly pertinent

11   to me.

12                MR. WAXMAN:        Well, though, I mean, I think

13   it does demonstrate a few things.                 First of all, it is

14   entirely possible, as this Court reiterated in

15   McConnell, for the exact same message or an equally

16   effective message to be given at any particular time.

17   If the ACLU or the National Rifle Association or any of

18   the other groups that never wants to actually bring an

19   as-applied challenge but always wants to say oh no, no,

20   no, this is horrible, wants to run an ad, as this

21   Court has -- they can establish a separate segregated

22   fund.    And if they come in and convince a court that

23   that's impractical or impossible, maybe they get an

24   as-applied challenge.

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is this true of the NRA

 1   also?     Is it the case that they have never targeted, so

 2   to speak, a particular legislator?

 3                 MR. WAXMAN:        I don't think anybody would

 4   claim that.     Even the --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't think they would

 6   either.     Why pick on the ACLU?

 7                 MR. WAXMAN:        I'm not -- I wasn't -- I don't

 8   mean to pick on the ACLU.            I think highly of both

 9   organizations and many of the amici that are arrayed

10   against me.     The point is that I use the ACLU as an

11   example because the reason they never put, they never

12   name a congressman is because they don't want their ads

13   to be perceived as breaking faith with what they tell

14   the public.

15                 As for the NRA, the NRA actually did bring a

16   challenge against the FEC in the D.C. Circuit and said,

17   "we don't really qualify under MCFL because we take some

18   corporate funds, but it's de minimis and we think that's

19   what the Supreme Court had in mind.                       You know what?

20   They won.     But they can't take yes for an answer.                       They

21   want to establish that this law is facially

22   unconstitutional.     And that does go to the point I

23   think, if I may, as to why -- well, it -- why you

24   shouldn't reexamine McConnell for first principles.

25                 But let me just say in response to your very

 1   first question, Mr. Chief Justice, that the reason that

 2   we know that this ad is typical is, as this Court

 3   created, articulated the paradigm of an electioneering

 4   communication, the test in the Jane Doe example, and

 5   this case is materially indistinguishable from the Jane

 6   Doe ad.   That is one that, quote, "condemns Jane Doe's

 7   record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to

 8   call Jane Doe."    Here we've got an ad that denounced

 9   the, quote, "group of Senators who had filibustered

10   judicial nominees" -- may I finish my sentence?

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Please.

12                 MR. WAXMAN:       The only thing that

13   distinguishes that statement from Jane Doe is knowing

14   that Senator Feingold was part of that group, and

15   reasonable listeners in the context of the ad itself and

16   the web site would certainly have known that.                    Thank

17   you.

23                 MR. BOPP:     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

 1   that they are repudiating the very studies and expert

 2   witness testimony that this Court relied upon in

 3   recognizing a distinction between sham issue ads and

 4   genuine issue ads.      That was a methodology that the

 5   Government created and this Court relied upon.                    Now they

 6   are converting genuine issue ads which they identified

 7   in the record through their expert testimony and their

 8   studies.   These ads are contained in the joint appendix

 9   on pages 159 to 167.

10               Their expert based upon their studies

11   testified that these were genuine issue ads.                    Now they

12   refused to state, as they do here, refused to state a

13   test to determine what's a genuine ad.                    So we are left

14   trying to comply with this law and mount the as-applied

15   challenges that this Court said is available to us to

16   look at these ads and determine what essential features

17   there are of these ads.          And as I will explain further

18   later, these are grassroots lobbying ads of the type not

19   like Jane Doe or yellow tail, but as -- but exactly the

20   type of the PBA ad, for instance, which we have focused

21   on, which is on page 166 of the joint appendix.                    So in

22   these studies, and these experts, they only looked at

23   the text of these ads to determine whether they were

24   genuine or sham.

25               There was no testimony about the subjective


                                         29

 1   intent of the speaker.       There was no testimony about the

 2   particular groups who ran these ads on whether or not

 3   their PAC was supporting a particular candidate.             No

 4   expert in McConnell speculated about the possible effect

 5   of any particular ad to determine whether it was genuine

 6   or sham.

 7              JUSTICE BREYER:             How could you tell?   I

 8   rather liked the one --

 9              MR. BOPP:       I'm sorry?

10              JUSTICE BREYER:             I rather liked the one we

11   had before about Senator Faircloth, and his ad was,

12   Senator Faircloth is against the trial lawyers and their

13   efforts to increase liability laws, so write him.                Now,

14   testimony all over the place.             That is the advocacy

15   candidate ad of the century.            And you couldn't possibly

16   know that without having known that one of the parties

17   had spent millions trying to paint Faircloth's opponent,

18   Senator Edwards, as the creature of the trial lawyers,

19   that anyone -- that anyone in North Carolina knew it.

20   So they read those words and they understand precisely

21   what's at stake.   They're saying vote against Edwards,

22   vote for Faircloth.     You just tell me how anyone could

23   know such a thing without looking at the context.

24              MR. BOPP:       There was no testimony in

25   McConnell that that ad, it -- for those that determined


                                       30

 1   whether or not it was sham or genuine, that ad was sham

 2   or genuine, there was no testimony, no reference --

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:            I thought people offered to

 4   bring in such facts as -- there was a web site address

 5   here.   It says, indeed oddly, don't phone the Senator.

 6   Go look at the web site.         And if you look at that web

 7   site, it says defeat him, defeat him, defeat him.                 I

 8   mean, that sounds as if they have defeat in mind.

 9               So certainly, there are about four or five

10   things which they said to look at outside the four

11   corners.   So I'm not certain what it is in the law that

12   says that you only look to the four corners.                 I mean, I

13   read the opinion below.        Did you read it, by the way,

14   the 1,000-page opinion?        I bet you did, the 1,000-page

15   opinion of the district court?

16               MR. BOPP:      I did indeed.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:            Good.       Then you know like I

18   know, and it took me a week, and it probably took you

19   less, but you know what that record was like in the

20   case, don't you?

21               MR. BOPP:      Yes.

22               JUSTICE BREYER:            Thousands and thousands of

23   pages that as I read it, I drew one conclusion.                 The one

24   conclusion was if there's a law, and it's a good law

25   under the Constitution, if it is, that corporations and

 1   labor unions cannot give money to political campaigns.

 2   And if it is true, as it is true, that what political

 3   campaigns are about now is television.                    And if it is

 4   true, as it is true, that these are the single lion's

 5   share, the single best way to get somebody defeated or

 6   elected, then if you open the gates and say corporations

 7   and rich givers or whatever can contribute by writing

 8   these ads and paying for them, forget the first two

 9   premises.     Forget the rule that says corporations can't

10   contribute.

11                 Now, I put all that in front of you.                 It

12   seems to me what you're asking for is for us to overturn

13   McConnell and to say either in practice or in theory,

14   McCain-Feingold campaign finance law is

15   unconstitutional.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            You are asking for that

17   among other things, aren't you?

18                 MR. BOPP:      Well, if there's no workable test

19   --

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:            And you are asking for

21   nothing else.

22                 MR. BOPP:      If there is no workable test that

23   is reasonably ascertainable by small grassroots

24   organizations that separates genuine issue ads from sham

25   issue ads -- this Court in Ashcroft said you cannot

 1   throw out the protected speech in order to target

 2   unprotected speech.       And the line of argumentation that

 3   the Government is presenting simply ignores the fact

 4   that at least we have a dilemma, we have Congress in

 5   session during the blackout periods, voting on items.

 6   And we have in the First Amendment one of the four

 7   indispensable freedoms, your right to petition the

 8   Government.

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I agree with you it's

10   exactly as Justice Scalia said.               If we agree with you in

11   this case, good-bye McCain-Feingold.                     Maybe we should do

12   it up front.    That's what you advocate.                   Very well.

13   Would you address that?         Why should this Court only a

14   year or two after it upholds McCain-Feingold, accept a

15   position that either in fact or in theory overturns that

16   case?

17                 MR. BOPP:     Because facial upholdings can

18   only be sustained constitutionally if as-applied

19   challenges are adequate to protect the protected speech.

20   And this case demonstrates that that is probably

21   impossible.    It is certainly demonstrating that when the

22   Government has changed its criteria, it is using

23   criteria that it rejected previously now to say genuine

24   issue ads which we asked this Court to rely upon in

25   their testimony and studies as genuine issue ads, that

 1   they are repudiating those.

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why do you say that those

 3   issue ads are inconsistent with the Government's

 4   position here?

 5              MR. BOPP:      Well, because they --

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:            You haven't explained that.

 7   You're just --

 8              MR. BOPP:      Yes.        The Wisconsin Right to Life

 9   ads are in every material respect indistinguishable from

10   these six grassroots lobbying ads.

11              JUSTICE SOUTER:            You're taking this because,

12   in effect on a four corners facial criterion.

13              MR. BOPP:      Yes.

14              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But one of the issues in

15   this case is whether that is an appropriate methodology,

16   so will you address that?

17              MR. BOPP:      Well, this Court has consistently

18   rejected the idea of looking to, you know, outside the

19   message of the speaker such as subjective intent or --

20              JUSTICE SOUTER:            We're not talking about

21   subjective intent here.       We're talking about what

22   Justice Breyer raised a moment ago.

23              That is, we are looking for the public

24   political context in which the ad is run.                  He gave the

25   example of the Faircloth Edwards ads.                  Anyone in North

 1   Carolina knew what they meant.                 Someone in Idaho or New

 2   Hampshire probably did not, because they did not know

 3   the context.

 4                Your argument, seems to me is, ignore the

 5   context.    And my question is, why should we ignore --

 6   why should we do that?

 7                MR. BOPP:       Well, that test that has been

 8   articulated by the Government would invite ads to be

 9   prohibited based upon the varied understandings of the

10   listener, and that --

11                JUSTICE SOUTER:             But doesn't any

12   communication depend upon the understanding of the

13   listener?   Can we even sensibly talk about what a

14   statement means or an advertisement means without

15   understanding the context in terms of the listener's

16   understanding?

17                MR. BOPP:       You do that all the time based

18   upon the -- the test is, what do the words say?                 What

19   does the ad say?     What does the speech say?

20                JUSTICE SOUTER:             No.     The question is, what

21   do the words mean.

22                MR. BOPP:       Yes, what do they mean.

23                JUSTICE SOUTER:             And it is impossible to

24   know what the words mean without knowing the context in

25   which they are spoken.

 5   just -- just like the ads were.

 6              MR. BOPP:      There were two huge big studies

 7   on -- two in '98 and 2000, and there was absolutely no

 8   testimony about the --

 9              JUSTICE SOUTER:            My question is, why should

10   we ignore the context?      How can we tell what something

11   means without the context?

12              MR. BOPP:      Well, there is relevant context,

13   such as the person named, the incumbent is a candidate.

14   That would be a relevant context.               It is broadcast

15   within 60 days of a general election, in which he is a

16   candidate as well as a voting member of the Senate.

17   That would be context.

18              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But that -- those don't go

19   to meaning in the sense of, for example, the Faircloth

20   Edwards example does.     Why should we ignore the aspects

21   of context which determine meaning, i.e., the

22   understanding that a listener would have?

23              MR. BOPP:      Because it simply -- it would

24   prohibit all speech because no one would know in advance

25   whether or not there would be --

 1                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           You mean the people in

 2   North Carolina were unaware of the Edwards position,

 3   they were unaware of the distinction between Faircloth

 4   and Edwards?

 5                 MR. BOPP:     I have no idea.

 6                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Of course they knew that.

 7                 MR. BOPP:     I have no idea.

 8                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Of course they knew that.

 9   And just as presumably, you knew the position of Senator

10   Feingold in these advertisements, and the people in the

11   state knew because of your other -- because of your

12   other public statements.

13                 MR. BOPP:     Because of one or two press

14   releases?

15                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Why should those things be

16   ignored?

17                 MR. BOPP:     There's absolutely no evidence

18   that anyone in Wisconsin knew his position on the

19   filibuster.

20                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           You think they're dumb?

21                 MR. BOPP:     No.

22                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           You have a web site.   You

23   have a web site that calls their attention, and you

24   think nobody's going to it?

25                 MR. BOPP:     But we can't run the ads, we

 1   can't --

 2               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Nobody's paying attention

 3   to what the Senator is doing?

 4               MR. BOPP:      If we can't run the ads, we can't

 5   draw peoples attention to the web site.

 6               JUSTICE SOUTER:            You think the only source

 7   of information about Senator Feingold is your

 8   advertisement?

 9               MR. BOPP:      No, but I don't --

10               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Then if your advertisement

11   is not the sole source of information, then why do you

12   assume that no one in Wisconsin knows what the senator

13   has been doing when he votes.

14               MR. BOPP:      Look, polls show that a majority

15   of the people don't even know who the Vice President of

16   the United States is.      So to suggest that they know a

17   particular position --

18               JUSTICE SOUTER:            So your position is that we

19   ignore context because no one -- because the voters

20   aren't smart enough to have a context?

21               MR. BOPP:      No, that we be allowed to speak

22   so we can give that information to the voters.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:            But that's, that's the

24   point, because where I get into my chain.               You have an

25   argument.   I'm not denying that.              I understand it.   But

 1   it's sort for me deja vu all over again.                We've heard

 2   it.

 3               MR. BOPP:      Yes, but you said --

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:            And what happened before --

 5   either you can distinguish this, which I don't see how

 6   frankly, or you're back into the chain, and if you want

 7   to say one more thing about the chain, I didn't draw it

 8   to the final ending there, if I take most of the ads --

 9   and that's what that Kollar-Kotelly opinion is about.

10   That's what that 1,000-page record is about.                That's

11   what the 10,000 pages of testimony were about.                That's

12   what McCain-Feingold was about, and all those witnesses.

13   They said in today's world these are the kinds of ads

14   people run just to defeat people.                And then they said,

15   moreover, most of the campaign money goes on them.                   And

16   then they said, moreover, if you let corporations and

17   labor unions contribute to these, well, then they can

18   contribute to the campaign.            And the only thing I left

19   out before was, if you're prepared to say the

20   Constitution the Constitution requires us to let

21   corporations and unions buy these kinds of ads, well,

22   how could it be constitutional to have a statute that

23   forbids them to contribute directly to the candidate,

24   something that's been in existence only since I guess

25   1904?   But how could that be constitutional if they can

 1   just give this money directly?               Why can't they give this

 2   same money to the candidate?

 3              MR. BOPP:        Well, because of your decision in

 4   Beaumont, which creates a distinction between

 5   contributions and independent speech, and this is

 6   independent speech.

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:              It's pretty easy to tell

 8   whether you're giving money to the money to the

 9   candidate or not, isn't it?

10              MR. BOPP:        Very readily.

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:              That's a fairly bright line

12   that you don't have to worry about stepping over the

13   wrong side of it.

14              MR. BOPP:        That's right.

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Whereas this one,

16   especially if you adopt a context determination that

17   requires a 1,000-page district court opinion, who knows.

18              JUSTICE BREYER:              Is that right?         I mean,

19   1,000 is what we have here, is we happen to have three

20   criteria, absolutely clear:             Does it mix the candidate?

21   Does it run within 30 or 60 days before the election?

22   And is it targeted to an electorate?                     Now, that's clear.

23              Now, if you're prepared to say that's

24   unclear, I don't understand it, you don't need a

25   1,000-page record about that.              All you need is a record

 1   where you have your organization to come in and show how

 2   yours is significant different from the mine run of

 3   cases.    What's the problem?

 4                MR. BOPP:       The problem is you're not giving

 5   force to the other conclusion of all three district

 6   court judges that there were genuine issue ads.

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:             Oh, yes.         Yes, I see you

 8   could distinguish.

 9                MR. BOPP:       And that these ads, you know,

10   fall under a different line of cases.                     First National

11   Bank versus Bellotti has held that corporate efforts to

12   influence Legislative and Executive Branch officials --

13   -

14                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Are you trying to convince

15   us the purpose of these ads was to convince Senator

16   Feingold to change his position on filibusters?

17                MR. BOPP:       It was indeed.               It was to lobby

18   him about the upcoming vote.

19                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Do you think they had much

20   chance?   Do you think that was a realistic goal?

21                MR. BOPP:       Yes, as it turns out, because in

22   2006 we ran the same sort of anti-filibuster ads and

23   Senator Kohl, now up for reelection, changed his

24   position on the filibuster.              So these things happen.            In

25   other words, people -- people's positions are affected

 1   by grassroots lobbying, and at least people should have

 2   the opportunity to engage in grassroots lobbying.

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Is that called democracy?

 4                MR. BOPP:      We are hopeful, Your Honor.              And

 5   that our part -- our system of self government is based

 6   upon the self- government of the people and their

 7   ability to influence the actions of governmental

 8   officials.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Mr. Bopp, your

10   argument that McConnell's facial holding should be

11   overturned appears on page 62 of your brief.                 I take it

12   you have at least 61 page arguing that your as-applied

13   challenge can succeed without overturning McConnell's

14   position?

15                MR. BOPP:      Yes.        Yes, we have, which would

16   require the adoption of a reasonably ascertainable test,

17   one that people would not be subject to three years of

18   litigation, scorched earth litigation tactics, intrusive

19   discovery into every aspect of their organization for

20   decades.    It would have to be clear, simple, and

21   objective and be able to be implemented on short notice,

22   because things pop up, like the filibuster of a Supreme

23   Court nominee in January of 2006.

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:            What's your test?       Their

25   test is fuzzy, I agree with you.                What's yours?    Do you

 1   have a clear one that does not invalidate the whole

 2   statute?

 3                MR. BOPP:      Well, based on their evidence in

 4   McConnell and these grassroots, and these genuine issue

 5   ads, I think there are three key or essential features

 6   of those ads that we are satisfied would protect

 7   grassroots lobbying and genuine issue ads.               The first is

 8   based upon the content of the communication, they focus

 9   on a current legislative matter, take a position on it,

10   urge people to contact them, their congressmen and

11   senators, to take a particular action or position.

12                Secondly --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:            That says what's good.

14   What is your test for what's bad?

15                MR. BOPP:      Second, the ads do not mention an

16   election, candidacy, political party, challenger, or the

17   official character, qualifications, or fitness for

18   office.    That was the key link the district court found,

19   that these ads not, as Buckley said -- and of course

20   McConnell was litigated under Buckley -- is that they

21   were not unambiguously candidate- related.

22                JUSTICE SOUTER:            That's -- give us the third

23   one.   I want to go back to --

24                MR. BOPP:      The third one is, as long as the

25   ad meets this pattern, that the fact that the ad -- ours


                                        43
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   does not -- but the fact that the ad mentions the name,

 2   the position of a public official on an issue and

 3   praises or criticizes him or her for that does not

 4   affect its genuineness.

 5                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       May I go back to

 6   your second criterion?         It seems to me your second

 7   criterion is simply the injection of magic words back

 8   again.     You're saying if we don't use certain magic

 9   words it's okay.     That's a magic words test.

10                 You're not looking for any particular word.

11   You're looking for the meaning and breadth of the, of

12   the item.

13                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, but you said if we

14   don't mention the election and the candidacy of this

15   person for this election, that is one of the

16   sufficient -- one of the conditions with the other three

17   which would be sufficient to justify the, on First

18   Amendment grounds, justify running the ad.                  That seems

19   to me simply to be reinjecting magic words in a negative

20   form.

21                 MR. BOPP:      Well, in a much more expansive

22   and comprehensive test which looks to three features of

23   the ad.     But in any event, you look at the words all the

24   time.     Is it fighting words?           You look at what are the

25   words, what are they saying?

 1              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            We look at fighting words

 2   in a context.

 3              MR. BOPP:      And I think we have a relatively

 4   --

 5              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It's one thing to say

 6   something in a bikers bar and another thing in the --

 7              MR. BOPP:      And I think we have a relevant

 8   context.

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Are there many cases where

10   we look just at the words?

11              MR. BOPP:      Well, you certainly have in --

12              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You can't shout "Fire" in

13   a crowded theater; it has to be a crowded theater.

14              MR. BOPP:      Well, relevant context, that

15   there is an election upcoming, so it's within 60 days.

16   The person's a candidate.         These are relevant -- and for

17   that matter, whether the is a current Legislative Branch

18   matter or likely to arise in the near future.

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Bopp, you do not have

20   to establish, do you, that the test you propose will get

21   at every bad ad, that it will be sure to get at every ad

22   that is not a genuine issue ad?

23              Is that the burden on you?

24              MR. BOPP:      I don't believe so, Your Honor.

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:            I thought when we're

 1   dealing with the first amendment we give wide scope to

 2   the principle that it is, it is better to allow, you

 3   know, some bad speech than it is, in the effort to get

 4   rid of that bad speech, to eliminate any good speech

 5   that is justified.

 6                So even if there is something that might

 7   sneak through that does achieve what Congress didn't

 8   want to achieve, the answer in the First Amendment is

 9   that's too bad.     There's some stuff you just can't get

10   at.   There's a lot of bad speech that is allowed all the

11   time because you can't get at it without suppressing the

12   good speech.

13                MR. BOPP:       I think that's the standard.

14                JUSTICE BREYER:             In fact this isn't the

15   First Amendment totally on one side.                      Isn't this, isn't

16   this a case where the courts held that there are very

17   significant constitutional interests on both sides of

18   the equation, which is what makes this kind of thing

19   difficult.     Isn't that so?

20                MR. BOPP:       And so giving meaning to one side

21   was upholding it facially.            Now your job is to give

22   meaning to the other side, which is genuine issue ads

23   that are to be protected as applied.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:             I'm just suggesting why a

25   pure First Amendment test doesn't necessarily answer the

 1   question and why we've upheld McCain-Feingold.

 2              MR. BOPP:       But even if you use balancing,

 3   you've already used it.        You upheld it on its face,

 4   because you said the vast majority were shams.              At the

 5   same time, you said there were genuine issue ads.              You

 6   reserved the question of whether or not the interest is

 7   sufficient, the governmental interest is sufficient, to

 8   prohibit genuine issue ads in footnote 88.             You know,

 9   they refuse to give the test.            They refuse to tell us

10   what is the standard.

11              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But your test, as I

12   understand it, is the test to determine whether you fall

13   within this sort of heartland of the statute which we

14   upheld on facial challenge.           Yours is a test where

15   exclusion from the facial rule; isn't that correct?

16   That's -- that was why you were giving the answer to

17   Justice Scalia that you gave?

18              MR. BOPP:       I did --

19              JUSTICE SOUTER:            What you're saying:     I have

20   three criteria and if I satisfy those criteria, then

21   the, then the facial validity of the statute is not an

22   answer to my claim.     That's basically what you're

23   saying.

24              MR. BOPP:       Yes.

25              JUSTICE SOUTER:            And of course, if you

 1   success in that you're saying, okay, the Government then

 2   has the burden of satisfying strict scrutiny.                  That's

 3   the reason for your test, isn't it, to get you out of

 4   McCain-Feingold -- I mean, to get you out of the holding

 5   in McConnell?

 6                 MR. BOPP:     We're not trying to get out of

 7   the holding in McConnell.

 8                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Sure.       You're saying this

 9   is an applied challenge which is different in some

10   relevant respects, so that the facial holding in

11   McConnell shouldn't apply to us, it shouldn't bar,

12   shouldn't justify the Government barring our ad.                 Isn't

13   that your logic?

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           You could say yes to that,

15   I think.

16                 MR. BOPP:     Thank you.

17                 But the -- we're trying to -- actually --

18                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           You want to go further than

19   that, I know.    But that's your first step.

20                 MR. BOPP:     No, our first --

21                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           That's what you were

22   getting at.

23                 MR. BOPP:     Our first step is we want to give

24   meaning to the promise of McConnell that there were

25   genuine issue ads that could be protected by as-applied

 1   challenge.

 2                JUSTICE SOUTER:             The way to do that is say,

 3   there's something different about my case from the case

 4   which was taken as typical in upholding statute against

 5   facial challenge.

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:             He fears the Greeks even

 7   when they bear gifts.

 8                (Laughter.)

 9                MR. BOPP:       Yes, we have.                We have

10   demonstrated how these ads are materially identical to

11   the genuine issue ads this Government presented to this

12   Court and you relied upon that representation.                      We have

13   demonstrated why and their experts have agreed that the

14   Yellowtail ad, the Jane Doe ad, is completely different

15   than our ad.   Their experts say that our ads are

16   grassroots lobbying ads.

17                Now, we are faced with a change in position

18   of the Government.      I mean, in McConnell the Government

19   said naming a candidate is critical.                      Now their experts

20   say it doesn't matter if you name a candidate or not,

21   any genuine issue, any ad, can influence an election if

22   you mention an issue.

23                JUSTICE SOUTER:             But your, your principle

24   concern at this point is getting yourself out from the

25   holding of McConnell, in other words, by saying we have

 1   a case which was not the typical case in McConnell,

 2   that's why it's an as-applied challenge and that's why

 3   this is a new ball game.           And I take it your principle

 4   argument for that in criticizing the Government's

 5   position is that the Government didn't use to say that

 6   there's something significant or something insignificant

 7   about naming the candidate, and now they do.

 8              That it seems to me -- if I understand your

 9   argument -- goes back to this context argument or not.

10   Because the argument that's being made is, in context we

11   know perfectly well what's going on.

12              MR. BOPP:         I just think that misrepresents

13   --

14              JUSTICE SOUTER:               You're saying you shouldn't

15   look at the context.

16              MR. BOPP:         I think that simply misstates the

17   effect of this ad.      If anybody wanted to influence an

18   election with this ad, this was the most remote,

19   attenuated, speculative way.

20              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Then why did you refer them

21   to the web site?     There's nothing remote or speculative

22   about what happens when they look at the web site.

23              MR. BOPP:         And that has been also misstated

24   in the briefing here.        There was absolutely nothing on

25   the web site about anything other than the filibuster

 1   issue.   There was nothing about the PAC or what the PAC

 2   was doing.    It was all about the filibuster.

 3                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Anything about Senator

 4   Feingold?

 5                MR. BOPP:      Well, of course.             It was about

 6   Senator Feingold's position.             It was, the one change --

 7                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Did the web site indicate

 8   the -- the Wisconsin Right to Life's position on Senator

 9   Feingold?

10                MR. BOPP:      Only on the filibuster, yes.            It

11   identified -- the ads don't, the website does --

12   identified the position of Senator Feingold on the

13   filibuster and criticizes him for that.

14                Now, if that is to be -- you know, number

15   one, the whole First Amendment was adopted to allow --

16                JUSTICE SOUTER:            That's part of the context,

17   isn't it?    In other words, you're supplying some --

18                MR. BOPP:      No.

19                JUSTICE SOUTER:            -- context for the ad.

20   You're saying, if you want to know the context in which

21   we're saying this, look at the website.

22                MR. BOPP:      No.      We don't believe that that's

23   part of the context.

24                JUSTICE SOUTER:            You don't believe that's

25   what you are doing.

 1                 MR. BOPP:     But see, the FEC doesn't even

 2   regulate what's on the Internet.                You can do anything

 3   you want on the Internet

 4                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           The FEC doesn't regulate

 5   anything else in the broader political context except

 6   what the statute allows.          My point is, it seems to me

 7   you are referring to context.              Why therefore is it

 8   illegitimate for a court to look to context?

 9                 MR. BOPP:     We have not referred to context.

10                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Okay.

11                 MR. BOPP:     We are not importing in our

12   analysis --

13                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask a rather basic

14   question?   Do you agree that the Constitution permits

15   Congress to pass a statute that prohibits your using

16   electioneering ads that use magic words?

17                 MR. BOPP:     Yes.

18                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Would it also prohibit you

19   from using -- urging everyone to look to a web site that

20   used the same magic words?

21                 MR. BOPP:     Would it?

22                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Yes.

23                 MR. BOPP:     Perhaps, yes.

24                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           So that if your web site

25   used the magic words, then your ads would be -- could be

 1   regulated.

 2                 MR. BOPP:     You're talking about the

 3   constitutionality of the Federal statute that

 4   incorporates the cited to website.                  You know, perhaps.

 5   But that's much different than a constitutional standard

 6   on what this Court is going to look to.                  We have no

 7   notice of this.

 8                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           No, but you would agree

 9   the statute could be validly applied to an ad that says

10   look at this website, and the web site then uses the

11   magic words?

12                 MR. BOPP:     Perhaps.          I'm not certain of

13   that.   And I'm sorry that I don't have a considered

14   response to that question.

15                 But that is much different than what we are

16   faced with.    We are faced with ad hoc criteria that is

17   being used by the Government.              They reject examining

18   subjective intent because it's unworkable.                  Now they

19   want to examine subjective intent.                  They disclaim to

20   this Court and Justice Scalia's question about, well,

21   anything that might influence an election, can we

22   regulate it?    They said no.           Well now they are claiming

23   that, that anything that might influence an election --

24                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Well, do you believe that

25   the First Amendment would not be violated by an ad that

 1   was the functional equivalent of one that contained

 2   magic words?

 3                MR. BOPP:      Well, I disagree with that

 4   holding of --

 5                JUSTICE STEVENS:            There might be an

 6   upholdable constitutional difference between two ads

 7   that convey the same message.

 8                MR. BOPP:      Well, I don't believe they have

 9   the same functional --

10                JUSTICE STEVENS:            If they're the functional

11   equivalent, by hypothesis, they convey the same message.

12                MR. BOPP:      Well, Your Honor, I lost that

13   argument in this Court.         So you know, I'm not trying to

14   relitigate McConnell.       I'm trying to give meaning to

15   McConnell.    I mean, you talked about genuine issue, as

16   this Court did.    Their experts identified genuine issue

17   ads.    They said, as this Court said in Wisconsin Right

18   to Life I, as-applied challenges can be brought.                     And so

19   we're trying to give meaning to that, that there --

20                JUSTICE BREYER:            The theory is that the ad

21   itself on the web site, in your opinion, would have been

22   okay?    You turn to the web site three months before the

23   election.    It says 16 times out of 16 in the past two

24   years, Feingold and Kohl have voted to filibuster

25   certain of the President's nominees.                     Feingold and Kohl

 1   are putting politics into the court system, creating

 2   gridlock and costing taxpayers money.                     Now three months

 3   before the election you put -- write that in your ad.

 4   Now, is that in your opinion constitutionally protected,

 5   gets it out of McCain-Feingold?

 6                 MR. BOPP:      In the -- as a broadcast ad?

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.      What you did, suppose

 8   instead of what you ran, you know, in a broadcast ad.

 9                 MR. BOPP:      Yes.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:            You think that is

11   protected?

12                 MR. BOPP:      Yes.        Because whether you praise

13   or criticize a Government official's action in office

14   has nothing to do with whether it falls under the First

15   Amendment's protection of petitioning.                    In fact that's

16   what, you know, the kind of information -- we didn't do

17   that.   But that's the kind of information that's very

18   relevant to the constituent's effort to petition.

 1   like to stress the virtue of as-applied challenges.                   You

 2   might wonder in the abstract, wasn't there a problem

 3   with the statute that applies to a group running a

 4   series of ads and then one of them falls in the period.

 5   But then you look at an as-applied challenge and you see

 6   that didn't happen here.         In fact, the opposite did.

 7   This issue was percolating since March of 2003.                   These

 8   ads were run some 500 days after the first filibuster

 9   vote.   Both before and after Senator Feingold's

10   reelection cycle, they addressed this --

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Does that go to their

12   meaning or to the intent of -- is that what governs?

13   It's the intent of the person who puts it on?                I thought

14   -- I thought you were focusing on the meaning of it,

15   what it conveys to the public.

16               GENERAL CLEMENT:            Justice Scalia, if you're

17   looking for an as-applied challenge that's going to

18   identify a genuine issue ad, I would think that it would

19   go somewhat to intent.       And I would think the

20   reason that --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's new to me.      I

22   thought you were asking us to look at the meaning.                  What

23   does it mean to the --

24               GENERAL CLEMENT:            No.      Our position is

25   slightly different than intervenors on that point.                  And

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   I think the reason that the series of ads hypothetical

 2   is beguiling is because it suggests that because they

 3   run the same issue ad all the time, they must be

 4   interested in the issue, not the election, and the

 5   opposite is true here.

 6                 They run ads about this issue, they run --

 7   they have communications about this issue outside of the

 8   period of Senator Feingold's reelection.                  They don't

 9   rely on broadcast ads.         They rely on e-alerts when it's

10   not during the election cycle.                But when it's during the

11   election cycle, all of a sudden they start running

12   broadcast ads.     And I think it shows what the timing

13   suggests.     The timing here suggests an intent to

14   influence the election, not an intent to engage on the

15   issue.

16                 JUSTICE ALITO:          How long will the blackout

17   period be during the upcoming year for the presidential

18   candidates?

19                 MR. BOPP:      Well, I think that in various

20   places it will be 30 days before the primary and then

21   obviously 60 days before the general.

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            It could be as long as 200

23   days; isn't that correct.

24                 MR. BOPP:      Not in any one place.           And if

25   there's an argument, though, that because of the way the

 1   various broadcast media affect Manchester, New

 2   Hampshire, that's a great as-applied challenge.                     The

 3   virtue of as-applied challenges are that you get a

 4   concrete record and you don't have to speculate, wow,

 5   you know, is it possible to address the filibuster --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You have to speculate

 7   before you try to put the ad on.

 8               GENERAL CLEMENT:            No, you don't.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You have to speculate

10   whether the Court is going to say well, since you're in

11   the zone of three different radio stations or television

12   stations, a different rule applies.                     Doesn't the person

13   who wants to speak have to speculate, roll the dice?

14               GENERAL CLEMENT:            No, they don't, Justice

15   Scalia, and one of the arguments that's made to try to

16   suggest that there should be a reconsideration of

17   McConnell is, as-applied checks don't work.                     How can you

18   say that?   In the two cases that have been brought,

19   there were preliminary injunction proceedings that were

20   completed before the blackout period began.                     So in that

21   case, bring your preliminary injunction if you have a

22   question.

23               But the virtue of as-applied challenges, and

24   the last thing I'll say, is the virtue of as-applied

25   challenges, they're not all created equal.                     Just because


                                       58

 1   this as-applied challenge fails doesn't mean the statute

 2   isn't open to them.

 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, General.

 4   The case is submitted.

 5              (Whereupon, at 11:16 a.m., the case in the

 6   above-titled action was submitted.)
