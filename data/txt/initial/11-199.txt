 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF BEAU B. BRINDLEY

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. BRINDLEY:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               When determining whether an error affects

12   substantial rights pursuant to the harmless-error

13   statute, courts should first begin the analysis with the

14   error itself, consider it in the context of the entire

15   record, determine what potential impact it may have, and

16   then ask the question:      Can the government prove to the

17   requisite degree of certitude -- in this case, fair

18   assurance -- that the error did not substantially impact

19   the verdict of the jury that heard the case?

20               It is impermissible for the reviewing court

21   to merely ask the question of whether some other jury, a

22   reasonable jury that didn't hear the error that this

23   jury heard, would convict him and determine harmlessness

24   on that basis.

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            My problem --

 2               MR. BRINDLEY:       Yes.

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- is I can accept that

 4   formulation certainly for purposes of this case.           I just

 5   don't see where in the opinion -- I have the opinion of

 6   the court of appeals -- it focused on the wrong test.

 7               It didn't use the magic words, and it

 8   started out with let's look at the big picture, and it

 9   said, well, here's the defense he elected to put on, and

10   this is a tough sell because.           But then it quotes what

11   happens with the jury.     It -- and it -- and it ends its

12   analysis for -- saying:      We -- this evidence would have

13   moved the jury to convict Vasquez without a nudge from

14   anything it heard in the government's case.

15               I just -- I just don't see that you have

16   supported your theory by what the -- by what the court

17   says.

18               MR. BRINDLEY:       Before the harmless-error

19   analysis, the question the Court asks is, what we have

20   to decide is whether a reasonable jury would convict him

21   absent the error.   And so, the question that they ask

22   doesn't require any consideration of the error.           And the

23   conclusion they reach that he would be convicted without

24   any consideration of the error also doesn't consider the

25   error.

 1               They do not address the error or its impact

 2   at all, despite a robust dissent, which set forth the

 3   extraordinary prejudicial possible impact of this error.

 4   They don't disagree with the dissent; they simply don't

 5   address it at all.

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Could you tell me what

 7   the error actually was?       I see -- and you can add

 8   another -- three potential things about these calls or

 9   three potential errors:       One, that they proved as a

10   matter of fact that she was biased.               But, as the

11   majority points out, she already said she was before the

12   tapes were played.    So, whatever error may have been

13   occasioned by the jury using the tapes as for the truth,

14   it really was cumulative to an already admitted bias.

15               The second is some sort of ambiguous

16   statement by her that all of them were in trouble,

17   meaning all the defendants, and a similar statement by

18   the -- by Petitioner's lawyer.           So, what was it that was

19   error that affected or influenced the jury among these

20   three choices?

21               MR. BRINDLEY:        The -- the statements from

22   counsel, two statements:       One, that everyone was going

23   to lose the case, which was repeated several times by

24   government counsel during the cross-examination of Ms.

25   Perez.

 1                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         It was never referenced

 2   in the summations, however, or in the reply.

 3                 MR. BRINDLEY:      They were not specific -- the

 4   recordings were referenced, and they told them to look

 5   at the recordings.    They didn't reference that specific

 6   statement.    It was referenced three times in the

 7   cross-examination.    When the witness suggested that

 8   it -- who was going to lose the case only referred to

 9   her husband, the government corrected her and said, no,

10   it was everyone.    And then they played the tape to make

11   that clear.

12                 They also played a portion of a recording

13   where it said that counsel was talking to Mr. Vasquez

14   about pleading guilty.      Now, if you take those two

15   statements together for their truth, what they mean is

16   that counsel believes he's guilty and was telling him he

17   should plead that way.

18                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So, that's the error

19   that you think --

20                 MR. BRINDLEY:      I think that's --

21                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- influenced this

22   trial?

23                 MR. BRINDLEY:      I think that's the most

24   substantial one.

25                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         All right.   Now, tell me

 1   what in this record reflects that influence.

 2                 MR. BRINDLEY:      Well --

 3                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         The fact that they asked

 4   for her testimony -- well, she was your client's entire

 5   defense.   So, what does the asking for her testimony

 6   show that they were interested in that particular part

 7   of the transcript?

 8                 MR. BRINDLEY:      Well, asking for her

 9   testimony shows that they were focused on the -- they

10   were asking for a transcript that would have contained

11   that part of the record.       We don't -- we can't prove,

12   and we don't have the burden -- I think that's

13   important -- to prove that she -- they were focused on

14   that specific statement.       However, they did ask for that

15   transcript.

16                 I also think they rendered the split verdict

17   in the case, which is --

18                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Which transcript?   The

19   transcript of her testimony?

20                 MR. BRINDLEY:      Her testimonies, both on

21   direct -- and then they asked for both, plural,

22   indicating they wanted the rebuttal testimony, which

23   would have included these statements.

24                 And I don't think there's any way for the

25   government to prove on this record to any degree of


                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   assurance that they weren't concerned about that error,

 2   an error that I think if they took these things for

 3   their truth, then they could have thought he essentially

 4   confessed to his lawyer.        His lawyer knew he was guilty.

 5   Those are fair inferences if taken for their truth.            And

 6   then they could have disregarded all arguments that were

 7   made on his behalf.      That's a sort of error that could

 8   infect the entire proceeding.

 9                  And when you ask --

10                  JUSTICE ALITO:       Is it correct that the

11   difference between your position and the Government's

12   position is that the Government says the focus should be

13   on a rational jury, and you say the focus should be on

14   this particular jury?

15                  MR. BRINDLEY:      That is one of the important

16   differences.    I think --

17                  JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, that I understand.

18   But beyond that I really don't understand the difference

19   between the two positions.

20                  MR. BRINDLEY:      I -- well, in the

21   Government's brief, at some times, as we indicate in our

22   reply, it seems that they support a very similar test to

23   ours, and at others, it seems like they want to say that

24   you can just look at a reasonable jury and how they

25   would view the evidence.

 1                JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, let me -- let me read

 2   you two sentences and tell me whether you think there's

 3   a difference between them.        First one:        "Is there a fair

 4   possibility that this particular evidence caused the

 5   jury to convict?"   Second statement:             "Is there a fair

 6   possibility that this jury would have" -- "that this

 7   jury would have convicted without the evidence?"

 8                Do you see a difference between those two?

 9                MR. BRINDLEY:      I do.

10                JUSTICE ALITO:       What is the difference?

11                MR. BRINDLEY:      The difference is one of them

12   was going to focus on the entire record, which includes

13   the error.   The other is going to focus on the evidence

14   in the record without the error, and that's important,

15   particularly with an error like this, an error that

16   could have a pernicious effect that could affect a

17   large, substantial part of this evidence, everything the

18   defendant presented.    It's really --

22                I -- where in the Government's brief do you

23   see the statement that the analysis should not look to

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Where exactly is

 7   that in their brief?     That the -- the question is

 8   whether a jury would convict him without considering the

 9   error.    Because I look at the Government's brief, and

10   they have fairly extensive analysis of -- of the error,

11   why they think it's not important, why they -- you know.

12   But I don't see them saying you don't look at the error

13   at all.

14                 MR. BRINDLEY:      I think there's a

15   significant -- I don't have the exact citation.

16                 On page 29, Your Honor, it indicates:

17   "Although the Court's analysis often has not focused

18   exclusively on the overall strength of the government's

19   proof, its decisions demonstrate that a court's

20   determination of harmlessness can properly rest on the

21   conclusion that the admissible evidence of guilt is

22   sufficiently strong such that the prejudicial effect of

23   erroneously admitted evidence can be deemed not to have

24   altered the outcome."

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Yes, exactly.   In

 1   other words, you look at the prejudicial effect of the

 2   erroneously admitted evidence and see if that altered

 3   the outcome.

 4                  MR. BRINDLEY:      If that's the -- and there's

 5   parts of -- the Government's brief, I think, agrees with

 6   us in large part on what this test should be.             And as

 7   far as that goes, I think the problem is the majority

 8   below asked a different question and appeared to do a

 9   different analysis.

10                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       What would you point at in

11   the majority opinion below that suggests that they did

12   an analysis that didn't look at the error and its

13   possible prejudicial effect?

14                  MR. BRINDLEY:      Two things:       First, the

15   question that they asked.         The question that they asked

16   was whether a reasonable jury would convict him absent

17   the error.   There is no focus on this jury that heard

18   the case or this verdict.         And --

19                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Where -- where is that

20   statement?   Where is that statement?

21                  MR. BRINDLEY:      In the -- you mean in the

22   majority opinion?

23                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.

24                  MR. BRINDLEY:      It's immediately prior to the

25   harmless-error analysis.

 1                 If we go to page 16A of the appendix to our

 2   cert petition, it states at the bottom of that first

 3   paragraph:    "On appeal, the burden lies on the

 4   government to prove that a reasonable jury would have

 5   reached the same verdict without the challenged

 6   evidence."

 7                 That's the question they're asking.              That

 8   question doesn't --

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But -- but in the context

10   of the opinion -- and this was my first question -- they

11   then proceed to analyze -- and that's toward the very

12   end of its discussion -- what happened in this

13   particular case.    And it concludes, from this evidence

14   we believe -- "This evidence we believe would have moved

15   the jury to convict."

16                 MR. BRINDLEY:       I think the problem is they

17   asked that question, which I think is the wrong

18   question.    Kotteakos says you can't ask that question

19   because you can't strip the error from the whole.

20   That's the question they ask.             And to answer that

21   question, you don't have to consider the error.

22                 Then I think it's important they didn't

23   address the error at all; they didn't address its

24   potential impact, despite that dissent which laid out

25   that this is one of the most prejudicial errors you

 1   could have in a trial.      They ignored it.

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              They say --

 3   immediately after the sentence you gave us, they say

 4   "looking at the evidence as a whole."

 5                 MR. BRINDLEY:      They do say that.          But then

 6   later on, in that same paragraph, they indicate that

 7   here's where the evidence was.           And I think it's

 8   important that the only evidence they talk about is the

 9   government's evidence, and they talk about it in a way

10   that views the evidence in the light most favorable to

11   the government.

12                 In their harmless-error analysis, they don't

13   address Mrs. Perez's testimony, and they -- the more

14   important thing is they don't address the error at all.

15   They don't even disagree with the dissent's contention

16   that it's this terribly prejudicial error.

17                 Instead, they do what many of the courts

18   below have been doing when they do this guilt-based

19   approach to answer this question.            They focus on the

20   government's evidence viewed in the light most favorable

21   to the government and then find, well, he could be

22   convicted on that basis by a reasonable jury.

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:       You didn't -- you didn't

24   read the whole thing.      I -- it's a little hard to

25   understand.   And looking at the transcript on page 769,

 1   am I right?   I want to get my own understanding right.

 2   At that moment your client's lawyer, who they call

 3   "Beau" -- is that right?

 4                 MR. BRINDLEY:       Yes, that was me, Judge.

 5   Yes, Your Honor, yes, it was me.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Okay.         All right.

 7                 Your client's lawyer, namely you --

 8                 (Laughter.)

 9                 MR. BRINDLEY:       Yes.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:        -- has not yet seen the

11   client; is that right?       They think you haven't seen the

12   client yet.   They say somewhere you haven't even talked

13   to him yet or -- he hasn't even talked to Beau.                 He

14   hasn't seen his lawyer yet.          They say that two

15   paragraphs earlier.

16                 So, is that right, basically, that they

17   think that, anyway?      You see at the top of the page,

18   about six lines down:       He hasn't even talked to the

19   lawyer yet.   He hasn't even talked to Beau.

20                 MR. BRINDLEY:       I think that actually what

21   they're talking about was whether Mr. Perez's lawyer had

22   talked to me, Mr. Vasquez's lawyer.

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Oh, they're talking about

24   the lawyer.   All right.       And what you're trying to do,

25   as far as I can read this, is they think what you're

                                                                             15
 1   trying to do is you want Perez to plead guilty.             Is that

 2   the fair thrust of this?

 3                 MR. BRINDLEY:      There's some discussion

 4   between them --

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:       What do you think it means?

 6                 MR. BRINDLEY:      There's -- it's hard for me

 7   to tell exactly what --

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:       All right.      So, it's hard

 9   to tell what they're talking about, I grant you that.               I

10   thought they were talking about trying -- that you

11   thought it would be better if everybody got some kind of

12   agreement worked out.

13                 And then she says, Perez's wife:           "How can I

14   not worry?"   He says:     "I don't understand what's going

15   on."   Which is fair comment.            "But it's not the way

16   Beau -- he's putting it two different ways.             If he

17   didn't explain to you the way, then, either -- then it's

18   a different story.    If you don't ask him" --

19                 Then she says:       "Yes, he's saying that

20   everybody's going to lose.         He's saying that whatever

21   he wants to say.   I don't believe him."

22                 Well, by the time I got through reading

23   that, I wasn't certain what they were talking about, and

24   I thought it sounded like they're talking about:             Let's

25   all make an agreement or everybody's going to lose.

 1                 And -- and I could see that you could say

 2   that's prejudicial.      I could also see that the

 3   government could say it isn't prejudicial.             And it's

 4   pretty hard for me to read their opinion as thinking

 5   they were really not thinking about that error.             I mean

 6   that was -- or not an error.              I mean, of course, they'd

 7   be thinking about that; that was the issue.

 8                 And as I read the opinion, they

 9   said, well, there's so much other evidence in the case,

10   and in our opinion, this is weak enough that it didn't

11   -- wouldn't have made a difference and -- and if you

12   didn't, say, take it for the truth.

13                 And the other, dissenting judge, common, is

14   thinking:   No, I don't know; you know, it's pretty hard

15   to understand what it means, but there's an implication

16   there the lawyer thinks he's guilty of some kind, and in

17   context that might have made a difference.             So, he comes

18   to a different conclusion.

19                 That's what I saw going on.            And I didn't

20   see some big war of standards.             I just saw judges

21   disagreeing about a fairly tough question in an

22   individual case.   So, what can you say to make me change

23   my mind and think this is a war of standards that we

24   ought to --

25                 MR. BRINDLEY:       Well, because -- I think -- I


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official

                                                                            17
 1   think the most important thing is what I've already

 2   said, is the question they ask isn't about the error,

 3   and they don't address it at all.          And when you consider

 4   a dissent with that robust of language, the idea that

 5   they wouldn't address it at all is problematic.

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:       Okay.         So, would it satisfy

 7   you in your opinion if we said:         We aren't finding your

 8   opinion totally clear.    And, luckily, people don't have

 9   the right to send cases back to us on that basis, but we

10   have the right to send cases back to you on that basis.

11               (Laughter.)

12               JUSTICE BREYER:       And, therefore, we would

13   like you to clarify whether you do or did or did not

14   take in the actual transcript page there, when you

15   reached your conclusion.

16               MR. BRINDLEY:      I don't think that would be

17   sufficient, because I think the important thing here is

18   that they be required to ask the right question, to

19   focus on this jury that heard the case.

20               JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, Mr. Brindley, I mean,

21   I guess one difficulty -- and this is really repeating

22   Justice Alito's question, but it seems that you're

23   parsing things pretty closely.         If I ask the question

24   whether an error altered the verdict, it seems to me I'm

25   asking pretty much the same question as whether without


                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                        18
 1   that verdict the -- whether without that error, the

 2   verdict would be the same.          That seems like just two

 3   ways of saying the same thing.

 4                  Now, if what you're saying is put aside that

 5   formulation, there are lots of courts that are doing

 6   something wrong, which is that they're not looking at

 7   the error and its possible prejudicial effect at all,

 8   then I understand the argument; but then I ask the

 9   question, well, is that what this court did?

10                  MR. BRINDLEY:      And I think that the -- by

11   asking the question in that way and talking only about a

12   reasonable jury absent the error, when you start saying

13   absent the error and you start looking at the evidence

14   without the error, you're looking at a case the jury

15   didn't hear.    And I think that's the biggest problem.

16   If you're looking at a case the jury didn't hear, then

17   the reviewing court sort of makes its own guilt judgment

18   about a case they didn't hear.

19                  JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, look, if you -- if you

20   win, your client will get a new trial.             Let's suppose

21   that the new trial is exactly like the trial that took

22   place.   Every single thing is the same except the error

23   is corrected.    All right.       Isn't that essentially the

24   harmless-error analysis?

25                  MR. BRINDLEY:      No, I don't think so.

 1                JUSTICE ALITO:       No?

 2                MR. BRINDLEY:      I don't think so, because I

 3   think if you do the analysis that way and you say the

 4   error is corrected, you don't take into account its

 5   impact.   The question has been to be whether it

 6   contributed to the jury's verdict, not whether the

 7   verdict would be the same in another trial.       That's

 8   where that Sixth Amendment problem that this Court was

 9   worried about all the way back in Kotteakos, and even in

10   Neder, where this Court said to safeguard the jury's

11   province, we have to do an exacting review of the entire

12   record including -- that would include the error,

13   obviously, and its impact.

14                And here this court didn't address the error

15   or its potential impact, and I think --

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Are you -- are you saying

17   that it doesn't matter that the verdict would have been

18   the same by this jury if the error had not been made?

19   You're --

20                MR. BRINDLEY:      Yes, I am saying that.     I'm

21   saying that the question --

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:       You're saying that the test

23   is whether it contributed to the verdict, and if it did,

24   it doesn't matter whether the same verdict would have

25   been pronounced absent that evidence?

 1                  MR. BRINDLEY:      That is correct, Your Honor,

 2   yes.

 3                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       Well, then, what is

 4   harmless error?    Every error is harmful.          Every error

 5   that's -- that's there contributes to the verdict.

 6   There's no such thing as harmless error.

 7                  MR. BRINDLEY:      I think -- I don't think that

 8   should be the formulation of the test.             I think it has

 9   to have a -- what the government has to be able to do is

10   prove to the necessary degree of certitude that the

11   error doesn't substantially impact the verdict.            And the

12   reason I --

13                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       What -- what does that

14   mean?   To say that it doesn't substantially impact the

15   verdict means the verdict would have been the same

16   despite this evidence.       But you're saying, no, that's

17   not the test; you have to ask whether it contributed to

18   the verdict.    The Government says, well, it did, but the

19   verdict would have been the same anyway.

20                  That's what harmless error is, it seems to

21   me.

22                  MR. BRINDLEY:      I think what the -- when you

23   ask the question about whether the verdict contributed

24   substantially to -- or, I'm sorry, whether the error

25   contributed substantially to the verdict, what you're


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

 1   doing is you're -- you have to then look at the entire

 2   record and you have to look at the error's impact.               And

 3   when you do that, you can make a determination whether

 4   there's anything in the record that would allow the

 5   government to prove to the right degree of assurance

 6   that it didn't.

 7               Now, you could -- it could be the case that

 8   you look at all of the evidence and you can say, well,

 9   in light of all the other evidence, the error was

10   cumulative, or it was essentially uncontested.              And then

11   you can find that error is harmless.               It couldn't have

12   contributed to the verdict, and we know that to the

13   right degree of certitude.

14               I think the problem comes in when you're

15   talking about this reasonable jury and whether they

16   would convict without the error.             That's some other

17   trial.

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Could we get a little

19   more practical here?      I think I understood your basic

20   argument, which is:      My defense was by this one woman,

21   the wife of one of the codefendants.               She tells a story,

22   and if the jury had believed her story they would have

23   acquitted your client.

24               MR. BRINDLEY:         Yes.

25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            All right.     So, I am

 1   assuming what you're saying -- and you can correct me if

 2   I'm wrong -- which is if we believe that the error

 3   committed affected her credibility in a meaningful way,

 4   that that deprived you of a defense.              Is that what

 5   you're saying?

 6                MR. BRINDLEY:       Yes.

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Of the potential of

 8   convincing the jury.

 9                MR. BRINDLEY:       Yes, absolutely, in addition

10   to the fact that the error -- if those things are taken

11   for their truth, they serve as an independent basis for

12   conviction, believing he had essentially confessed.

13                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Okay.     Now, assuming

14   that's your argument --

15                MR. BRINDLEY:       Yes.

16                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          -- I go back to my

17   question.   Okay?   Because what you said to me earlier,

18   it wasn't about believing her or not; it was about

19   believing the defense attorney when -- whether the

20   defense attorney thought the defendant was guilty or

21   not.

22                MR. BRINDLEY:       I think that -- well, I think

23   the two go hand in hand.       I think that if they take these

24   statements for their truth, they could disbelieve her

25   and the defense attorney who called her because the

 1   defense attorney knew he was guilty and then called this

 2   witness to say otherwise.        I think that would in that

 3   situation make it appear as if she wasn't telling the

 4   truth.   And I think the important thing about this whole

 5   analysis --

 6                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Let's -- let's --

 7                 MR. BRINDLEY:      Okay.

 8                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Are you -- are you

 9   taking the position in this case that a reviewing court,

10   under no circumstance, could conclude that this error

11   was harmless?   Or are you taking the position in this

12   case that the court here, the Seventh Circuit, I think,

13   committed review error and we should send it back for

14   them to do it the right way?

15                 MR. BRINDLEY:      I -- I am first saying that

16   the court committed review error.            But I think -- I'm

17   also saying on top of that if you do the error -- review

18   properly in these cases, as we've asked the test to be

19   formulated, then what this -- this case is going to come

20   down to is really one question, and --

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Well, you're -- and

22   you're agreeing with the dissenting judge, who I think

23   did say this error is harmful.

24                 MR. BRINDLEY:      Yes, of course.

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          And so, you're not saying

 1   that it's just that they didn't use the right formula,

 2   but you would say, given what occurred here, the

 3   importance of this witness, that -- that this was a --

 4   this was a harmful error?

 5                  MR. BRINDLEY:      Yes, absolutely.      I -- I

 6   think if you do the test appropriately and do the proper

 7   analysis focused on this jury and the potential impact

 8   of the error, then this is a harmful error.

 9                  JUSTICE BREYER:       Back to Justice --

10                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Is your argument something

11   like this?   Let's assume there are 10 pieces of

12   evidence.    Evidence 1 through 9 are properly admitted.

13   Evidence item 10 is (a) wrongfully admitted and (b) so

14   prejudicial that that's all the jury looked at.             There

15   is a substantial likelihood of that.

16                  I think this is your argument:          If the jury

17   was so obsessed, focused, transfixed by item 10, which

18   was improperly admitted, what would happen if we

19   concluded that this jury in this case on these facts, if

20   they had looked at 1 through 9, would have convicted?

21   What result?

22                  MR. BRINDLEY:      I think if you did the

23   examination that way and didn't consider 10 at all, what

24   you're saying is it's possible to convict on 1 through

25   9, but you're not considering the possibility that you

                                                                            25
 1   could convict as an independent basis on 10.           And the

 2   government would have to --

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           We're not only saying it's

 4   possible to convict, but that likely, probably would

 5   have happened.

 6                MR. BRINDLEY:      I don't -- well, if the error

 7   is the error in this case, that's number 10, then I

 8   think when you consider the possible impact, sweeping as

 9   it might be, I don't think there's any way on this

10   record that the government can prove with fair assurance

11   that that didn't infect the jury.

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           No, my hypothetical is

13   that the court of appeals says that if the jury had

14   looked at 1 through 9, which was properly admitted

15   before them in this trial, they would have convicted,

16   likely.

17                Now, we -- then the hypothetical is:           We

18   don't think they did because this item was so

19   prejudicial that all they looked -- that's all they

20   looked at.   Is that what your argument is?          It seems to

21   me that's stronger than the argument you're making.              I'm

22   not sure even that works for you.

23                MR. BRINDLEY:      I -- the formulation you've

24   stated, I agree with that.        If number 10 is such that

25   there's no way that they can prove that it didn't impact

 1   the jury's verdict substantially -- and I don't think

 2   they can in this case -- then, yes, that's -- that's our

 3   argument.   And the one reason I think it's most

 4   important in this case is because this case comes down

 5   to -- at the end, we have -- you know, you have --

 6   essentially it's a circumstantial case.            This isn't like

 7   Harrington or Schneble or the cases with direct evidence

 8   where this Court has found harmless error.

 9                This is a case where the ultimate question

10   is, if you believe Mrs. Perez is credible, he's not

11   guilty; if you don't, he is.            And in order to find

12   harmlessness, you have to have a reviewing court on a

13   cold record making that credibility determination,

14   something that this Court has continually said a

15   reviewing court is not in a position to do.            And when a

16   case can be ground down to the point where it's going to

17   come to a credibility determination about a witness the

18   reviewing court did not see --

19                JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, maybe the majority in

20   the court of appeals was wrong in its application of the

21   harmless-error test.    I didn't think that was the reason

22   why we took this, why we took this case.            What I'm

23   concerned about is the test.            Now, the only aspect of --

24   the only thing that I understand that really

25   differentiates your position from the Government with


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   respect to the test is whether the focus is on a

 2   rational jury or on this particular jury.

 3                And when you say the focus should be on this

 4   particular jury, aren't you calling for a speculation by

 5   the -- by an appellate court?           How is an appellate court

 6   supposed to tell whether this particular jury was

 7   different from a hypothetical rational jury?

 8                MR. BRINDLEY:      Because this -- the reviewing

 9   court has to look at everything in the entire record.

10   That includes in this case the jury note.          It includes

11   in this case the split verdict.          All of those things.

12   And when you look at all of those things, you can get

13   insight into the jury that heard the case and how they

14   viewed it.

15                You can also look at how a reasonable jury

16   would view the case as heuristic device to get back to

17   what this jury thought.      But --

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          I thought -- I thought

19   your main point -- yes, you said "this jury" rather than

20   a hypothetical jury.    But I thought your main point is

21   that what's wrong is to say strip out the infected

22   testimony, take that out, look at the rest of the

23   record, and if the rest of the record warrants

24   conviction, no harmless error.

25                I thought that what you're saying is that

 1   the basic mistake is what -- what are they looking to;

 2   are they looking to all of the evidence, or are they

 3   just asking the question, let's take out the tainted

 4   evidence, see if there's enough to convict?

 5               MR. BRINDLEY:        Yes.     Yes, Your Honor.     I

 6   agree with that.    The problem is the question asked by

 7   the majority strips out the error and it also focuses on

 8   the reasonable jury rather than this jury.

 9               And with that, if there aren't any further

10   questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my

11   time.

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

15               ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG

16                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

17               MR. YANG:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

18   please the Court:

19               The harmless-error inquiry, as this Court

20   explained in Neder and prior decisions, turns ultimately

21   on one question:    Whether a rational jury -- and this is

22   a quote -- "whether a rational jury would have found the

23   defendant guilty absent the error."               Now --

24               JUSTICE KAGAN:         Mr. Yang, that does raise

25   the question that I think most separates you and Mr.


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                       29
 1   Brindley, and it's the question that Justice Alito

 2   suggested.   So, let me give you a hypothetical.

 3                Let's say that this jury was not out for 8

 4   hours but was out for 8 days.            And on the 7th day, a

 5   note came from the jury, and the note said we really

 6   think that these tape recordings are extremely

 7   important, but we're -- we're having a dispute about how

 8   important they are, and we'd like to listen to them

 9   again.   And they do that, and then they come back with

10   this compromise verdict.

11                Now, what you are suggesting is that we

12   cannot look at any of that.         Essentially, the best proof

13   that's available to us about whether the error in fact

14   affected this jury's decision, you would have a court

15   close its eyes to.    And I guess -- why would that be?

16                MR. YANG:     Well, I don't believe our view is

17   quite so firm.   I think, as a general matter, our view

18   is that indications mid-deliberation of what a jury

19   might or some subset of the jury might be considering is

20   generally very unreliable.         And that, in your case, the

21   Court shouldn't shut its eyes to that question, but what

22   it should do is redirect the court back to the evidence

23   that was before the jury.        Because if we're assuming a

24   rational jury, there often is some correspondence; it

25   should be an indication to go back and look again.

                                                                         30
 1                If the Court were to conclude, wow, the

 2   evidence was so overwhelming, so overwhelming that no

 3   rational jury would have, you know, had a problem with

 4   convicting absent the error, it's very unlikely that the

 5   situation that your hypothetical poses would result.

 6   So --

 7                JUSTICE KAGAN:       So, let me make sure I

 8   understand what you're saying to me, that you're saying

 9   to me:   No, we didn't mean to say that that was

10   irrelevant; we just mean to say that an appellate court

11   should be cautious about it and look at that kind of

12   evidence in the -- in light of everything else that

13   happened at the trial.

14                MR. YANG:    Ultimately, the appellate court

15   should look back at what the jury was supposed to

16   consider, the evidence in light of the instructions.          It

17   should be a cautionary note but ultimately should

18   redirect the court back to the evidence.

19                And I think that focuses on, again, one of

20   the two related legal points that Petitioner made in

21   argument that I think there's real disagreement between

22   the Government and Petitioner on:           one, the inquiry of a

23   reasonable jury or a rational jury, which is the

24   Government's view, versus this particular jury; and the

25   related claim that the inquiry is how this influenced

 1   the deliberative process, if it was like a factor that

 2   this jury might have considered in reaching its

 3   verdict --

 4                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          I don't know how to

 5   separate out an admitted error situation.                 And let me

 6   explain why, okay?    Let's assume the facts of this case,

 7   but instead of this tape recording, the improperly

 8   admitted evidence was a confession by the defendant.

 9   Would you be prepared to say that in a circumstantial

10   case of guilt -- now, we've already said that

11   confessions are one of the most powerful pieces of

12   harmful error -- that in this, in a confession, that

13   somehow this was still harmful -- harmless?

14                 MR. YANG:    Are we taking Marina's testimony

15   out now?

16                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Yes.     Yes.

17                 MR. YANG:    Okay.         If Marina's testimony was

18   not in and you had the evidence here -- now, an

19   unconstitutional confession, of course, would raise the

20   bar, right?

21                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          That's a different

22   standard.

23                 MR. YANG:    We're going to --

24                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Let's -- let's talk

25   about it under the Kehota standard.               Let's talk about

 1   the standard we're assessing.

 2                 MR. YANG:    If you're -- all you're asking is

 3   a fair assurance, then I think you could get to the same

 4   result here, because what you -- when you take Marina's

 5   testimony out of the picture, there was really no

 6   defense at all.    What the government had was a strong

 7   case --

 8                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         No, no, no.   He

 9   testifies, but he testifies to everything Marina said.

10   Meaning, he -- when I used the word "confession," I'm

11   sorry, I misspoke.

12                 He takes the stand.         He -- or doesn't take

13   the stand.    He says everything he said to the police.

14   And that confession that he was there, et cetera --

15                 MR. YANG:    So, he testified to the substance

16   of Marina's testimony, that he happened to just drive

17   there?

18                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         She called him --

19                 MR. YANG:    Right.

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- et cetera.

21                 MR. YANG:    And then the error is the same

22   error?

23                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         It was improperly

24   admitted.    Without Miranda --

 2                 MR. YANG:    The tapes?

 3                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Uh-huh.   Not the tapes,

 4   just the story.

 5                 MR. YANG:    I'm a little confused --

 6                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         All right.

 7                 MR. YANG:    -- because if he's testifying in

 8   court, the government is not putting him on.           He's going

 9   on as -- there's no Miranda question or anything.

10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         My hypothetical is not

11   working for this reason, and I understand what you're

12   saying.   It's hard to identify a comparable mistake.

13   But my point is that -- doesn't the harmfulness of the

14   error sort of vary with the strength of the government's

15   case?

16                 MR. YANG:    Undoubtedly. I think that's right.

17   Now, let --

18                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         If he had not run away,

19   and the tapes were admitted --

20                 MR. YANG:    We would have a weaker case, and

21   it would be -- ultimately, these lines that the Court

22   has to draw between a fair assurance or harmless beyond

23   a reasonable doubt are guides to reasoned judgment by

24   the court of appeals.      The Court has repeatedly

25   recognized that this is a reviewing court's judgment

 1   based on the record.

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Exactly.

 3                MR. YANG:     Now -- now --

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          And what the defense

 5   said was there's only one defense here, and it's the

 6   wife's defense that he was there by accident, not

 7   intentionally.    There was a lot of countervailing

 8   evidence to disprove that, but the question is could a

 9   reasonable jury have -- might have or could have

10   credited that defense?

11                MR. YANG:     Well, I'm not sure that that's

12   Petitioner's view.    I mean, I would -- there's two

13   aspects to this case.      We can talk about the fact-bound

14   ins and outs of that, which is interesting in its own

15   right.   But I think one of the key legal questions for

16   the Court is what's the standard that the Court must

17   apply.   And there's a real difference between

18   Petitioner's and the Government here.

19                And that standard the Petitioner has

20   advocated is that this jury, as opposed to the

21   reasonable jury, and that looking at this jury, you must

22   look at the thought process of this jury to decide

23   whether the error might have had some influence.

24                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          No, you look at how the

25   case was tried.

                                                                        35
 1               MR. YANG:     Well, no, I think the position

 2   about this jury versus a rational jury, in looking at

 3   the deliberative process, is entirely foreclosed by this

 4   Court's decision in Shinseki.

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But, Mr. Yang --

 6               JUSTICE KAGAN:        Well, you just told me it

 7   wasn't, Mr. Yang.   Because -- well, I think that the --

 8   that the reason why this jury versus a reasonable jury

 9   is important is whether you're going to take into

10   account what you know about what this jury did:            how

11   long it stayed out, what notes it wrote to the court,

12   what eventual verdict it reached.

13               And you just suggested to me that that was

14   fair game to consider in this analysis, although one

15   should be cautious about doing it.

16               MR. YANG:     I should qualify that.        I didn't

17   intend to give the Court the misconception that we're

18   looking at this jury.     The ultimate question is whether

19   a rational jury would have convicted absent the error.

20               JUSTICE KAGAN:        Well, a rational jury is not

21   the jury that I said stayed out for 8 days and sent back

22   a note on the 7th day.     That's this jury.

23               MR. YANG:     And the reason that I believe

24   that the Court can use that as a benchmark to look back

25   at the evidence is it is some indication of perhaps what


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official

                                                                        36
 1   the evidence should be saying to a rational jury.         But

 2   the ultimate question is the rational jury.

 3               And let me give you a few examples from the

 4   Court's case law, because I think this really puts it

 5   beyond dispute that the real question is the question of

 6   a rational jury, what they would do absent the error.

 7               First, in Neder the Court explained that

 8   erroneous admissions of evidence or exclusions of

 9   evidence, just like an erroneous instruction on an

10   element of the offense, or failure to instruct on a

11   necessary element of the offense as was the case in

12   Neder, will infringe on the jury's factfinding role and

13   will affect the deliberative process in ways that are

14   not readily calculable.

15               The error in Neder was that the jury was

16   instructed not to consider the question of materiality,

17   which was an essential element of the defense.         And the

18   Court specifically rejected that the -- that the fact

19   that this jury didn't actually make a finding based on

20   the evidence was not -- did not foreclose harmless-error

21   analysis.

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          You're going back then to

23   your position in your brief where you said that you

24   would not include, in the harmless-error calculus, that

25   the jury requested to hear Marina's testimony again, the


                        Alderson Reporting Company

                                                                               37
 1   length of their deliberations, the divided verdict?                 You

 2   said in your brief, at pages 32 to 35, that you would

 3   not include those.

 4                MR. YANG:      That's right.          Those types of

 5   indications are entirely unreliable and --

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But I thought you

 7   answered Justice Kagan that you could take them into

 8   account, the court could take them into account but

 9   cautiously, not give them -- not give them undue weight.

10                MR. YANG:      What I think the court should do

11   is when you have a -- what is a much better indication

12   or at least a -- of what this jury might have been

13   doing, you use that as a reason to go back and look

14   again at the evidence.

15                JUSTICE BREYER:         I suspect --

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Suppose you have a case in

17   which, after the verdict of guilty, there's a motion for

18   a new trial, and it's being heard by the trial judge,

19   and the trial judge said:         I now acknowledge that this

20   court committed error in introducing item 10 in

21   evidence.   And the court remembers that when this came

22   into evidence, the courtroom was quiet, the jury was

23   transfixed, jurors were weeping.             This was the high

24   point of the trial.

25                That's wrong for the judge to say.              All he


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                        38
 1   has to say is, well, I have to ask whether items 9 -- 1

 2   through 9 would have been in, and some other jury, a

 3   rational jury -- so, that's the end of it.          Judges do

 4   the -- do what I suggested all the time.

 5                MR. YANG:    Well, we think that, again, the

 6   -- the inquiry that needs to be focused on is what a

 7   rational jury would do.      And let me give you an

 8   example --

 9                JUSTICE KAGAN:       That's starting to look, Mr.

10   Yang, very much like a directed verdict for the

11   government on the part of a judge, because you're so

12   abstracting it from this case and this jury and what

13   this jury's reactions to everything that happened was

14   that, you know, why not just go to the directed verdict

15   route?

16                MR. YANG:    This Court has repeatedly

17   rejected that.   The reason it's not a directed verdict

18   is you have a jury verdict.        You have a jury verdict

19   that beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury has factually

20   determined that this defendant is guilty of the offense

21   charged, on proper instructions.           Then the question is:

22   What remedy do you have?

23                JUSTICE KAGAN:       You do have a jury -- excuse

24   me.   You do have a jury verdict, but you are giving us a

25   formulation of the test that essentially pretends that


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                            39
 1   the jury is not there and that we know nothing about how

 2   it reacted to various things.

 3                 MR. YANG:     The reason --

 4                 JUSTICE KAGAN:        Sorry.         A question mark.

 5                 (Laughter.)

 6                 MR. YANG:     This I think can be answered if I

 7   could just get out a few of the Court's cases, because I

 8   think this shows the Court's rationale here and shows

 9   that our view has to be the right view.

10                 For instance, in a series of cases, this

11   Court has concluded that the unconstitutional admission

12   of a confession, either of the defendant or the

13   codefendant, can be harmless when there is overwhelming

14   evidence such that a rational jury would convict without

15   the evidence.

16                 Now, if we're looking at what a jury would

17   have considered, whether they were brought to tears or

18   whatever, when you're talking about a confession,

19   there's no doubt that a rational jury or any jury is

20   going to have that far in the forefront of their minds

21   when they are deciding guilt or innocence.                But the

22   question --

23                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Counsel, I just don't

24   see how you can do it without the error.                I keep going

25   back to this point.      How about if the prosecutor had


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                             40
 1   done in summation the following:             Ladies and Gentlemen,

 2   whatever the wife told you disbelieve because the lawyer

 3   said he was guilty.

 4               MR. YANG:       I'm sorry.        I just --

 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            The lawyer -- the

 6   prosecutor got up at the end of trial and said:

 7   Disbelieve everything the wife told you, because the

 8   lawyer said the defendant was guilty.              All right?   I'll

 9   go through all the other evidence I have that might

10   prove that she was not telling the truth, but the

11   central, most important piece of evidence in this case

12   about his guilt is that the lawyer said he's guilty.

13               Can you say that this jury was uninfluenced

14   by that error?

15               MR. YANG:       No.

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Because under your

17   formulation --

18               MR. YANG:       No.     You can't --

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            -- a rational jury would

20   have convicted absent the lawyer saying that.

21               MR. YANG:       That's right.          But this Court has

22   repeatedly said, for instance in Rose, where the

23   question was the jury was told to presume certain malice

24   in a -- in a homicide, the fact that the error may have

25   altered the basis on which the jury decided the case is


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                              41
 1   not the question; you look to the reasonable juror.

 2                Similarly in Pope, the Court said the

 3   question does not turn on whether the jury did not, in

 4   fact, have this error in mind when it found the

 5   defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, because --

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            You would -- you would

 7   take into account that the prosecution apparently

 8   thought this was important, so important.               The trial was

 9   over.   The prosecutor said:         Judge, I'd like to come

10   back so these tapes can be introduced.

11                That -- the -- we have the witness

12   testifying that defendant is there by chance; he was not

13   part of the scheme.      We have no direct evidence, because

14   Cruz never spoke to this defendant, to Vasquez.               He's at

15   the scene, we know that.        And an explanation, an

16   innocent explanation, is given why he's at the scene.

17   And then the government comes back, after everything is

18   done, and says:   We want the jury -- we want these tapes

19   to be before the jury.

20                Isn't that -- don't we take into account

21   that the government itself thought this was very

22   important?

23                MR. YANG:      I -- I think it's a factor that

24   you consider, again, in directing the courts look at

25   really what the trial evidence was.                I mean it, I think,


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                         42
 1   belies the facts of this case -- obviously, that's a

 2   hypothetical.   But when you look at how cases really

 3   develop, prosecutors don't focus on a fleeting, you

 4   know, sentence in a series of -- series of long tapes

 5   that weren't transcribed --

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But my point to you is it

 7   wasn't fleeting if the government says we want to extend

 8   the trial so that we can play these tapes, all of them.

 9   And they contain not just the one statement.          There's

10   the one statement that the trial will be bad, a trial

11   will be bad for all of them, and they all -- that --

12   they should take a blind plea.

13               MR. YANG:     I think when you look at what

14   happened at trial, you see that the tapes were played

15   for two reasons:   one, to show that Marina had bias

16   because she was told by Petitioner's counsel that

17   Petitioner's counsel -- well, she thought this --

18   Petitioner's counsel would be able to make motions and

19   arguments on behalf of her husband at sentencing.

20   And --

21               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          The dissent pointed out

22   that she admitted that before the tapes were played.

23               MR. YANG:     Correct.

24               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          That she was testifying

25   in the hopes of getting a lesser sentence for her


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                         43
 1   husband.   So, she -- the tapes weren't necessary for

 2   that.

 3                MR. YANG:    Well, the tapes certainly were

 4   reinforcing of that.     And, in fact, when the

 5   government's closing argument -- it did not reference

 6   anything about this -- what I think you and

 7   Justice Breyer correctly identified as a very ambiguous

 8   sentence in a series of long tapes.              And, remember,

 9   these --

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          What was --

11                MR. YANG: -- the transcripts that are in the

12   record are only one portion of the tapes.              So --

13                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          What was your second --

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          What was the line that

15   the government, the prosecutor, repeated three times

16   while she was on the stand, the exact line?

17                MR. YANG:    The exact lines?

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Yes.

19                MR. YANG:    This is --

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          The government thought --

21   thought it was important for the jury to hear it,

22   because they said it three times.

23                MR. YANG:    Well, to be fair, I think you

24   need to look at what's before and after it.              The

25   government is focusing on three different statements


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                             44
 1   that are at issue in the case.

 2               The first one is that -- with some

 3   profanity, suggesting that her husband is not likely to

 4   succeed at trial.   The second one is that defense

 5   counsel suggested -- that she said that defense counsel

 6   suggested that everybody was going to lose.              And then,

 7   third, she thought everybody was in, again with

 8   profanity -- I'm going to paraphrase -- a bad situation.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Mr. Yang, why does any of

10   this have to do with her credibility?              Did the dissent

11   say that the way this affected the jury was that it

12   rendered her less credible?        I thought --

13               MR. YANG:     The --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- that the dissent just

15   said it's bad to tell the jury that even the defendant

16   thought he was guilty -- or even the defendant's lawyer

17   thought he was going to lose.

18               MR. YANG:     The reason that this was in --

19   and I don't -- it's not contested here -- is because the

20   argument was made that these statements equating

21   Petitioner and Perez in terms of their level of guilt or

22   their likelihood of being convicted is inconsistent with

23   Marina's subsequent testimony that all of us -- you

24   know, Vasquez just -- or Petitioner just showed up

25   unknowingly because she asked him.               That was the theory.

 1                 It's not contested.         And, in fact, nothing

 2   that the jury heard in this case under Petitioner's

 3   theory would be different.         The only difference would be

 4   a limiting instruction that would simply say you can't

 5   take these statements for the truth of the matter.

 6                 So, nothing that the jury heard would have

 7   been different.    When you read the short passage in the

 8   context of these tapes -- and the tapes, again, are not

 9   fully transcribed.    Petitioner asked for the entire

10   tapes to come in at the -- at the tail end of the trial,

11   which -- which was -- based on the government's showing

12   that was uncontested that Petitioner was at the scene,

13   he drove the $23,000 there, he waited with Perez and

14   Cruz while the informant was coming back, he was there

15   when the call was made to the informant that said they

16   had the money.

17                 Now, there's some dispute over whether he

18   said that, but certainly he was there when that call was

19   made because that's what triggered the raid.               All of

20   that was basically undisputed.           You've got all these

21   calls that tie Petitioner to Perez -- to Perez,

22   27 calls --

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              You're going over

24   the evidence.    And I may simply be asking the same

25   question Justice Kennedy asked earlier.               But let's say

 1   you have a situation where it's the same thing, and at

 2   the -- you, know, and the improperly admitted evidence

 3   has the defendant saying:         I'm guilty, I'm guilty.       And

 7   And the jury goes out and comes back in 2 minutes:              You

 8   know, the guy said he was guilty.

 9                  Is that a situation in which we're supposed

10   to then go back, look at all the complicated evidence,

11   and see if a jury would have convicted?             Or can we with

12   a fair degree of confidence say that the error is what

13   led the jury to convict?

14                  MR. YANG:    Well, I think the former, but let

15   me explain.    And again, I'm going to go back to Neder,

16   if I may, for a second.        In Neder, the jury never found

17   an element of the offense.          Never did.     There's no

18   question that the jury's verdict was affected by the

19   failure to instruct.       In fact, it was not just a failure

20   to instruct.    The district court told the jury this is

21   not for them to consider.         And --

22                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       But critical to the Court's

23   view in that case was that the -- the defendant could

24   not have contested that element.

25                  MR. YANG:    Well, but if we're -- again, if

 1   we're focusing on the legal dispute between us and the

 2   other side about whether we're looking at this jury or

 3   what a rational jury would do when you excise the --

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:       Well, I would like very

 5   much to know what your answer is to Justice Kennedy's

 6   hypothetical and the Chief Justice's.             As I understand

 7   those hypotheticals, they're trying to imagine a case --

 8                 MR. YANG:    Right.

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:       -- where the particular

10   piece of improperly admitted evidence -- we know from

11   how the jury reacted, or the kind of evidence -- it's

12   the kind of thing that could really make a difference.

13   I mean, they were in tears, et cetera.

14                 MR. YANG:    And --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:       All right.      Now, in my

16   reading of this, which I once had to read about 100

17   harmless-error cases, and it seemed to me -- and you can

18   confirm or deny this -- that in cases like that, the

19   judge who knows this is a tough case when the jury's

20   feeling this way, asks himself or herself the question,

21   could this illegally admitted evidence make a

22   difference?   Could it have made a difference in this

23   case?   Could it have?     And the answer is going to be

24   "no" where that judge thinks a reasonable jury would not

25   have thought it made a critical difference.

 1                 And that's just putting the same thing I

 2   think slightly differently.         But the answer in

 3   Justice Kennedy's case would be a judge just isn't going

 4   to think it has nothing to do with rationality.              If the

 5   jury's in tears, they're going to think it's a close

 6   case.    And, therefore, if in fact this could have made a

 7   difference, the judge says, yes, it's not harmless.

 8                 And if the judge thinks, no, it couldn't

 9   have made a difference to any rational person, he's

10   going to say "harmless."       Period.

11                 Now, that was my impression reading those

12   cases.   And I felt that those hypotheticals were getting

13   at that.   And -- use them.        Answer them rather than me,

14   because that's what I'm interested in.

15                 (Laughter.)

16                 MR. YANG:    The answer is that in a case

17   where the jury -- where you have some very provocative

18   evidence, but there's also a very strong case that

19   exists -- it may depend on the level of certainty that

20   you need to get to, whether it's a fair assurance or

21   harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.               But even in those

22   cases, you can -- if the court looks at the evidence as

23   a whole and says that there was so much evidence before

24   this stuff came in, this bad -- this error came in, that

25   a rational jury would have gotten to the same result,

 1   that it would have convicted, then --

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Suppose -- suppose the

 3   judge concludes that both this jury that I had and some

 4   hypothetical rational jury would have been so focused on

 5   this evidence that that's all they would have looked at,

 6   but if they had looked at 1 through 9, the admissible

 7   evidence, they would still have found guilt.

 8                 Is that -- is that what you're -- is that --

 9                 MR. YANG:    I think so, but let me give you

10   an example.

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           -- a proper application of

12   the -- of the framework?

13                 MR. YANG:    I think so, but it's not, again,

14   what a -- what this particular jury was doing, because

15   we know, for instance, from Neder or in the confession

16   cases, the jury hears a confession, an

17   unconstitutionally obtained confession,

18   unconstitutionally admitted, from the defendant, that is

19   going to be -- right there.         You know?     A jury -- a

20   juror could say:   Let's go home, we have a confession.

21   It's out of his own mouth.         There's very little else to

22   debate.

23                 But when the evidence is beyond that

24   confession, so overwhelming that no rational jury would

25   have gotten to a different result, and you could say


                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that with a fair assurance or if there's a

 2   constitutional error as it would be with a confession

 3   beyond a reasonable doubt, the Court says that this is

 4   harmless.

 5                  And the reason that the Court's taking that

 6   inquiry is because it recognized -- the Court's long

 7   recognized that no trial is perfect, that there are very

 8   significant costs of retrial.             And so, the premise

 9   there --

10                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But you -- you are

11   essentially saying, as I understand you, that if there

12   was such a thing as a directed verdict in a criminal

13   case, if the judge would say, you know, I will direct a

14   verdict here because there's only one way a rational --

15   rational jury could come out.

16                  MR. YANG:    This -- that argument was

17   specifically rejected by this Court in Neder.             The same

18   question came up, and in fact, Neder is a much -- more

19   difficult case for the government than this, because at

20   least in Neder, the defendant had the argument that this

21   jury could -- did not find guilt beyond reasonable doubt

22   because it was never instructed to find an element of

23   the offense.

24                  JUSTICE ALITO:       Mr. Yang, I think you may be

25   taking a harder position than you really need to.               Why

 1   shouldn't the rule be that the -- the appellate court

 2   should look at what would be done by a rational jury,

 3   except in the kind of extraordinary circumstances that

 4   have been posited by Justice Kagan's hypothetical and a

 5   few of the other questions, simply because it's so

 6   difficult to determine what a -- what the jury was

 7   actually doing?

 8                We have a rule that prohibits consideration

 9   of what goes on in the jury room.           But suppose we didn't

10   have that.   Suppose that it was all videotaped, and the

11   jury didn't know what was going on, so you could -- you

12   could watch it and see.      If that were the case, then

13   surely the rule would be what would this jury have done?

14   But most of the time, it's just speculation to tell what

15   a jury -- what they -- did they come back quickly?

16   Well, that shows that this evidence was so bad that it

17   caused them to render a quick verdict in what otherwise

18   would have been a difficult case.

19                Did they take a long time?          Well, it shows

20   it was a close case, and, therefore, any error might

21   have tipped them one way or the other.

22                You just can't tell.

23                MR. YANG:    I'm -- I don't want to resist

24   this too much, because I think we're fighting about

25   things at the very extreme.        Most of the times that


                         Alderson Reporting Company

                                                                             52
 1   we're talking about these purported indications from the

 2   jury, it's entirely ambiguous.             And the -- so, there may

 3   be well be extreme examples.             And I think those would

 4   rightfully influence a court's consideration in a case.

 5                 But, again, when you have harmless-error

 6   cases in which we know for a certainty, as in Neder,

 7   that the jury did not find an element of the offense,

 8   the inquiry has to be, it has to be, on what the Court

 9   has repeatedly said in -- this is I believe on pages 19

10   of our brief -- that the focus of the harmless-error

11   inquiry is bringing the court's attention to the fact

12   that the primary purpose of a trial is the factual

13   question of guilt or innocence.

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           And you read --

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Counsel, when you

16   began, if I'm remembering correctly, you said there were

17   two ways in which your position was different from Mr.

18   Brindley's.

19                 MR. YANG:    Right.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              One I understand is

21   that you look at a rational jury --

22                 MR. YANG:    Right.

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              -- and not the

24   particular jury.

25                 What's the second?

 1                 MR. YANG:    Well, it's related.     His focus on

 2   the -- this jury I believe is seeing whether there's

 3   some influence on the process, deliberative process,

 4   even if the outcome would have been the same absent the

 5   error.   And so, he's kind of trying to get into the

 6   minds of the jury.    And this Court has repeatedly

 7   rejected that.   Again --

 8                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Can I ask you a different

 9   question, Mr. Yang, which is, you know, this difference

10   in the formulation of the test, which I find it hard to

11   wrap my mind around, but -- and it strikes me that

12   there's two different ways of saying the same thing.

13   But I'm told that there's a fair bit of scholarship out

14   there which suggests that courts that use one

15   formulation tend to come out one way, and courts that

16   use the other formulation tend to come out the other

17   way.

18                 And I'm just wondering what your view of

19   that is, that somehow one formulation seems to put the

20   emphasis on the entire case, whereas the other

21   formulation seems to put the emphasis on only the

22   government's evidence, and that that makes a difference

23   in the end.

24                 MR. YANG:    We don't think that there is this

25   deep -- there are some disagreements or some things we


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

 1   disagree with about what courts of appeals do in any

 2   particular cases.     But with respect to this formulation

 3   of the -- I think Petitioner calls it the guilt-focused

 4   versus effect-of-the-error-focused approaches, the

 5   scholarship -- I think he relies principally on Judge

 6   Edwards' opinion about harmless error.             That came out in

 7   1995, when it was already swimming against -- upstream

 8   against this Court's harmless-error decisions.

 9                But he had in his pocket the Sullivan

10   decision, which was admittedly a structural-error case,

11   but there was language in Sullivan which suggested that

12   you need to look at what this particular jury was going

13   to do.

14                Then we have Neder and -- I can't pronounce

15   this very well -- but Recuenco.            It's the -- the

16   Apprendi application of Neder, which specifically rejects

17   this kind of broad logic in Sullivan as being

18   inconsistent with the Court's harmless-error cases.

19                Now --

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            You do agree -- you do

21   agree that the government has the burden of showing that

22   the error is harmless?

23                MR. YANG:      Yes.

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            It's the government's

25   burden.   And you also agree that we should look at the

 1   evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant in

 2   making --

 3               MR. YANG:    No.     The Court, even in -- I

 4   think most recently, the Court explained in Shinseki,

 5   talking about Kotteakos, that you don't use these kind

 6   of presumptions or rigid rules.         And the reason that you

 7   do, that you're kind of looking from the perspective of

 8   a reasonable jury, is the jury has in fact found the

 9   defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.             And then

10   the question is, are you setting aside that verdict

11   because -- do you think that this error was the thing

12   that tipped the scales from not guilty to guilty?               And

13   so, taking a look at the evidence, kind of with all

14   presumptions favoring one side or the other, is not how

15   this Court has conducted the --

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          So, what does it mean

17   that the government has the burden?             What does the

18   government have to do?

19               MR. YANG:    The government has to show, as --

20   this is the formulation in Neder and which the Court has

21   said in Neder is the same thing that applied in

22   erroneous admissions or exclusions of evidence, that a

23   rational jury would have found the defendant guilty

24   absent the error, and that involves the three core

25   elements we explained in our brief.             And then the Court

 1   takes into account --

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           The absent error.     So,

 3   that means -- wait.      You look at just the evidence

 4   that's not tainted?

 5                 MR. YANG:     In some cases you can do that,

 6   where the evidence is so overwhelming -- if I -- if I

 7   may finish.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Briefly.

 9                 MR. YANG:     Briefly.        In some cases, you

10   might do that.   In other cases where it's close or the

11   evidence is not so strong, you need to look at the error

12   to see if that error was going to be a dispositive thing

13   in getting to guilt.

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            The Chief Justice allowed

15   me to ask one question.        Could I amend your statement so

16   that you would say a rational jury in all the

17   circumstances of this case, given what this jury heard,

18   would have?

19                 MR. YANG:     Yes.     It's -- in the position of

20   this jury, based on the evidence presented to the jury,

21   correct.

25                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1               MR. BRINDLEY:      I first want to address

 2   Neder, which Government counsel continually referenced.

 3   Neder talks about the reasonable jury, but Neder also

 4   limits itself to situations where the evidence is

 5   uncontroverted and inconvertible, I think because in

 6   those situations the difference between the reasonable

 7   jury and this jury would be deemed to be nonexistent

 8   because it would be impossible for the error to have an

 9   impact.

10               Secondly, I think it's important to note

11   from Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical, if you don't

12   consider the error, then even that extreme case, that

13   would have to be ignored.      And so, I think the

14   Government's formulation and the formulation used by the

15   appellate court below would justify -- would lead to

16   that bad conclusion.

17               I also think that when you do that

18   formulation, where you're talking about the reasonable

19   jury and absence of error, the reason those cases come

20   out different is because those courts think they don't

21   have to address the error, which is I think what

22   happened in the majority below, why they didn't address

23   it despite the dissent.

24               The other thing I think it's important to

25   note is the reason you have to look at the error and its

                                                                    58
 1   possible impact and not just whether you could be

 2   convicted on the other evidence is because you say,

 3   well, he could be convicted on the other evidence.        If

 4   that's all that you're saying and you -- and it's not on

 5   the evidence which could independently in this case be a

 6   reason to convict, then I think you're making that guilt

 7   determination that this Court says is not supposed to

 8   happen.   And I think the majority's opinion below is

 9   consistent with that approach, and there's nothing in it

10   to suggest that's not exactly what they did.

11                 I also think that in the end -- there was a

12   mention of the limiting instruction; a limiting

13   instruction would have cured this problem.        We assume

14   juries would follow it.       That means they wouldn't have

15   concluded that his lawyer thought him guilty and then

16   put Mrs. Perez on the stand and concluded she wasn't

17   telling the truth.

18                 What this error allows, what -- if taken for

19   its truth, a jury could believe that he confessed to his

20   lawyer.   They could disregard everything that was said

21   on his behalf.   They could say we know that he's guilty;

22   his lawyer knew he was guilty; we can convict him on

23   that basis.   That's an error that can infect the

24   entirety of the proceedings.

25                 And if you look at this jury and what they

 1   heard, and the question comes down to whether Mrs. Perez

 2   is credible or not, there is nothing in this record the

 3   Government can point to that would allow a reviewing

 4   court to make that determination.            A reviewing court

 5   that didn't see --

 6                JUSTICE ALITO:        Did the panel majority in --

 7   did the panel majority in this case say anything that

 8   differs from what this Court has said about harmless

 9   error?   If we were to reverse, what would we point to in

10   the panel majority's opinion that was erroneous?

11                MR. BRINDLEY:       I think you would point to

12   that first statement of the test where they say whether

13   the reasonable jury would convict him absent the error,

14   because Kotteakos says you can't strip the error out.

15   This Court has never overruled Kotteakos.

16                The other thing --

17                JUSTICE ALITO:        Hasn't this Court said

18   exactly what Seventh Circuit said there?             In other

19   cases?

20                MR. BRINDLEY:       This Court has used, I think,

21   dicta that has language of that sort.             But in those

22   cases, what the Court does -- like in Harrington, they

23   look at what the error was; they put it in the context

24   of the whole case, and they can say the government could

25   prove the jury didn't look at this to the right degree

 1   of assurance, because it was cumulative, because --

 2   there's no -- there's nothing --

 3                JUSTICE ALITO:       You want us to say -- you

 4   want us to say we're reversing you, Seventh Circuit

 5   panel, because you said what we have said in prior

 6   cases, but we were wrong?

 7                MR. BRINDLEY:      I think the reason to reverse

 8   them is because that formulation has proven to lead to

 9   the wrong analysis, in all of these lower courts, this

10   guilt-based approach; and it is not the law of

11   Kotteakos.   This Court has never overruled Kotteakos.

12                And to focus on it allows a guilt

13   determination by a reviewing court that would be

14   violative of the Sixth Amendment that this Court was

15   concerned about in Kotteakos, that this Court was

16   concerned about in Sullivan, that this Court was even

17   concerned about in Neder, outside the scope of cases

18   where the evidence is uncontestable.

19                Because if you took these statements as true

20   and then you came down to a question, well, is Marina

21   credible or not, Mrs. Perez, there's nothing the

22   government can do on this record to prove that the jury

23   would have found her credibility differently because

24   this Court can't figure that out on a cold record.

25                It said so, many times.             It's not possible
