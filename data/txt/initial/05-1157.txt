 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 We'll hear argument

 4   this morning in case 05-1157, Credit Suisse Securities

 5   versus Billing, et al.

 6                 Mr. Shapiro.

 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO,

 8                      ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

 9                 MR. SHAPIRO:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10   and may it please the Court:

11                 The pivotal question in this case is whether

12   this Court's decisions in Gordon and NASD require

13   implied antitrust immunity as the district court

14   believed.     And we submit that the answer is yes.               The

15   '33 and '34 acts were of course passed for the very

16   purpose of regulating IPOs and alleged market

17   manipulation.     And this Court has referred to these laws

18   as the anchor of Federal economic policy in the

19   securities field.     And under these laws the SEC has laid

20   down detailed regulations applicable to the very

21   practices that are at issue in this case with active

22   supervision by the SEC and the NASD.

23                 And it has done this with full understanding

24   that syndicated underwriting is inherently concerted

25   action.     An underwriting requires joint action in


                                          3

 1   accumulating information and setting the price of the

 2   offering along with allotting shares to customers.

 3              Now the Gordon and NASD cases apply directly

 4   here because of the danger of inconsistency and conflict

 5   which the SEC cited.     As in cases of this Court in the

 6   past, like NASD and Gordon and later Trinko, Congress

 7   required this expert administrative agency to take

 8   competition into account when issuing its standards.

 9   And review in antitrust courts across the country would

10   once again raise the danger of false positives and

11   conflicts and wasteful redundancy.

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Did it, did it specifically

13   state that, or is it that or just the principle that all

14   Federal agencies have an obligation to --

15              MR. SHAPIRO:         Oh, no, Your Honor, it is very

16   express in 75 and then again in the 96.                Capital

17   formation, investor protection and competition have to

18   be weighed against each other by the SEC, and in Gordon

19   this Court attached great importance to that standard,

20   which differs from the competition first standard of,

21   the antitrust laws impose.

22              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Shapiro, to what

23   extent has the SEC regulated the specific

24   vertical restraints that are alleged here?

25              MR. SHAPIRO:         The SEC regulates the -- the


                                       4

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   alleged tie-ins and it regulates the alleged excessive

 2   compensation claims.

 3              JUSTICE STEVENS:              And laddering, for

 4   example?

 5              MR. SHAPIRO:          Laddering, tying, and

 6   excessive compensation.        And it's had a number of

 7   enforcement actions.      Its regulation M is focused

 8   exactly on those practices.             It's issued very detailed

 9   guidance in a document that we attach to our petition

10   appendix on what constitutes --

11              JUSTICE STEVENS:             And are we to assume that

12   if the allegations are true, which they of course may

13   not be, that this is a violation of the -- of the

14   securities laws?

15              MR. SHAPIRO:          Well the SEC has said it

16   depends on the circumstances.             And they draw very fine

17   lines in this area, Your Honor.

18              And if, in fact, the SEC concludes it is a

19   tie-in under its finely calibrated standards, then yes.

20   But that's the critical issue here.                     It is very easy to

21   term these things excessive compensation or tie-ins, but

22   when the NASD looked at a real complaint of this sort in

23   the Invemed case it found that there was no excessive

24   compensation and no commercial bribery.                     And --

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              How about in this case


                                        5

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Did the SEC examine that question at all in this case?

 2   And did it take any position?

 3              MR. SHAPIRO:         In this case it took no

 4   position on the merit of the underlying claims, but it

 5   said that there would be serious problems if antitrust

 6   law were applied to these allegations.                 It would

 7   interfere with the agency's ability to define what is

 8   manipulation and to amend its definitions.                 It has

 9   ongoing rulemaking proceedings right now addressed to

10   this issue; and it said further that it would discourage

11   underwriters from going up to the line of prohibition,

12   which is very important in this area.

13              Because if they don't step over the line and

14   they engage in book building conversations, that's

15   critical to setting the right price for the IPO.                  And so

16   --

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How should we, we

18   weigh -- Congress is asking with respect to securities,

19   private securities litigation, Congress looked at that

20   and thought some restraint had to be placed on private

21   actions, but it didn't do anything with respect to

22   antitrust private action.

23              MR. SHAPIRO:         We think part of the

24   repugnance analysis here should focus on the fact that

25   these securities claims have simply been repleaded as


                                       6

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   antitrust claims.    Congress wasn't aware of any problem

 2   of this sort; nobody had attempted to replead securities

 3   violations like tie-ins and excessive compensation as

 4   antitrust claims.    And Congress of course relied --

 5               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Doesn't, doesn't the

 6   statute specifically provide for -- for exactly this

 7   possibility?   Doesn't both the '33 and the '34 act have

 8   a saving other remedies clause?

 9               MR. SHAPIRO:          It doesn't refer to antitrust

10   cases.   Those were references to state law remedies that

11   Congress later contracted with the --

12               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Was it -- were those two

13   clauses expressly limited to state law remedies?

14               MR. SHAPIRO:          No.      They referred to other

15   claims, Your Honor, but they don't refer to antitrust.

16   So we don't believe --

17               JUSTICE SOUTER:              But do they have to?

18               MR. SHAPIRO:          We don't believe --

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:              None of the claims includes

20   an antitrust claim on its face.

21               JUSTICE SOUTER:              Well, we think -- we think

22   they don't apply to antitrust, and in Gordon and NASD

23   those same provisions were in place but that didn't

24   deter the Court from finding them --

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:              I don't even think we


                                         7

 1   mentioned them.    Did we mention them?

 2               MR. SHAPIRO:          Pardon me?

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Did we mention them in

 4   those cases?

 5               MR. SHAPIRO:          I don't believe the Court did.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, maybe we just forgot.

 7               (Laughter.)

 8               MR. SHAPIRO:          They -- well, they -- they

 9   don't pertain to antitrust.              If you look at the history

10   of those provisions they are talking about state causes

11   of action and there's no reference to antitrust as such

12   in them.

13               That's quite different from Trinko where

14   there was an antitrust savings clause that went on in

15   detail about saving the antitrust cause of action.

16               The danger of conflict that the SEC is

17   talking about here is an acute danger to its ability to

18   --

19               JUSTICE BREYER:              What happened in respect to

20   the SEC?   What about primary jurisdiction?              That's what

21   I wondered as I read this.           Nobody mentions it.      But

22   there's certainly a lot of precedent in the area in this

23   kind of thing.    You ask the agency, have to go to the

24   agency, see what they say.

25               MR. SHAPIRO:          Well, Your Honor, the reason


                                         8

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   it doesn't get mentioned is in that Gordon the Court

 2   held primary jurisdiction was not a fix for this kind of

 3   conflict.   And here the SEC has expressed its opinion in

 4   its amicus briefs already.          The Court is aware of those

 5   positions laid out in our cert petition --

 6               JUSTICE STEVENS:            The allegations in this

 7   are quite different from Gordon.               There you have got a

 8   horizontal -- allegedly horizontal agreement.                 Here you

 9   have got a vertical agreement which it seems to me

10   depends on non-disclosure for it work at all.                 If there

11   been full disclosure of all these laddering and

12   flippings I don't see how in the world you would ever

13   get a -- an antitrust violation.

14               MR. SHAPIRO:         Well, Your Honor, the conflict

15   is different, but it's really quite a more serious

16   conflict than it was in Gordon.              In Gordon the only

17   concern was the SEC might reinstitute fixed rates in the

18   future, and it never did that in 30 years.                 Here the SEC

19   says the conflict goes to our ability to define

20   manipulation and to amend our rules which we're in the

21   process of doing and we can't have conduct deterred.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, Mr. Shapiro,

23   you're doing a good job of defending the SEC's interests

24   but your position goes considerably beyond their

25   position today.

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              MR. SHAPIRO:         Well, the SEC in the lower

 2   courts advocated dismissal of the complaints; and in the

 3   Supreme Court, of course, they've -- they've urged for a

 4   vacator of the lower court decision.                   And the brief of

 5   the SG echoes many of the concerns that the SEC

 6   expressed in the lower courts.

 7              JUSTICE BREYER:            That's why I wonder about

 8   primary jurisdiction.     You put a burden on the, on the

 9   plaintiffs to go to the agency and the agency could take

10   a range of positions.     It might say this is absolutely

11   unlawful, BUT it's close enough we think an antitrust

12   court has no business mucking around in this.                  Or it's

13   unlawful and we don't care.           Or, it's not -- in which

14   case they could bring their suit.               Or it's -- it's not

15   unlawful but we don't care, or it's not unlawful and we

16   do care.

17              I mean, there is a range of positions they

18   could take which was the purpose of the primary

19   jurisdiction doctrine, to see in the context of the

20   particular conduct, not general but in the context of

21   the particular conduct, what the agency thought about

22   this in terms of its regulatory mission.

23              MR. SHAPIRO:         Well, I think Gordon is very

24   informative on that point.         It rejected primary

25   jurisdiction because the agency's views were already


                                      10
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   known to the Court.     Here the SEC has filed a 40-page

 2   submission in the district court explaining that the

 3   suit has to be dismissed because of conflict with the

 4   administrative scheme.

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:             That's in respect to the

 6   particular conduct at issue here.

 7              MR. SHAPIRO:          Absolutely.            The particular

 8   conduct at issue --

 9              JUSTICE BREYER:             Of course the Petitioners

10   have not had an opportunity, I would think -- they filed

11   a complaint.   But they've not had an opportunity to

12   argue this out in front of the SEC with particular

13   evidence, with particular witnesses, et cetera.

14              MR. SHAPIRO:          Well, what this Court said in

15   Gordon was that it's a legal question whether there is

16   potential interference with the administrative scheme

17   for us to decide the SEC's views are entitled to

18   considerable deference, the Court said.                  But if they've

19   been submitted in the form of amicus briefs, that is

20   sufficient to demonstrate the repugnance.

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:             I suppose if primary

22   jurisdiction were a cure-all, there would never be any

23   cases in which the regulatory scheme did not displace

24   the antitrust laws.

25              MR. SHAPIRO:          That's absolutely right.           In


                                       11

 1   that case, where the Court did refer an antitrust issue,

 2   the agency declined to take the reference.             And

 3   here there there was a factual issue the agency was

 4   supposed to opine on.     Here we have a pure legal

 5   question, the Court has held, of potential repugnance

 6   with the SEC scheme.     That's for the Court to decide.

 7              JUSTICE STEVENS:            The difference between

 8   this case and Gordon is that this case, the heart of

 9   their allegations are failure to disclose which is

10   quintessentially the SEC's business, making sure

11   disclosures are right.      I don't think if there were

12   disclosure, they would have a problem in this case.                  Am

13   I missing something on that?

14              MR. SHAPIRO:         Well, what the SEC says is

15   that if the conduct is ordinary book building,

16   communications about future transactions, at future

17   prices, there's no misconduct to be disclosed.               It is

18   perfectly permissible.

19              JUSTICE STEVENS:            The allegation in the

20   complaint is there was no disclosure.

21              MR. SHAPIRO:         The complaint alleges an

22   antitrust violation.     Just that there was agreement to

23   engage in tie-ins, and an agreement not to --

24              JUSTICE STEVENS:            The allegation is the

25   agreement -- the agreement not to disclose.

 1               MR. SHAPIRO:         That certainly highlights why

 2   this is an SEC case and not an antitrust case, it seems

 3   to me, because that -- disclosure is for this

 4   administrative agency to wrestle with, and it has made

 5   clear that investor welfare will be harmed and issuer

 6   welfare will be harmed if these sensitive questions are

 7   taken from it and are frozen by antitrust judgments.

 8   That was the problem the Court faced in NASD and it was

 9   the problem the Court faced in Gordon.

10               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Let me just ask one more

11   question, Mr. Shapiro.       Supposing there had been full

12   disclosure here.   Do you think there would be an

13   antitrust violation?

14               MR. SHAPIRO:         Well, in part, I would say

15   yes, there was an agreement in restraint of trade --

16               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Agreeing on what the --

17               MR. SHAPIRO:         Yeah, that's their theory.

18               JUSTICE STEVENS:            The preliminary before the

19   IPO.   But what they did after the IPO, would that

20   violate the antitrust laws?

21               MR. SHAPIRO:         Really what they are alleging

22   is a conspiracy to violate the securities laws here,

23   that had some -- what they claim, a market effect.            And

24   it is the agreement that they contend is an unreasonable

25   restraint of trade or they refer to the compensation

 1   payments as excessive commercial bribes.                 They say that

 2   violates the Robinson-Patman Act.

 3                The trouble is no matter how you phrase

 4   this, no matter how they could amend their pleading,

 5   inherent in the case are challenges to tie-ins and

 6   alleged excessive compensation payments that under the

 7   securities laws have to be regulated by the SEC.                 The

 8   Government has to speak with one voice on this issue

 9   under one set of standards, or administrative law gets

10   frozen.   And there's a huge deterrent effect on

11   underwriters.

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Are there many situations

13   in which a particular industry is subject to regulators

14   and they sometimes conflict?            Like EPA and OSHA?

15                MR. SHAPIRO:        Oh, yes.          Under these two

16   decisions of the Court, NASD and Gordon, there has to be

17   active supervision or pervasive regulation by the

18   agency, and then a direct conflict with what the SEC is

19   trying to accomplish.

20                There are a number of things that can be

21   regulated even under the antitrust laws under those

22   standards.   NASD and Gordon didn't stop all antitrust

23   litigation in its tracks.          Only things that were within

24   the agency's supervisory jurisdiction to present --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:           The EPA is not a hands-on

 1   regulatory agency the way the SEC is.                      It has not been

 2   given an entire industry to regulate.

 3                 MR. SHAPIRO:         I think that's right, Your

 4   Honor.     The '33 Act, if you look at the Act, every

 5   provision in it is focused on IPOs.                       It is state of the

 6   art comprehensive legislation.                The '34 Act in three

 7   separate provisions gives the SEC power to define

 8   manipulation.     Then it has rulemaking power and then it

 9   has exemption power.        This is comprehensive.                 It is far

10   more pervasive than the kind of regulation that was

11   before the Court in NASD.            In that case, there was just

12   unexercised rulemaking power.               Here we have got

13   voluminous regulations, we have interpretations, we have

14   many enforcement actions aimed at this very same

15   conduct.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, the Government says

17   that's fine where the regulations have been issued, and

18   where they -- where they render the action here lawful.

19   There's no -- no problemo.            What's wrong with that?

20                 MR. SHAPIRO:         Well, the Government says --

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            The Government's willing,

22   in other words, to give the SEC carte blanche.                      Whatever

23   you say is lawful is lawful that won't violate the

24   antitrust laws.

25                 MR. SHAPIRO:         We think immunity extends

 1   beyond what is expressly permitted by the SEC.                     The way

 2   the Court phrased it in NASD was things that are

 3   connected to the agency's regulatory responsibility have

 4   to be immunized to allow the agency to do its task.                      And

 5   that extends a little bit further than the permission

 6   standard that the Government has given.

 7               And there --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Extends a lot further, I

 9   would think.

10               MR. SHAPIRO:         I would think it does.              I

11   would think the NASD case would come out the other way

12   under the standard the SG is using today.                     But we think

13   we win under the inextricably intertwined standard,

14   because all of this conduct is closely connected to what

15   is permissible.   There's a very fine line between what

16   is forbidden and what is permitted.                     They can ask about

17   future market prices.      They can give the IPOs to their

18   best customers, but they can't solicit a transaction in

19   the immediate aftermarket while the IPO is still --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:            So we could decide that

21   way.   We could say, we don't have to decide what the

22   standard is, even if it is inextricably intertwined as

23   the Government does, you would win, you would be

24   happy --

25               MR. SHAPIRO:         We would win under either of

 1   these standards.     But what we advocate is dismissal with

 2   prejudice, which is the relief the Court gave in the

 3   NASD case, and not a shapeless remand of the case for

 4   further pleading.     And the reason for that is that the

 5   interference would overhang the market.                     The

 6   interference would affect the SEC's ability to lay down

 7   the standards and encourage conduct going up to the line

 8   of prohibition.

 9                 And the remedy that the Court approved in

10   NASD is exactly appropriate here, dismissal with

11   prejudice.     These plaintiffs did not even seek to amend

12   their complaints in the lower courts.                     Under Second

13   Circuit law, they've waived their right to seek an

14   amendment.     So we, in sum, urge the Court to stick with

15   its own standards in NASD and Gordon.                     The standards are

16   not broken.    They don't need to be fixed.                   Nobody has

17   pointed to any changed circumstances that would warrant

18   a change in this Court's decisions, and those decisions

19   require dismissal with prejudice.

20                 If there are no further questions, we'd

21   reserve the balance of our time.

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

 1           ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 2                     SUPPORTING PETITIONERS

 3                GENERAL CLEMENT:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 4   it please the Court:

 5                The United States has responsibility for

 6   enforcing both the securities laws through the SEC and

 7   the antitrust laws through the Justice Department and

 8   the FTC.    It thus has a critical interest in ensuring

 9   that these laws can be reconciled in a manner that gives

10   effect to both, and completely ousts neither.                  Any

11   effort to try to reconcile those laws in the specific

12   context of the underwriting of IPOs has to begin with an

13   understanding of the particular regulatory context and

14   scheme.    The SEC obviously carefully regulates both the

15   registration and the underwriting process for individual

16   IPOs.

17                There are two aspects of that regulatory

18   regime that are particularly important:                  First, the

19   approval for all sorts of collaborative conduct that is

20   the hallmark of the underwriting syndicate.                  And second,

21   the very fine nature of the distinctions that the SEC

22   draws between permissible book building activity and

23   impermissible market manipulation.

24                And in that regulatory context, the kind of

25   collaborative conduct that would in many other contexts


                                        18

 1   raise yellow or red flags of an antitrust violation is

 2   innocuous, because it's a hallmark of the underwriting

 3   process.

 4               Equally important, the SEC does make certain

 5   conduct like tie-ins and laddering unlawful, but very

 6   closely related conduct is not only permissible, but is

 7   considered beneficial to the capital formation process.

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I ask this question

 9   about the laddering and so forth?                 If it were fully

10   disclosed, would it be unlawful under either statute.

11               GENERAL CLEMENT:             I think it might, Justice

12   Stevens.   The prohibitions on laddering and tie-ins are

13   not just disclosure provisions.               And I think as a

14   practical matter, if these kind of things were

15   disclosed, they probably wouldn't happen.                     So it's a

16   little hard to --

17               JUSTICE STEVENS:             I can see how they would

18   affect the market if they were disclosed.

19               GENERAL CLEMENT:             That may be true, but the

20   way the regulation approaches that conduct is a little

21   bit more of a prophylactic approach.                     It's not just a

22   disclosure approach, and it does say that there's

23   conduct that is forbidden.           But I think it is important

24   to recognize just how fine the lines that are drawn here

25   become, because, to give you a real world example, the


                                        19

 1   guidance document that's at page 216A of the petition

 2   appendix makes clear that it is permissible for the lead

 3   underwriter, when talking to customers, to gauge their

 4   interest at various price points in the initial

 5   offering.

 6               JUSTICE ALITO:          In light of the very fine

 7   line, how is the Court to distinguish between --

 8   determine whether what's alleged is inextricably

 9   intertwined with authorized conduct?

10               GENERAL CLEMENT:            Well, I think if you were

11   looking at a challenge that took place solely within the

12   context of a single IPO, it would probably be so

13   difficult that I think we would concede that you can't

14   practically separate the two.             What I think is important

15   from the standpoint of the Justice Department and its

16   antitrust responsibilities is you don't want to sweep an

17   immunity so broad that it would, say, give cover to a

18   conspiracy that cut across IPOs, and was an effort to

19   fix commission rates, or to make territorial agreements,

20   or exclude a rival investment bank from the underwriting

21   process.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:            But the problem you address

23   has been a problem of strike suits.                     And it is the

24   problem that Congress addressed in its legislation.

25   Shake downs.   It just is less expensive to pay off the

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   suitor than it is to litigate it to a final conclusion,

 2   where that conclusion is highly uncertain.

 3              And I don't see how your -- your solution of

 4   inextricably intertwined, where there's a penalty of

 5   treble damages if you guess wrong about that line, I

 6   don't see how that's going to stop the strike suits any

 7   more than the current situation does.

 8              GENERAL CLEMENT:            Well, Justice Scalia --

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:            I wouldn't want to roll the

10   dice on whether something is inextricably intertwined,

11   with treble damages at the end.

12              GENERAL CLEMENT:            Well, Justice Scalia, I

13   think that you could certainly perform this test and

14   make the test protect conduct sufficient to protect

15   against that threat.     We are certainly sensitive to the

16   threat that a regulatory agency is trying to draw a fine

17   line between two closely related areas of conduct.

18   They're not going to be able to enforce that line as a

19   practical matter if the regulated community knows that

20   the consequence of having a foot fault in crossing that

21   line will be treble damages in a class action suit.

22              On the other hand, we would caution against

23   adopting some sort of broad immunity that would

24   preclude, say, the Justice Department from investigating

25   and prosecuting an antitrust conspiracy that cut across


                                      21
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   IPOs.   And of course, the Congress has addressed the

 2   problem of treble damages directly in a number of areas.

 3   And I suppose, if they were to address the area in the

 4   antitrust context, they might draw a distinction between

 5   private treble damages suits and Government enforcement

 6   efforts.   Now, that's a little hard to do --

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                They might, but they

 8   haven't yet.    A couple of times you've used this phrase

 9   cutting across IPOs.       Are you saying there should be an

10   absolute immunity from antitrust prosecution within a

11   single IPO?

12                 GENERAL CLEMENT:           Mr. Chief Justice, I mean,

13   I would warn you off of sort of saying absolutely no.                 I

14   think as a practical matter, though, it is going to be

15   -- I mean, I can't conceive of a ready example of where

16   an allegation that is specific to an internal single IPO

17   would really be practically inseparable.                 So I think the

18   role of the antitrust laws will largely be in

19   allegations that cut across IPOs.

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:           And even then, why do you

21   take the other position?          It is pretty easy to imagine

22   the SEC, under some circumstances, deciding that's a

23   proper way to market securities, to have some kinds of

24   agreements between IPOs or something like that.                 I don't

25   see why not.

 1              GENERAL CLEMENT:            Well, I suppose it's

 2   possible, Justice Breyer.

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:            It is possible.        I'm back

 4   to Justice Alito's question.           I mean, if you're worried

 5   about taking authority from the Department to prosecute

 6   territorial restrictions as some kind of blatant price

 7   fix, that's not in front of us.             So this doesn't have to

 8   be precedent for that.

 9              You're talking about this case.                  And there,

10   I think the Respondent -- the Petitioners here say that

11   my goodness, we don't see any way that a district court

12   is going to be able to start talking about whether this

13   evidence is protected.       What does that mean, protected?

14   Maybe protected here, because they have thought about

15   it, but there will be a lot of cases where the SEC

16   hasn't thought about the particular conduct.                 We don't

17   know what they're going to prove.

18              I'm back to Justice Alito.                  How is anybody

19   going to administer the standard that you are asking the

20   Court to enunciate?

21              GENERAL CLEMENT:            Well, I think if you draw

22   a distinction between intraIPO allegations and interIPO

23   allegations, you go a long way towards doing it.                 And I

24   should note, that's basically the line this Court drew

25   in NASD.

 1                 If you look particularly at the part of the

 2   decision that deals with count 1 of the Government's

 3   complaint, that was a horizontal allegation.                    And it was

 4   all in the context of vertical agreements that were

 5   specific to a particular mutual fund.

 6                 And in that context, this Court said that

 7   with respect to the horizontal agreement, there's

 8   nothing in the SEC regulations that specifically

 9   addresses that, but the SEC specifically blesses the

10   vertical agreements, so we're going to give additional

11   immunity to that horizontal agreement.                    That same page,

12   page 733 of the opinion, they say, what we don't have

13   before us is an allegation by the government that there

14   is a scheme here to reduce competition between mutual

15   funds.     There is no allegation that they were trying to

16   cut down, there was an agreement that would cut down

17   competition between Fidelity and Wellington, for

18   example.     It was all in the context of individual funds

19   and retarding the secondary market for individual funds.

20                     The language the Court used on page 733

21   of that opinion seems to us a perfectly reasonable test.

22   The Court said, quote:         "The close relationship is

23   fatal" the close relationship between what the SEC had

24   prohibited in the vertical context and what was sought

25   to be gone after in the context of the horizontal

 1   restraints, those are too closely related.                    I don't

 2   think that test has caused the undue confusion.                       And I

 3   think what it does it makes a reasonable balance between

 4   a ruling that on the one hand preserves a great deal of

 5   immunity, but on the other hand doesn't give a kind of

 6   blanket immunity that would basically completely oust

 7   the antitrust laws.     And I think that's the balance we

 8   hope to --

 9                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What happens on remand in

10   this very case based on your theory?                    You are not

11   adopting the district judge's position that this case

12   should be dismissed outright.

13                GENERAL CLEMENT:           That's right,

14   Justice Ginsburg, and --

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What happens when it goes

16   back?

17                GENERAL CLEMENT:           Well, I think this Court

18   could do one of two things.            I mean, the Petitioners for

19   their part have pointed to in footnote 6 of the blue

20   briefs, to a variety of Second Circuit precedents about

21   the standards for repleading.             Perhaps the easiest

22   course for this Court would be to just vacate and let

23   the Second Circuit apply its own law of repleading.

24   That would be one option.          The other option would be --

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But why, if this is a

 1   sprawling complaint and if the problem is that it says

 2   too much or too vaguely?          A district court doesn't have

 3   to leave the pleader to its own devices.                 It can have a

 4   pretrial conference and say, now let's get this whole

 5   thing in order, and it's not that the pleader is left

 6   alone to do what he or she will.

 7              But in complex cases like this, the district

 8   judge will often assert control from the beginning and

 9   not leave the parties to do what they want.

10              GENERAL CLEMENT:              We would have no objection

11   to that, Justice Ginsburg.           And I would say, you know,

12   you might say that, particularly based on the guidance

13   this Court gives in this case and the guidance this

14   Court gives perhaps in the Twombley case, that it might

15   be fair to let the plaintiffs have a crack at making a

16   new complaint in this area.             Oh the other hand, as I

17   say, we would have no objection to just allowing the

18   Second Circuit to sort it out based on Second Circuit

19   pleading law.    I think the important thing from our

20   perspective --

21              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               What would, what would a

22   satisfactory complaint for this party look like?

23              GENERAL CLEMENT:              Well, Justice Ginsburg,

24   it's a little hard for me to frame that complaint.                I

25   think if it focused on inter-IPO allegations and,

 1   contrary to this complaint, paragraph 42 of this

 2   complaint, actually alleges that there were a variety of

 3   different mechanisms that were used, that doesn't sound

 4   like what you would expect from a disagreement that cut

 5   across IPOs.   You'd expect uniform conduct to be

 6   alleged.   And if there was that sort of conduct and it

 7   was alleged to violate both regulatory regimes in a

 8   clear way, then maybe it could go forward.

13              ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER LOVELL

14                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

15               MR. LOVELL:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

16   and may it please the Court:

17               This Court's decisions in NASD and National

18   Gerimedical determined that implied immunity is not

19   favored, is justified only by a, quote, "convincing

20   showing of clear repugnancy," and then, quote, "only to

21   the minimum extent necessary," close quote.                 It is not

22   necessary to make the securities laws work to permit a

23   conspiracy to engage in conduct that the securities laws

24   have been trying to stop since their inception.

25               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, it might well be,

 1   because the reasoning would be, which I find very

 2   strong, is that as soon as you make an, bring an

 3   antitrust court in, you're talking about juries and

 4   treble damages.     And as soon as that happens, the people

 5   who are subject to it stay miles away from the conduct

 6   that, in fact, would subject them to liability.                 And yet

 7   staying miles away, they will not engage in conduct

 8   that, A, the SEC might believe is permissible, or, B,

 9   actually favor.

10                Where you get a complex complaint like

11   yours, that begins to ring true, that argument.                 And

12   that's what's concerning me.

13                MR. LOVELL:         I totally disagree, with great

14   respect.    Our complaint is that the conspiracy was to

15   require laddering in order to develop pools of orders

16   right after the stock began trading.

17                JUSTICE BREYER:             What they say in respect to

18   that is the other side says it's common to try to what's

19   called make a book or something.                 I don't know these

20   terms.

21                MR. LOVELL:         Right.

22                JUSTICE BREYER:             And when they do, what

23   happens is that the marketer goes out and he asks

24   people:    What's your plan?          What are you thinking of

25   doing next month?     What's your plan for this stock?

 1   Hold it?     Not?   It doesn't require much imagination to

 2   see how certain answers to that kind of question could

 3   be brought by a plaintiff in perfectly good faith as

 4   evidence that there's an agreement that next month they

 5   will pay more for the stock and next month they'll pay a

 6   lot more.

 7                 MR. LOVELL:         That's not this case, Your

 8   Honor.     That's not this case.             We say that the

 9   underwriters made a horizontal conspiracy to inflate the

10   prices and to inflate their charges as a result by

11   requiring these laddering orders and jointly negotiating

12   together the amounts of the laddering.

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             He's not saying that that's

14   this case.    He's just saying that it's so easy to make

15   allegations that action which was perfectly legitimate

16   amounted to action that was illegitimate.                  And that

17   question ultimately gets thrown into the laps of the

18   jury; and if the jury comes out the wrong way, you get

19   hit with treble damages.

20                 MR. LOVELL:         Your Honor, sorry for

21   interrupting.

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             I'm done.

23                 MR. LOVELL:         Okay.

24                 It's like a lawyer knows what to say and

25   knows what not to say.          This has been established for

 1   years.     You cannot say in the securities business, Your

 2   Honor -- and we don't know this; we know what to do as

 3   lawyers.     You cannot say it's a quid pro quo, I'm going

 4   to negotiate with you how much you have to purchase.

 5   That type of conduct created pools during the 1920s and

 6   the early 30s which manipulated prices to unsustainable

 7   levels that led to the great stock market crash and

 8   maybe the depression.        The legislative history said:                 We

 9   want to stop pools.       In section 982 of the Securities

10   and Exchange Act it says, quote, "One person or more

11   cannot work together to raise prices."

12                 We allege that the first part of this

13   horizontal conspiracy, across underwriters and across

14   IPOs, was to require the laddering in order to raise

15   prices.

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:            The problem -- I'd be

17   repeating it.    we're not talking about, say, your case.

18   I don't know what your evidence is.                       But let's imagine a

19   case where the evidence of just what you said consists

20   of some rather ambiguous discussions which might be

21   characterized in a variety of ways, including the way

22   the way the plaintiff wants to characterize it, who

23   would repeat the very words you just said.

24                 Now, the issue, it seems to me here, is in

25   light of that possibility, do we want an antitrust judge

 1   to say whether that's so?           I know you do.           Or do you

 2   want the SEC to say whether that's so in the particular

 3   case?   Or that's why I thought of primary jurisdiction:

 4   Maybe first send it to the SEC.

 5                 What's your view?

 6                 MR. LOVELL:       Well, I'll do primary

 7   jurisdiction last, Your Honor.               My view is that to bring

 8   in the other case is, in effect, to exculpate antitrust

 9   violations.    On this narrow case that we've alleged,

10   under Connelly versus Gibson there is no other case.

11   Anybody who's charged with murder or any serious conduct

12   could say:    Well, you can't really apply that because

13   this is the other case.

14                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask you if your

15   conspiracy allegation would be the same if there were

16   only one underwriter?

17                 MR. LOVELL:       No.      No, Your Honor.

18                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           It is critical to your

19   case that there are multiple underwriters?

20                 MR. LOVELL:       Yes, yes.

21                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           What if we thought that

22   the activities of the multiple underwriters were

23   Comparable to a single joint venture?                    In many respects

24   they're like a joint venture.              Would that mean your

25   whole case could collapse?            In other words, I'm really

 1   wondering to what extent you're depending on your

 2   horizontal agreement as opposed to the vertical

 3   arrangements like laddering and flipping and that sort

 4   of thing.

 5               MR. LOVELL:        We totally depend on the

 6   horizontal agreement, Your Honor.                The case rises or

 7   falls on the horizontal agreement among underwriters to

 8   require that which the securities law --

 9               JUSTICE STEVENS:            If there had just been the

10   vertical agreements and if they had been fully

11   disclosed, there would no antitrust violation, would

12   there?   If there had just been publicly disclosed

13   agreement by one underwriter with the purchasers to

14   engage in these activities, there would be no violation,

15   would there?

16               MR. LOVELL:        If there's no market power,

17   we're not alleging that, and we wouldn't try to bring

18   that case, Your Honor.       Where the antitrust laws, as

19   General Clement says, have their reach is that they get

20   the whole elephant.     If we prove that the underwriters

21   conspired as we alleged, and there's five administrative

22   complaints here -- it's not something where it's is a

23   strike suit.   There's five administrative complaints

24   finding this parallel unlawful conduct, which would work

25   best through a conspiracy.

 1                And we have our allegations in the complaint

 2   that they worked jointly together to do in this case

 3   what's always been prohibited under the securities laws.

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What about the

 5   Solicitor General's suggestion about extending antitrust

 6   immunity to a single IPO?           In other words, what's wrong

 7   with that?   That's where the SEC's regulation seems to

 8   be most pervasive, and what you can do in the context of

 9   an IPO if your allegations cut across IPOs that might be

10   different.

11                MR. LOVELL:        It's a hypothetical.          We're not

12   trying to do an individual case.                I don't have a strong

13   position on it.    There is a case called Roth berg in the

14   Eastern District of New York -- the Eastern District of

15   Pennsylvania, a district court case, that recognized an

16   antitrust violation in a single stock manipulation.

17   There are other cases called Shumway and -- and I forget

18   the other case -- that said, no, you can't have it.

19   They've gone both ways.

20                It wouldn't matter to our case at all.

21   We're trying to get at -- the securities laws are

22   transactional.    They can't get at a big wrong like this.

23   They only get their own part of the elephant.                 The

24   antitrust laws, this is business as usual, step into my

25   office.   As General Clement says, the antitrust laws

 1   come if we prove that there was a horizontal agreement.

 2   Then all of these individual efforts --

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What are you talking

 4   about when you say a horizontal agreement?                  Are you

 5   talking about a group of underwriters in the context of

 6   a single IPO?

 7                MR. LOVELL:        No.

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No.

 9                MR. LOVELL:        No, Your Honor.           It's across

10   IPOs and across underwriters.              They changed their

11   business.    They all changed the business at about the

12   same time:    This is the way we're going to operate.

13   We're going to require the laddering orders.                 That moves

14   the price up.    And we're going to require another type

15   of tie-in agreement that allows the underwriters to

16   participate in the customer's profits from the

17   difference between the IPO price and the inflated prices

18   at which transaction sales were made right after the

19   IPO.

20                JUSTICE BREYER:            What about an agreement

21   among underwriters, among underwriters, which says the

22   following:    We agree that we go -- when we go on our

23   tour, we will be certain to ask the potential purchasers

24   whether they plan to hold this stock for at least a

14   way of this narrow case and the facts that are presented

15   for immunity here, which the Congress has been trying to

16   stop forever, and the conduct's spread between 1997 and

17   2001 and was a massive violation that the securities

18   laws really aren't cut out to address.                    I know I'm

19   getting off your question a little bit, but in the

20   NASDAQ antitrust litigation these defendants and their

21   predecessors agreed to keep the spreads wide in

22   the over-the-counter market.             There were rules about

23   maximum spreads.    There were many rules, many

24   regulations.

 1   securities markets for all the underwriters across 5,000

 2   stocks -- we only proved it out to 1600 -- to widen

 3   their spreads, to keep their bids and offers wide.

 4   Billions of dollars -- the Justice Department after we

 5   brought the case, the Justice Department brought a case.

 6   The entire industry was changed.              You can now trade a

 9   antitrust -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I'm trying to grasp

11   the difference between the single IPO and multiple.                   So

12   in response to Justice Breyer's hypothetical, they all

13   agree in the context of a single IPO, let's make sure

14   everyone's going to hold the stock for a month, and you

15   say no problem.

16              MR. LOVELL:        No problem.

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, if the same

18   underwriters get together the next month, they've got a

19   different IPO and they say, you know, let's do the same

20   thing we did last time because seemed to work well in

21   terms of the issuance and the capital formation.                All of

22   a sudden that's an antitrust problem?

23              MR. LOVELL:        No.      The basis for my answer is

24   two levels of no problem.         There's not a problem as to

25   the single deal and there's not a problem as to saying


                                      36

 1   you have to hold the stock.               That's not at issue.             We

 2   have no problem with that.

 3                What's always been prohibited is to create

 4   pools of orders to drive up the price of the stock.                          If

 5   you work to raise the price of the stock, which this was

 6   all geared to do, after it came public, it drives prices

 7   to unsustainable levels.            It creates a lot of action in

 8   the stock.   People come in and buy.                       Our clients buy

 9   directly from the defendants who are driving the stock

10   up.   And yes, there was no disclosure.                      As with any

11   antitrust conspiracy, if there was disclosure there

12   could have been --

13                JUSTICE BREYER:              Can you get damages for

14   that from the SEC?       I mean, it sounds like bad conduct.

15                MR. LOVELL:          The SEC refers the customers to

16   the private lawyers if you complain.                       The securities

17   laws are totally different from the ICC, from the common

18   carrier case.

19                JUSTICE BREYER:              Suppose you lose, your

20   client -- suppose all these bad things happen and you

21   don't have an antitrust claim.                 Is there somewhere in

22   the law that you can get damages?

23                MR. LOVELL:          Yes.

24                Where?

25                MR. LOVELL:          The specific intent of Congress

 1   in creating the securities laws was to create private

 2   remedies which are available, and to preserve all other

 3   remedies, including --

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:           So what's at issue here is

 5   not whether you get a remedy.             It's whether you get

 6   treble damages.

 7                MR. LOVELL:       No.      Theoretically, there are

 8   other remedies as to each individual client for what

 9   each individual client did.            No one can address in a

10   securities case the wrong that happens here.               The

11   agreement.   That can only be addressed as

12   General Clement says at page 22 of the brief, through an

13   antitrust case.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Why is that?     I don't

15   understand why the SEC could not -- they can make rules

16   for a single IPO; it seems to me they can make rules for

17   coordination of IPO.      Why can't they do that?

18                MR. LOVELL:       Well, the SEC could make a rule

19   to prohibit -- to further supplement the protections.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Right, right.

21                MR. LOVELL:       Yes, Your Honor.         They could

22   supplement the prohibitions --

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:           They have chosen not to.

24                MR. LOVELL:       Well, it -- it -- I think it's

25   more institutional that the focus has always been

 1   transactional, Your Honor.          And the Congress clearly in

 2   982 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 clearly

 3   prohibits individual or joint efforts to raise prices,

 4   empowers private investors to sue, empowers the SEC to

 5   sue --

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:             No, but --

 7              MR. LOVELL:         There could have been a suit by

 8   now but it has never happened.

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:             But you -- you could regard

10   the activity of laddering and of making a book on a

11   stock when the -- in the case of a single offering.                     You

12   could -- you could look upon that as, as an attempt to

13   raise the price.   That's what it is, isn't it?                    An

14   attempt to make sure there's going to be a high enough

15   price for the stock so that it won't flop once it's out

16   there?

17              MR. LOVELL:         In the -- there's huge

18   qualitative differences between certain types of conduct

19   which has always been accepted and was not prohibited in

20   the securities laws and laddering or pools of orders to

21   raise prices and tie-in agreements.                     The only metaphor I

22   can throw out, Your Honor, is that we know how far we

23   can say and what we can't say, the brokers always know

24   this, until 1997 to 2001 when they -- they changed their

25   underwriting businesses to go -- and we, we allege that

 1   they required, induced, solicited -- not that they did

 2   things on the way -- close to the line or -- in the,

 3   what had always been the accepted area, the world

 4   changed.   And that change moved into the territory that

 5   had -- sorry for hurrying -- that had always been

 6   prohibited.

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yeah.       And you're saying

 8   they did this just -- not in the context of just single

 9   IPOs, but that they agreed across IPOs that they would

10   all do this.

11                 MR. LOVELL:        Yes, Your Honor, across IPOs

12   and across underwriters, so that --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why?

14                 MR. LOVELL:        So that a customer couldn't go

15   to another underwriter for a different deal.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Uh-huh.          The customer being

17   the issuer?

18                 MR. LOVELL:        No, no.         The public customers

19   who have accounts with the underwriters; they're also

20   brokerage firms.    If they wanted to get an IPO in what

21   we call class security, the technologies securities,

22   they had to pay --

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            They'd have to pay the

24   premium.

25                 MR. LOVELL:        Yeah.        They had to pay these

 1   unlawful charges under securities laws, no matter where

 2   they went.    And in terms of the inextricably

 3   intertwined, it is the qualitative difference that stops

 4   that.

 5                 I think behind the Solicitor General and the

 6   SEC's proposal is a fear that the syndicates, the

 7   underwriters are vulnerable to an antitrust case because

 8   they operate together.        That's not true.            There's never

 9   been a case precisely like this; and the underwriters as

10   brokers, as market makers, they operate together and

11   cooperatively all the time.             Five years goes by.      Seven

12   years goes by.    There's no antitrust case --

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.       So what are the

14   words you use in the opinion, that would separate your

15   case, where it is like price fixing and so forth, to

16   charge them, from the case that they're worried about,

17   which is where the evidence is, to prove the allegation

18   is, really involves activity that could be quite

19   legitimate?

20                 Now, now -- what words would I write in the

21   opinion that in your opinion would separate the sheep

22   from the goats?

23                 MR. LOVELL:       They agreed to inflate prices

24   in precisely the way the securities laws have always

25   prohibited.    They agreed to inflate prices and they


                                        41
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   agreed to make tie-in agreements that have always been

 2   prohibited under the securities laws, to participate in

 3   the profits from the inflated prices, which they were

 4   not permitted to participate in.

 5              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So your test is it

 6   has to be prohibited by the securities laws?

 7              MR. LOVELL:        No.      But in this narrow case,

 8   it happens to be that the method that they went to,

 9   which was always a guaranteed method to drive up prices

10   and to participate, was -- had always been prohibited by

11   the securities laws.

12              It is not the test.              The test for the

13   antitrust claim is merely this:             they wanted to make an

14   agreement to inflate prices and they wanted to make an

15   agreement to inflate their charges.                    And if a customer

16   came to this underwriting trust at the time to deal with

17   them, they had to do this type of transaction to inflate

18   the price, and they had to pay the underwriting extra --

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What do you say to

20   the -- sort of stepping back from the trees to the

21   forest, to the general suggestion that Congress has been

22   tightening up the requirements for private securities

23   litigation over the past few years; and you're bringing

24   this now as antitrust claims as a way to circumvent

25   Congress's regulation.

 1                MR. LOVELL:        That the actual facts show that

 2   Congress wanted this claim to be brought.                Certain --

 3   Congress is well aware of the NASDAQ antitrust

 4   litigation and of the Salomon Brothers antitrust

 5   litigation, both antitrust claims in the securities

 6   markets.    Both situations where the diligent

 7   professionals at the SEC were criticized by the

 8   congressional oversight people for not finding out what

 9   was going on, perhaps, and that the antitrust bar did

10   and brought the case, and then the DOJ brought it and

11   then there was questions.

12                JUSTICE BREYER:            What about -- what about --

13   listen to what I'm about to say.                I'm thinking of the

14   standard.

15                The standard would be where the allegations

16   are such, where the case is such that -- to go

17   further -- that, one, it is an allegation of a claim of

18   illegality; is price fixing, in price fixing; and it is

19   of longstandingly prohibited under the securities law;

20   and there is evidence to support that, of -- strong

21   evidence to support it, or the evidence in support

22   thereof is not primarily evidence simply of asking the

23   jury to draw inferences from conduct that is protected.

24   Under those circumstances there is no immunity.

25                MR. LOVELL:        Bingo.        That -- we live with

 1   all that, Your Honor.       To quote -- sorry, sorry.

 2                 (Laughter.)

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I don't know if it's -- I

 4   mean, you know --

 5                 (Laughter.)

 6                 MR. LOVELL:       No, no - but we agree on every

 7   one.   But to go back --

 8                 JUSTICE ALITO:         How could the Court -- how

 9   could a court enforce that at the 12(b)(6) stage?

10   Determining whether there's strong evidence of one type

11   or another.

12                 MR. LOVELL:       Well, in this particular case,

13   Your Honor, there's five administrative proceedings that

14   have, that have come forth since we -- we filed first,

15   and there was nothing.        And -- but since then there have

16   been a lot of administrative proceedings.                I would say

17   that the fact that parallel unusual -- unlawful conduct

18   is occurring in a way that the horizontal people who are

19   doing it inflate their prices at the expense of the

20   public, would satisfy any test.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Look, the question isn't

22   whether it satisfies it.          The question is whether you

23   can get rid of this suit at the outset or do you have to

24   go through enormously expensive discovery, which --

25   which isn't worth the candle.

 1                MR. LOVELL:        Your Honor, I think you have --

 2   for the good of the country, I think you have to follow

 3   the facts and find out if these people conspired as

 4   alleged.

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- discovery?      Right?

 6                MR. LOVELL:        Yes.       Sure.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But the problem --

 8   the problem is that, of course, these people are to some

 9   extent under the securities laws in the business of

10   fixing prices.    They get together as a syndicate, a

11   syndicate, and say well, you have to figure out what

12   price we're going to charge for this initial public

13   offering.    It looks, if you didn't understand the

14   context, it would look an awful lot like an antitrust

15   violation.

16                And the problem is, I guess, that -- that

17   when you take that type of evidence, the type of

18   evidence you're going to be relying on to show that

19   there's price fixing, it is exactly what the SEC wants

20   the people to do.    They want them to get together.                They

21   want them to agree on an appropriate IPO price that's

22   going to contribute to capital formation and everything

23   else.

24                And how do you at, as Justice Alito pointed

25   out, at the 12(b)(6) stage, how is a district court

 1   supposed to say well, this is the bad price fixing, this

 2   isn't the good price fixing?

 3                 MR. LOVELL:       Again it is the qualitative

 4   difference.    Everybody knows -- and the SEC does want

 5   IPO prices to be fixed, just like in the NASD case, they

 6   only wanted one price for the mutual fund shares because

 7   people could be disadvantaged.               However, everybody also

 8   knows under Section 982 and Section 17 of the Securities

 9   Act, that you don't go over and rig the after market,

10   not even in one stock, let alone what we allege, across

11   stocks.   And with regard to the question earlier, Your

12   Honor, about how Congress --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't think you've

14   answered his question.

15                 MR. LOVELL:       Oh, I'm sorry.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I think that you've said

17   that the two were different.             His question was how can

18   you tell at the outset, at the 12(b)(6) stage, the

19   difference between those two things that you've

20   mentioned?    Sure they're different but -- but the

21   evidence that is only evidence of the one also looks

22   like evidence of the other.

23                 MR. LOVELL:       Well --

24                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           What is the particular

25   difference between supporting the price and rigging the

 1   aftermarket?   I mean, how do we tell that at the

 2   12(b)(6)?

 3                MR. LOVELL:       You look, you compare the cases

 4   to the language in the complaint.                In paragraphs 4 and 5

 5   of the complaint we say that they agreed to require

 6   laddering, they agreed to require this.                     We don't say

 7   that they made any -- any hints or legitimate activity.

 8   We're held to that burden of proof.                     You look at the

 9   cases, required has always been unlawful.                     To require a

10   pool of orders to drive up the prices -- always

11   unlawful.

12                And Congress during the 1990s did narrow the

13   securities laws; and they took away treble damages as to

14   RICO, and they stopped resorting to state court, where

15   the standards weren't as stringent as under the PS law

16   -- for class action.      However, they knew about these

17   antitrust cases that had saved billions of dollars for

18   consumers.   They applauded them.              And they reenacted the

19   savings clause that says all rights and remedies are

20   preserved.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                How did they applaud

22   them?

23                MR. LOVELL:       Well, they just said that they

24   -- Congress -- that's too strong a statement.                    The

25   specific Congress people involved were glad that the --

 1   the wrongdoing was uncovered and said as much and wrote

 2   to the Attorney General, and the SEC, and said why --

 3   why wasn't it found sooner?

 4                 But they did not touch these antitrust

 5   actions.     Number one, they come very infrequently.

 6   Number two, they've done great benefit for the

 7   securities markets and for the participants in the

 8   securities markets, and even for the defendants

 9   themselves.     They forced the defendants to operate by

10   talent and bring out their best, and not resort to what

11   the problems for the public always is --

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 The SEC which is the

13   agency charged with supervising those markets, thinks

14   otherwise.

15                 MR. LOVELL:        No -- no.

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 They don't think

17   these, the antitrust actions are good for the securities

18   markets.

19                 MR. LOVELL:        The SEC -- and this is the

20   first immunity case before the court where the SEC and

21   the DOJ both are in favor of not having substantive

22   immunity.    They both oppose immunity.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But that wasn't the SEC's

24   position below, was it?

25                 MR. LOVELL:        No.      No, it was not, Your

 1   Honor.

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           And the Justice Department

 3   was on one side, the SEC was on the other.               Right?

 4                 MR. LOVELL:       Yes, Your Honor.         And --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It looks to me like they

 6   split the baby up here.

 7                 (Laughter.)

 8                 MR. LOVELL:       I -- I -- that's the only way I

 9   can see it.    But if Your Honor looks at the questions

10   that the SEC answered to Second Circuit, the SEC said

11   they couldn't say how the current laws couldn't work on

12   the facts of this case, but future cases might present a

13   closer case, Your Honor.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I would always -- I think

15   the standard I was more or less talking about is pretty

16   close to what the SG says.           And I think he says that --

17   that -- that Justice Alito's point, which is certainly a

18   good point, is that you would have to allege facts such

19   that it was clear from the face of the complaint that

20   you weren't resting your case on the conduct that was --

21   that's what he means by protected -- and there's an

22   ongoing obligation, it says, on the part of the district

23   judge to be sure that the case isn't really growing out

24   of this conduct that is arguably okay.

25                 MR. LOVELL:       Protected conduct.        And we

 1   could live with --

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            You, you could live with

 3   the SG --

 4                 MR. LOVELL:        We could live with that.      On

 5   the other hand, applied immunity is an affirmative

 6   defense.     It was held in Cantor versus Detroit Edison,

 7   428 US 579, which didn't make it into our brief, that

 8   applied antitrust immunity is an affirmative defense.

 9   As we brief, there's a long line of cases from Your

10   Honors that say that you don't have to plead in the

11   complaint to negate an affirmative defense.

12                 I don't think that unlawful conduct under

13   the securities laws is entitled to more protection than

14   free speech or some of the conduct in these other cases;

15   and I -- and we've opposed the inextricably intertwined

16   standard as particularly inappropriate where an

17   affirmative defense is involved.

18                 Nonetheless, we could live with that, if it

19   came down.     And we think the complaint already lives

20   with it.     The complaint has, from paragraph 53 through

21   paragraph 63, a number of allegations of joint conduct

22   to do things which are clearly unlawful under the

23   securities laws.     It does have one allegation about

24   holding road shows.       On its own, that's permissible.           We

25   don't have a footnote that says this is permissible on


                                         50

 1   its own.     That may have caused somewhat of the problem

 2   for -- for people.

 3                 But reading the complaint as a whole,

 4   paragraph 5 says that these later paragraphs I just

 5   referred to show how the time in the syndicates was

 6   abused.

 7                 And I'm going back to this vulnerability

 8   point.     The defendants are vulnerable to an antitrust

 9   class action plaintiffs saying, you conspired.               Yes.

10   But it only happens -- it only happens once in a while.

11   And think about it.       If they abuse their time in the

12   syndicates to create a conspiracy of this nature, to do

13   something that's always been prohibited under the

14   securities laws, and it's clearly prohibited under the

15   antitrust laws, why should we bend over backwards to

16   protect that every five years or seven years?               The

17   normal --

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You didn't have a chance

19   to answer Justice Breyer's question about primary

20   jurisdiction.    Let's get the SEC's views first of

21   whether there is any interference with securities law

22   enforcement.

23                 MR. LOVELL:        The public carrier cases, the

24   Interstate Commerce Commission, the sea carriers and the

25   air carriers have had primary jurisdiction as an


                                         51
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   approach.    In order to keep it uniform, they kept the

 2   rate and then there would be questions on the rate.                        So

 3   both for administrative discretion and factfinding, the

 4   Court said that's their baby, we're going to stay out.

 5                The securities laws have always been totally

 6   different.    The antitrust laws - it was a little bit

 7   patterned after the antitrust laws.                      Section 9(e) is

 8   like the antitrust laws, 15 U.S.C. 15. the antitrust

 9   laws said we want private attorney generals to go out

10   and sue.    The securities laws said we want to give the

11   remedies under this act, new remedies.                     We want to

12   preserve -- preserve all other remedies, any and all

13   other remedies.

14                The single damages point raised by the

15   defendants in the same section is only a limit on

16   recovery.    It's not a limit on the rights and remedies.

17   So the answer to primary jurisdiction is that it's

18   always worked this way, that the private plaintiff is

19   supposed to sue in court.           He's expressly empowered

20   under securities laws to sue in court, As he's expressly

21   empowered under the antitrust laws, and the courts have

22   always resolved the issue.

23                JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, but we haven't had this

24   problem focus before, and isn't primary jurisdiction the

25   most efficient answer to the problem that we've got?                       In


                                        52

 1   other words, isn't it time to do something different?

 2                MR. LOVELL:         No, I don't believe so, Your

 3   Honor.    The times that it's come up before in the NASDAQ

 4   case, United States versus Morgan, the courts have said

 5   business as usual.      They used the usual implied immunity

 6   standard and they resolve it, as usually happens.                   In

 7   Richey, the Richey case and a few other cases we've

 8   either said -- not implied immunity, but we've either

 9   said we're not going to get involved, it's the agency's,

10   it's the ICC's responsibility, or it was referred one

11   time in the Richey case to the old Commodity Exchange

12   Commission, which then declined to take the referral

13   because -- that was an appropriate referral because it

14   had to do with the exchange rules.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:             I don't understand what

16   happens with this primary jurisdiction in the context of

17   an antitrust suit.      You're entitled to a jury trial in

18   the antitrust suit, right?

19                MR. LOVELL:         Yes, Your Honor.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:             And in primary

21   jurisdiction, would we refer it to the SEC and accept

22   the SEC's fact determinations and then instruct the jury

23   that --

24                MR. LOVELL:         Never happened before, and it's

25   contrary to the -- what Congress wants.                   In a different


                                         53

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   statutory context, it was what Congress wanted for

 2   uniformity.

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           And it is really the

 4   factual determination that is the hang-up, that you

 5   don't want things that are innocent and that the SEC

 6   would know are innocent to be taken as evidence of

 7   guilty by the jury.      So you really haven't accomplished

 8   a whole lot if you just send it over to the SEC for

 9   rulings on the law as opposed to rulings on whether this

10   particular conduct violated the law.

11                 MR. LOVELL:       I agree, Your Honor.

12                 I think that the presence here of the SEC

13   complaints, the SEC's fact-finding, saying that things

14   got out of hand during this time and the law was broken

15   on a widespread basis, indicate that we are not coming

16   forth with weak facts.        And I also agree that in the

17   securities context, primary jurisdiction has not had the

18   basis it's had in other legislative contexts where

19   uniformity was desired.

20                 Thank you.

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

25                 STATEMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO


                                        54
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 2              MR. SHAPIRO:           Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 3              The key question in this litigation is who's

 4   going to design what a tie-in is and who's going to

 5   decide what constitutes unreasonable compensation.                   The

 6   plaintiffs say quite overtly in their briefs these

 7   issues can't be left in the hands of the SEC.                Well,

 8   Congress put these issues in the hands of the SEC.

 9   There are three separate provisions that give the SEC

10   power to define what is forbidden manipulation, what is

11   a forbidden tie-in, and what is excessive compensation.

12              The SEC this Court has said is an agency

13   that Congress had considerable confidence in in the

14   Gordon case and that confidence is well justified here.

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:              What's your test,

16   Mr. Shapiro?

17              MR. SHAPIRO:           Our test is the one the Court

18   laid down in those two cases:              Is there active

19   supervision or is there pervasive regulation?                If the

20   answer is yes to either of those, you ask, is there a

21   potential conflict, and if so immunity applies and the

22   complaint has to be dismissed.               And this is true whether

23   you're talking about one IPO or an agreement that cuts

24   across several IPOs, because even in the multiple IPO

25   situation the jury would still have to decide, was that


                                        55
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   a tie-in or was it something innocent; was it

 2   unreasonable compensation or was it something that was

 3   proper?

 4              JUSTICE BREYER:             We all agree, say a group

 5   of underwriters, that for the next we will insist that

 6   every customer, whatever price we charge, will pay 30

 7   percent more for 50 percent more shares next month.

 8   Absolutely illegal, isn't it?

 9              MR. SHAPIRO:          Well --

10              JUSTICE BREYER:             They write it down, just

11   what I said.

12              MR. SHAPIRO:          The same circumstances were

13   presented very similar to the NASD in the Invemed case.

14   They had a Three-week trial, 17 experts, and they

15   concluded that those charges were quite permissible

16   considering the whole range of services that were given.

17   Now, if this occurred with concerted action the SEC has

18   power to deal with concerted action.                    Congress said that

19   they could deal with multiple party manipulations.                    They

20   have many cases where they proceeded against multiple

21   parties.

22              In the NASD case the claim was that there

23   was a horizontal conspiracy involving many brokers and

24   many underwriters, it was industrywide, it went on for

25   years and years.   And the Government argued there it was


                                       56
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   improper, it was contrary to the SEC's policies this.

 2   This Court held squarely that that is within the SEC's

 3   power to regulate and if something of that sort is

 4   occurring the SEC can deal with it.

 5              The test there wasn't whether it was

 6   connected to something that was permissible.             The test

 7   was whether it was connected to the SEC's regulatory

 8   responsibilities and the SEC could deal with that sort

 9   of concerted action on an industrywide basis.

10              Now, Mr. Lovell has argued that the conduct

11   has always been forbidden.         He labels it that way.

12   There are many case from this Court that we cite in our

13   reply brief holding that that labeling does not defeat

14   immunity because it's always possible to characterize

15   conduct in that fashion.        But the agency has to apply

16   its expertise to decide what is forbidden and to change

17   its rules over time, which the SEC is now doing.             And it

18   has to be able to prevent, deterring conduct that comes

19   up to the line of prohibition.             Here that conduct is

20   essential to protect investors and to protect issuers.

21   The markets couldn't function efficiently if

22   underwriters could not engage freely in the kinds of

23   conversations that get twisted in this litigation into

24   something characterized as tie-ins.

25              Now, there are 310 private suits now pending


                                      57

 1   under the securities laws brought by many of these same

 2   lawyers, making the same claims of concerted action to

 3   manipulate the stock market.              Those suits are subject to

 4   a panoply of safeguards that Congress has prescribed,

 5   including single damages, restrictions on class action

 6   abuse, serious loss causation requirements.

 7              The only purpose for stretching the

 8   antitrust laws here is to evade all of the safeguards

 9   that Congress has passed, each and every one of them.

10   We think NASD and Gordon are very important in

11   preventing that kind of a pleading tactic.

12              And of course, when counsel talks about

13   concerted action and manipulating the stock market, what

14   did Congress pass the '34 Act for if it wasn't that?

15   There were extensive hearings about concerted

16   manipulation involving pools and groups that were

17   manipulating the market.           That's why there are several

18   anti-manipulation provisions in the '34 Act that give

19   Power to define the misconduct and to deal with it

20   effectively.   And this is the toughest cop in

21   Washington, the SEC.        They're perfectly capable of

22   dealing with this.

23              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you,

24   Mr. Shapiro.
