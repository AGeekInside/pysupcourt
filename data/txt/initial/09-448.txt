 7                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. ATES

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. ATES:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               The Fourth Circuit vacated an award of

12   attorney's fees to Petitioner Hardt even though the

13   district court found Respondent violated ERISA in bad

14   faith and required Respondent to redetermine benefits

15   within 30 days or face adverse judgment.                   And Ms. Hardt

16   then secured the full disability benefits after that

17   court-enforceable order.

18               Ms. Hardt is entitled to -- is eligible for

19   a fee award under section 502(g)(1) of ERISA by proper

20   application of this Court's established fee standards

21   under any test this Court has previously established.

22   But to be clear --

23               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                What do you define as --

24   assuming that we go back to our prior language and use --

25   in Ruckelshaus, "some success on the merits," what's the


                                          3

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   "some success on the merits" that you claim your client

 2   reached?

 3                  MR. ATES:     In that instance, the "some

 4   success on the merits" is the finding of the ERISA

 5   violation in this instance.

 6                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Now, I believe that this

 7   circuit said, yes, there are cases where we have so held,

 8   but that's because there was a cause of action under the

 9   complaint that -- that alleged a violation of the Act.

10   But here there wasn't.         Here, there was a claim for

11   benefits only, and you didn't get benefits.                 That was

12   the circuit's reasoning.           So tell me where they erred

13   and how we go back to defining "some success on the

14   merits" in light of that position by the circuit?

15                  MR. ATES:     They misread the complaint,

16   Justice Sotomayor.      We are claiming a claim for

17   benefits.     As part of that claim, we asked for equitable

18   relief for the ERISA violation.                 The heart of ERISA is

19   the full and fair review process in 1133 of the statute.

20   Because without a full and fair review by the plan

21   administrator, that fiduciary cannot get to the right

22   result.     It violated that obligation here.

23                  We asked for the benefits, but the district

24   court, instead of awarding the benefits, said in the

25   first -- in the second instance, here's your second bite

 1   at the apple; get it right this time.                   That's success on

 2   the merits under ERISA, because they must abide by their

 3   fiduciary obligations, and they breached it here.

 4                The relief the district court formulated in

 5   essence was an equitable-type relief:                   Do it again.   We

 6   asked for that in the complaint.               We asked for equitable

 7   relief.

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So what do you think

 9   our -- the meaning of our footnote, Chief Justice

10   Rehnquist's footnote in Ruckelshaus, who said a

11   procedural victory is not some success on the merits.

12   How do you differentiate what he meant by a --

13   some procedural victory is not enough?

14                MR. ATES:     I think it foreshadowed the

15   Hanrahan-type case, and we are miles apart from

16   Hanrahan.   Hanrahan, which Respondent is relying upon,

17   was the circuit court reversing the district court on a

18   pure civil procedure issue.            Here, there is a -- a

19   right; it is a process right.             So when the process right

20   is violated, your relief is going to necessarily be

21   process-driven.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:           It was the same in

23   Hanrahan.   There was a right to a certain process in the

24   lower court, and the -- the person complaining achieved

25   reversal.   It was sent back and said:                  Do it right.   Give


                                        5

 1   this person the process that -- that he's entitled to.

 2                 MR. ATES:     But, in Hanrahan, there was no

 3   finding of a violation of law, Justice Scalia.                    Here we

 4   have a violation of ERISA, a violation of a fiduciary

 5   obligation by the plan administrator.                    The relief

 6   accorded for that violation was a remand back to the

 7   plan administrator to get it right.

 8                 That's the difference between our case and

 9   Hanrahan.    In Hanrahan, there was no finding of a

10   violation of law.    No one was found to be a legal

11   wrongdoer.    We have that here.             The fiduciary breached

12   its obligation.

13                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Are you saying that in

14   Hanrahan there was no prod at all from the court, and

15   here there is?

16                 MR. ATES:     I'm sorry --

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            In Hanrahan, there was no

18   prod from the court; the court didn't say anything

19   that -- it was the filing of the complaint that led to

20   the action, wasn't it?

21                 MR. ATES:     Well, what happened was the

22   district court, I believe, granted a motion to dismiss or

23   a motion for judgment as of law at trial.                    The -- the

24   court of appeals reversed that.                What we have here is a

25   prodding from a court, but moreover a finding of a


                                         6

 1   violation by a court.          The court found Reliance violated

 2   ERISA.     That's the key distinction between here and

 3   Hanrahan.     And --

 4                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Suppose now, in response

 5   to "Do it right," Reliance on a complete record and very

 6   careful review finds that total disability was not

 7   proved.     Then there would be no fees, right?

 8                  MR. ATES:       No.         Under our position, the --

 9   Ms. Hardt is eligible for fees and the district court

10   can take into account trust law principles which are

11   embodied in what we call this five-factor test to

12   determine whether to award fees.                   She's eligible for

13   fees based on the violation by Reliance in bad faith.

14   We have a legal wrongdoer here.

15                  The amount of those fees, Justice Ginsburg,

16   may be determined in part by her degree of success.

17                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, this district court

18   kept jurisdiction over the action.                     He more or less

19   waited to see how the story came out before he wrote the

20   plot.     Suppose the district court said:                  All you came to

21   me for was an order for remand.                   I give you the order

22   for remand.     Case ended.          At that point, he doesn't know

23   how it's going to come out.                At that point, can he --

24   can the district court award attorney's fees?

25                  MR. ATES:       Absolutely, the court at that


                                            7

                             Alderson Reporting Company

 1   point, if he's closing the case out in particular and

 2   entering judgment as to the violation --

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So that even if, when it

 4   goes back to Reliance, Reliance finds that it's patently

 5   frivolous, close to a fraud, she -- the employee still

 6   gets the fee?

 7                MR. ATES:     The only way it's going back,

 8   Justice Kennedy, is from a violation of law.                 So, in that

 9   regard, she has succeeded on the merits by proving a

10   violation regardless of the outcome at the end of the

11   day.

12                Now, here certainly she got the benefits, so

13   we -- we meet even Buckhannon and beyond.                 But in the

14   case where the district court is sending it back, it

15   must be sending it back for a violation of law, save one

16   instance.   The claimant comes forward and says:                I have

17   additional evidence that I didn't -- I didn't submit

18   below.   I've got an equitable ground to -- to convince

19   the court to, in essence, reopen the record.                 I want --

20   I want to send it back.

21                In that instance, fees should not be awarded

22   because it was the claimant's fault in not getting this

23   record -- this record evidence in.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, she prevailed

25   in some way to give her another chance to make that


                                        8

 1   argument.

 2                 MR. ATES:      Again --

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I'm just saying I

 4   think you're giving up too much.

 5                 MR. ATES:      Maybe I am, Mr. Chief Justice.

 6   But my point is to try to distinguish Hanrahan, in the

 7   sense that we have a judicial finding of a legal

 8   violation here.     What I was trying to articulate

 9   earlier, perhaps inartfully, was that she -- she's

10   eligible for fees under the five-factor test, but in

11   that instance the district court is not likely to use

12   its discretion to grant fees in that instance.                   I was

13   not --

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, what if you

15   get in Justice Kennedy's situation, where the court

16   doesn't know what's going to happen on remand?                   You

17   know, the objection is -- the administrator throws it

18   out, saying, you know, you filed the wrong form, so you

19   lose.    And the district court says you can't throw it

20   out on that basis; under trust law, it doesn't matter.

21   And it goes back.

22                 Now, the district court doesn't know what's

23   going to happen.     Does she get fees or not?

24                 MR. ATES:      It -- it depends on what the

25   district court does with it.              But she has to prove a


                                          9

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   violation of ERISA for it to go back.                     And if she proves

 2   that, she's eligible for fees.                And the district court

 3   in its discretion can take all these factors into

 4   account.

 5                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So is the district

 6   court -- is the district court supposed to wait until

 7   the whole thing is over before deciding the fee

 8   application?

 9                  MR. ATES:     I think the better practice is

10   for the district court to hold the case over and

11   supervise the remand.        But if the district court enters

12   judgment at that point, then -- then under Rule 54 or

13   the -- they have to come in and apply for fees within

14   14 days of that judgment.            But this case does not give

15   this Court an opportunity specifically to give the

16   courts, district courts, guidance whether to keep these

17   cases open or not, much like the Social Security cases

18   that happened in the late '80s and early '90s.

19                  But to get back to our main point, which is

20   this is not a prevailing party statute, that was the

21   fundamental error by the Fourth Circuit in imposing a

22   prerequisite to determining whether a claimant is

23   entitled to fees.     Section 502(g)(1) is not a prevailing

24   party statute for three primary reasons:                    first, the

25   language and structure of the statute.                    The words


                                         10

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   "prevailing party," a term of art that has been used for

 2   hundreds of years, is not within section 502(g)(1), but

 3   it is in other sections of ERISA.

 4               Its statutory sibling, section 502(g)(2),

 5   contains a judgment requirement.              Another provision of

 6   ERISA, 1451(e), uses the terms "prevailing party."

 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             How could somebody have

 8   some success on the merits if they don't achieve a

 9   judgment of some sort?

10               MR. ATES:     This case -- in the -- in the

11   Bradley case, which was cited in Hanrahan, said you

12   have many final orders in a case, and if the court

13   determines an issue of -- a particular issue in a

14   case -- and here it's finding an ERISA violation --

15   and as relief for that they are issuing an order

16   requiring Reliance to act within 30 days,

17   let's say the case settles at that point.

18   That's enough for fees to issue should the parties not

19   be able to agree on fees as a part of the settlement.

20   It's the judicial act in finding the violation that

21   triggers -- triggers the success on the merits.

22               And this case was on the merits.              As we

23   pointed out in our very yellow brief, the district

24   court --

25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But under your theory,


                                      11

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   presumably no relief has to be granted?

 2                 MR. ATES:     Relief does not have to be

 3   granted.   The district court --

 4                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But then what -- what's

 5   the difference -- is it your theory that if the district

 6   court -- for whatever reason, if this wasn't an ERISA

 7   case where a remand -- or where the court said they did

 8   violate, but I've now looked at the evidence that you're

 9   proffering, the new evidence they did not consider,

10   and it's not enough for benefits; you don't get it.                  Is

11   your argument that you are entitled to fees because they

12   decided there was -- the court decided there was a

13   violation of ERISA?

14                 MR. ATES:     Yes, it is.             My argument is you're

15   eligible for fees, and the amount of fees will be

16   taken into account in determining the degree in the

17   district court, taking these five factors into account,

18   taking into effect your position on the merits, the

19   defendant's position on the merits, and determining what

20   that fee award should be.           But it should not operate as

21   a barrier to getting into an eligibility question.

22                 So she's eligible for fees in that instance,

23   but what those fees should be is at the district court's

24   discretion.

 1   Justice Scalia's question, what's the difference between

 2   Hanrahan, where there's a violation of the civil

 3   procedure code which is an entitlement to process?                    Why

 4   aren't you successful, if this is a non-ERISA situation,

 5   merely for a finding that the district court acted

 6   improperly?

 7                  MR. ATES:     Because you have to look at the

 8   party who is violating.          Here it's the party who's

 9   violating the law.      It's a party to the suit who is

10   violating the law.      That violation is found in Hanrahan.

11   It's a civil procedure.          The district court didn't --

12   didn't do something right.

13                  Here -- and that's not a violation of the --

14   of law.     That's a -- that's a misapplication of a

15   civil -- of a rule of civil procedure.                    Here we have a

16   violation of law by a party.              That's the fundamental

17   difference between us and Hanrahan.

18                  JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask -- ask this

19   question?     The question here is whether there was

20   eligibility for fees.        Could the district judge in your

21   view say, yes, I think the plaintiff is eligible for

22   fees, but it was actually a very difficult legal issue,

23   and the defendant's position was entirely reasonable, so

24   I think as a matter of discretion I will not award any

25   fees?

 1                  MR. ATES:     The district court can exercise

 2   its discretion and not award fees.                   I think, however,

 3   that the better result is when a violation of law is

 4   proven, the plaintiff or in this instance a claimant or

 5   beneficiary should be entitled to some amount of fees

 6   because the purpose of the statute, explicitly stated in

 7   the statute, is to protect beneficiaries and claimants

 8   and have access to the Federal courts.

 9                  If every case is a close case and you're

10   not giving -- giving fees, then -- these are folks with

11   limited means.     These are folks by definition cannot

12   work when they are disabled, and you are eating up their

13   benefit through attorney's fees.                 And that cannot be the

14   point of the statute when Congress enacted this.                   It is

15   to protect beneficiaries, to give appropriate -- give

16   appropriate relief and keep open access to the Federal

17   courts.

18                  If I can get back to, again, why this is not

19   a prevailing party statute, the language and structure

20   clearly show that.      The history and context show it as

21   well.     And I'm not talking legislative history.                I'm

22   talking about the fact that ERISA supplanted the Welfare

23   and Pension Plans Disclosure Act, which required a

24   judgment before fees could issue, but Congress chose to

25   remove that requirement when it originally enacted


                                         14

 1   ERISA.   It does not have that judgment language and does

 2   not have prevailing party language.

 3                Moreover, this Court repeatedly has held

 4   that trust law should inform the interpretation of

 5   ERISA.   Trust law, for hundreds of years, has taken into

 6   account these principles that the district courts and

 7   courts of appeals have relied on for at least 30 years

 8   under ERISA to inform, guide, and limit district courts'

 9   discretion in awarding fees.

10                I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

14      ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

15                    SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

16                MR. SHAH:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

17   please the Court:

18                The district court found that Respondent's

19   original decision denying benefits disregarded pertinent

20   medical evidence in violation of ERISA and found that

21   the decision was otherwise unsupported by substantial

22   evidence.   Based on those findings, the district court

23   ordered Respondent to make a new benefits determination,

24   after which Respondent finally granted the benefits due.

25                Those facts established Petitioner's

 1   eligibility for a fee award under ERISA section

 2   502(g)(1), which authorizes a court to award reasonable

 3   attorney's fees, quote, "in its discretion," end quote.

 4   That discretion, as per ERISA more generally, is to be

 5   exercised in accordance with well-established trust law

 6   principles, and those principles quite clearly reject a

 7   strict prevailing party standard.

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Could you tell me

 9   whether you differ in your definition of "some success

10   on the merits" than your predecessor colleague?                   Do you

11   define it as in the manner he did, that it's any legal

12   judgment in the Petitioner's favor that another party

13   has done a wrongful act?           I think -- I think I'm

14   summarizing his position accurately.

15               MR. SHAH:        Yes, I -- I think we are in an

16   agreement, Your Honor, with -- with -- with Petitioner's

17   characterization.     When there's a judicial order

18   finding a violation --

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                No, that's different

20   than what he said.

21               MR. SHAH:        Okay.

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                All right.    Yes, here

23   there was an order of remand.               That's clear.     And I can

24   understand the difference between an order, because

25   there are many decisions of the court that end up in

 1   orders that are not final judgments.                      But there are

 2   decisions, like this one, I think according to him, that

 3   if the district court had said there was a violation of

 4   ERISA and the parties then settled without a judicial

 5   order reflecting that finding and/or requiring a remand,

 6   I think according to him he would say this party was

 7   entitled to fees.

 8                MR. SHAH:       I don't want to characterize his

 9   view, but here's our view on -- on "some success on the

10   merits."   If the order -- to be concrete about it, the

11   order in this case -- assuming this case, all that --

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               No, I didn't assume this

13   case.

14                MR. SHAH:       Pardon?

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               No order, just a

16   finding.

17                MR. SHAH:       So there's a finding of an ERISA

18   violation, period?

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               And then a settlement.

20                MR. SHAH:       And then a settlement.               Well,

21   Your Honor, I think it depends on which framework we're

22   operating under.     I think if we're operating under

23   well-established trust law principles, that clearly

24   qualifies as enough success to justify a fee award.                       And

25   we can look at several of the trust cases cited in both

 1   our brief and Petitioner's brief.                In re Catell's Estate

 2   is discussed in all the briefs.               There the plaintiff

 3   brought a claim to remove a trustee, and the basis for

 4   the claim to remove the trustee was a contention that

 5   the trustee wasn't complying with one of the terms of

 6   the trust.

 7                After he filed the suit -- and this was

 8   before even any finding by the judge -- the trustee then

 9   complied with that particular term of the trust.               And

10   then what the court said was, well, because the trustee

11   complied with the underlying premise or the motivation

12   for your suit, I'm going to deny your claim to have the

13   trustee --

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Well, that seems like a

15   catalyst theory, and that was, at least in dicta,

16   rejected in -- in Ruckelshaus.              So how do you deal with

17   that?

18                MR. SHAH:     Well, it wasn't -- in the dictum

19   in Ruckelshaus; it was actually accepted, Your Honor, in

20   that -- in the footnote the Court -- in the dictum within

21   Ruckelshaus, the Court says quite plainly that Congress,

22   in departing from a strict prevailing party language

23   in Ruckelshaus, meant to embrace judicial -- relief that

24   wasn't encapsulated within a judicial order.

25                But we're far afield from Ruckelshaus here,


                                       18

 1   because we actually have a judicial order, and we're

 2   far afield from the outer limits of the trust --

 3   trust law cases which -- which, for example, In re

 4   Catell's Estate, which I just mentioned -- and by no

 5   means is In re Catell's Estate an outlier.                 The Third

 6   Circuit's opinion in Dardovitch, which is also cited in

 7   our brief, recounts In re Catell's Estate as falling

 8   well within the history of trust law cases.

 9                 Petitioner's reply brief at page 11 cites

10   Grien v. Cavano.    That's another case where a plaintiff

11   brought -- brought a claim that a union fund was not

12   complying with accounting and proper bookkeeping

13   procedures.   After he filed the suit, they fell in line,

14   adopted the various procedures that plaintiff had

15   sought, and the court still said:                 Drawing upon trust

16   law principles, we're going to award fees.

17                 Now, again, I don't think the court has --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           As the Respondent points

19   out, the position you're taking is unusual for the

20   government.    The government is usually arguing against

21   fees, because the fees are often assessed against the

22   government.

23                 MR. SHAH:     Right.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           So long as you know that

25   you're making your bed and you're going to have to lie


                                        19

 1   in it --

 2                (Laughter.)

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- and you're essentially

 4   saying that when there is simply a procedural victory,

 5   which happens all the time, when -- when an agency is --

 6   is reversed in its procedure even though the -- the --

 7   the petitioner here doesn't get any concrete relief

 8   until it goes back to the agency and may lose in the

 9   agency ultimately, you're -- you're content to say

10   that fees are assessable in that situation, just by

11   reason of the procedural victory.

12                MR. SHAH:     Your Honor, a couple of

13   responses:   First of all, ERISA is somewhat unique in

14   that ERISA -- first of all, this provision doesn't have

15   prevailing party language as -- unlike EAJA, for example.

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:           No, I'm talking about other

17   prevailing -- I'm talking about other statutes that

18   don't say "prevailing party."

19                MR. SHAH:     Okay.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Sure.

21                MR. SHAH:     I think still this provision

22   is unique in that it's informed explicitly by trust

23   law principles, as this Court has held numerous --

24   in numerous decisions regarding other ERISA provisions.

25   And the trust law principles depart from the American


                                       20

 1   rule.   All of those other statutes which you have in

 2   mind, Justice Scalia, are premised on the background of

 3   the American rule.      The trust law departs from American

 4   rule, and so when you interpret ERISA section 502(g)(1)

 5   based upon the trust law principles, I think that

 6   supports a different --

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:              I'm -- I'm -- I'm not sure

 8   it's reasonable to interpret an attorney's fee provision

 9   as having anything to do with trust law.

10               MR. SHAH:        Well, even --

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:              It's -- it's a requirement

12   of attorney's fees enacted by -- by the Federal

13   Congress, and I -- I find that very artificial.

14               MR. SHAH:        Well, Your Honor, it's -- it's a

15   fee provision enacted within ERISA which explicitly

16   states as one of its purposes to protect beneficiaries

17   and to provide them access to courts.                     This is in the

18   legislative history.

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, I -- I can see now

20   why the red brief has a very substantial appendix with

21   statutes.   Now, you say, oh, this is unique.                    Well, then

22   we may have many, many different kinds of statutes.                        This

23   does not provide for -- this is not a prevailing party

24   statute.

25               MR. SHAH:        Correct.

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But just in going through

 2   the list of the statutes, there are many statutes that

 3   are not prevailing party statutes.                   And it seems to me

 4   that -- you say it's unique.              Well, it's unique in the

 5   sense it's in ERISA, but I -- I think it's very close to

 6   many -- many of the statutes with the language there in

 7   the red brief's appendix.

 8                 MR. SHAH:      Right.         And, Your Honor,

 9   previously the government has made narrow arguments.

10   For example, there were arguments --

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Take the case, though --

12   just take the -- what is the government's position?                        The

13   ERISA plaintiff wants $5 million.                  They get denied

14   everything.     The -- the court says:                    I noticed here

15   there was a 30-day deadline that you had, and he only

16   gave you 28 days, so I'm sending it back, but I'll tell

17   you your claim that there was enough evidence is absurd;

18   you're never going to win it.               And then he goes back,

19   and he loses it.     Okay?       He has had a procedural

20   victory.

21                 Does he get attorney's fees?                     Not -- not a

22   chance that he's going to win this claim, and, indeed, he

23   loses it.     He doesn't get a penny.                Does he get

24   attorney's fees, because on a technicality he won a new

25   hearing?

 1                 MR. SHAH:     Under your hypothetical, Justice

 2   Breyer, a district court would be within its

 3   jurisdiction to deny attorney's fees.                    That doesn't --

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:           My question is --

 5                 MR. SHAH:     He wouldn't --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:           -- does the statute, in

 7   the view of the government, permit attorney's fees in the

 8   case I just mentioned?

 9                 MR. SHAH:     Probably not in application.                 He

10   would be eligible, but a district court --

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Your answer is, yes --

12                 MR. SHAH:     Yes.

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:           -- it does permit?

14                 MR. SHAH:     Yes.        But a district court

15   applying --

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.         You're just

17   saying it won't be a problem because the district court

18   judges are all reasonable, and I know they think that.

19                 (Laughter.)

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What if -- what if

21   the success is preliminary?             You know, the plaintiff

22   survives a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff survives a

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Why?   He has had

 4   some success.

 5                MR. SHAH:      No, Your Honor, because that

 6   would be captured within Hanrahan, we think, and

 7   that's -- and that's easily distinguishable because

 8   those are errors -- even if some of those procedural

 9   victories were overturned on appeal or procedural losses

10   were overturned on appeal, those are all errors within

11   the court system or victories within the procedures of

12   the court system, not a violation of -- on the merits of

13   the underlying claim, which is what we have here.

14                We have a finding of a violation of ERISA

15   and then relief ordered to --

16                JUSTICE STEVENS:           But then, aren't you

17   treating the statute as though it did have a prevailing

18   party clause in it?

19                MR. SHAH:      Pardon, Your Honor.

20                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Is not your construction

21   one that just treats the statute as though it required

22   the plaintiff to be a prevailing party?

23                MR. SHAH:      Well -- well, Your Honor, no.              I

24   think our -- our -- our argument is to interpret it in

25   light of trust law principles.

 1                  Now, the trust law cases -- there is

 2   language in some of the trust laws cases that suggests

 3   that fees -- fees could be awarded to unsuccessful

 4   litigants or regardless of outcome.                       But I think if you

 5   read those cases, on the facts of those cases they don't

 6   go that far.     But I think what they do embody is a much

 7   broader notion of success than the strict prevailing

 8   party jurisprudence that this Court has promulgated --

 9                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, under your -- under

10   your rule would it be error for the district court to

11   terminate its jurisdiction?              It must keep jurisdiction

12   to see how the play comes out in the end?

13                  MR. SHAH:     No -- no, Your Honor, I don't

14   think it must keep jurisdiction.                 But certainly in a

15   case where it does retain --

16                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, but it certainly has

17   to in order to adopt the ameliorating factors that

18   you -- that you use in order to justify this rule.                          And

19   I -- I -- it's not clear to me that courts usually

20   retain jurisdiction in these cases.

21                  MR. SHAH:     May I respond, Your Honor?                 A

22   couple of responses, Justice Kennedy:                      First, if they

23   didn't retain jurisdiction -- and in the Seventh

24   Circuit, for example, that's one circuit which says that

25   these orders have to be final, and final judgment has to


                                         25

 1   be entered -- then we're exactly analogous to a

 2   sentence 4 Social Security case.

 3               And this Court has made it clear in a line

 4   of decisions that upon entry of final judgment -- and

 5   those are exactly analogous in the sense that what

 6   happens is that the court finds that the decision below

 7   committed some error in law, it vacates that decision,

 8   and then sends it back to the Social Security

 9   Administration for a new determination without

10   preordaining the result.        Regardless of the result

11   there, at the time of the remand and entry of judgment,

12   that plaintiff is eligible for -- for fees.

13               We think that the same outcome would be

14   controlled here, even if the Court applied its strict

15   prevailing party jurisprudence.

16               Thank you.

20                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

21               MR. ROSENKRANZ:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may

22   it please the Court:

23               No judge has ever decided the merits of

24   Petitioner's claim for benefits.              Under this Court's

25   holding in Ruckelshaus, the Petitioner must demonstrate

 1   some success on the merits, and under Rule 54 she must

 2   specify the judgment entitling her to an award.

 3                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What about the footnote

 4   that was mentioned in Ruckelshaus that said:                   "Congress

 5   found it necessary to explicitly state that the term

 6   'appropriate' extended to suits that forced defendants

 7   to abandon illegal conduct" -- illegal conduct was found

 8   here -- "although without a formal court order"?

 9                MR. ROSENKRANZ:           Yes, Your Honor.         Footnote

10   8 of Ruckelshaus addressed one sentence of legislative

11   history of a different statute, and only so far as the

12   Court pointed out that the sentence was of no use to

13   Sierra Club in that case.          I don't think the footnote is

14   properly read to be a full-fledged endorsement of the

15   catalyst theory.

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            This is not merely a

17   catalyst.   In Buckhannon, the catalyst theory was

18   rejected.   Here the court said:              If I were to decide

19   right now -- the district court said:                   I am inclined to

20   rule for Hardt, but I'm going to give Reliance an

21   opportunity to respond.

22                So the court had evaluated the evidence at

23   that point as favoring Hardt.             To that extent, it wasn't

24   a purely procedural ruling.            It says:         As things stand

25   now, Hardt should get fees; but I'm leaving the door


                                       27

 1   open.    So it wasn't just a procedural decision.                  It was

 2   an evaluation of the evidence up to that point, wasn't

 3   it?

 4                 MR. ROSENKRANZ:           Yes, Your Honor, but it

 5   would be an utterly unadministrable rule to attempt to

 6   weigh the inclinations of district judges in their opinions.

 7   This Court's precedents have made clear that we weigh

 8   success on the merits by evaluating judicial judgments.

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, the judgment is, send

10   it back.    That's what it says:             Send it back.       And the

11   reason for sending it back is this woman was undergoing

12   terrible pain, that the Social Security Administration

13   says she's completely disabled, that she's entitled in

14   the -- on the evidence shown.              There's no substantial

15   evidence to the contrary.           But you, the company, want to

16   take money from her instead of giving her the money.

17                 Now, I've read the record.                  It doesn't

18   support anything contrary to what I've said.                    So now

19   you send it back.     Now, what is that but a big victory

20   for the other side?      Which then leaves the company to

21   say:    They're right; pay them.

22                 Now, if that isn't -- I mean, what words of

23   English -- if you're -- we're talking about partial success.

24   Partial success, or not total defeat.                    That is the

25   language from Ruckelshaus.            Not "total success."             You

 1   still get it.   Okay.     What in the English language can

 2   we read in a case or a statute that would say you

 3   shouldn't reach that commonsense result?                  Now, of

 4   course, I'm characterizing it a little bit, but it does

 5   seem like a commonsense result.

 6                MR. ROSENKRANZ:           Your Honor, Petitioner in

 7   this case, like all plaintiffs, arrived in court

 8   requesting a judgment, a judgment awarding her benefits.

 9   Indeed, she believed she was entitled to such a judgment

10   as a matter of law, and she moved for judgment as a

11   matter of law for summary judgment.

12                What the district court actually did was

13   deny that motion for summary judgment.                  Rather than give

14   her the judgment she sought, the district court employed

15   a particular procedural maneuver, which was to remand

16   the case -- quote, "remand the case" -- to her

17   litigation adversary to reconsider the question.                    Now --

18                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             His point -- your

19   adversary's point -- is the court couldn't effect that

20   procedural move without taking step one in what was

21   requested.   It had to find some sort of violation,

22   either to remand or to grant benefits, so that the

23   relief sought, by definition, needed a finding by the

24   court.   And your adversary says the court found an ERISA

25   violation.


                                       29

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                Now, the type of relief it grants is up to

 2   its discretion.   This is an equitable situation, and it

 3   exercised its discretion by doing a remand.                 Why is that

 4   view different than calling it a procedural step?                 Isn't

 5   that a substantive win?

 6                MR. ROSENKRANZ:           Your Honor, this is a

 7   purely interlocutory order.            So this was not an end to

 8   the case.   This was not a decision on the merits.               This

 9   was a purely interlocutory order, on the road to a

10   decision on the merits, perhaps, but the district court

11   denied her motion for summary judgment, did not conclude

12   that she was entitled to benefits as a matter of law and,

13   instead, remanded the case for further proceedings.                 So --

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, what is the

15   impact on your position of our decision last week in

16   Conkright v. Frommert?       I know you haven't had a chance

17   to brief it, but I'm also sure had you a chance to read it.

18                MR. ROSENKRANZ:           Your Honor, Conkright

19   emphasizes that these judgments are to be made in the

20   first instance and, in fact, in the second instance by

21   claims administrators, that that is --

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I would have thought

23   that it -- one thing it did emphasize, that in the

24   typical case, the likely relief is going to be sending

25   it back rather than making a judicial decision, which --


                                       30

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   which seems to me, then, that -- and then presumably, in

 2   most cases, the person would prevail before the plan

 3   administrator.

 4               So given Conkright, your position is going

 5   to severely limit the circumstances under which

 6   claimants are entitled to fees.

 7               MR. ROSENKRANZ:            Your Honor, it's -- you are

 8   correct that in Conkright, the Court -- Court indicated

 9   that in most cases the district court should remand

10   under circumstances like this.              You are quite correct.

11   Under circumstances like this, then, there would be

12   fewer opportunities for district courts to award --

13   to award fees.   And that's a correct result under

14   502(g)(1), which, as informed by --

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Even though the --

16   as in Conkright, the claimant's success can -- before

17   an agreement, can be quite dramatic.                    This was a very,

18   very significant victory for the claimant to get it sent

19   back under those circumstances.

20               MR. ROSENKRANZ:            Your Honor, I'm not sure

21   this should be characterized as a victory.                    This is not

22   a procedural maneuver that the plaintiff sought.                    The

23   plaintiff asked for summary judgment, and her summary

24   judgment motion was denied.            And, instead, the district

25   court chose to remand the case to her litigation


                                       31

 1   adversary.   Surely, at that moment at least, that surely

 2   could not have felt like a victory.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Future claimants will not

 4   ask for summary judgment from the district court,

 5   presumably, in light of Conkright.                 They will ask that

 6   the case be remanded.       So, in future cases, will they

 7   have obtained a victory?

 8                MR. ROSENKRANZ:           I don't think that future

 9   claimants will ask for a remand as their final form of

10   relief, Your Honor.     This was -- the relief that one asks

11   for in one's complaint is the final judicial relief that

12   one wants.   This is --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, we've -- we've

14   already told them they can't get that.

15                MR. ROSENKRANZ:           Your Honor, a plaintiff

16   could get an -- could get the relief of benefits if a

17   claims administrator had acted severely improperly or in

18   very bad faith.   A district court still has power to

19   issue an award on summary judgment.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:           The claimant doesn't --

21   doesn't really claim that.           The claimant just says this

22   was a wrong decision and they should do it correctly.

23   And the claimant knows that all he's going to get from

24   the district court is a remand.

25                MR. ROSENKRANZ:           But the correct way to --


                                       32

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           So he would not ask for

 2   money and, therefore, would be victorious, on your

 3   analysis.     If all he asked for was a remand, he got a

 4   remand.

 5                  MR. ROSENKRANZ:           No, Your Honor.       A properly

 6   framed complaint under ERISA should still be a claim for

 7   benefits.    The -- the remand that Conkright contemplates

 8   is still an interlocutory remand, like the remand here.

 9   One does not put in one's complaint a desire for

10   interlocutory relief, any more than one asks --

11                  JUSTICE BREYER:           If someone wants a remand,

12   it's a remand, but on limited grounds; that is, a

13   holding of the district court.                The ERISA administrator

14   was -- it's an abuse of his discretion to refuse to give

15   this woman nothing.       In my opinion, she's entitled at

16   least to $30,000, but whether it's 30 or 35, I don't

17   know.     So I remand it to the ERISA administrator so he

18   can decide to act within -- within his discretion, give

19   her either 30, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

20                  Now, in your view, attorney's fees -- all

21   the statute says is the court, in its discretion, may

22   allow a reasonable attorney's fee.                   Nothing more.   Now,

23   what would stop an attorney's fee in that situation?

24                  MR. ROSENKRANZ:           Your Honor --

25                  JUSTICE BREYER:           If that's what you think.

 1                 MR. ROSENKRANZ:            Your Honor, a remand order

 2   under those circumstances might constitute success on

 3   the merits because it resolves an issue in the case, which

 4   was liability in the case.             So that perhaps would constitute

 5   success on the merits.         This resolved no substantive

 6   issue on the case.      This remand order simply says:              As a

 7   procedural matter, go back and look at it again.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:            You distinguish between him

 9   saying you have to give her at least 30 and his

10   saying the evidence that supports giving her less than

11   30 is -- insufficient, is substantially -- is -- what's

12   the word?     Yes, worthless.

13                 MR. ROSENKRANZ:            Yes, Your Honor, this Court

14   has -- this Court has expressly distinguished between

15   judicial --

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:            That's the line you draw?

17                 MR. ROSENKRANZ:            Yes, Your Honor, the

18   difference between judicial pronouncements and judicial

19   relief is one that this Court has --

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              That -- that's

21   difficult.    Let's assume that a claims administrator or a

22   plan administrator is not deciding the claim.                  The party

23   comes to court and says:           Under ERISA, I have a right to a

24   decision within X number of days; force them, mandamus

25   them to give me a decision.              The court says:       Reasonable;

 1   you have a right to one.         And orders them to.

 2               Under your theory, they've won nothing?

 3               MR. ROSENKRANZ:            No, Your Honor, in your

 4   hypothetical the -- the remand order would presumably be

 5   a final judgment, and it might well constitute success

 6   on the merits.

 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              So you're -- you're --

 8   wait a minute.   Then we go back to a question that was

 9   asked by one of my colleagues.              If a plan participant

10   came in and said they didn't consider evidence they

11   should have; they didn't seek my treating physician's

12   documents, and here they are; they should consider them

13   now, and the court says you're right, enters a

14   remand order, and dismisses the case -- that's enough?

15               MR. ROSENKRANZ:            Your Honor, I'm not sure

16   that's a properly formatted ERISA complaint.              If the

17   gravamen of the complaint is "I want my benefits" then --

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Well, what -- what's

19   the difference between the first example I gave, a

20   mandamus to issue a decision -- that's not a claim for

21   benefits, either; it's a claim for a decision.              What's

22   the difference between that and the second hypothetical?

23               MR. ROSENKRANZ:            If the -- if the gravamen

24   of the complaint is a complaint for benefits, then the

25   complaint should ask for benefits, and the judge should

 1   resolve that case.      A remand would always maintain

 2   jurisdiction -- should always maintain jurisdiction over

 3   the case, thus always be interlocutory and procedural.

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Is that how it

 5   works?   Remands always retain jurisdiction?                   I would --

 6   I would have thought the district judge would want the

 7   thing off his or her docket, you know, for the

 8   statistics, if anything.           And --

 9                (Laughter.)

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  -- and would say,

11   and maybe could say -- well, what if the judge says:

12   Look, I don't know if you're going to prevail or not

13   on remand.   My decision actually doesn't help you much

14   one way or the other, but if you get benefits, then the

15   other side is liable for attorney's fees, and I assume

16   you'll be able to work out the amount.                    If you don't,

17   he's done.   End of case.          Sent back to the

18   administrator.

19                MR. ROSENKRANZ:             Your Honor, on the research

20   that we have done, most district courts hold

21   jurisdiction on remands such as this, and we believe

22   that is the proper course.             When the case -- the gravamen of

23   the case is a complaint for benefits, the district court

24   merely remands to the ERISA claims administrator, the

25   merits of the case simply have not been decided.

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:            That may be, but why can't

 2   they do this?    What would be wrong with this heretical

 3   idea, that as long as the plaintiff wins something out

 4   of the court, the district judge -- that group of people

 5   we were talking about -- has discretion to decide

 6   whether ultimately they got something significant of

 7   what they wanted, and as long as that judgment helped

 8   them get them something significantly of what they

 9   wanted, attorney's fees are fine; and we leave it all up

10   to the district judge as long as the district judge

11   doesn't abuse the discretion that that standard gives

12   him?

13                What would -- I mean, would the Earth come

14   to an end?   What would happen that would be so terrible

15   if we said something like that?

16                MR. ROSENKRANZ:            Your Honor, I believe that

17   would be to embrace the catalyst theory that this Court

18   rejected in 2000 --

19                JUSTICE BREYER:            It didn't say anything

20   against the catalyst theory.             It said you have to

21   remember this is an American country, we follow the

22   American rule, and there has to be something special in

23   the situation.    And what would be special in this

24   situation is that the judge has to decide that as a

25   result of the favorable ruling, the plaintiff really did

 1   get something significantly of what she wanted.

 2                MR. ROSENKRANZ:             Your Honor, the Court was

 3   careful in Ruckelshaus to say that a purely procedural

 4   victory would not suffice.             Now, purely procedural

 5   victory may well -- may well result in success for a

 6   plaintiff at some later stage; it could result in

 7   out-of-court success.        This Court has been crystal clear

 8   that we do not look for success out of court; we don't

 9   look for it in interlocutory orders --

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Rosenkranz, suppose

11   the complaint was:      I asked for a turnover of certain

12   documents; they refused without reason. And the court

13   says:   You're right; you're entitled to those

14   documents.

15                It's interlocutory; there is no decision;

16   but the only thing that the plaintiff asked for the

17   plaintiff got, that is entitlement to the documents.

18   The court said:   You are entitled to the documents.

19   And then it goes back, and the documents are turned over

20   because the court has ordered that.

21                Under your theory, because there was no

22   determination of benefits, even that ruling which was a

23   total victory for the plaintiff doesn't open the door to

24   fees.

25                MR. ROSENKRANZ:             On your hypothetical, Your

 1   Honor, that would not be an interlocutory order.                    So if

 2   a plaintiff arrives seeking only documents and the

 3   district court awards her, her documents, that would be

 4   the end of the case, and the district court would

 5   properly relinquish jurisdiction, and we could evaluate,

 6   compare the result that the district court gave -- gave

 7   a plaintiff with what the plaintiff originally asked

 8   for.   But this is not such a case.

 9                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              So that would fall --

10   even if in the end of the -- at the end of the day no --

11   no award is made?     No benefits are awarded?

12                MR. ROSENKRANZ:             Your Honor, it might be

13   proper to frame a complaint under ERISA for a purely

14   procedural remedy like some documents.                    That is not the

15   main run of ERISA cases.           So in the normal case, a

16   petitioner arrives -- a plaintiff arrives asking for

17   benefits.   And --

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But you -- but you say --

19   you called it purely procedural and you said yes, but

20   that's the only thing that she asked for.                    So she got it.

21   So she qualifies for fees.             Even though you just

22   characterized it as purely procedural, it's a purely

23   procedural ruling, but it's all she asked for --

24                MR. ROSENKRANZ:             Your Honor --

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              -- so she gets benefits.

 1               MR. ROSENKRANZ:            -- I'm not sure that

 2   a properly framed ERISA complaint would be -- would

 3   be for a purely procedural result.                 If one could frame

 4   an ERISA claim like that, which I think is extremely --

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, I'm not dealing

 6   with something obscure.        If the -- the plaintiff says, I

 7   have asked for certain documents, they withheld those

 8   documents with no good cause at all, and the court said:

 9   You're right; turn over documents.

10               It's that hypothetical.                     It's just --

11   that's the situation.      There is a final order:                 Turn over

12   the documents.   But it's a procedural order, right?

13               MR. ROSENKRANZ:            Yes, Your Honor.

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But, nonetheless, benefits

15   would be -- nonetheless, fees would be available?

16               MR. ROSENKRANZ:            Your Honor, our position is

17   that in this case the remand order was both purely

18   procedural and interlocutory.             So it fails under both

19   those grounds.   On your hypothetical, the -- the order

20   would be a final order, but presumably still purely

21   procedural, and so perhaps not success on the merits

22   even on that hypothetical.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:            What if --

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You're changing -- you're

25   changing the answer.      The answer that you first gave

 1   me was it's a discrete issue -- final judgment, yes,

 2   qualifies for fees.       Now you're saying no, no fees?

 3                  MR. ROSENKRANZ:           Your Honor, it would

 4   qualify in the sense that it would be a final judgment,

 5   not an interlocutory order.              Whether that's properly

 6   characterized as a purely procedural victory or not, I'm

 7   not sure.   Most ERISA claims are not framed that way.

 8   They are usually framed as claims for benefits, not for

 9   purely procedural --

10                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Suppose the claim were:

11   They're just not processing my application.                     So, Court,

12   order them to process my application.                     Right; they're

13   not doing anything; we order then to go process the

14   application.    End of case in the district court.

15                  Fee entitlement?

16                  MR. ROSENKRANZ:           Again, Your Honor, that

17   would perhaps be best characterized as a purely

18   procedural victory even though it's a final judgment and

19   even though it's what the plaintiff sought.                     Again, in

20   this case, this order was purely interlocutory, and so

21   it's a much easier case.           This -- in this case, this was

22   a procedural step on the road to a final judgment.                     This

23   was not a final judgment at all and not at all what the

24   petitioner sought.

 1   to questions about the significance and the consequences

 2   of its position said, oh, this is a unique statute.

 3   ERISA -- it's is an ERISA statute.

 4                 Do you agree that if -- if we rule for you,

 5   it would be applicable primarily to ERISA and it

 6   wouldn't have an effect on these other statutes?

 7                 MR. ROSENKRANZ:            No, Justice Kennedy, I

 8   don't.   The Court has oftentimes emphasized that

 9   fee-shifting statutes ought to be read in parallel, that

10   we ought to have fewer rather than more fee-shifting

11   standards in the world.          And so, presumably, the result

12   in this case would govern any number of fee-shifting

13   statutes of similar language.

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What if the

15   parties -- to follow up on Justice Ginsburg's line of

16   questioning, what if the parties decide, look, this case

17   rises or falls on the discovery issue?                    If we have to go

18   through discovery, it's going to cost us a lot more than

19   to pay you.   So we stipulate whatever the ruling is on

20   discovery will decide the issue.

21                 In that case, can the party -- can the

22   claimant get fees?

23                 MR. ROSENKRANZ:            I'm sorry, Your Honor.        In

24   this hypothetical, the district court grants the

25   discovery order, but the -- but still holds jurisdiction

 1   over the case?

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, it grants the

 3   discovery order, and as a result, a direct result of that

 4   ruling, the plan pays benefits.

 5               MR. ROSENKRANZ:           No, Your Honor.       I believe

 6   that this Court has rejected the direct results theory

 7   and has instructed us to look at the content of judicial

 8   judgments, not at their ancillary effects on parties out

 9   in the world.

10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So what is the

11   difference between prevailing party and some success

12   on the merits for you?      The only difference is whether

13   they won on one cause of action as opposed to four?

14               MR. ROSENKRANZ:           Your Honor, in Ruckelshaus,

15   the Courts emphasized that omitting words like

16   "prevailing party" or "success" from a statute is

17   significant, but it's not revolutionary, that what it

18   accomplishes is a decrease in the quantum of success

19   required -- the degree, I believe was the Court's

20   language -- but not the type of success required.                But

21   it was still --

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             So under Buckhannon, 51

23   percent only entitles you to fees.                And under your view

24   of this statute, you have -- as long as you get

25   1 percent order, that's enough.

 1                MR. ROSENKRANZ:            Your Honor, the -- the Court

 2   in Ruckelshaus was speaking of the interpretation of

 3   "prevailing party" that -- that held sway in circuit

 4   courts in the 1970s.

 5                At that time, "prevailing party" had been read

 6   quite narrowly to require substantially prevailing, and

 7   the Court understood Congress to reject that standard in

 8   adopting a statute that doesn't include language like

 9   "prevailing party."      Subsequently, this Court has

10   adopted a much more liberal understanding of the words

11   "prevailing party," so there may not be --

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              So you -- you see no

13   difference today?

14                MR. ROSENKRANZ:            There may still be a

15   difference, but it will be a smaller difference and a

16   difference only in quantity, certainly not a difference

17   in type.   The result -- the success still has to be

18   success that you can find in a judgment of a court.

19                Your Honors, if I could -- Your Honors, as

20   a matter of policy, the plaintiffs have argued that this

21   will result in -- that -- I'm sorry.                     As a matter of

22   policy, the plaintiffs -- or the Petitioner's rule would

23   result in a second major litigation over attorney's

24   fees, and this Court has rejected any such rules.                     The

25   concern is that the fee-shifting inquiry ought to be

 1   simple and easy to administer.

 2                The ease of administrability of our rule is

 3   that it turns on the contents of judicial judgments.               If

 4   the Petitioner wins in this case, the policy result will

 5   merely be stingier plans.          So these are not plans that

 6   any private party is obliged to create, and this Court

 7   has emphasized that the purpose of ERISA is to balance

 8   the interests of beneficiaries, on the one hand, but also

 9   the interest in the creation of these plans and the

10   generosity of these plans, on the other.                And a fee award

11   under circumstances like this would result in far less

12   generous plans for -- for --

13                JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask this question?

14   You rely very heavy on Ruckelshaus, which of course was

15   a case in which the fees were sought to be imposed against

16   the government.

17                Is there a basis for distinguishing on a

18   sort of a sovereign immunity approach for saying that

19   maybe there should be a stricter standard when you're

20   taking money away from the sovereign than when you're

21   taking it away from private litigants?

22                MR. ROSENKRANZ:           Your Honor, I don't think

23   so.   The Solicitor General is here arguing that this

24   ought to be the rule, and it would presumably be the

25   same rule even in a statute that applied against the

 1   government.    Again, this Court has cautioned against a

 2   proliferation of different fee-shifting standards.                      I

 3   would think there would be a concern about having a

 4   different standard applied to the government than to a

 5   private party on -- on similar statutory text.

 6   Certainly, no indication in this statutory text --

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, it's a trust -- trust

 8   law is at issue here, is the government's assertion.

 9                 MR. ROSENKRANZ:           Your Honor, I agree with

10   you that it seems artificial in a way to apply those --

11   to apply -- to import those principles entirely.                    On the

12   other hand, this Court has emphasized that ERISA is

13   informed by trust principles.              And under Sprague, the

14   Court emphasized that trust principles would very rarely

15   shift fees in a context like this.                  So to that extent, I

16   do believe that this provision should be informed by

17   this Court's holding on that point.

18                 Just to re-emphasize, Your Honors, what

19   actually happened in the district court below:                    So the

20   Petitioners sought judgment as a matter of law for

21   benefits, and that motion was denied.                    Instead, she

22   received an interlocutory procedural order, a remand to

23   her adversary, a private party in litigation, to

24   consider the question again.

25                 And, as this Court emphasized, the second


                                        46

 1   inquiry by the claims administrator would be reviewed

 2   for abuse of discretion.         It could easily have come out

 3   the other way, as the district court itself

 4   acknowledged.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:            You also received -- she

 6   also received a conditional judgment in her favor.

 7               MR. ROSENKRANZ:            The district court

 8   specified that if Reliance did not comply with this

 9   procedural --

10               JUSTICE BREYER:            She said:        Unless this

11   order goes into effect within 30 days, the judgment will

12   be entered for the plaintiff, for her -- for her.

13               MR. ROSENKRANZ:            Yes, Your Honor.        That's

14   true, but I don't think that distinguishes this from --

15               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, she got one judgment

16   in her favor.   It was a conditional judgment.                 I mean,

17   if we're being technical, if we're going to just do

18   this totally on some kind of procedural theory of what's

19   a judgment, what's a judgment in your favor, and we just

20   don't want to look to the merits of it and see what

21   really happened, then why doesn't she win?                  Because she

22   got a judgment in her favor, okay?                 End of the matter.

23               MR. ROSENKRANZ:            Your Honor, she didn't

24   actually get a judgment.         She got a --

25               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, let's read the

 1   judgment.   Let's see.       It says -- it says judgment.            It

 2   says in a -- what is it called?                I just saw it here.

 3   My colleague had it here.

 4               It says -- I think this it.                   It says "Conclusion"

 5   -- it says -- and it's in the conclusion, and

 6   it says what happens.        And it says it denies, denies,

 7   denies, denies.   And then it says:                 "Reliance to act on

 8   Ms. Hardt's application, adequately considering all the

 9   evidence, within 30 days.           Otherwise, judgment will be

10   issued in favor of Mrs. Hardt."

11               Now, that's in a kind of judgment, I guess.

12   It's in an order.     So an order saying we'll issue a

13   judgment -- it sounds to me like you could say that's a

14   judgment in her favor.        You don't have to, but you

15   could.

16               MR. ROSENKRANZ:              Your Honor, I think that's

17   only -- the district court was only saying what is

18   implicit in most all procedural orders --

19               JUSTICE BREYER:              No.    Normally, a judge -- a

20   judge doesn't say:     It is ordered that if you do not

21   act within 30 days, there will be a judgment entered in

22   flavor of the plaintiff.          That's not a usual thing.

23               MR. ROSENKRANZ:              But, Your Honor, if a party

24   ignores the procedural order of a district court, it

25   does so often on peril of default.                  So it --

 1                  JUSTICE BREYER:           I'm just saying, if we're

 2   going to be formal and we're going to look to certain

 3   words included in -- in certain papers, irrespective of

 4   what really happened, don't we have those words in the

 5   paper that's relevant here?

 6                  MR. ROSENKRANZ:           Again, Your Honor, the

 7   district court did not decide the merits of this case.

 8   The district court offered the possibility that it would

 9   enter judgment if something happened in the future.

10   That thing did not happen in the future.                   There was

11   no judgment in her favor in this case.                    Again, the issue

12   was remanded to a private party to determine the issue.

13   The grant of benefits on remand certainly could not

14   constitute success on the merits.

15                  That was not judicial action at all.                 That

16   was the action of a private party.                   Purely voluntary

17   action.    Certainly, couldn't constitute a judgment under

18   Rule 54.     And then when the case arrived back at the

19   district court, the district court did the only thing

20   that it was left to do, which was to dismiss the case.

21                  And those are the actual actions the

22   district court took:        denying the motion for summary

23   judgment and dismissing the case.                  And under this

24   Court's precedents, where we look for success is in those

25   judgments.     Those judgments show us no success on the

 1   merits for Ms. Hardt.

 2                If there are no further questions --

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

 4                Mr. Ates, you have 4 minutes remaining.

 5                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. ATES

 6                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 7               MR. ATES:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 8   please the Court:

 9                I have two points on rebuttal:                Under their

10   we must have a final judgment on the benefits on her

11   claim for -- final judgment on the merits on her claim

12   for benefits, that is absolutely foreclosed by this

13   Court's decision in Schaefer, where a Social Security

14   claimant comes forward, shows a violation by the

15   Secretary; it's remanded back to the Secretary; the case

16   is closed at that point.          There was no decision on the

17   merits for the benefits, and yet this Court found that

18   was prevailing party.

19                Here, we don't need prevailing party, but

20   moreover, even accepting their theory, it leads to absurd

21   results.   There is a provision in ERISA, 1132(c),

22   that gives a claimant the right to seek documents.                  And

23   yet, they are saying if the claimant is wholly

24   successful to get the plan document from which certain

25   claims you don't even know if you have until you read


                                        50

 1   those plans, they would say it's a purely procedural

 2   victory; you cannot get attorney's fees.                 The whole

 3   point of that provision was to require the fiduciary to

 4   give the document over so people can understand their

 5   rights.

 6                Moreover, their final judgment on the merits

 7   for benefits rule leads to perverse incentives under

 8   ERISA.    The plan administrator is incented to deny the

 9   first time around, challenge it all the way through the

10   courts, on remand maybe, if they get a conditional

11   judgment, as here, that says if you don't act within

12   30 days I'm giving you that judgment, they then grant

13   the benefits and the court gets rid of the case, they

14   have succeeded in eliminating the right

15   of claimants to get to court to pursue their rights,

16   because of the cost of litigation.

17                But moreover, here we have a judgment.                  To

18   be clear, that is not our argument.                  We had a

19   conditional judgment by the district court sending it

20   back:    If you do not act in accordance with law within

21   30 days, I will enter judgment on this case.

22                We have that, but at the end of the day,

23   it was not a dismissal.        They overlooked district court

24   docket 57.   There was a judgment entered in Ms. Hardt's favor

25   against Reliance in the amount of attorney's fees.                   The


                                        51

 1   original order merges into that judgment.                  We have a

 2   final judgment here as well.            Although we don't need it

 3   under section 502(g)(1), we have it here.

 4               This Court should not require a judgment

 5   before fees can be awarded.            The whole -- and it

 6   certainly shouldn't adopt a purely procedural rule out

 7   of thin air that's not in the statute.                  This is a

 8   procedural statute.     The only way claimants can

 9   effectuate their right is ensuring the procedure is

10   followed.   That is what we have here.

11               They did not follow proper procedure.                   They

12   abused their discretion.         They breached a fiduciary

13   obligation to the claimant.            In these circumstances,

14   under the clear language and clear structure of this

15   statute, this claimant is entitled to fees.

16               The only -- may I finish?

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Sure.

18               MR. ATES:       The only issue that Reliance

19   contested was whether she was a prevailing party.                   Knock

20   that leg of the stool, their case fails.

21               Thank you.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

23               The case is submitted.

24               (Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in the

25   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
