 6                    ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA CALL

 7                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                 MS. CALL:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10                 Mr. Johnson's conviction for battery in the

11   State of Florida can be sustained by the slightest

12   contact.   Such a conviction does not qualify as a

13   violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act.                 A

14   violent felony means one that has as an element the use,

15   attempted use, or threatened use of physical force

16   against the person of another.               Physical contact is not

17   the same as physical force.

18                 Physical force in this context means

19   something more than a mere quantum of physical contact,

20   and it requires violent aggression that is likely to

21   cause physical injury.         This conclusion is guided by the

22   rules of statutory construction in this Court's

23   precedents.    The better-reasoned circuits have applied

24   these principles to find that physical force means

25   something more than de minimis contact.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And that's -- you say

 2   that's Federal law.      Would it make a difference if,

 3   contra what Florida held in the Hearns case, a State had

 4   typed a battery statute as a crime of violence?

 5               MS. CALL:       Yes, Your Honor.           If the State

 6   statute required that the offender admit the use of

 7   force as part of the elements of his prior offense --

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            No, no, no.      It's exactly

 9   the -- it's exactly the statute Florida has.                And

10   somebody has a plea, and we don't know from the record

11   what the conduct was.       But the State, unlike Florida,

12   says, our battery statute for our State law purposes is

13   a crime of violence; therefore, for our State law

14   enhancements the person who pleads guilty to a battery

15   offense will be deemed one who has committed a crime of

16   violence, if that's the State law.

17               MS. CALL:       Then -- no, Your Honor, I'm

18   sorry.   Then the mere fact that the State found that it

19   qualified under its own recidivist statute would not

20   bind the Federal court.        Why we say that Hearns is

21   binding is the proposition that it found the elements of

22   a battery offense and the -- the ACC looks to those

23   elements to determine whether it is a violent felony.

24   Congress didn't say that it -- the offender had to have

25   conduct that involved the use of physical force, but a


                                       4

 1   prior that had as an element the use.

 2               So the fact that the State statute may

 3   qualify under its State recidivism wouldn't be the same

 4   determination that it didn't have as an element the use

 5   of force.   Here --

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:            But what -- what -- before

 7   we can even get into this, I think we have to decide if

 8   those words "striking or touching" describe one crime or

 9   two.   And what we said in Chambers is that the nature of

10   the behavior that likely underlies a statutory phrase

11   matters in this respect.        If you think of the seven

12   different things covered by one statute in James or

13   Chambers, two of them, failing to return from a furlough

14   and failing to return from work in day release, seem to

15   me quite possibly to describe one thing, not two.

16               Now, how do we know that striking or

17   touching describes two things?             I couldn't find any

18   instance, and we had the library looking.              I couldn't

19   find any instance in Florida where those two things have

20   ever been charged separately.            And they looked at

21   hundreds.

22               So -- so why do we think it's two crimes,

23   rather than just one called "striking or touching"?

24               MS. CALL:       Your Honor, two reasons.          First,

25   the face of the statute itself has "or," so it doesn't


                                       5

 1   require --

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:             It does, too, in Chambers.

 3   It's "not returning from furlough or not returning from

 4   work release."     You know, and I'd -- I would say the

 5   behavior is the same.        It's not like burglary of a

 6   dwelling versus burglary of a boat.                      Those are two

 7   separate things.

 8                MS. CALL:       Yes.

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:             Here, why do you think they

10   are two separate things?

11                MS. CALL:       Your Honor, because Hearns, the

12   Florida State Supreme Court decision, described them as

13   three separate offenses and spelled out that this

14   statute could be violated and it said by:                     First,

15   touching someone intentionally and against their will;

16   second, by striking; or third, by causing bodily harm.

17                JUSTICE BREYER:             Okay.      If they are separate

18   things, what is the evidence?              There is a legal

19   question.    You say the touching.               Spitting, is that

20   enough to rise under the -- to fall within the Federal

21   statute?    Suppose I agree with you on that; the answer's

22   no.

23                How do I know whether touching as applied in

24   Florida as a separate matter in the mine run of cases,

25   involves spitting or involves something that causes far

 1   more serious harm?     How do I know?

 2                 MS. CALL:     Your Honor, you would apply first

 3   the plain language of the statute, and "to touch" means

 4   the slightest contact, as the courts have held.                 At

 5   pages 41 to 42 we spelled out the offenses of spitting,

 6   making slight contact, that justified a battery

 7   conviction.    "Strike" obviously has to mean something

 8   else or the legislature wouldn't have included both

 9   types of conduct within the battery provision.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           This -- this statute is a

11   misdemeanor statute, isn't it?

12                 MS. CALL:     For a first offense, yes, Your

13   Honor.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yeah.      And the only reason

15   what happened here was elevated to a felony was that he

16   had a prior offense.

17                 MS. CALL:     Yes, Your Honor.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           So it's understandable that

19   the slightest touch could -- could constitute a

20   misdemeanor.

21                 MS. CALL:     Your Honor, the problem with

22   saying that just because it's a felony, therefore it

23   can't be considered is that the statute first describes

24   the prohibited conduct and says that the conduct is in

25   the first subparagraph, the penalty is in the second.


                                        7

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   So the very same conduct is necessary for either a

 2   felony or a misdemeanor, and essentially no force times

 3   two is still zero.

 4               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, ACCA uses the words

 5   "physical force," and any touching involves some

 6   physical force.   Now, how do we determine how much more

 7   than the minimum physical force is necessary in order to

 8   fall within the Federal statute?

 9               MS. CALL:      Your Honor, it is a qualitative

10   line that sentencing judges would have to make, like all

11   of the other difficult decisions that they're called on

12   to make in the sentencing guidelines in these 3553

13   factors.   We've asserted as a proposed test that it be

14   conduct just like the Begay test, that it would be

15   physical force of a kind that is violent and aggressive

16   and likely to cause injury.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, there -- most -- this

18   statute actually, we looked into it and it seems to be

19   used, particularly the touching part, also to cover

20   unwelcome physical, sexual advances.                   And it's not hard

21   to consider such matters to have involved force of

22   exactly the kind that the Federal statute is aimed at.

23   And there was no striking, but there was in fact use of

24   harmful force, touching.        That was serious.

25               Now, how do we know which is more normally


                                       8

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the case when this statute is used in its touching

 2   respect?

 3                MS. CALL:     Your Honor, the government has

 4   cited a footnote of 6,000 convictions, and there is no

 5   way to know of those convictions whether they were

 6   charged as to touch, to strike, or to cause bodily harm.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:           But we don't have to know

 8   what's more normal anyway, do we?

 9                MS. CALL:     No, Your Honor.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:           If -- if any conviction is

11   possible under the element of the crime to touch, when

12   there is simply slight physical force, your argument

13   still stands, right?

14                MS. CALL:     Yes, Your Honor.

15                JUSTICE BREYER:           I would say that's

16   certainly wrong under our cases.               I mean, I would have

17   thought that the reason that burglary, for example, is a

18   violent crime is not because in every instance there is

19   a risk of physical harm, because in the mine run of

20   instances there is a risk of physical harm, and I

21   thought we said that in at least three cases.

22                MS. CALL:     Yes, Your Honor, as to looking to

23   both the enumerated offenses and those that fall in the

24   otherwise.   The first prong of the ACC, though, does not

25   talk about conduct and it does not refer to an ordinary


                                       9

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   case.   It says an offense that has as an element.                 And

 2   therefore it is directed to looking at a particular

 3   Florida State statute rather than a generic battery or

 4   how battery might ordinarily --

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:           I know, but an element --

 6   you mean we should interpret "element" in the first part

 7   of this in a radically different way than we have

 8   interrupted equivalent words in the second part, and we

 9   should say that burglary -- in other words, assault

10   or -- or -- in other words, unless in every case of

11   prosecution there is going to be force actually applied

12   or something like that, that it doesn't fall within one?

13   I'm surprised at it.     I mean, I guess it's possible.

14   What would be the argument for doing that, which would

15   be totally different than we have handled the other one?

16               MS. CALL:      Your Honor, the reason why is

17   that Congress was directing in the first prong those

18   crimes that were directed against persons and would be

19   defined by their elements.          In the second prong Congress

20   did list out four enumerated offenses that they thought

21   were committed, A, by career criminals, and, B, that

22   created that substantial risk.             In the first part it

23   does not talk about risk to others.                    It's that

24   offender's conduct and an elements-based test.

25               JUSTICE ALITO:          If there were a State

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   statute that made it a battery to engage in offensive

 2   and unwelcome sexual touching, your argument would be

 3   that that would not fall within the first prong of ACCA,

 4   because there is not a -- it's not likely to cause a

 5   physical injury?

 6              MS. CALL:        Yes, Your Honor.

 7              JUSTICE ALITO:            Is that right?

 8              MS. CALL:        Yes, Your Honor.            Because --

 9              JUSTICE ALITO:            If there was a statute that

10   said -- in the old days I'm told people used to throw

11   the contents of chamber pots out the window.                If there

12   were a -- a State statute that said it is a crime to

13   dump the contents of a chamber pot on somebody's head,

14   you would say that's -- that doesn't fall within the

15   first prong of ACCA?

16              MS. CALL:        Yes, Your Honor, I would say that

17   that does not qualify under the first prong.

18              JUSTICE ALITO:            Even -- those are classic

19   batteries --

20              MS. CALL:        Yes, Your Honor.

21              JUSTICE ALITO:            -- and the language of the

22   first prong of ACCA really tracks the language of the

23   common law crime of battery?

24              MS. CALL:        Your Honor, it does because it

25   talks about in Florida the element is the slightest


                                       11

 1   contact.    And we were not arguing that that offender who

 2   spits or touches or does these other disrespectful acts

 3   doesn't deserve to be charged and can't be charged with

 4   battery under Florida's State law.

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:           So -- so what about an

 6   assault?    I guess, using a law school hypothetical, I

 7   mean, a statute for assault -- I guess you could assault

 8   somebody by threatening to throw a marshmallow at them.

 9                MS. CALL:      Yes, Your Honor.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay.       Now, assault is out

11   of the statute.

12                MS. CALL:      Your Honor, again, it depends on

13   each particular statute and its elements.

14                JUSTICE BREYER:           No, no.          But I mean, on

15   your definition, as you and Justice Scalia were

16   suggesting, because it is conceivable that you could

17   assault somebody by threatening to throw a marshmallow,

18   that means assault is no longer a crime of violence, and

19   that can't be right.

20                MS. CALL:      Well, Your Honor --

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, of course it's right.

22   You don't have to touch somebody for an assault.

23                MS. CALL:      Correct.

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:           You can just threaten

25   somebody.

 4                 Ms. Call:     And that would be --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Of course it's right.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Assault is not a crime of

 7   violence; it's not a use of force.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Certainly not.

 9                 MS. CALL:     Two responses to that, Your

10   Honor.    The first is, looking at the underlying facts

11   would violate the categorical approach of saying we're

12   not looking at what each offender might have done in any

13   particular case, but what are the elements that he

14   necessarily admitted.       And under the Florida statute it

15   would qualify as a violent felony because the Florida

16   statute defines it as an offer to do violence coupled

17   with the --

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:          What about attempted

19   murder?

20                 MS. CALL:     Your Honor, yes, if it has as an

21   element the use of force.          And that --

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:          But it didn't --

23                 MS. CALL:     Yes, but under the ACCA, which is

24   one of the phrases that the government elides out of its

25   analysis, it's not simply the actual use of force, but

 1   an attempted or threatened use of force.

 2                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Can I ask you something?

 3   In your definition, you appear to hinge it on the fact

 4   that the force used has to cause injury of some type,

 5   that.     That appears to be the only definition you can

 6   give.     But the use of physical force means just the use

 7   of force, strong force, violent force, aggressive force,

 8   but it doesn't mean that it necessarily has to cause

 9   injury.

10                 Would my rearing back and slapping you?             In

11   those instances slapping doesn't cause physical injury

12   as that term is defined in the common law, which is an

13   injury of lasting effect.           You may have some redness for

14   a second, but that's all.           Would that qualify as a crime

15   of violence?

16                 MS. CALL:      Your Honor, some of these

17   questions will be difficult lines for the court -- a

18   sentencing court to draw.           We have offered the

19   definition that violent felony, the word "violence"

20   encompasses sort of a rough use of force that could lead

21   to injury or is likely to lead to injury, not --

22                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Well, but violence has a

23   broader meaning.    It generally means a strong force or a

24   strong -- physical force generally has some relative

25   degree of -- of impact.         I agree with you, the common

 1   definition talks that way.            Why should we read something

 2   more into it, like physical injury?

 3               MS. CALL:        Your Honor, the Court wouldn't

 4   have to, and part of where we drew this from is the

 5   Court's language in Begay that indicated that crimes

 6   within clause (1) of ACCA are those crimes which are

 7   also likely to present a serious risk of potential

 8   injury to others.

 9               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Many will, but don't --

10   serious use of force doesn't necessarily always.

11               MS. CALL:        Yes, Your Honor, and that's why

12   the qualitative line falls somewhere higher than mere

13   contact, which would simply be the standard for Florida

14   battery conviction.

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Suppose we knew -- knew

16   what happened.   It's the same statute, and it would be

17   possible to have a conviction for a rude touching under

18   it.   But this man, instead of pleading guilty, in fact

19   went to trial, and we know that he beat somebody badly.

20   If -- if that were the case, if we knew what the facts

21   were, then would the ACCA enhancement be in order?

22               The statute covers the waterfront from a

23   rude touching to beating somebody to a bloody pulp.              But

24   we know, because there's been a trial, exactly what this

25   person does, and what he does would fall under the

 1   aggressive violence, capable of doing physical injury to

 2   another.

 3              MS. CALL:         No, Your Honor.             Knowing the

 4   added fact of the actual conduct would not answer the

 5   question because it is based on the elements.                   However,

 6   if the prosecutor charged it as to strike, or there was

 7   a division -- for example, at page 19 of our reply brief

 8   we showed the Fifth Circuit case in Robledo.                   It tracked

 9   the exact same Florida statute that is at issue here and

10   said the offender did touch or strike the victim, comma,

11   by striking him with a vehicle.                And the Fifth Circuit

12   said under the modified categorical approach to look at

13   the charging document and the offender's necessary

14   admission shows that was, in fact, a crime of violence.

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Isn't there a separate -- a

16   separate battery crime, aggravated battery, in -- in

17   Florida, which --

18              MS. CALL:         Yes, Your Honor.            There are two

19   other felony battery statutes, apart from this one that

20   do --

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, this isn't -- this

22   isn't a felony battery statute.                This is a misdemeanor

23   battery statute, which has been elevated to a felony in

24   this case only because the fellow had a prior.

25              MS. CALL:         Yes, Your Honor.

 1              JUSTICE SCALIA:           But, besides the

 2   misdemeanor battery statute, there are two felony

 3   battery statutes in Florida, right?

 4              MS. CALL:      There are.            Two other separate --

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:           And how -- how are they

 6   defined?

 7              MS. CALL:      Your Honor, they add the mens rea

 8   of whether or not the battery was intended to cause

 9   great bodily harm, permanent disfigurement, or permanent

10   disability; and the other says simply that you committed

11   a battery and did cause -- the higher standards.                 But --

12   and, in addition, the misdemeanor battery includes the

13   element of causing bodily harm, and offenders can be

14   charged simply with that provision.

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:           Misdemeanor does?

16              MS. CALL:      Yes.       Yes, Your Honor.      The

17   felony version is to cause great -- great bodily harm.

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:           Right.

19              MS. CALL:      And the misdemeanor is to cause

20   bodily harm, which Florida law defines as low as causing

21   a bruise or mark like that.

22              So, if someone were charged with, in State

23   court, a predicate that involved that kind of injury, a

24   prosecutor using his or her discretion could charge

25   under causing bodily harm and -- which showed facts that


                                     17

 1   could support the finding of a violent felony.

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What -- what about

 3   the government's argument that your interpretation would

 4   dramatically limit the reach of this provision of ACCA

 5   because of the number of States that define battery in

 6   the same way Florida does?

 7              MS. CALL:       Your Honor, I think that the

 8   government exaggerates the concerns of that because

 9   there are statute that both require an admission of the

10   use of force or have that as an alternative that could

11   be prosecuted in the appropriate case.

12              JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, but --

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Yeah, but it's --

14   it's usually easier just to charge the lowest common

15   denominator, the battery that doesn't necessarily

16   require violent force, and the point -- this was the

17   argument that was accepted in -- in Hayes, that the

18   interpretation, say, advanced by the dissent in that

19   case, would mean that there be a vast number of States

20   that weren't covered.

21              I mean, presumably, Congress meant to cover

22   all the States.

23              MS. CALL:       Yes, Your Honor.            However,

24   because the -- in Hayes, the Court was looking at the

25   "committed by" and whether that was the -- the necessary

 1   part of the prior conviction.

 2               Here, given the fact that the statute can be

 3   charged both in Florida and many other statutes to be

 4   included, shows that those cases would -- it would only

 5   be a small number of cases that are likely to be

 6   affected where --

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:             You -- you would have to

 8   have other States which only have a battery statute that

 9   is defined as broadly as this misdemeanor battery

10   statute in Florida.

11               If they have a higher degree of battery,

12   just as Florida does, which is a felony, then, if the --

13   if the prosecutor wants this fellow to be convicted of a

14   violent crime, he -- he could charge him with that --

15   with that higher degree.

16               MS. CALL:        Yes, Your Honor.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Are there any States that

18   have only this simple battery statute, which is -- which

19   is met by a simple touching?

20               MS. CALL:        According to LaFave, only Florida

21   and I believe one other State has such a broad

22   definition --

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:             No. No.          You mistook my

24   question.

 1              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Are there any States in

 2   which the only prosecution for battery that can be

 3   brought is under a statute as broad as this one, which

 4   is -- is covered by even a touching?

 5              MS. CALL:       No, Your Honor.

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Don't all of the other

 7   States that have a touching statute also have higher

 8   degree of battery statutes?

 9              MS. CALL:       Yes, Your Honor, according to

10   LaFave, all States have aggravated battery statutes that

11   include either the use of a deadly weapon or --

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But I thought the

13   evidence was pretty clear that Congress was adopting the

14   common law definition of battery here, which doesn't

15   require that higher degree of force or violence.

16              MS. CALL:       Your Honor, in the legislative

17   history, the only time that they talked about battery --

18   in one House report it references battery and assault,

19   simply by those descriptions.

20              Every other time, they talked about assault

21   and battery with a deadly weapon and something more than

22   a simple touching.

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Do they use battery in the

24   statute here?   I am looking for it.                   I don't -- I don't

25   see the word "battery" at all.

 1                 MS. CALL:     No, Your Honor.             There is no

 2   enumerated offenses in the first prong.

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Well, what worries me more

 4   than -- than your application to battery is the

 5   methodology, because, if it's true that in Section 1,

 6   unlike Section 2, a single instance of where you could

 7   commit the crime without using force is sufficient to

 8   take it out of the statute, then, just looking through

 9   this, generally, you would take out assault, probably

10   have to take out kidnapping.             You would probably have to

11   take out domestic violence.            You would have to take out

12   extortion, certainly, explosives laws.

13                 I mean, the very -- laws that I would think

14   Congress certainly intended to include in that first

15   definition.

16                 MS. CALL:     Your Honor, when they --

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:          So that's very worrying,

18   and why I don't think it's the right methodology.

19                 MS. CALL:     Well, Your Honor, they did use

20   the word "element," and an element is a constituent --

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Yes, but an element could

22   be an element that is a -- the word is "element," the

23   use or threatened use of physical force.                 Now, an

24   element, say like abduction, could be an element that

25   uses physical force if in the mine run of cases it uses


                                       21
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   physical force, even though one can sometimes think of

 2   an exception.   That's how we have interpreted 2.

 3      So if we interpret 1 a different way, we are going to

 4   take outside the statute the very things that Congress

 5   wanted inside; and, if we interpret it the same way, I

 6   think we would get to the right result.

 7              MS. CALL:       Your Honor, I would have two

 8   responses to that.    The first is, in the second prong,

 9   Congress used the word "conduct."                And if they had meant

10   conduct to be included in 1 rather than the elemental

11   definition, that would have been a very easy definition.

12              Second, when they talked about the crimes

13   intended for category 1, they gave the examples of

14   someone with murder convictions, rape convictions, a

15   gangland enforcer.

16              JUSTICE BREYER:            Rape can be convicted

17   without -- rape can be conducted without force.

18              MS. CALL:       Yes, Your Honor.

19              JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.       So now rape is

20   out.

21              MS. CALL:       Your Honor, it depends on the

22   element of the offense.

23              JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, the element of rape

24   is not force; it's lack of consent.

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Excuse me.       Under 1 it

 1   depends upon the elements, but what about 2 and

 2   especially the residual provision of 2, "any other

 3   conduct that presents a serious potential risk of

 4   physical injury to another"?             I would think rape

 5   qualifies under that.

 6                 MS. CALL:     And, certainly, if the government

 7   believes --

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          And many of the other

 9   crimes that Justice Breyer has been talking about.

10                 MS. CALL:     Yes, Your Honor.               I certainly

11   agree that -- -

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:          You do?          You agree that,

13   then -- in other words, Section 2 is not about property

14   crimes that involve force, which is what Congress

15   happened to say nonstop in the legislative history,

16   which I know isn't read by everyone.                    But it seemed to

17   me reading that history, the first part is dealing with

18   those things that aren't property crimes.                    The second

19   part, like arson, extortion, which they had in mind of a

20   certain kind, and whatever, the explosives-related

21   things, were things that they thought didn't -- could be

22   property crimes that also involved harm to people.

23                 MS. CALL:     Yes, Your Honor, and --

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Well, you can't say yes to

 1                MS. CALL:      Well -- I agree with Your Honor

 2   that the legislative history certainly indicates that 1

 3   and 2 had different purposes, but this Court didn't find

 4   Begay and Chambers on the easy test, to say simply that

 5   DUI is not a property crime, therefore it doesn't

 6   qualify.    So I hesitate to offer that as a solution to

 7   the Court, but keeping in mind that the government --

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I dare say that the next

 9   time somebody comes to argue before this Court that a

10   crime is not included within Section 2 because it's not

11   a property crime, I don't think that person is going to

12   get one vote.

13                JUSTICE BREYER:           They wouldn't have to say

14   that.    They would have to say that it is not a crime

15   like the three that are mentioned, which I can't

16   remember -- it's arson, extortion -- and what's the

17   third?    Using explosives.

18                MS. CALL:      It is burglary, arson, extortion,

19   and --

20                JUSTICE BREYER:           Yeah, burglary, arson,

21   extortion -- all right.        You would say it's not like

22   that.    It's DUI; it was not like that.

 1   prove that a predicate qualified under the first prong,

 2   it could offer argument in evidence to the sentencing

 3   judge to show that it met the Begay test and was, in

 4   fact a serious risk of injury, that -- purposeful

 5   violence, et cetera.      It's simply not that battery by

 6   touching qualifies.

 7                And, Your Honor, if I may reserve the

 8   remainder.

 9                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Would you just clarify an

10   answer that you gave.       You described Florida as unique,

11   but I thought there were many States that had a

12   codification of common law battery that would include

13   both touching and more aggressive behavior.                I thought

14   Florida was not alone in having that kind of statute.

15                MS. CALL:      There are other States, Your

16   Honor, that have the common law definition, but they

17   also have alternative versions.              Many of the States also

18   have alternative versions that require either the use of

19   force or the aggravated if the underlying conduct or the

20   underlying charge was that serious matter of involving

21   physical force to qualify under a violent felony.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:          I thought you said they all

23   had such -- such aggravated statutes in your answer to

24   me.   Now you just said many of them do.               Which is it?

25                MS. CALL:      Well, many have alternative

 1   versions that require admission of use of force, not

 2   simply, say, touching or striking like Florida.                  But all

 3   do have felony versions of aggravated felony.

 6             ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER

 7                 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 8              MS. KRUGER:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10              The primary definition of violent felony in

11   the Armed Career Criminal Act, as, Justice Alito, you

12   have noted and, Mr. Chief Justice, as you have noted,

13   almost precisely tracks the general definition of the

14   crime of battery; that is, the unlawful application of

15   physical force to the person of another.

16              Petitioner's primary submission --

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, then why

18   didn't they say -- why didn't they just say battery, if

19   that's what they meant?         It's a lot simpler and also

20   clearer than to say physical force against the person.

21              MS. KRUGER:          I think it's certainly true,

22   Mr. Chief Justice, that Congress could have defined the

23   category of predicates for the ACCA in that way by

24   listing certain offenses, which would then require the

25   courts to determine what the generic elements of those


                                        26

 1   offenses were, as this Court did with respect to

 2   burglary in Taylor.

 3               But Congress instead decided to list in its

 4   primary definition of violent felony the common element

 5   that it thought as a categorical matter indicated a

 6   sufficient potential for harm that the crime ought to be

 7   singled out as a predicate for ACCA enhancement.                      And

 8   that single element was the use of physical force

 9   against the person of another.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:           You -- you -- you would

11   have us believe that by "violent felony" in this -- in

12   this statute, Congress meant the threat -- the threat?

13   It doesn't even have to be the act.                    You know, if you

14   don't shut up, I am going to come over and thwonk you on

15   your shoulder with my index finger.                    I'm going to

16   (snap).   This is a violent felony under this statute

17   which gets him how many more years?

18               MS. KRUGER:        It creates a mandatory minimum

19   of 15 years.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Fifteen years for (snap).

21               (Laughter.)

22               MS. KRUGER:        Justice Scalia, I think that

23   there are a few responses to that question.                    The first

24   is that a threatened use of force is normally considered

25   and normally punished under the criminal law as a crime


                                      27

 1   of assault.     And for the reasons that Justice Breyer has

 2   noted already in the arguments, it seems awfully

 3   unlikely, particularly in light of legislative history

 4   of this provision for those Justices who consider such

 5   considerations relevant, that Congress meant to exclude

 6   the crime of assault.

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           But that's all he's

 8   necessarily been convicted of.               When a verdict is

 9   brought in in Florida under this misdemeanor statute,

10   all you know for sure is that he threatened to go

11   (snap).   That's all you know for sure that he has been

12   convicted of, and you are going to give him 15 years.

13                 MS. KRUGER:       And again, two responses:             The

14   first is as a practical matter that is not a crime.

15   Normally the law of assault, in order to constitute a

16   criminal threat, there has to be more than simply the

17   use of words.    There has to -- the defendant has to

18   manifest by conduct.

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But there have been rude

20   touchings where there is no danger of physical injuries

21   to the person.    There have been prosecutions in Florida,

22   I understand, for what would be considered a rude

23   touching as opposed to an aggressive use of force that

24   would risk physical injury.

25                 MS. KRUGER:       That's correct.          There have


                                        28

                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   been a handful of cases, that are cited in Petitioner's

 2   brief, in the -- in which the Florida statute has been

 3   used to criminalize rude touchings.                   We think that those

 4   rude touchings, as a matter of general usage in the

 5   common law and in the general definition of battery, do

 6   in fact have as an element the use of physical force.

 7   That is a usage that has been in force in the majority

 8   of States for quite some time.            And we think that it

 9   does no particular violence, if you will pardon the

10   expression, to the statute to interpret it to encompass

11   the full range of common law batteries, batteries as

12   they are prosecuted --

13              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            How about pick pocketing,

14   would pick pocketing be a violent crime if it involves a

15   touching necessarily?

16              MS. KRUGER:       Pick pocketing actually doesn't

17   involve a touching necessarily.             Normally if you --

18              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I guess a very good pick

19   pocket could get -- could get just the wallet and not

20   touch the person, I'm not sure.

21              MS. KRUGER:       Well, pick pocketing, normally

22   as it is criminalized in most states, does not, in fact,

23   require as an element that the prosecution prove that

24   the -- the defendant touched the victim.

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:           No, but you don't prosecute


                                     29

 1   them for pick pocketing.        You have a clumsy pick pocket

 2   and you prosecute him for battery, right?              And he gets

 3   15 years.

 4               MS. KRUGER:        Well, the clumsy pick pocket

 5   would, in fact, be in most jurisdictions a robber.              And

 6   robbery is precisely the kind of offense that we know

 7   that Congress was intending to cover in subsection 1 of

 8   the ACCA.   It was one of the first ACCA predicates, and

 9   it remains, I think, a paradigmatic example of a crime

10   that has as an element the use of force and is,

11   therefore, covered under the plain statutory language.

12   But I think that --

13               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Counsel -- I'm sorry.

14   Please finish and then I will --

15               MS. KRUGER:        But I think that the essential

16   thrust of the argument so far has been that if it's

17   possible to commit battery under the common law under

18   the laws of 27 states, including Florida, under Federal

19   law in the way that individual instances doesn't seem to

20   present a serious risk of injury, then it can't possibly

21   be a violent felony.      And I think that we know from the

22   way the Court has interpreted the statute to date that

23   that is simply not the case.

24               This Court addressed a very similar argument

25   in Taylor --

 1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Counsel, you see that

 2   you don't have the inquiry.           The issue is not whether it

 3   causes serious injury or not, the issue is whether the

 4   nature of the force used is physical force.                And, so, if

 5   you look at the common definition of "physical force" in

 6   the dictionary, which your adversaries did very well in

 7   their brief, physical force has in its ordinary meaning

 8   the use of some strength, of some power, and generally

 9   kissing doesn't require that strength or power, touching

10   someone on the shoulder, doesn't.                All of these

11   activities are prohibited by this statute if they are

12   unwanted.

13               So the question is not whether or not they

14   present the risk of physical injury, the issue is

15   whether in all applications or in a substantial number

16   they don't require the use of strength to -- in its

17   application.   That's a different question.

18               MS. KRUGER:       Justice Sotomayor, I think that

19   you are exactly right, that the inquiry that is set out

20   in subsection 1 is simply, does this crime have as an

21   element the use of physical force?

22               Our submission is that every battery under

23   Florida law, under common law and under the laws of 27

24   states and the Federal Government does have an -- as an

25   element the use of physical force.

 1              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Mainly because -- now we

 2   are getting to Judge Easterbrook's argument about the

 3   dime -- you know if I touch myself, I have now used

 4   force.

 5              MS. KRUGER:          Right.         There is some

 6   suggestion in Judge Easterbrook's opinion that that

 7   usage is somehow peculiar to Newtonian physics.                  The

 8   fact of the matter is, it is actually a very common

 9   usage in the criminal law.            There are a number of

10   judicial opinions, for example, that we instead of using

11   the formulation that we see in Florida's battery

12   statute, instead use the formulation use of force of the

13   slightest degree.

14              JUSTICE BREYER:              All right.       Suppose we

15   interpret the statute, the act of the statute as

16   requiring more force than that, as requiring something

17   more than spitting.      Now, suppose that sometimes, as

18   they have made a strong case, that touching is a

19   separate thing under this statute because that's what

20   the Florida Supreme Court said, and moreover, there are

21   prosecutions that seem not to fit within striking.                    How

22   do we know whether by and large this were a touching as

23   used in Florida, covers things with mostly minimal

24   touching, minimal force or enough force to get within

25   the statute?

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 MS. KRUGER:       Well, Justice Breyer, I think

 2   that's precisely the problem with the Petitioner's

 3   submission.     It creates a kind of required element under

 4   the ACCA that has no clear parallels in the substantive

 5   criminal law.     And it would require Federal sentencing

 6   courts to ask precisely the kinds of questions the law

 7   of battery has historically thought to avoid, just how

 8   much physical force is enough.

 9                 The reason why a statute like Florida has

10   reached the least touching of another in anger is as

11   Blackstone told us, that too is a form of violence.                     It

12   has so been considered for centuries.

13                 And, Justice Ginsburg, to return to your

14   question earlier, Florida itself actually does classify

15   the crime of battery as defined under its statute as a

16   crime of violence for certain purposes.                  The ordinary

17   understanding of the crime of battery --

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Not for recidivism.      Not

19   for recidivism purposes.

20                 MS. KRUGER:       It --

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But are you saying that

22   suppose to Florida split this statute, and some states

23   do, so one crime is a rude touching crime, and the other

24   is the use of physical -- aggressive physical force that

25   endangers the physical safety of another.                  If you have


                                        33
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   both of those statutes, I take it that you would say

 2   either one of them would fit under ACCA as a crime that

 3   has the use of physical force, because you are saying

 4   the rude touching is physical force?                   Even if you split

 5   off the touching from the striking, you would say that

 6   the touching falls under ACCA?

 7               MS. KRUGER:       That's correct, Justice

 8   Ginsburg.   We think that both variants of that offense

 9   in your hypothetical would have as an element the use of

10   physical force.

11               JUSTICE STEVENS:            But only as a felony.

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And what Congress was

13   trying to get at the worse of the worst in ACCA, the

14   Armed Career, whatever -- that they meant to get after

15   people who go around poking other people in a rude

16   manner?

17               MS. KRUGER:       Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

18   think, first of all, it would be a mistake to think that

19   Congress defines the range of ACCA predicate with

20   particular consideration to the ways that hypothetical

21   defendants might -- might commit even quintessentially

22   violent crimes in particular cases.

23               This Court, for example, considered in

24   Taylor v. United States a very similar argument, which

25   was that the statutory reference to burglary ought to be


                                      34
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   interpreted in a way that would limit it to aggravated

 2   burglaries of a certain sort, armed burglaries or

 3   burglaries of occupied buildings, in order to make sure

 4   that that reference to burglary better fit with

 5   Congress's purposes in selecting the worst of the worst.

 6              This Court declined that invitation because

 7   it decided that Congress's unmodified views of the word

 8   "burglary" indicated that Congress meant for that word

 9   to take on its ordinary meaning as it was used in the

10   laws of the many states.       It said that Congress would

11   have recognized that ordinary burglaries can be

12   committed in individual instances in ways that don't

13   seem particularly harmful, by unarmed defenders of

14   unoccupied buildings in remote locations, but that

15   Congress nevertheless made a categorical judgment that

16   burglaries as a whole present sufficient potential for

17   harm that they ought to be covered as ACCA predicates.

18              And I think a similar analysis applies here.

19   Congress probably wasn't focused on the least amount of

20   force that it takes to commit the crime of battery, but

21   it was entitled to make a judgment that any battery, any

22   unlawful use of force against another person,

23   categorically presents sufficient potential for harm

24   that --

25              JUSTICE BREYER:           It might have, but battery


                                     35

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   by touching does seem a separate category.                    And at that

 2   point, you have to decide, is there an element there of

 3   force?   And I think it requires more force than just the

 4   simplest touching.

 5                Now, on Justice Scalia's approach, the fact

 6   that there is one conviction for spitting is sufficient

 7   to take it outside the statute.              That's not my approach.

 8   I would say, in the mind run of cases, does there have

 9   to be more force than just spitting?                    And now I don't

10   know how it's prosecuted.         So why don't I say in this

11   case, from my perspective, very well, I don't know.                       No

12   one knows.   No one has told me.             No one has looked into

13   it.   It's very hard to look into, but not impossible.

14                It's the Government's job, faced with a

15   15-year statute, to do the looking.                    They have the

16   resources.   More than a defense attorney.                   Therefore,

17   uncertain as I am, I must decide this in favor of the

18   defendant.   What's the response to that?

19                MS. KRUGER:      Well, I think the response is,

20   first, we think that the proper approach is one that

21   pays respect to the words that Congress used to define

22   the crime.   In ordinary criminal law, despite what some

23   intuitions seem to be, the least touching of another in

24   anger is a form of violence.            It is a use of physical

25   force.

 1                I think to the extent that, Your Honor, you

 2   are inclined to look to the purposes of this statute,

 3   what Congress would have thought the mind run of cases

 4   that would fall under Subsection 1's use of force

 5   provision would cover, I think there you look at the

 6   reported cases in Florida, we see that the kinds of

 7   crimes that are prosecuted under the touching or

 8   striking prong of that statute are, in fact, quite

 9   harmful.    It's not at all difficult to see why Congress

10   would have been concerned about these types of crimes,

11   both because in many instances they involve conduct that

12   is probably better described as touching or striking but

13   it is -- nevertheless risks substantial harm to the

14   victim, like choking, like beating the victim's head

15   against the car window, to use an example from one of

16   those cases cited in our brief.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:           You know, I guess it comes

18   down to whether we think that in -- in B1, Congress was

19   using technical language or Congress was using simply

20   ordinary language, because you are quite right that the

21   definition of -- of battery covers even the slightest

22   touching.   The use of physical force, which would

23   include the slightest touching.

24                But in using that definition to define the

25   term "violent felony," I find it hard to believe that


                                       37
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Congress was using the term in a technical sense, and

 2   was not using the term "physical force," "the use of

 3   physical force" to mean something more than a mere

 4   touching.

 5               But that's -- that's basically what we are

 6   arguing, isn't it?    Whether that -- whether that phrase

 7   there, "threatened use of physical" -- "use or

 8   threatened use of physical force," is technical language

 9   which is the definition of battery, or rather more

10   common usage.

11               You -- you would acknowledge that, that in

12   more common usage, no one -- no one would think that if

13   you go over to somebody and point your finger at him on

14   his lapel and say, "Now, you listen to me," that that

15   would be considered the use or threatened use of

16   physical force?

17               MS. KRUGER:       I think it probably is not the

18   way that we ordinarily talk in day-to-day conversation,

19   but it certainly is the way that the law has talked

20   about it for centuries, and I think there is a reason

21   that Congress had in mind the technical definition of

22   battery rather than ordinary parlance, if for no other

23   reason because it tracked so closely the general

24   definition, that technical definition of "battery," when

25   it defines "violent felony" in Subsection 1.           And also


                                      38

 1   because now that the --

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:               May I ask -- may I ask

 3   this, following up on Justice Scalia's point?                     Are there

 4   any other crimes other than battery that -- that create

 5   the same situation where in the first time it is

 6   committed it's a misdemeanor, but then it becomes a

 7   felony because it's committed twice?                     So what we have

 8   here is conduct that first time is misdemeanor, second

 9   time is a felony.     Are there any other examples of

10   crimes that fit that category that come within

11   Subparagraph 1?

12              MS. KRUGER:          I am not sure of the answer to

13   that, Justice Stevens.         I do think that one reason why

14   the misdemeanor versus felony distinction is somewhat

15   unimportant to the interpretation of the "use of

16   physical force" language in this case is that if the

17   same language was deployed first in the "crime of

18   violence" definition of 18 U.S.C. 16, which by its

19   terms, applies to both misdemeanors and felonies, and

20   Congress has of course subsequently used that very same

21   language to define a class of misdemeanor crimes of

22   domestic violence in Section 922(g)(9), we think to the

23   extent that this Court is inclined to interpret the

24   extent of the similar language in the similar statutes

25   in a similar manner, the use of physical force language


                                        39

 1   should remain consistent across them.

 2                One of the principal vices of Petitioner's

 3   arguments is also that it would leave the Federal

 4   domestic violence provisions like Section 922(g)(9) with

 5   relatively patchwork and haphazard application, which is

 6   precisely one of the considerations that motivated this

 7   Court's decision just last term in the United States v.

 8   Hayes.    Whether the Court --

 9                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But there are no

10   provisions that would include domestic violence and the

11   gun possession provision.

12                MS. KRUGER:       There are -- the range of

13   predicate offenses that can be used for the Section

14   922(g)(9) domestic gun violence prohibition, ordinarily,

15   as this Court recognized in Hayes, encompasses the

16   general assault and battery statutes of the United

17   States.   Twenty-seven of these states define battery in

18   more or less the way that Florida does, to include a

19   range of uses of physical force from the least degree of

20   physical force to very severe beatings, so under

21   Petitioner's reading, it would be impossible to say for

22   sure in more than half of the country that a domestic

23   violence conviction, even a battery conviction that is

24   specifically denominated as a domestic violence battery

25   conviction in many a state, would qualify under Section


                                       40

 1   922(g)(9).

 2                It seems unlikely that Congress, in enacting

 3   that statute, which was designed to create a nationwide

 4   solution to the nationwide problem of the combination of

 5   guns and domestic strife, would have intended for that

 6   statute to have such a haphazard impact.               And yet that

 7   is precisely what the effect of Petitioner's reading

 8   would be.

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Where is the provision?

10   922(g)(9), is that in your brief somewhere?

11                MS. KRUGER:       It is.        It's in the statutory

12   appendix to the gray brief.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:          I am looking for it.     I

14   don't see it.   922(g)(9).

15                MS. KRUGER:       The --

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:          I hate people talking about

17   statutes that I don't have in front of me.

18                MS. KRUGER:       It's on page 3(a) of the

19   statutory appendix.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:          3(a).

21                MS. KRUGER:       It contains Section

22   921(a)(33)(a), which provides the definition of

23   "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence."

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:          I thought you said 922.

25   That's what I thought you said.

 1               MS. KRUGER:       That's correct.          The

 2   substantive prohibition is in Section 922(g)(9), and the

 3   definitional provision is reprinted on page 3(a).

 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It's really a question for

 5   Petitioner's counsel, and I didn't have time to ask as

 6   your white light goes on.         I take it your position is

 7   that if you do not prevail on your argument, that this

 8   is under Roman -- small Roman 1, that if -- you have to

 9   remand for small Roman 2?

10               MS. KRUGER:       That's correct.

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Is there an argument that

12   you anticipate objecting to that remand?               Or is this

13   absolutely clear-cut that we must remand?

14               MS. KRUGER:       I think it's within the Court's

15   discretion to decide how to dispose properly of the

16   case.   I think that the Section -- the Subsection 2

17   issue was preserved in the courts below.               The district

18   court rested its decision on both Subsections 1 and 2,

19   and the court of appeals addressed only Subsection 1.

20               We think that if the Court decides that the

21   court of appeals is wrong in its interpretation of

22   Subsection 1, then the appropriate thing in order to

23   determine what Petitioner's correct sentencing should be

24   would be to remand to allow the court of appeals to

25   address the alternative argument about Subsection 2.

 1   But the reason why the Subsection 1 inquiry is so --

 2                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             How -- I'm sorry.

 3   Before you go on, your adversary claims you waived by

 4   not raising this as an -- as an alternative in the sorts

 5   stage.     Could you fold that into your continuation of

 6   this answer?

 7                 MS. KRUGER:       Certainly.               I think that rule

 8   15.2 of the rules of this Court requires us in a brief

 9   in opposition to raise any material matters that relate

10   to the question presented.

11                 The question presented in this case concerns

12   just the basis for the court of appeals decision in this

13   case which was subsection (1) of the statute.                     We think

14   it's not at all unusual for this Court to decide that a

15   court of appeals judgment is in error and then remand to

16   allow the court of appeals to address --

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Hear what they said, what

18   the Eleventh Circuit said, it said that if battery under

19   Florida law fits within the description of (1), then it

20   is a violent crime for ACCA purposes.                     And then it says

21   if not, then not.     And as long as the issue was in front

22   of them I would think that those last four words are a

23   holding.

24                 MS. KRUGER:       I think it's difficult to read

25   those four words in that manner, Justice Breyer.

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                JUSTICE BREYER:          Why?

 2                MS. KRUGER:       If for no reason because the

 3   court of appeals didn't so much as acknowledge the

 4   existence --

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:          Was it argued?

 6                MS. KRUGER:       It was argued.          It was -- it

 7   was briefed in the court of appeals, and the court of

 8   appeals --

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:          It is pretty hard to see it

10   given Begay, how this is like arson or, you know, the

11   other three there, burglary, arson --

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Explosives.

13                JUSTICE BREYER:          -- explosives.

14                MS. KRUGER:       Well --

15                JUSTICE BREYER:          So, I mean, I don't know.

16   Maybe the court of appeals felt -- what they said was,

17   "if not, then not."      And it was raised in argument.

18                MS. KRUGER:       Well, I think it's -- again,

19   it's difficult to read that piece of loose language in

20   the Court's opinion as a direct holding, particularly

21   considering that the court of appeals didn't so much as

22   cite the language or even the code provision that

23   relates to the argument.        But I think to the extent that

24   the Court questions whether it would qualify under

25   subsection (2), I think the answer is yes.               Battery


                                      44

 1   is -- qualifies under this Court's interpretations of

 2   that subsection in Chambers and Begay and James.            It is

 3   a crime that is typically purposeful, violent and

 4   aggressive.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:          Yeah, but I -- I thought --

 6   you know, it's -- it's like the other four listed out.

 7                 MS. KRUGER:      Well, it is like them in that

 8   it poses risks that are similar in --

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:          But then we are rereading

10   these three other examples out because then "other"

11   covers any crime that poses a risk of violence, or

12   whatever the words are there -- I forget the words.

13   Poses a risk.

14                 MS. KRUGER:      No, I think it would still be

15   consistent with this Court's analysis of subsection (2)

16   in Begay in that battery by touching, if you consider it

17   to be a separate crime, which again I think is a highly

18   contested --

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:          And you think drunk driving

20   doesn't present a serious potential risk of physical

21   injury?

22                 MS. KRUGER:      No, but what this Court said in

23   Begay was that it doesn't present risks that are similar

24   in degree and kind to the risks that are presented by

25   the enumerated offenses.         And battery, including battery


                                       45

 1   by touching or striking under Florida law, presents

 2   risks that are quite similar in degree and kind to the

 3   enumerated offenses, particularly burglary.                It is --

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Wait, I don't follow

 5   that at all.   I mean, I understand your argument that

 6   physical force means the slightest touching, but I don't

 7   understand the argument that the slightest touching

 8   presents a serious risk of potential physical injury.

 9              MS. KRUGER:        Well, I think -- first of all,

10   to clear up a misconception, simply because the

11   statutory text covers the slightest touching doesn't

12   mean that it covers only the slightest touching.                   It

13   covers a wide range of degrees of physical force

14   beginning with the slightest touching and including --

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Yeah, but your

16   argument is to try -- is asserting that the slightest

17   physical touching is covered by the statute.

18              MS. KRUGER:        Right.         And the question before

19   the Court in this case concerns only that question.                     It

20   concerns the proper interpretation of subsection (1).

21   Whether the crime is one that has as an element the use

22   of physical force.

23              JUSTICE STEVENS:             The district court thought

24   that the two were related.          The district court, if it

25   thought a slightest touching was qualified under (1) it


                                      46
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   was not unreasonable to say that it would also qualify

 2   under (2).    But if that argue ment is rejected under

 3   (1), it seems to me it would follow necessarily that it

 4   would also be rejected under (2).

 5                 MS. KRUGER:      I'm not entirely sure why that

 6   would be true.    But I do think that it's right as a

 7   descriptive matter that most of the crimes that are

 8   encompassed by subsection (1) would also qualify under

 9   subsection (2).

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          But (2) -- (2) looks to the

11   conduct, it doesn't look to the element of the crime.

12   So you could actually look to the conduct of which the

13   person was convicted, no?

14                 MS. KRUGER:      Well, you have to look at the

15   contact that the person was convicted of with respect to

16   the elements of the crime, that is the nature of the

17   category --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          No, no, no.      You look to

19   the crime -- under (1), you look to the crime he was

20   convicted of, and if -- if -- if none of its elements

21   require serious physical force, you can say it doesn't

22   qualify under (1), but under (2) if in fact you see the

23   misdemeanor he was convicted of was really whacking

24   somebody really hard, then -- then it could possibly

25   come within -- come under (2).

 1                MS. KRUGER:        With respect, Justice Scalia, I

 2   think that is incorrect.          This Court has made clear that

 3   subsection (2) like subsection (1) proceeds by looking

 4   at the elements of the offense --

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Just at the elements.

 6                MS. KRUGER:        Just at the elements of the

 7   offense of which the defendant was convicted.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Can I ask you about --

 9   about 922?   You point to the -- the definition there,

10   the definition in 921.         But that is a definition of the

11   term, misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.            And in

12   the context of defining that term, I'm perfectly willing

13   to believe that the use or attempted use of physical

14   force means even the slightest touching, as -- as

15   battery does.     You are talking about a misdemeanor crime

16   of domestic violence.

17                But what we have before us here is a term --

18   a different term that is being defined and that term is

19   violent felony.     And I find it a lot harder to swallow

20   that -- that that definition embraces merely the

21   slightest touching.

22                MS. KRUGER:        Well, Justice Scalia, I would

23   certainly be inclined to agree with you but it's

24   particularly clear given the text and context of the

25   purposes of section 922(g)(9) that battery ought to be


                                        48
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   covered by that definition, misdemeanor crime of

 2   domestic violence.    But we think that the reason why it

 3   is also clear under subsection (1) of the ACCA is that

 4   the use of force element of the definitional provision

 5   is separate from the degree of seriousness with which

 6   the State chooses to treat the crime, yet the crime is

 7   punished as a felony, and if has as an element the use

 8   of physical force, then it qualifies as a violent felony

 9   under the ACCA, just as if it is punished as a

10   misdemeanor, it qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of

11   domestic violence under section 922(g)(9).

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:           I dare say that Congress in

13   my view probably didn't even contemplate that something

14   which is a misdemeanor could become a violent felony if

15   you did it the second time.

16              MS. KRUGER:        Well --

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:           Have we ever approved that,

18   by the way, kicking it up to the felony category simply

19   because of recidivism?

20              MS. KRUGER:        Well, the Court in United

21   States v. Rodriguez in analyzing the coordinate

22   provision of the ACCA that covers serious drug offenses

23   said that the felony aspect of that definition is

24   satisfied by a recidivist enhancement.                And we think

25   that the conclusion in that case, and it is not disputed


                                     49

 1   among the parties, applies with equal force in this case

 2   to the proper interpretation of violent felony.

 3              But it was certainly true by the time that

 4   Congress enacted the ACCA, which the legislative history

 5   indicates Congress understood would cover assault

 6   crimes, for example, that there were certain kinds of

 7   batteries and assaults that, although otherwise may be

 8   punished as simple batteries and assaults, as

 9   misdemeanors, could be elevated to a felony if for

10   example they were committed against a law enforcement

11   officer.

12              It simply was not unheard of for simple

13   battery to be elevated to a felony under certain

14   circumstances in 1986 Congress enacted the present

15   version of ACCA.   At the end of the day, we think that

16   Congress -- every indication that we have in both the

17   text, the context, the purpose of the statute and its

18   background suggests that Congress was in fact

19   deliberately tracking the definition of battery when it

20   enacted the primary definition of violent felony in

21   subsection (1).

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, every

23   indication except for the fact that they didn't use the

24   word battery.

25              MS. KRUGER:         Aside from the fact that they


                                       50
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   didn't use the word battery.            Instead they chose to

 2   incorporate the general definition of the crime of

 3   battery; that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

 4              We think that to the extent that the Court

 5   is inclined to restrict the terms of -- that Congress

 6   chose to use itself to physical force as only exceeding

 7   a certain threshold, to include some batteries and not

 8   other batteries, the Court would be setting up a very

 9   difficult test for Federal sentencing courts to apply in

10   the real world.   Essentially --

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:            States do it all the time

12   when they have different degrees of battery.

13   Misdemeanor -- felony battery -- they do it all the

14   time.

15              MS. KRUGER:        Well, as the Chief Justice has

16   noted, States don't have quite the same compulsion to

17   sort different factual offenses into different boxes.

18   Prosecutors, as the prosecutor did in this case, can use

19   either of the two alternative prongs of Florida's

20   battery definition to punish what is essentially the

21   same offense, which is the crime of battery, that

22   deserves the same punishment regardless of which prong

23   the prosecutor proceeds under, whether the bodily injury

24   prong or the touching or striking prong.

25              And Petitioner's concession that at least


                                      51
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Federal sentencing courts could draw distinctions

 2   between touches and strikes, may have some resonance in

 3   the State of Florida, but has resonance for the rest of

 4   the country.    Most State assault and battery statutes

 5   don't contain explicit references to striking, but

 6   subsume striking within the range of conduct prescribed

 7   by their offensive touching prong.

 8              So it simply wouldn't be possible, in most

 9   cases, for a court to look at the cold record of the

10   underlying State conviction and try to discern exactly

11   how much force was involved in the offense and whether

12   that force satisfied the Petitioner's proposed

13   threshold, whatever it means.

14              At the end of the day, the principal

15   question before the court is one that is, primarily,

16   relevant to the Section 922(g)(9) provision and other

17   federal misdemeanor domestic violence provisions and one

18   that we think, in considering the purposes of those

19   statutes and the very serious dangers that they address,

20   the Court ought to interpret the plain text of the

21   statutes in light of their plain meaning.

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, Counsel.

 2                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I -- I don't want to waste

 3   too much of your time on the remand, but I can't really

 4   fault the government for waiving a right to raise a

 5   claim under Clause 2, which is your second reason for

 6   not -- not remanding, and it -- it does seem, to, me

 7   that the Eleventh Circuit -- one permissible reading was

 8   that they were just looking at 1, so that we would have

 9   to remand.

10                MS. CALL:     Justice Kennedy, I would have to

11   disagree with that because it was fully briefed, fully

12   argued --

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I understand that.

14                MS. CALL:     And I take the -- the provision

15   that when they indicated that the test was exclusively

16   under the first prong.

17                Second, Your Honor, I believe it would

18   simply be a waste of judicial resources if the Court

19   finds that this battery by touching doesn't have, as an

20   element, the use of force, the test would be to remand

21   it to decide whether it meets the Begay standard, which

22   is purposeful, violent, aggressive, and all of those

23   tests.

24                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.      Except in this area,

25   I am a little reluctant when it hasn't been argued


                                      53

 1   before as to make a definitive holding, but I will look

 2   at the Eleventh Circuit opinion again.

 3              MS. CALL:      Yes, Your Honor, and the other

 4   note I would make is, factually, at page 40 of the joint

 5   appendix, they indicated there were no other Shepard

 6   documents to offer to the Court, so the entire record is

 7   available for reconsideration and is available to this

 8   Court.

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Thank you.

10              MS. CALL:      And, Your Honor, I wanted to note

11   this is not just an academic exercise on noticing what

12   physical force means.     Absent this one finding of

13   Mr. Johnson's prior conviction was a violent felony, it

14   raised his guideline range, from 27 to 33 months, to a

15   mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years.

16              So the danger of including this crime, when

17   the art or criminal act was not designed to include all

18   crimes or all offenders, means that it took all

19   discretion away from the sentencing judge.

20              In ACCA, Congress set a superior high

21   standard requiring three priors on three -- that

22   occurred on three separate occasions, and so looking at

23   this decision, when Mr. Johnson was put inside the box,

24   that tied the judge's hands.

25              If this were not considered a violent


                                     54
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   felony, the sentencing judge could consider that under

 2   the guidelines in the 3553 factors.                   But to read

 3   physical force so broadly is to, in essence, collapse

 4   the distinction between those violent offenses that are

 5   meant to be included in the Armed Career Criminal Act

 6   and those that are not.

 7              Your Honors, I would also note one matter,

 8   that physical contact is used in the assault statutes

 9   under the Federal Code, so there is a different

10   provision -- a different meaning to physical contact

11   than to physical force, and the physical force, in this

12   definition, is looking at what level and what sort of

13   force Congress intended to require to impose this very

14   high sentencing standard.

15              And this Court had rejected, in Shepard, the

16   government's same happenstance argument that

17   prosecutions would depend on recordkeeping and charging

18   decisions, and so, for all the reasons argued,

19   Mr. Johnson would ask that this Court vacate the lower

20   decision and remand for resentencing.

21              Thank you.

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, Counsel.
