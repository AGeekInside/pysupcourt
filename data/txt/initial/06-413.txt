 3            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               We'll hear argument next

 4   in 06-413, Uttecht versus Brown.

 5            Mr. Samson.

 6                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L. SAMSON,

 7                      ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 8                 MR. SAMSON:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court.

10                 The Ninth Circuit's conclusion that

11   Mr. Brown is entitled to habeas corpus relief should be

12   reversed for three reasons.                 First, under Section

13   2254(3)(16) of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death

14   Penalty Act the trial judge's dismissal of Mr. Deal from

15   the jury is a finding of fact of substantial impairment

16   that is presumed correct unless it is rebutted by clear

17   and convincing evidence.             Mr. Brown has not presented

18   such evidence because the record before the State court

19   supports the decision to remove Mr. Deal, especially

20   since the trial judge had the opportunity to observe

21   Mr. Deal and the defense had no objection to his

22   removal.

23                 Second, under 2254(d)(2) the State court

24   decision was based on a reasonable determination of the

25   facts.     Since the finding of fact was correct it is


                                            3

 1   necessarily reasonable.

 2              And third, under 2254(d)(2), the State court

 3   decision was not contrary to Supreme Court precedent.

 4   Since the trial court applied the correct standard under

 5   Witt and found as fact that Mr. Deal was substantially

 6   impaired and this case is immaterially indistinguishable

 7   from Witt, the State court's decision was a reasonable

 8   application of clearly established Federal law.

 9              Mr. Deal did indicate in the voir dire that

10   he could impose the death penalty and consider it, but

11   his other statements created an ambiguity which the

12   trial judge was in the best position to resolve.

13              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Counsel, may I ask you one

14   thing, which I have assumed, and I think it is correct,

15   but I'd like to be sure of it.             Is it the case, is it

16   correct, that prior to the voir dire questions, no one

17   had given a statement to the venire people of what the

18   law was with respect to the imposition of the death

19   penalty; is that correct?

20              MR. SAMSON:        Not exactly, Your Honor.          Prior

21   to the individual voir dire, they were -- there was

22   instructions given to the jurors.               Prior to the filling

23   out of the questionnaire.

24              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Were they told what the --

25   I forget how many factors are enumerated under the


                                       4

 1   Washington law?    Were they told what they were?

 2                 MR. SAMSON:        No, Your Honor, it was more a

 3   general instruction regarding how the system operates.

 4                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             Okay.

 5                 MR. SAMSON:        In the individual voir dire of

 6   Mr. Deal --

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But one piece of

 8   evidence that -- one piece of information that wasn't

 9   given apparently to those jurors, they didn't know about

10   it, was that life meant life without parole.                   Because

11   when he was questioned, he was surprised, he didn't know

12   that that was the law.

13                 MR. SAMSON:        Your Honor, he learned an hour

14   before his questioning that that was the law.                   He was

15   not informed of that -- of tht law when he filled out

16   his questionnaire.      But approximately an hour before the

17   individual questioning, he was informed of that, and he

18   indicated that in his questioning that he had just

19   learned an hour ago.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And how did he learn

21   that?

22                 MR. SAMSON:        He learned that from the

23   instructions given by the trial judge as well as through

24   the statements by defense counsel and by the prosecutor.

25                 And the defense counsel reminded Mr. Deal of


                                          5

 1   the fact that there was life without parole.                      She asked

 2   him if he can consider both options, death and life

 3   without parole.     He said he could.                And then defense

 4   counsel asked why do you think the death penalty is

 5   appropriate?     And he stated again, as he stated in his

 6   questionnaire, it would be a case where the person was

 7   incorrigible and would reviolate if rereleased.

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             He gave that as an

 9   example.     He didn't say and that's the only circumstance

10   in which I be willing to vote for the death penalty.

11                 MR. SAMSON:        That is correct, Your Honor,

12   but the prosecutor in viewing Mr. Deal's responses

13   through the course of the voir dire, the prosecutor

14   viewed Mr. Deal as saying the only time, or I would have

15   great difficulty in imposing the death penalty, unless

16   the person would be released and would be in a position

17   to -- to reoffend or kill again.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Did he say, "for example,"

19   with regard to the quotation that Justice Ginsburg

20   mentioned?     I didn't recall that he said for example.

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             He was asked to give an

22   example.     He didn't say for example.                   But he didn't say

23   this would be the only situation in which I would vote

24   for the death penalty.

25                 MR. SAMSON:        That is, that is correct.              Both


                                          6

 1   -- both are correct, Your Honors.               At Joint Appendix 62,

 2   he was asked for an example of why he believed the death

 3   penalty was appropriate, and he says, "I think if a

 4   person is or would be incorrigible and would reviolate

 5   if released, then it would be appropriate."

 6              And, in fact, the only two examples he ever

 7   gave of when he believed it would be appropriate is when

 8   a defendant wants to die or a defendant would be

 9   released on parole and could kill again.                   And the

10   prosecutor specifically asked Mr. Deal, can you think of

11   an example, or a situation of when you would be able to

12   impose a death penalty now knowing there is life without

13   parole, and Mr. Deal at Joint Appendix 71 to 72 said I

14   would have to give that some thought.                   Like I said up

15   until an hour ago I did not realize that life without

16   parole was --

17              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Would you agree that if we

18   grant your position and grant you relief, that it would

19   be something of an extension over Witt and Darden, in

20   that the jurors in Witt and Darden had fixed views, that

21   they were as a matter of conscience opposed to the

22   penalty?

23              MR. SAMSON:        Your Honor, I would agree that

24   the statements given by the jurors in Witt and Darden

25   were not exactly what Mr. Deal said.                   But I think the


                                       7

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   general rule that the deference given to the trial judge

 2   would be the same rule.        And we are only asking this

 3   court to apply the rule.

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I understand that.       But I

 5   do think that the views of this juror, Deal, were

 6   somewhat more equivocal than in the cases I've

 7   mentioned.

 8                MR. SAMSON:       They were, Your Honor.           There

 9   was not a statement as in Witt and Darden where the

10   jurors said that they had an opposition to the death

11   penalty and would have difficulty applying it.                 That is

12   correct.   The statements were -- were different.

13                And certainly if the judge viewing a juror

14   of this type determined that the juror was not impaired,

15   then that decision would also be entitled to deference.

16   In fact, an example occurred in this case, Juror Obeso,

17   the judge -- there was a challenge by the prosecutor.

18   There was actually an objection by the defense.                 And the

19   judge said Mr. Obeso says that he can follow the law and

20   impose the death penalty and I think he can.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                One thing I couldn't

22   clearly discern from your brief is the significance you

23   attached to the defendant's, defense failure to object.

24   How does that enter into our analysis?

25                MR. SAMSON:       Your Honor, there's two points


                                        8

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   made from the failure to object.                 The first is it

 2   explains why there's no evidence, expressed evidence

 3   regarding demeanor or credibility or even an express

 4   statement regarding demeanor or credibility or even an

 5   express statement as to substantial impairment.

 6                The second is that as the Court stated in

 7   Witt, it is a significant factor the court may consider

 8   in its evidence that show the judge acted appropriately.

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:              It seems to me on that

10   point that the State is somewhat surprised and

11   whipsawed.   And I understand that the Washington court

12   reached the issue.      It is not independent State ground.

13   I take it the prosecutor had some peremptories left?

14                MR. SAMSON:         Yes, Your Honor.         The

15   prosecutor had two.

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:              How late in the process

17   was -- was Deal considered?               Was he one of the early

18   jurors or one of the late jurors?

19                MR. SAMSON:         He was one of the -- the early

20   jurors.   He was on November 3, which was about five to

21   six days into the individual voir dire on the death

22   qualification.

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:              This was about a 17 day

24   voir dire?

25                MR. SAMSON:         That is correct, Your Honor.

 1   And --

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, that cuts a little

 3   bit against the peremptory.             I mean, if it was early in

 4   the game the prosecutor might not have exercised the

 5   peremptory.

 6                 MR. SAMSON:       Well the peremptories were not

 7   exercised until the death qualification and the other

 8   for-cause checks are were done.

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Oh, I see.        So the whole

10   jury is -- I see.

11                 MR. SAMSON:       Yes, Your Honor.            So they, they

12   completed all the death qualification.                   And then those

13   jurors that that remained they had further individual

14   voir dire, and the defense and the prosecutor then used

15   their peremptories interchangeably to remove jurors.

16                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I go back to the

17   Chief's question about the failure to object?                   I think I

18   got the impression from Judge Kozinski's opinion that he

19   thought that the Washington Supreme Court found that

20   with respect to two out of the three jurors at issue

21   that there had been a finding that they were

22   substantially impaired, but with respect to this juror,

23   that the Washington Supreme Court seemed to rely on the

24   failure to object as the principal explanation for their

25   decision.

 1               MR. SAMSON:        I would -- I would disagree

 2   with that, Your Honor.

 3               The -- the State Supreme Court on page 171a

 4   of the Petitioner's appendix specifically was citing to

 5   Witt and the rules from Witt.             And that includes the

 6   rule that the trial judge's exclusion of a juror

 7   constitutes a finding of fact.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I thought

 9   Justice Stevens's articulation of Judge Kozinski's

10   opinion was exactly right but I thought you would in

11   response cite us to page 208a where the Washington

12   Supreme Court said that those jurors' views, including

13   Mr. Deal, would have prevented or substantially impaired

14   their ability to follow the court's instructions and

15   abide by their oaths as jurors.

16               It seems the court of appeals judge

17   overlooked that.

18               MR. SAMSON:        They did, Your Honor.            They

19   did.   And that is a specific finding of fact by the

20   State Supreme Court.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Is it a finding?       It's

22   listed under "Summary and conclusions."                 Under

23   "Findings," I thought under "Findings" the -- the

24   findings were that he misunderstood the standard.                  He

25   said beyond a shadow of a doubt, rather than beyond a


                                       11
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   reasonable doubt.    And what other finding of fact was

 2   there?   Because this one is listed under conclusions.

 3   "From the facts, I conclude that he would be impaired."

 4   But the impairment is the conclusion from what facts?

 5               MR. SAMSON:         It is from all the facts that

 6   the State Supreme Court had before it.                   It's

 7   one-paragraph analysis of Mr. Deal did not lay out all

 8   the facts that were before the court.                    And the statement

 9   208-A, although it's listed as a conclusion, essentially

10   constitute a finding of fact.              And even if this Court

11   were to say that is not a finding of fact, it contains

12   with it the implicit finding of fact.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, aren't we obliged

14   under AEDPA to give deference to any reasonable

15   conclusion from the facts?

16               MR. SAMSON:         Yes, Your Honor.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:             So even if it is just a

18   conclusion, AEDPA still applies to it unless it's a

19   totally unreasonable conclusion, right?

20               MR. SAMSON:         That's exactly right, Your

21   Honor.

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But the point stands that

23   the court of appeals was just incorrect in, in, in not

24   noting what's there too late.              It's just not a fair

25   summary of what the Washington Supreme Court did.

 1               MR. SAMSON:        Yes, Your Honor.           The Ninth

 2   Circuit found that the State courts made no Finding of

 3   fact and, as Mr. Brown has essentially admitted in his

 4   response brief, there are two State court findings of

 5   fact, one by the Washington Supreme Court and one by the

 6   trial judge.

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Is this something

 8   particular under Washington procedure, this summary and

 9   conclusions section at the end of the opinion?

10               MR. SAMSON:        No, Your Honor.           I think this

11   is more just the style of the justice who wrote the

12   opinion and how he writes his opinions.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 All right.

14               JUSTICE SOUTER:            I take it your position is

15   that if the State courts had made or had expressed no

16   conclusion other than the final conclusion that he is

17   impaired, that that conclusion itself would be entitled

18   to AEDPA deference if the record could be read to

19   support it; is that correct?

20               MR. SAMSON:        Yes, Your Honor.           Yes, Your

21   Honor.   The AEDPA --

22               JUSTICE SOUTER:            If that's the case, then

23   AEDPA deference is more than deference, isn't it?                 AEDPA

24   deference has reached on your view the conclusion that

25   if there is any factual support in a record, the


                                       13

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   ultimate conclusion of the court will be upheld, whereas

 2   I thought AEDPA deference went to factfinding and to

 3   express conclusions that the court drew.

 4              MR. SAMSON:         Your Honor, we're not saying

 5   that there will never be a case where the deference

 6   given to a trial judge and the deference given to a

 7   State court in factual determinations can be overcome.

 8   Certainly, it's hard to think of one, but there can be a

 9   case where that deference could be overcome.

10              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Isn't this perhaps just

11   such a case?   Because this finding by the Supreme Court

12   of the State is based only on the written record, so it

13   does not get any benefit of observing the demeanor of

14   the witness -- I mean, the demeanor of the prospective

15   juror; isn't that correct.

16              MR. SAMSON:         It is correct the State Supreme

17   Court --

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:             So if we disagreed and

19   thought there was not evidence in the written record

20   that would support that conclusion, we should not give

21   deference to that appellate court finding.

22              MR. SAMSON:         Your Honor, but the appellate

23   court finding also was based on the trial court finding

24   of fact, and the State Supreme Court recognized, as this

25   Court did in Witt, that deference must be given to the


                                       14

 1   trial judge, who did have the opportunity to observe the

 2   juror.

 3               JUSTICE SOUTER:             But the trial judge made no

 4   conclusion about demeanor.           He didn't say anything about

 5   demeanor, did he?

 6               MR. SAMSON:         No, Your Honor, and neither did

 7   the --

 8               JUSTICE SOUTER:             If we're going to get --

 9   that takes -- it seems to me it takes deference yet one

10   further step.   We're saying that even if there is

11   nothing on the record about demeanor, we are supposed to

12   assume that a trial judge drew a conclusion based on

13   demeanor.   I mean, that is not deference.               I mean,

14   that's simply imputing fiction.

15               MR. SAMSON:         Your Honor, there's no evidence

16   on demeanor because the defense counsel did not object.

17               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Why is it the defense

18   counsel's obligation to object?               It seems to me that if

19   the State is objecting, saying I want this juror

20   removed, and the trial judge is saying, okay, I will

21   remove him, that there is an obligation to make a

22   record.

23               MR. SAMSON:         Your Honor --

24               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Wouldn't there be?     I guess

25   my point is if there isn't, then in effect you are


                                        15

 1   making the defendant responsible for creating a record

 2   to support what the other side asks for.

 3              MR. SAMSON:        Your Honor, as this Court

 4   explained in Witt, when there is no objection or no

 5   dispute as to the factual issue in the trial court, the

 6   judge has to reason to elaborate on his finding and

 7   therefore he has no obligation to do so.

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But that means that the,

 9   that the argument for sustaining the trial judge's

10   action on the ground that the trial judge could observe

11   demeanor in effect is the elimination of judicial review

12   on that subject, because we know that if the venire

13   person was present in the courtroom and the judge was

14   present in the courtroom, the judge probably looked at

15   him, and if that is enough to sustain judicial action on

16   the grounds that we defer to demeanor then there's no

17   judicial review at all.       I think that's what Judge

18   Kozinski said.

19              MR. SAMSON:        Your Honor, if there is

20   absolutely no evidence to support the trial judge's

21   conclusion in the record --

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:            I'm talking about demeanor.

23   I'm talking about demeanor.           And there's nothing as I

24   understand it on the record about demeanor.

25              MR. SAMSON:        Yes, Your Honor.         In Marshall


                                      16

 1   versus Lonberger the Court said there is no requirement

 2   for explicit finding as to credibility.

 3               JUSTICE SOUTER:             And if there is no

 4   requirement that there be anything on the record about

 5   demeanor, then there is no judicial review on that point

 6   at all, is there?

 7               MR. SAMSON:         Not on demeanor, but there can

 8   be judicial review on the other facts that are presented

 9   in the record.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Of course there is on

11   demeanor.   I mean, I suppose, to begin with, is it not

12   the case that the burden is on the habeas applicant to

13   show that demeanor did not make the difference?               It's

14   the burden on him to show that it was an unreasonable

15   determination.

16               MR. SAMSON:         It is the burden on him to

17   present clear and convincing evidence.

18               JUSTICE SOUTER:             And the question --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:             And secondly, he could

20   present such evidence if he showed that there was

21   absolutely no ambiguity in what the person's statements

22   said, so that demeanor could not have made a difference.

23   But in a case where the statements are seemingly

24   contradictory or arguably contradictory, demeanor is

25   very relevant and it's the burden, it seems to me, of


                                        17
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the Petitioner to show that demeanor wasn't what made

 2   the difference.

 3               And besides which, wasn't there some part of

 4   the record that you referred to where he said "and I

 5   believe him"?

 6               MR. SAMSON:         Yes, Your Honor.          That's as to

 7   a different juror when there was an objection, and

 8   because there was no objection there was no obligation.

 9               If I may --

10               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Is there any way that he

11   can show that demeanor didn't make a difference when the

12   record is absolutely silent on demeanor?                 Is there any

13   way he can show that?

14               MR. SAMSON:         Your Honor, he could attempt to

15   bring evidence in a State court collateral -- he

16   actually filed a motion for reconsideration as to

17   another juror.    He did not do that in this case.

18               JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I ask to be sure I

19   understand the record, because I did miss something

20   before.   Did the trial judge say in so many words that

21   Deal's views would have prevented or substantially

22   impaired his ability to follow the court's instructions

23   and abide by the rules of the jurors?

24               MR. SAMSON:         The trial judge made no such

25   express finding because there was no objection raised.

 1              And if I may reserve --

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:              So that's the point of the

 3   absence of objection.       That's why he didn't make the

 4   critical finding.

 5              MR. SAMSON:          Yes, Your Honor.

 6              JUSTICE STEVENS:              Because the judge didn't

 7   make the critical finding.

 8              MR. SAMSON:          He would have made a finding if

 1   meticulously careful in applying the standard from

 2   Wainwright versus Witt.        In the joint appendix, I

 3   believe at pages 7 through 9, there's an extensive

 4   discussion of how the judge is going to apply the Witt

 5   standard evenhandedly.       He's going to eliminate those

 6   jurors who are like-biased.           He's going to eliminate

 7   those jurors who --

 8              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Does that respond to the

 9   possible suggestion that Judge Kozinski made that what

10   he really did was act on the basis of no objection,

11   rather than on the basis of a finding that he failed to

12   make?

13              MR. DREEBEN:         I don't think so,

14   Justice Stevens, because it's very clear that he told

15   the parties, if you have any question, if you have any

16   problem with any of the objections that are made, speak

17   up and I will intervene and question the juror myself

18   and clarify it.

19              And this is a judge who, against the

20   background of the entire voir dire, clearly was making a

21   good faith effort to apply the Witt standard.          There

22   were 12 objections by the prosecution to various jurors

23   that they should be excused for cause because of

24   inability to apply the law as Washington gives it.             The

25   defense objected, I believe, to seven of those; and the


                                      20
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   prosecution lost on five of those occasions.

 2               So the judge basically went with the defense

 3   when the defense spoke up and objected.                     There were two

 4   jurors that were excused over the defense objection.

 5   The transcript is also in the voir dire on those and it

 6   shows that the defense objected and said these jurors

 7   can apply the standard under the law, and the judge

 8   found that they could not and excused them.

 9               In the case of Juror Deal there is no

10   absolutely reason to believe that the judge wouldn't

11   have done exactly the same thing if the defense had

12   objected.

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, what is -- I know,

14   Justice Breyer; just on this point.                     The defense

15   actually volunteered "no objection."

16               MR. DREEBEN:         Said "We have no objection."

17   And I think that this is one of the three significant

18   legal errors that the Ninth Circuit made in disposing of

19   this challenge.   This Court made clear in Wainwright

20   versus Witt that the absence of a defense objection is

21   very critical in assessing whether a judge's implied

22   finding of bias is to be upheld on appeal.                     And it's for

23   the reason that my colleague mentioned in part:                       If the

24   judge is not asked to give a fuller explanation, there

25   is no reason --

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:             What has this to do with

 2   the -- aside from the explanation, when I read through

 3   the transcript, as I have, it seemed to me in the

 4   transcript he didn't say a word that suggested he's

 5   against giving the death penalty.                   He kept saying yeah,

 6   in special circumstances, not always.                      Then they get

 7   into this thing where he's been thinking of a person who

 8   will in fact commit a crime again.                    And then it's put to

 9   him directly:      Have you thought about that he won't be

10   committing a crime again if he's in jail the rest of his

11   life.   He says:    You're right; I hadn't really thought

12   it through.

13                 I want to know, thinking it through, could

14   you consider the death penalty?                 Do you think under the

15   conditions where the man would never get out again you

16   could impose it?     Yes, sir.

17                 So you don't think that if parole was an

18   option, etcetera, repeating it.                 Death penalty?      I could

19   consider it.    Then could you impose it?                   I could if I

20   was convinced that was the appropriate measure.

21                 And it's absolutely clear he's not thinking

22   of the repetition.       It is clear he is thinking that it's

23   some kind of a mean.         And I compare that with Witt,

24   where the person just says no, I can't, and I compared

25   it with this other case, Gray, and they say it's illegal

 1   to push him off a jury, a woman who is confused, and

 2   finally she says:    I think I could.

 3                MR. DREEBEN:         Justice Breyer, I think your

 4   question goes to the heart of the case.

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, that's probably

 6   right.

 7                MR. DREEBEN:         But the reason it goes to the

 8   heart of the case, Justice Breyer, is that you and I and

 9   every other appellate lawyer and judge who have looked

10   at this is dealing with a cold record, but the only

11   person who actually saw and heard this juror give the

12   responses was the trial judge.

13                JUSTICE BREYER:            So what is it that he could

14   have done?   Was he shaking, making faces?               Was he

15   shaking his head to indicate he believed the opposite?

16                MR. DREEBEN:         Well, Justice Breyer --

17                JUSTICE BREYER:            If something like that

18   happened, isn't a prosecutor of any sense going to say,

19   I want it noted for the record that the witness while he

20   said these words was chortling inwardly or something

21   like that?

22                MR. DREEBEN:         Well, Justice Breyer, there

23   were five separate occasions during Juror Deal's voir

24   dire in which he expressed either uncertainty or a

25   misconception about what the death penalty should be


                                        23

 1   exposed for when measured against Washington law.

 2              And the overarching point that I make before

 3   I talk about those five instances is that this is a

 4   record in which there is confusion and uncertainty about

 5   whether Juror Deal really can adhere to the law.             And in

 6   those circumstances, the only judge who can truly

 7   resolve that and determine whether he should be credited

 8   is the trial judge.     And this Court has made that point

 9   over and over again in describing its voir dire.

10              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             If there is confusion, is

11   that grounds for excluding him?

12              MR. DREEBEN:          Confusion alone is not.      If

13   it's confusion it must rise to a level of preventing or

14   impairing the juror's ability to follow the law.

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But even at this point,

16   this juror, he doesn't know anything about aggravating

17   circumstances.   He doesn't know about mitigating

18   circumstances.   He hasn't been told what the standards

19   of -- that it was beyond a reasonable doubt.

20              And to say that he should be criticized

21   because when he was asked to give an example he said one

22   thing and not another, it seems if you just read the

23   transcript, that there's nothing disqualifying.             So as

24   you said, everything is the weight falls on the

25   demeanor, which an appellate court can't review.

 1              MR. DREEBEN:           I think that that's right,

 2   Justice Ginsburg.    It doesn't mean that there is no

 3   judicial review at all, in response to Justice Souter's

 4   question and I think the concern underlying your own.

 5   There has to be fair support in the record for the

 6   conclusion that the trial judge could have resolved the

 7   question of a juror's competence to sit in the way that

 8   he did.

 9              And if you had a record in which everything

10   that juror said was consistent with complying with State

11   law, which I don't think this record is, and the

12   prosecutor objected, and the judge says granted, and

13   there's no explanation, I think that would be difficult

14   to uphold, even if it is possible that everyone in the

15   courtroom knew that the judge was relying on demeanor.

16              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Is there anything in this

17   record to indicate that the judge did rely on demeanor?

18              MR. DREEBEN:           What is -- no.         There's

19   nothing explicit.    But this Court has said over and over

20   again that there does not have to be because in this

21   case, in particular, since there was no objection, the

22   judge did not elaborate on his reasons at all.                 But the

23   Court has gone further in Witt and in Darden and

24   building on cases like Patton versus Yount, and made

25   clear that it is implicit in a judge's action in


                                        25
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   response to an objection that he has relied on the

 2   totality of the law and his observations.

 3              And here there were two instances during the

 4   defense colloquy in which the juror specifically said

 5   that his example of when the death penalty is

 6   appropriate is a circumstance when somebody is

 7   incorrigible and will reoffend if released.             And then

 8   three times during the prosecution's voir dire, he

 9   volunteered, first of all, that it would have to be in

10   my mind very obvious that the person would reoffend.

11   And this was a particularly significant answer because

12   it wasn't given in response to a death penalty question,

13   it was given in response to whether he could apply the

14   reasonable doubt standard to the crime.

15              He again comes back to the reoffend notion

16   after having State law explained to him again, and said,

17   could you consider imposing the death penalty, he said I

18   have to give that some thought.

19              JUSTICE SOUTER:             But he had not been given,

20   as I understand it, the explanation of what the -- I

21   keep saying nine factors.          Whatever the enumerated State

22   factors were.   He had not been told that at any point,

23   had he?

24              MR. DREEBEN:          No, but I think the important

25   point, Justice Souter, is that under Washington law


                                       26
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   there were really two alternatives, life without parole

 2   or death.

 3               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yeah, but the -- the

 4   questioning was what grounds are you going to look to

 5   make that decision; and he had not been instructed on

 6   Washington law on that at all.

 7               MR. DREEBEN:         The concern that I think the

 8   prosecutor had and that the judge accepted is that this

 9   juror's vision of when capital punishment is appropriate

10   is when somebody will get out and kill again.             And under

11   that analysis, you would never impose capital punishment

12   under Washington law, because the defendant is never

13   going to get --

14               JUSTICE STEVENS:            But doesn't it follow that

15   his limited cases, the views about when the death

16   penalty is appropriate would translate into views of

17   whether he could or could not impose the death penalty

18   if instructed properly by the court?

19               MR. DREEBEN:         Not -- not automatically,

20   Justice Stevens.   I mean, this is an juror --

21               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Doesn't it have to be

22   automatic in order to justify the result in this case?

23               MR. DREEBEN:         No.      What has to be the case,

24   and this Court in Witt made clear it is not going to

25   apply an unmistakable certainty requirement, is that the


                                       27

 1   judge has to conclude that juror's views would prevent

 2   or substantially impair juror in applying the law.              And

 3   the judge had to make a call based on what he saw and

 4   what none of us did, of whether this juror's views --

 5               JUSTICE STEVENS:           Isn't there a world of

 6   difference, at least it has been my experience in trials

 7   like this of what a juror will do on his own and what he

 8   thinks the law might be, and what is fair, and so forth,

 9   as opposed to what a, the juror will do in response to

10   proper instructions?

11               MR. DREEBEN:        Yeah.

12               JUSTICE STEVENS:           The jurors mostly are

13   pretty conscientious.

14               MR. DREEBEN:        Yes, they there are.     And --

15               JUSTICE STEVENS:           Is there any reason to

16   believe this guy wasn't?

17               MR. DREEBEN:        Well the judge found one.       By

18   excusing him after having --

19               JUSTICE STEVENS:           Well -- without -- because

20   there was no objection.

21               MR. DREEBEN:        Well he made clear, if I may

22   conclude, he made clear at the outset as I think I did

23   when I started my presentation, that this record shows a

24   judge who was conscientiously applying the Witt

25   standard.

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

 2   Mr. Dreeben.

 3                 Ms. Elliott.

 4          ORAL ARGUMENT OF MS. SUZANNE LEE ELLIOTT,

 5                     ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

 6                 MS. ELLIOTT:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 7   please the Court.

 8                 There were in our view two findings by the

 9   Washington courts here.         The first by the trial court is

10   objectively, an objectively unreasonable determination

11   of the facts in light of the evidence presented, and

12   thus the writ should be granted under 50 -- 28 --

13   2254(d)(2)?    And the supreme court's decision -- and

14   I'll get to a moment to where I think their decision is,

15   in the record, which conflicts with the State's view of

16   where that is -- was an unreasonable application of this

17   Court's controlling precedent in Witt versus

18   Witherspoon.

19                 And I would direct the Court to, in terms of

20   the State Supreme Court's finding, to page 173a of the

21   appendix of the Petition for certiorari.                 But I would,

22   of course, first like to start with the actual record in

23   this case.

24                 In this case, the Washington State trial

25   court's decision to excuse juror Deal for cause was be


                                        29

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   objectively unreasonable based upon the record, because

 2   juror Deal said many times on the record, when presented

 3   with the question of whether or not he could impose the

 4   death penalty under the sketchy view he had of

 5   Washington State's statutory capital punishment scheme,

 6   that he could do so.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But that's the

 8   beginning of the questioning, isn't it?                   It is not the

 9   end of it.     It is surely not the law that just, whenever

10   a juror says sure, I'll follow the instructions, that

11   he's automatically -- has to be seated?

12                MS. ELLIOTT:          No, Your Honor.          But it went

13   beyond that.    And at page 73 of the joint appendix, the

14   very question was put to him by the prosecutor.                    "Now

15   that you know that in Washington, if you find the

16   defendant guilty, you're only going to have two choices,

17   the death penalty or life in prison without the

18   possibility of parole, could you still consider under

19   the appropriate evidence imposing the death penalty?"

20   And Mr. Deal said, "I could consider it.                   Yes."

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  After several times

22   saying the only time he would consider it is if the

23   person is going to reoffend.              I mean, if he just gets

24   the right answer once out of six times and it's the last

25   time, is the judge required to ignore the prior

 1   colloquy?

 2               MS. ELLIOTT:          No, Your Honor, but I don't

 3   think he only said it once out of those times.                  Judge

 4   Kozinski identified in his opinion six times, and those

 5   are found on the record of proceedings at page 62, at

 6   page 72, and again at page 73.               And he was repeatedly

 7   asked, and one time he was asked first I'm going to ask

 8   you if you could consider it -- this is on page 72 and

 9   then I'm going to ask you if you could impose it?                  Even

10   if he would never get out.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But look at page --

12   look at page 262.    He says, you know, could -- could

13   you -- when do you think the death penalty is

14   appropriate?   If the person would reviolate if released.

15               MS. ELLIOTT:          But that is one of, under --

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  There are others.

17               MS. ELLIOTT:          -- Washington law it's an

18   appropriate consideration.           And that's the -- and then

19   that was the example he gave, but he didn't say but I'm

20   never going to do it, if he -- if my only choice is

21   death or life in prison.

22               And I think that the State's reading of the

23   voir dire here actually expands both the objection made

24   by the prosecutor and the -- the substance of the

25   colloquy with juror Deal.

 1               JUSTICE ALITO:          What do you make of the fact

 2   that twice just before his final statement he's given

 3   exactly the question whether he could -- whether he

 4   impose the death penalty in any situation other than

 5   when the person might get out and kill again, and he --

 6   his answers are at best equivocal.                 The first time he

 7   says I would have to give that some thought.                 That's on

 8   72.   And then he says I do feel that way if parole is an

 9   option.   Without parole as an option I believe in the

10   death penalty.   Which is totally ambiguous.                What do you

11   make of those answers?

12               MS. ELLIOTT:         I make of those answers as

13   being entirely appropriate under the questions given and

14   also demonstrating that he's clearly not a juror who is

15   substantially impaired or whose views would prevent him

16   from considering the instructions that would be given to

17   him at the end of this case.            If fact include him as a

18   --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What if the -- what

20   if the voir dire -- what if the juror said just what he

21   said on a few occasions, that I would consider it if the

22   person would reviolate?        And that was all.           That would

23   be a basis for excusing him?

24               MS. ELLIOTT:         Under your hypothetical, no.

25   If, however, he said I will never impose the death


                                       32
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   penalty if the only choice is life without and the death

 2   penalty, I think that would be problematic under

 3   Washington law.

 4              But he never said that.                     That's the reading

 5   the State gives his voir dire but it's not there.

 6   Because that would prevent him from making the decision

 7   that Washington requires.

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, you -- you -- you

 9   insist that he come out and say in so many words, I am

10   going to be an unreliable juror.              That's -- that's not

11   the way it happens.     And somebody has to evaluate

12   whether indeed he's shading the truth a little bit and

13   whether, in fact, he will be impaired in his service.

14   And some of these -- some of these answers suggest that.

15   And it, it is not an easy call to simply say well, you

16   know, unless he comes out and admits yes, I'm going to

17   be a lousy juror, nobody is going to say that.

18              MS. ELLIOTT:         Well, Your Honor, I agree that

19   nobody is going to say that, although in other cases, in

20   other records and other cases cited by the State here,

21   in fact, trial judges have made records of those kinds

22   of situations, which are not present here.                   And in fact,

23   for example, I believe it was Gray versus Mississippi,

24   the judge got the feeling that jurors were giving

25   answers that would get them off the panel.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why -- why was there no

 2   objection if this was so clear?                If this fellow had

 3   answered all the questions the way you expect a, a good

 4   juror to answer, why was there no objection when the

 5   State moved to dismiss him?

 6                MS. ELLIOTT:          It is not required under

 7   Washington law.    And, in fact --

 8                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             It may well be objected,

 9   there were 12 instances --

10                MS. ELLIOTT:          That is corrected.

11                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             -- in which the prosecutor

12   wanted to excuse; in seven of those, there was an

13   objection.

14                MS. ELLIOTT:          That's correct.

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             So he certainly knew how

16   to object.   And you absolutely trap the trial judge here

17   by not indicating to him that he should make some

18   further finding.     In fact, the -- the -- the lawyer

19   doesn't just remain silent.              He's standing and says I

20   have no objection.

21                MS. ELLIOTT:          Well the question --

22                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Judge Kozinski thought

23   the reason there was no objection was that this juror

24   came across as being pro-death penalty.                   Isn't that what

25   he said?

 1               MS. ELLIOTT:           That's what he said.             I --

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   You don't go as far

 3   as Judge Kozinski?

 4               (Laughter.)

 5               MS. ELLIOTT:           On two points I don't go as

 6   far as Judge Kozinski.         One, I believe that actually

 7   there has to be some deference to implicit findings; let

 8   me clarify that, and I know the State has pointed that

 9   out.   I think Judge Kozinski's language was a little

10   loose there.   I think he probably agrees with me.

11               As to the -- the failure to object, first of

12   all, if the court says, first of all, are there any

13   objections; now again we have admitted that what he said

14   was I have no objection.           But the --             under Washington

15   law, the prosecutor, the judge, and the defense attorney

16   all knew that this issue could be raised for the first

17   time on appeal.

18               The prosecutor -- and I'm not saying on

19   habeas review, but in the trial court, a challenge for

20   cause, the burden falls on the prosecutor to articulate

21   a basis.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, that's fine.          But,

23   but competent counsel knows that getting something

24   overturned on appeal is a lot harder than getting it

25   done right the first time.            And he also knows that if


                                         35

 1   you raise an objection, you're more likely get it done

 2   right.

 3              I can't imagine why if he thought this

 4   person was not properly strikeable he would have sat --

 5   indeed not just sat silent but said I have no objection.

 6   It just doesn't make any sense.

 7              MS. ELLIOTT:         Well I think he made a

 8   mistake, then.

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, he made the same

10   mistake the judge did.      I wonder who else was there that

11   made the same mistake.      I mean, you know, it makes you

12   think maybe, maybe the judge was right.

13              MS. ELLIOTT:         Well, Your Honor, the only

14   basis we have for the trial judge's ruling is the

15   objection made by the prosecutor.               And the -- assuming

16   he incorporated that as the basis for his ruling.                    What

17   prosecutor said was that -- he had two rulings.                    First,

18   he said I think he's overcome his problem with the

19   explanation about reasonable doubt.                    And so that's not

20   an issue in this case.      And he said, and I don't think

21   he has said anything that overcame this idea that, of he

22   must kill again before he imposed the death penalty or

23   be in a position to kill again.

24              That, it's our position is incorrect,

25   under -- an incorrect summation of what happened in the

 1   voir dire and, in fact --

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Where -- where are you

 3   quoting from?

 4               MS. ELLIOTT:         I'm quoting from page 675.

 5   Which is Mr. Matthews --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:            75 of the --

 7               MS. ELLIOTT:         Of the joint appendix.            Which

 8   is Mr.   Matthews' objection.           And the court makes

 9   basically an unadorned grant of objection that for

10   cause.

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And incidentally the court

12   did not say are there any objections?                   The court did not

13   say that.

14               MS. ELLIOTT:         I'm sorry, Your Honor.            The

15   court says -- uh -- the bailiff will excuse you.

16   Counsel, any challenge to this particular juror?                   That's

17   at the bottom of page 64.          And then what Mr. Mulligan

18   says is we have no objection.

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, but the court didn't

20   say is there an objection?          So you're incorrect.

21               MS. ELLIOTT:         I'm sorry.             So --

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Now on the that,

23   just the language you just focused on, on page 75, if

24   that was correct, you disagree with it, but if if the

25   court concluded that the juror had not overcome the idea

 1   that he must kill again before imposing the death

 2   penalty, that would be a sufficient basis for excusing

 3   him?

 4               MS. ELLIOTT:         Under Washington law, I think

 5   there would be a sufficient basis for excusing juror

 6   Deal if he said I now know what the statutory scheme is,

 7   and only if there's some possibility for release of

 8   Mr. Brown and the opportunity for him to kill again,

 9   would I impose the death penalty.

10               We know that would prevent him from imposing

11   Washington's statutory scheme because once finding him

12   guilty, the juror will never be released again.              So the

13   possibility of release would not be there.              And so he

14   would reject the notion that you must consider

15   mitigating factors if there's no possibility of release.

16               We argue in our brief that that's not what

17   he said.   And in fact, Juror Deal was a thinking juror,

18   a juror who could, in fact, consider all of the options.

19   We disagree, of course, with the prosecutor's summary

20   that this concern about recidivism was somehow central

21   or pivotal to Juror Deal.

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You think he could have

23   imposed the death penalty in this case?

24               MS. ELLIOTT:         Yes.

25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What's the harm then in

 1   replacing him, from your standpoint?

 2              MS. ELLIOTT:         The harm?

 3              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You're complaining about

 4   the excusal of a juror who by your own submission would

 5   impose the death penalty.         So why am I here?

 6              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Because you don't know

 7   him.

 8              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I would like to hear the

 9   answer.

10              MS. ELLIOTT:         My answer is because it's a

11   constitutional issue and this juror could also have

12   considered the mitigating circumstances that would have

13   been proposed by the -- at that stage that were clearly

14   on the table for argument in front of the jury at the

15   penalty phase.

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You, according to this

17   structural error, so you have a death case, and so you

18   have this kind of error you don't have to prove.

19              MS. ELLIOTT:         Under Gray versus Mississippi,

20   I don't have to -- Mr. Brown does not have to prove that

21   it's harmless.

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And then you're zeroing

23   in on this particular juror and the colloquy, but

24   shouldn't we look at the entire proceeding of the

25   jurors, including that there were -- what was it --

 1   seven attempts by the prosecutor to have a for cause

 2   excusal?

 3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            There were actually 12, I

 4   think.     Weren't there 12 objections by the prosecution?

 5   I was going to ask, we've already destroyed the rebuttal

 6   time of your colleagues, but it seems to me that this is

 7   a large number of challenges by the prosecutor.                     Can you

 8   comment on that?     12?     I mean, the defense objected to

 9   seven, and five objections were sustained.

10                 MS. ELLIOTT:         I can't say in the vast

11   universe of capital cases in Washington whether that's

12   extraordinary or not.

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Thank you.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            How many days did this

15   take?

16                 MS. ELLIOTT:         17, I believe.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            17 days?         Less than one a

18   day.    That's pretty good.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Yeah.    How many

20   paraded by?    I mean, do we know?

21                 MS. ELLIOTT:         I didn't count on a daily

22   basis, Your Honor.      In a quality case in Washington, 17

23   days is probably pretty average, maybe a little short.

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But it does seem that

25   this trial judge was doing a conscientious job.                     He

 1   granted five of the -- rejected five of the

 2   prosecutor's, and how many of those had been where

 3   defense counsel had objected?

 4                 MS. ELLIOTT:           I think seven.

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:               He objected in seven and

 6   in five of those --

 7                 MS. ELLIOTT:           No.      He objected to 12, and

 8   seven of those were granted, that's my understanding.

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Well, I'm not --

10                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:              No.      I think the

11   prosecution challenged 12 times.                   There were seven

12   objections.    Five were sustained.

13                 MS. ELLIOTT:           Excuse me.             I'm sorry, Your

14   Honor.   I misunderstood your question.

15                 So yeah, I don't disagree that this Court

16   should look at the entire record of voir dire, and I

17   don't disagree that Judge Martinez is a conscientious

18   trial judge.    The problem in this case is that when he

19   granted the challenge for cause to this juror, he did

20   not and he could not find that this juror was

21   substantially impaired.            He could not -- he was not

22   prevented from following Washington law.

23                 The --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   In your view, do we

25   look at this any differently through AEDPA than if we


                                           41
                             Alderson Reporting Company

 1   were looking at this on direct review?

 2                MS. ELLIOTT:        Well, yes.             I mean, you have

 3   to view it through the lens of the statute.

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So that makes a

 5   difference in the standard of review that we apply in

 6   this case?

 7                MS. ELLIOTT:        Well, there is -- prior to the

 8   enactment of AEDPA, there was -- this Court said you

 9   give deference to the trial court's findings.                    AEDPA

10   has, of course, codified that deference by saying that

11   the trial judge has to be objectively unreasonable based

12   upon the facts developed at the trial court level.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So, does that mean

14   we give a greater degree of deference?

15                MS. ELLIOTT:        I don't think this Court has

16   said what, on balance, what the difference between the

17   kind of deference that was required under Witherspoon

18   is, as laid against the kind of deference now.                   It's

19   clear Congress wanted to provide a substantial amount of

20   deference to the trial court and limited habeas review

21   of State court decisions.          But as Judge Kozinski pointed

22   out in his opinion in this case, that didn't mean that

23   they were going to completely eliminate Federal habeas

24   review.

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm just trying to

 1   get a handle on your view as to whether the standard of

 2   review with respect to deference to the State court is

 3   different in this respect than it would be on direct

 4   review?

 5                 MS. ELLIOTT:         Yes.       I think under habeas

 6   review, it's a more substantial review, because we have

 7   to show not only that the findings were unreasonable but

 8   they were objectively unreasonable, which I think is a

 9   different standard than saying you give deference to the

10   trial court.

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask, one of the most

12   troubling parts about this case is the failure to

13   object.     As I understand, under Washington law, that

14   doesn't making any difference, the review is exactly the

15   same as it would have been if there had been an

16   objection.     But under our review as a matter of

17   constitutional law, should it make a difference?

18                 MS. ELLIOTT:         I don't think so.      I think

19   it's one of those peculiarities of Washington law that

20   you should give respect to, but it is essentially

21   meaningless in the context of this case, because all the

22   parties knew this case was going to be reviewed and

23   reviewed.     I mean, there's automatic appellate review.

24                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Do you have any response

25   to Justice Kennedy's concern that this really allows for

 1   a mouse trapping of the trial judge who very likely

 2   would have paid less attention to the issue as long as

 3   any counsel doesn't object, just as a realistic way that

 4   this kind of thing is handled?

 5               MS. ELLIOTT:         Well, I respect his concerns

 6   about bushwhacking or mouse trapping, but the fact of

 7   the matter is that that's Washington law and the judge

 8   was well aware of it, as were the parties.

 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, let me put it to you

10   this way:   There's no demeanor finding here.                 Suppose

11   the judge had made a demeanor finding.                  That would be

12   different, the case would be a different case, wouldn't

13   it?

14               MS. ELLIOTT:         Yes.

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And if the objection is

16   what prevents the demeanor finding, then maybe we should

17   be able to consider the fact there was no objection,

18   even though Washington law doesn't require it before we

19   consider the issue.

20               MS. ELLIOTT:         But there's nothing in the

21   record that says that the reason that the judge didn't

22   mention the demeanor, or the prosecutor who made the

23   objection didn't mention demeanor.                 Certainly, it seems

24   to me that if demeanor had been a concern based upon the

25   answers given by the juror here, and because the

 1   prosecutor had the laboring oar at the trial court to

 2   provide a basis for the challenge for cause, he would

 3   mention it.

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I thought your

 5   brother made the point that there was a more elaborate

 6   explanation of the trial judge's determinations when

 7   there had been an objection.

 8                 MS. ELLIOTT:        I do believe that he had a

 9   more lengthy explanation where there were objections.

10   But whether or not that would have -- there was

11   something in the demeanor of this particular judge here

12   that he simply didn't mention, it can't be found here.

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, but he said for one

14   of the other witnesses, I just don't -- I don't believe

15   him.   And if that had been his problem here, he

16   presumably would have said the same thing.

17                 MS. ELLIOTT:        Well, presumably then, he

18   would have said that in response to the prosecutor's

19   objections, which was not that we don't believe that

20   Juror Deal could be credible.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Not if there's no opposing

22   objection by defense counsel.              When there was, and when

23   part of his reason for granting the motion to strike the

24   juror was demeanor, he mentioned demeanor.

25                 MS. ELLIOTT:        That's correct, and here he


                                        45

 1   didn't.    So I think the assumption was, he was granting

 2   the objection on the basis provided by Mr. Matthews,

 3   which was incorrect both under Washington law and under

 4   the facts developed in the voir dire.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:            The law on this, and you've

 6   read the cases more recent probably -- I've skimmed

 7   through some but not read them all, as I'm sure you

 8   have.     And the statement of the law that I want to know,

 9   is it still valid law, is in Witherspoon on 522, Justice

10   Stewart in the footnote.           And what he says in that

11   footnote is, "the most that can be demanded of a venire

12   man in this regard is that he be willing to consider,"

13   and those are his italics, "to consider all of the

14   penalties provided by State law, and that he not be

15   irrevocably committed before the trial has begun to vote

16   against the penalty of death, regardless of the facts

17   and circumstances that might emerge.                      If the voir dire

18   testimony in a given case indicates that venire men were

19   excluded on any broader basis than this, the defendant's

20   sentence cannot be carried out."                 Is that still a valid

21   statement of the law or has it changed?

22                 MS. ELLIOTT:         That is still a valid

23   statement of the law.

12   ability.     And this juror never --

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You would agree that

14   substantially impaired is not the same as irrevocably

15   committed?

16                 MS. ELLIOTT:         Yes, I would agree, because

17   you could say I favor the death penalty, as this juror

18   did, and still sit on the jury.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:            This doesn't say -- that's

20   one of the things it says.            But the other is, "the most

21   that can be demanded of a venire man is that he be

22   willing to consider" -- that's the word that's

23   italicized -- now, is there any -- "and if you exclude

24   him on a broader ground than that, the death sentence

25   cannot be carried out".          Now, is there anything in any

 1   later case that suggests a change in that respect?

 2                 MS. ELLIOTT:         No, Your Honor.             In fact, the

 3   cases affirm that.      And in fact, this juror was

 4   precisely the kind of juror that I think was appropriate

 5   to sit.     What he said was, I can consider.

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, he said that, but

 7   elsewhere he sort of indicated that he couldn't consider

 8   it unless it were a situation in which this person would

 9   be able to commit the crime again.

10                 MS. ELLIOTT:         But none of those statements

11   indicated he would be prevented from voting for the

12   death penalty, or that he was substantially impaired

13   from doing that.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            They did indicate that

15   unless that was the situation, he wouldn't consider

16   imposing the death penalty.              I think that's precisely

17   what they indicated.

18                 MS. ELLIOTT:         Well, if it means only that he

19   would consider the issue of future dangerousness, it

20   wouldn't prevent him under Washington law.                      Because

21   under Washington law, first of all, the presumption is

22   for life.    And second of all, the consideration of

23   whether or not a person would recidivate is both an

24   aggravating and a mitigating factor.                      So the fact that

25   he's concerned about reoffense is perfectly appropriate.

 1                 Where I think he could be prevented is if he

 2   said, if this -- unless this guy is going to be released

 3   in the future, and I don't think that's what he said

 4   here, Your Honor.     What he said was, recidivism is

 5   important.

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I like recidivate by the

 7   way.     I'm going to use it in the opinion.                  It's a very

 8   useful verb.

 9                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            If I can get back to my

10   concern about the failure to object again.                     Supposing

11   this defense counsel instead of just saying no

12   objection, said no objection, I think he's a hanging

13   juror?

14                 MS. ELLIOTT:         I think he's a hanging juror?

15                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            In other words, he thought

16   contrary to the prosecutor, his appraisal of this man

17   was that he's going to be pro-death penalty, and he let

18   that be known.    Would that make a difference?

19                 MS. ELLIOTT:         Well, I think that --

20                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            I don't think it would

21   under Washington law.        I don't suppose it would.

22                 MS. ELLIOTT:         Well, if the juror said -- it

23   would make a difference under Morgan if the juror said

24   I'm not going to consider any mitigating factor.

25                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            No, no.         The juror just

 1   did what he did, but everybody was evaluating his

 2   demeanor in the courtroom, and defense counsel's

 3   evaluation was to mean I don't want that juror, he's

 4   going to hang my client, and that's what he thought and

 5   he let it come out when he told the judge no objection.

 6                 MS. ELLIOTT:        Oh.

 7                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Would that make a

 8   difference?

 9                 MS. ELLIOTT:        It wouldn't make a difference

10   under Washington law because it could be raised for the

11   first time on appeal, yes, if that wasn't what the

12   record demonstrated.

13                 Did I understand your question?

14                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           You did.        Do you think it

15   should make a difference to us if we think that he

16   didn't really want this guy on the jury?

17                 MS. ELLIOTT:        I don't think there's anything

18   in the record to suggest that, but for lack of his

19   objection.    Because there's no harmless error analysis,

20   I don't think it can make a difference to this Court,

21   and because in Washington we have this peculiar rule

22   which says you don't have to object.

23                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Does the fact that this is

24   structural error, that there's no harmless error

25   analysis, mean that we should be very careful to give


                                        50

 1   substance to the rule that there's deference to the

 2   trial judge?   And in fact, in the Witt case, we said

 3   that the determination to excuse a juror is based on

 4   determinations of demeanor and credibility that are

 5   within the trial judge's province.                 We said that.

 6              MS. ELLIOTT:          Absolutely.            And if there had

 7   been a mention of demeanor on this record, I think this

 8   Court's decision would be easy.

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             What presumes that there

10   is that judgment made by the district judge, whether or

11   not it's mentioned?     It was not mentioned in Witt.

12              MS. ELLIOTT:          Well, what Judge Kozinski says

13   about that is if on the record -- you have a cold record

14   here which demonstrates in our view that the juror is

15   completely qualified to serve, and nothing about him

16   would prevent him from serving.              And you have no mention

17   of demeanor by the trial judge, but speculation on the

18   part of the prosecution, then all substantive evidence

19   review of juror challenges in capital cases is dead and

20   --

21              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Should defer to Judge

22   Kozinski's observation or to the Supreme Court in Witt?

23              MS. ELLIOTT:          You should defer to the

24   Supreme Court's observation in Witt, but only I think if

25   there's some indication on the record that there is

 1   demeanor.   And --

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, there's a

 3   third choice which under AEDPA is the Washington State

 4   court decision to which we should defer.

 5               MS. ELLIOTT:           The Washington State Supreme

 6   Court decision?

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Yes.

 8               MS. ELLIOTT:           The Washington State Supreme

 9   Court decision suffers a different problem, I think,

10   Your Honor, which is that what the Washington State

11   Supreme Court said on page 173 was that on voir dire he

12   indicated he would impose the death penalty where the

13   defendant, quote, "would reviolate if released," which

14   is not a correct statement of the law.                    And in fact,

15   that is -- the considerations about whether or not

16   Mr. Brown would reviolate whether in prison or not are

17   considerations under Washington law in a death penalty

18   case.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   On page 208, though,

20   the Washington Supreme Court also stated the standard,

21   as I understand it from Witt, that Mr. Deal's views

22   would have prevented or substantially impaired his

23   ability to follow the court's instructions.

24               MS. ELLIOTT:           But -- I agree that there is a

25   summary that says that.          But the substantive basis for


                                         52

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the trial court' decision I think is back at page, as I

 2   said, 173a, where he --

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Isn't the number of the

 4   page that you gave telling this is an appeal from a

 5   capital sentence, and there are umpteen challenges made.

 6   So the judge is dealing with Richard Deal in one

 7   paragraph.    The defendant raised a host of challenges,

 8   and so there's not perfect consistency with what these

 9   two passages in the opinion.             But mustn't we take into

10   account what this was?        It was the defense brought out

11   every objection they probably could conceive of and they

12   didn't put particular emphasis on this, so it comes out

13   this way.

14                 MS. ELLIOTT:        Well, if you're -- you mean in

15   terms of the -- in the trial court?                      Or in the State

16   Supreme Court decision?

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            In the Supreme Court.

18   Now we're talking about the Washington Supreme Court.

19   You said they got it wrong because they said in this

20   paragraph that he got the law you wrong, he made an

21   incorrect statement of the law because he said he would

22   impose the death penalty where the defendant would

23   reviolate if released, which is not a correct statement

24   of the law.

25                 We don't know exactly what that court meant


                                        53
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   by that paragraph, but we do know that the Washington

 2   Supreme Court was basing -- I don't know how many

 3   objections they were dealing with in this opinion, but a

 4   great many.

 5                 MS. ELLIOTT:         Yes, and so if you then turn

 6   to the end of the opinion, if that's what you're asking,

 7   at 208, there's kind of a summary of their basis for all

 8   of the challenges made by Mr. Brown to all sorts of

 9   things in the case.

10                 There were also challenges to other jurors

11   as well.     And there are separate paragraphs where the

12   court -- those jurors that are mentioned in the summary

13   paragraph, where the court then explains the various

14   reasons why it's upholding the trial judge as to those

15   jurors as well.

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, my point is simply

17   that where the court is faced with so many challenges,

18   this particular one, there had been no objection at the

19   trial.     So an appellate court might think we don't want

20   to spend too much time on that one.

21                 MS. ELLIOTT:         That is true.          It appears as

22   though what they did was to, because this is not what

23   the trial judge said, this is the basis for the

24   objection by the prosecutor, that they assumed the trial

25   judge adopted the prosecutor's objection.


                                         54

 1                In sum, there's nothing in the record that

 2   supports a conclusion here that Juror Deal could not

 3   subordinate his personal views about the death penalty

 4   or that he would frustrate the State's legitimate

 5   purpose in carrying out the State's legitimate interest

 6   in a constitutional capital death penalty scheme.               So we

 7   would ask this Court to affirm the opinion of Judge

 8   Kozinski in the Ninth Circuit and grant the writ of

 9   habeas corpus in this case.            Thank you.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

11   Ms. Elliott.

12               Mr. Samson, you have one minute remaining.

13               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. SAMSON

14                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15               MR. SAMSON:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

16               In response to the questions regarding the

17   Witherspoon language and whether it's still good law,

18   the Court in Witt essentially said that is no longer the

19   standard.   The standard instead is the substantial

20   impairment standard, and it is not required to show that

21   the juror would never impose the death penalty or

22   automatically vote against it by unmistakable clarity.

23               And the fact that there were -- in response

24   to Justice Ginsburg's question, the fact that there were

25   so many claims presented to the State Supreme Court may


                                       55

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   explain in part the summary opinion regarding this

 2   particular issue.    AEDPA does not require a perfect

 3   opinion by the State court to survive review.                  It only

 4   requires reasonableness and an objective standard.

 5              In addition, the arguments presented by

 6   Mr. Brown are essentially:           We disagree and the Federal

 7   courts should disagree with the factfinding process done

 8   by the State courts.       But the fact that a reviewing

 9   court reviewing the same transcript may reach a

10   different factual determination is not sufficient.                  If

11   the view reached by the State court is supported by

12   evidence and is -- thank you, Your Honor.

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

14   The case is submitted.
