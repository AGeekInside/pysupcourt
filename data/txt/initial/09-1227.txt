 5   United States.

 7                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 8                       ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 9                  MR. CLEMENT:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                  The standing of Petitioner to challenge the

12   constitutionality of the Federal statute under which her

13   liberty is being deprived should not be open to serious

14   question.     She clearly satisfies this Court's modern

15   tripartite test for standing.                 Indeed, it is hard to

16   imagine an injury more particularized or concrete than

17   six years in Federal prison, and the liberty interest

18   she seeks to vindicate is her own, not some third

19   party's.

20                  In many ways, I think "standing" is a bit of

21   a misnomer here.     Plaintiff is not a plaintiff who seeks

22   to invoke the jurisdiction of a Federal court.                          She is a

23   defendant who has been hailed into court by a Federal

24   prosecutor.     There is no logical reason she should not

25   be able to mount a constitutional attack on the statute

                                         3

 1   that is the basis for the prosecution.

 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Do our -- any of our

 3   opinions talk about the standing of the defendant?                I

 4   can't think of one at the moment.

 5               MR. CLEMENT:           Well, I think it was in the

 6   habeas context, but the Spencer decision does talk about

 7   how, when you have a criminal defendant or somebody who

 8   is serving a sentence, their standing to challenge the

 9   conviction is essentially one of the easiest standing

10   cases you can imagine.         And I think in a sense, the same

11   principles would apply here.

12               But as I said, I think standing is normally

13   something you think about as applying to the plaintiff,

14   who is invoking the jurisdiction of the court.               So

15   what's really at issue here is something -- almost more

16   of a bar on somebody's ability to make an argument that

17   would vindicate their liberty, and I see no reason why,

18   in logic, that should be the case.

19               Now, the court of appeals essentially didn't

20   apply ordinary -

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, it seems to me there

22   are certainly some arguments you could make as a

23   defendant for which you have no standing.               You're saying

24   there's no argument you can make as a defendant for

25   which you have no standing?

 1               MR. CLEMENT:           Well, I'm not sure you would

 2   call it normal standing principles, Your Honor.                There

 3   are certainly arguments you could make that you -- would

 4   have no business having anything to do with your case.

 5   There's arguments you could make that would have nothing

 6   to do with -- would be non-justiciable -

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Suppose I raise an

 8   Establishment Clause objection in a matter that -- that

 9   does not involve legislation and which our recent

10   opinions say therefore does not violate the

11   Establishment Clause?

12               MR. CLEMENT:           Well, I guess I would have to

13   know why you were a defendant in that case and how it

14   had anything to do with the price of tea in that

15   particular case.   But -

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:              No, you wouldn't.    All

17   you -- all you would have to know is that the claim is

18   based upon a statute -- is not based upon a statute and

19   that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence says if it's

20   not based upon a statute, it doesn't violate the

21   Establishment Clause.

22               MR. CLEMENT:           With respect, I don't think

23   that follows.   I mean, I think if -- if the Federal

24   executive tried to imprison you based on your religion,

25   you could take issue with that and say that's an

                                        5

 1   Establishment Clause violation.                 The problem in your

 2   recent case, the Hein case, is the only -

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I'd say it's a Free

 4   Exercise Clause violation.            I don't think you need the

 5   Establishment Clause for that.

 6                MR. CLEMENT:         Well, if they said, well,

 7   we're hereby establishing a religion and you're not part

 8   of our religion and we're therefore imprisoning you, I

 9   would think you could bring that claim.

10                But in all events, bringing it back to the

11   case before you, I think there is no reason to think

12   that ordinary principles of standing wouldn't give my

13   client every ability to challenge the constitutionality

14   of the statute under which she's being held.

15                JUSTICE KAGAN:           Mr. Clement, in the case

16   before us, are you making any claims other than that

17   Congress was acting outside its enumerated powers in

18   enacting this statute?        Are there any peculiarly Tenth

19   Amendment claims that you're making?

20                In other words, you admit that Congress is

21   acting within its enumerated powers and yet the action

22   violates the Tenth Amendment.               Are you making any claims

23   of that sort, or are all your claims that the statute

24   here goes beyond Congress's ability to enact it under

25   Article I?

 1                MR. CLEMENT:           Well, Justice Kagan,

 2   principally our argument here is an enumerated powers

 3   argument.   My problem, though, is I'm not sure I

 4   understand some clearly defined set of Tenth Amendment

 5   claims that are uniquely only Tenth Amendment claims and

 6   not enumerated power claims.

 7                JUSTICE KAGAN:             Well, let's just use the

 8   Printz case and say, even though Congress might have the

 9   ability to enact a statute under Article I, there's an

10   independent Tenth Amendment limitation.                      Do you have any

11   claims of that kind in this case?

12                MR. CLEMENT:           Well, I don't think so, but

13   let me just say that my problem is -- take the Printz

14   case.   The Printz case itself went out of its way to say

15   that it was an enumerated power case.                      In answering an

16   argument in the dissent, the majority opinion says, this

17   is not separate from enumerated powers.                      If you -

18                JUSTICE KAGAN:             Well, let's assume,

19   Mr. Clement, that there is such a thing as a claim in

20   which you're saying, I can see that this is within

21   Congress's Article I powers, but there is an independent

22   Tenth Amendment limitation on this.                      Do you have any

23   claims like that?

24                MR. CLEMENT:           I don't think so, Justice

25   Kagan, but I'd hate to sort of bet my case that on

 1   remand, I'm not going to say something in making an

 2   argument that the government or somebody else thinks is

 3   too much of a commandeering claim and too much -- not

 4   enough of an enumerated power claim.

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              The government agrees

 6   that it's an enumerated power claim in this case.

 7               MR. CLEMENT:         Again, Justice Ginsburg, that

 8   is the basis of our claim.           But just to give you a -

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              You are -- you are at no

10   risk if the Court were just limited to what both of you

11   agree is involved -- Article I, Section 8 -- and if

12   there is a difference for commandeering claims, when the

13   case arises, we can deal with it.

14               MR. CLEMENT:         Well, Justice Ginsburg, you

15   could certainly do that, and as long as it is crystal

16   clear that there will be no obstacle to my client making

17   a constitutional attack on section 229 on remand, I

18   suppose that's fair enough for my client.

19               But one of the arguments we've preserved,

20   for example, is the argument that Missouri vs. Holland

21   is not a blank check for the government, that it

22   requires a balancing of the State's interests against

23   the Federal interests.       And if on remand, I wax eloquent

24   about the State's interest in criminal prosecution and

25   law enforcement, I would hate for a trap door to open up

                                      8
                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   at that point and I be told that, wait, wait, that's too

 2   much of the State's interest and not enough of your own

 3   interest.

 4                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             So you want us to say that

 5   when there is a specific injury, specific to your

 6   client, that your client has the right to make any

 7   argument to show that the government has exceeded its

 8   powers under the Constitution, because those powers are

 9   limited to protect the liberties of the individual?

10                  MR. CLEMENT:         Exactly right, Justice

11   Kennedy, and that's the fundamental worry I have here,

12   is that this Court's cases have not drawn a distinction

13   between commandeering claims and enumerated powers

14   claims.     The two cases the government points to, New

15   York and Printz, both go out of their way to say that

16   they are mirror images or, in fact, enumerated power

17   claims, because a law that commandeers is not necessary

18   and proper.

19                  And I do also think that a part of the

20   problem with the suggestion that somehow Tennessee

21   Electric should be reimagined as a third party standing

22   claim is it fundamentally miscomprehends for whom the

23   structural provisions of the Constitution are there for.

24   Those provisions are there to protect the liberty of

25   citizens.

 1                The United -- this Court made that point in

 2   the Free Enterprise Fund just last term.                      There was a

 3   case where it wasn't the executive complaining about the

 4   infringement on executive power.                  The Executive Branch

 5   ably defended the statute in this Court.                      It was a

 6   disgruntled accounting firm that was allowed to

 7   vindicate the separation of powers.

 8                JUSTICE ALITO:           Can't there be some Tenth

 9   Amendment claims that go just to State prerogatives and

10   not to the rights of individuals?                      Let's say there's a

11   Federal statute that purports to regulate where a State

12   locates its capital, or the -- the contents of a State

13   flag, something like that.            Wouldn't that go just to

14   State prerogatives and not to individual rights?

15                MR. CLEMENT:         I think it would, Justice

16   Alito.   My point is not that there's some special rule

17   for the Tenth Amendment that plaintiffs will always have

18   standing.   My point is that you should just apply the

19   normal rules.   And what I don't think is sustainable is

20   the proposition that in commandeering claims an

21   individual never has standing.

22                I mean, imagine a Federal statute that

23   purported to save Federal money by commandeering local

24   prosecutors to prosecute Federal crimes.                      Well, I would

25   hope that a defendant in that kind of case would be able

                                      10

 1   to raise a commandeering argument as a defense.                      I don't

 2   think it would be any different if Congress tried to

 3   commandeer the Comptroller General to start bringing

 4   criminal prosecutions.          In that case -

 5                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. Clement, if you are not

 6   making a commandeering claim, then we would be going out

 7   of our way to decide that question.                      And so, you know,

 8   are you making a commandeering claim?

 9                 MR. CLEMENT:          I don't -- I don't

10   self-identify as having made a commandeering claim.                      But

11   what I would say is -- we're not asking you to do

12   anything special.     I just think it's the government

13   that's asking you to go out of your way to

14   reconceptualize Tennessee Electric as a different kind

15   of case and preserve it.

16                 JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, the problem is if

17   you're just making a treaty power claim, then how are

18   you going to possibly win on remand in the Third Circuit

19   if we reverse and say that your -- your client has

20   standing?    Do you think it falls within the prerogatives

21   of the court of appeals to say that Missouri v. Holland

22   was wrong?

23                 MR. CLEMENT:          Well two things, Justice

24   Alito.   First, this is a technical matter.                     We could go

25   back to the Third Circuit on our way back to coming here

                                        11

 1   and we would still have standing to make an argument

 2   that it's foreclosed by precedent.

 3                  But I think it's a mistake to think that

 4   Missouri v. Holland is some bright-line rule that

 5   forever answers this question.                  As I read Missouri v.

 6   Holland and as we clearly argued before the Third

 7   Circuit, it's not a blank check.                    It's really is more of

 8   a balancing test that looks at the State's interest and

 9   the Federal interest in assessing whether or not the

10   statute that implements the treaty is necessary and

11   proper.   And I think this case compares pretty favorably

12   with Missouri against Holland because there the state's

13   interests was very weak because these birds were just

14   flying through on their way and there was no real State

15   interest, or so this Court held, whereas in this case

16   the State has a real legitimate interest in law

17   enforcement.     I also think we ought to be able to make

18   --

19                  JUSTICE ALITO:           Does that depend on the

20   nature of the chemical that's involved?                    Suppose the

21   chemical was -- was something that people would normally

22   understand as the kind of chemical that would be used in

23   a chemical weapon?      Let's say it's Sarin does it matter

24   that this case doesn't involve something like that?

 1   Alito.   I think it would matter in part for a

 2   constitutional avoidance statutory construction

 3   argument, which I think also ought to be open to us.                    I

 4   sort of think by analogy to the Jones case, where this

 5   Court said that a Federal statute about arson doesn't

 6   apply when a cousin throws a Molotov cocktail at a

 7   residence.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             But that's a merits

 9   question rather than a standing question.                    I assume

10   we're not getting into those merits questions here.

11                 MR. CLEMENT:          No, I was trying to respond to

12   the question of whether we would be foreclosed.

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             All right.       But you're

14   confusing me.     I thought we were just doing standing.

15                 MR. CLEMENT:          No, we're not asking you to do

16   more than do standing.          But I do think it's important to

17   understand that we don't think we would be limited to

18   just losing on Missouri v. Holland below and coming back

19   up.   We think we have a very good argument about

20   Missouri v. Holland as applied.

21                 We also think that there is sort of a

22   statutory construction argument.                    And this isn't sarin.

23   There is something sort of odd about the government's

24   theory that says that I can buy a chemical weapon at

25   Amazon.com.     That strikes me as odd, and that seems to

                                        13

 1   me the kind of thing where you could make a statutory

 2   construction to say, well, maybe sarin or maybe actual

 3   chemical weapons, that's one thing, but with respect to

 4   this kind of commonly available chemical, to say without

 5   any jurisdictional element or anything like that, that

 6   it's a Federal crime seems like an argument we at least

 7   ought to have standing to make.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:            What do you say about the

 9   one thing -- the strongest point against you, I think,

10   is a single sentence in that TVA case.                 It's only one

11   sentence, but it's there in the opinion, and I think

12   what it's saying, Justice Roberts says, well, he already

13   finished, he just finished saying nobody -- Congress

14   hasn't violated some rule against creating a system of

15   regulation in this statute because it isn't regulation.

16   But then he said, but even if it were, even if it were,

17   and if your complaint was that Congress has acted

18   outside its authority, which they might have thought at

19   that time, in creating a system, TVA, that competes with

20   local systems, even if that were so, the appellants,

21   absent the State or their officers, would have no

22   standing in this suit to raise the question.

23                Okay, now, that -- they put quite a lot on

24   to that.   That is what it says.                So are we supposed to

25   say, well, that was an ill-considered dicta?                 Or are we

                                      14

 1   supposed to say it was just wrong?                       Are we supposed to

 2   say the law has changed?            What in your view are we

 3   supposed to -- or is different.                   What in your view are

 4   we supposed to say?

 5                  MR. CLEMENT:         Could I say two things about

 6   that sentence, and then explain what I really think you

 7   should say?     First of all, the first thing I would say

 8   about that sentence is that I don't think, read in the

 9   context of the entire opinion, it actually means that

10   the Court is trying to impose a special disability on

11   Tenth Amendment claims, because remember, they have

12   already rejected the plaintiff's basis for having

13   standing.

14                  JUSTICE BREYER:            So it comes out of left

15   field, and it's an overall "any, even, if."                       So that

16   suggests it's just dicta and doesn't count.

17                  MR. CLEMENT:         And it's dictum in another

18   way.     But what I think it stands for is the proposition

19   --     it rejects the argument that if you don't otherwise

20   have standing under the governing standing rule of the

21   day that you somehow have a license to bring a Tenth

22   Amendment claim.     And if that's what it stands, well, it

23   was right then and it continues to be right.

24                  A second point to make about it is it is

25   dictum, and if you read the sentence, what it says is

                                        15

 1   the following:   It makes a reference to what it's

 2   already established a couple of paragraphs earlier,

 3   which is the states at issue here have passed laws to

 4   accommodate TVA's sale of power, and then it goes on to

 5   say, if this were not so.           What does that -- that is a

 6   counterfactual hypothetical.              It's the worst kind of

 7   dictum.   It says if this were not so.                 If it were not

 8   the fact that the States had already taken these actions

 9   to affirmatively accommodate then we would have a

10   different question and then there wouldn't be standing.

11   So it is dictum I think and can be disregarded as such.

12                But really if you ask me what you should do

13   with it, you should do what you did in Twombly, with

14   some language in an opinion that had continued to cause

15   trouble in the 50 years since.                You should just say

16   that's no longer good law because it's not.                  The central

17   holding of Tennessee Electric was overruled 40 years ago

18   in the Camp case, and I think this language is of a

19   piece from that legal interest test, the legal wrong

20   test of standing, and I think this Court should make

21   clear that it doesn't apply any longer, and the virtue

22   of that would be that it would free up the lower courts

23   to decide these Tenth Amendment standing claims based on

24   an application of normal standing principles, because

25   that's not happening in the lower court right now.                  In

                                      16

 1   the lower court right now what happens is somebody comes

 2   in with a Tenth Amendment claim of whatever stripe,

 3   maybe it's a commandeering claim, maybe it's not, and

 4   what they're confronted with, especially if it's a

 5   commandeering claim, is a quick citation of Tennessee

 6   Electric, an equally quick citation of Shearson which

 7   says only this Court can overturn its decisions, and

 8   that's it.     No standing analysis, nothing subtle about

 9   the particular claim.         And that's not a sustainable

10   situation.

11                  If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

12                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, Mr.

15                ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN,

16              FOR RESPONDENT, IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONER

17                  MR. DREEBEN:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

18   and may it please the Court:

19                  As Petitioner confirmed this morning, the

20   central claim that he is making about the

21   unconstitutionality of section 229 is that it exceeds

22   Congress's enumerated powers.                 He may wish to raise as

23   part of that claim a argument that it invades the

24   province that belongs to the States concerning criminal

25   law.   He can do that.        He has the authority to make such

                                        17

 1   a challenge.     The Third Circuit erred in holding to the

 2   contrary.

 3                  Now, the Third Circuit in reaching the

 4   contrary conclusion relied on this Court's decision in

 5   Tennessee Electric v. TVA, and we think that the court

 6   of appeals misread that case in concluding that it

 7   barred standing, not because it lacks a holding that

 8   does bar standing of certain types of claims that allege

 9   an invasion of State sovereignty, but because the kind

10   of claim that Petitioner is making is not a Tenth

11   Amendment reserved rights claim, but instead an

12   enumerated powers claim.

13                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    It's kind of hard

14   under our precedents to draw that precise line between

15   enumerated powers and the Tenth Amendment, and it seems

16   a bit much to put defendant to the trouble of trying to

17   do that under the theory from TVA that they have no

18   standing to make a particular type of Tenth Amendment

19   claim.

20                  MR. DREEBEN:         Mr. Chief Justice, I don't

21   think that the defendant needs to be put in any trouble

22   in this case because the kind of claim that counsel is

23   making on her behalf does assert her right not to be

24   subject to criminal punishment under a law that he says,

25   counsel says, Congress lacks the authority to enact.

 1                JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, what if they argue -

 2   what if she argues on remand, if there is a remand,

 3   that, assuming for the sake of argument Congress can

 4   enact any law that is necessary and proper to implement

 5   a treaty?   The Tenth Amendment prohibits certain laws

 6   that intrude too heavily on State law enforcement

 7   prerogatives, State police power.                      If she makes that

 8   argument, which category does that fall into?

 9                MR. DREEBEN:         It falls into the enumerated

10   powers category, Justice Alito, just as last term in

11   United States v. Comstock one of the elements that this

12   Court looked at when it decided whether the law

13   authorizing civil commitment in that case was within

14   Congress's enumerated authority plus the Necessary and

15   Proper Clause, the Court looked at the extent to which

16   the law accommodated State interests or, alternatively,

17   invaded them in an unlawful manner, which is what Mr.

18   Comstock had alleged in that case.

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But you're -- you want us

20   to say that, even if the defendant in some case might

21   show that a constitutional violation is causing that

22   defendant specific injury, the defendant may not be able

23   to raise the claim of its, what you call sovereignty

24   claim?   In Thornton v. Arkansas, the term limits case,

25   we allowed a citizen of a State to bring a challenge to

                                      19

 1   a statute that the State had enacted inconsistent with

 2   its Federal powers.     Now, that's the flip side.       That

 3   was a State statute, not a Federal statute, but it seems

 4   to me that is inconsistent with the position you're

 5   taking.   And it seems to me also consistent -

 6   inconsistent with the rule that separation of powers

 7   claims can be presented by defendants, in Chadha v.

 8   INS, Clinton v. New York, a line-item veto case.

 9               The whole point of separation of powers, the

10   whole point of federalism, is that it inheres to the

11   individual and his or her right to liberty; and if that

12   is infringed by a criminal conviction or in any other

13   way that causes specific injury, why can't it be raised?

14   I just don't understand your point.

15               MR. DREEBEN:          Well, Justice Kennedy, I -- I

16   don't take issue with almost everything that you said.

17   The structural protections of the Constitution can be

18   enforced by individuals under the cases that you have

19   cited.

20               What we are dealing with here is two things.

21   First of all, a statement that this Court made in TVA

22   that was part of its holding, addressed to what the

23   Court perceived as an attack based on a specific aspect

24   of State sovereignty that belonged to the States.          Now,

25   today, we might not understand the claim that was made

                                      20

 1   in that case as implicating a specific sovereign right

 2   that's protected under the Tenth Amendment.                    Today we

 3   might look at it and say this is nothing other than a

 4   conventional preemption claim.

 5               JUSTICE ALITO:           I don't know whether that's

 6   a correct characterization of the argument that was made

 7   in -- in the Tennessee Electric case.                    I -- I'm looking

 8   at the brief in the case, and the discussion of the

 9   Tenth Amendment generally follows a caption that says

10   the power to dispose of Federal property does not

11   include any power to regulate local activities.

12               I don't understand why that isn't the same

13   kind of delegated powers argument that you say the

14   Petitioner here is raising.

15               MR. DREEBEN:         That may be, Justice Alito.                I

16   think that it's a little bit difficult to parse

17   precisely what the Petitioner in Tennessee Electric was

18   arguing, but this Court understood the claim as one that

19   -- that bore on Federal regulation of purely local

20   matters in a matter that regulated the internal affairs

21   of the State; and I agree with you that today we might

22   not view that as a Tenth Amendment-specific claim, but

23   this Court did in 1939.

24               JUSTICE BREYER:            Why didn't it just consider

25   it as outside the Commerce Clause?                    I mean, they had a

 1   whole lot of law, but what is the distinction between

 2   saying, as they said then, "Court, the TVA regulates

 3   electricity rates in Memphis and that's beyond the power

 4   of Congress to enact"?

 5               MR. DREEBEN:         Justice Breyer -

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:            In this case, which -

10   Breyer.

11               JUSTICE BREYER:            And this case seems the

12   same, saying it's beyond the power of Congress to enact

13   because of the treaty.

14               MR. DREEBEN:         Well I think if you intrude

15   today's analytical model -

16               JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.

17               MR. DREEBEN:         -- under today's

18   jurisprudence, that is how the case would be viewed.

19   But it was not how it was viewed at the time of TVA.

20               JUSTICE BREYER:            How do we know that?    I'm

21   not doubting you; I just want to know.

22               MR. DREEBEN:         The language from the

 1   presence or absence of a State objection mattered, the

 2   Court said:    As we've seen there's no objection from the

 3   State, and if this were not so the appellants, absent

 4   the States or their officers, have no standing to raise

 5   any objection under the amendment.

 6                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Let's assume in this

 7   hypothetical -- just that case, TVA.                     State -- the

 8   Federal Government sets the price, and someone's accused

 9   of violating that price.           Can that defendant come in and

10   say, just as in TVA, that's unconstitutional because

11   prices have to be set by the State?                     Can the defendant

12   say that, or is that an anti- commandeering claim that

13   you say they're barred from raising?

14                 MR. DREEBEN:         That is not an anti

15   commandeering claim.       That is the kind of claim that

16   today we would conceptualize as an enumerated powers

17   claim.

18                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               So my question goes back

19   to one that's been asked before, which is, give me a

20   hypothetical of a defendant who has been convicted where

21   it would be a pure anti- commandeering claim that you

22   say they have no standing for.

23                 MR. DREEBEN:         This will take me back to -

24   to Justice Kennedy's question, because I wanted to

25   answer the part that I thought distinguished a

 1   commandeering case from what Justice Kennedy was talking

 2   about.     And the point is best made in the context of an

 3   example.     Under the Sex Offender Registration Act,

 4   defendants have challenged the law on numerous grounds,

 5   including, number one, Congress lacks its constitutional

 6   authority under the Commerce Clause and the Necessary

 7   and Proper Clause to criminalize the individual

 8   registration requirement imposed on them.                       All courts

 9   that have addressed that have said that's a claim that's

10   within the cognizance of a defendant to bring.

11                  Defendants have also said the SORNA statute

12   violates Federal law because it requires States to

13   accept sex offender registrations.                       It commandeers the

14   States into requiring them to set up a sex offender

15   database.

16                  JUSTICE KAGAN:           Well, Mr. Dreeben, why

17   shouldn't the defendant be able to raise that argument?

18   If the defendant prevails on that argument, presumably

19   the statute is invalidated and the conviction is

20   overthrown.     So why doesn't the defendant have the

21   appropriate interest to raise that argument?

22                  MR. DREEBEN:         Well, Justice Kagan, this is

23   the absolutely crucial point that distinguishes

24   commandeering from most of the structural constitutional

25   provisions that we've been discussing this morning.                          A

 1   State can choose to establish a sex offender database

 2   and to receive registrations from people who are

 3   required to register under Federal law; and invalidating

 4   a Federal law that commanded them to do that does not

 5   deprive the State of its ability to say, we want to

 6   have, in our autonomous sovereign interest, a sex

 7   offender database that will receive these applications,

 8   and as a result -

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, all you're saying is

10   that there's -- in that hypothetical is that there's no

11   violation?

12                 MR. DREEBEN:         That's correct.

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Everybody goes home.

14                 MR. DREEBEN:         There -- the reason why in

15   that hypothetical the defendant should not raise the

16   issue is because there will be no violation -

17                 JUSTICE KAGAN:           But that's a merits

18   question.    That's not a standing question.             Why don't we

19   just say the defendant has standing to raise it, and

20   then he'll lose?

21                 MR. DREEBEN:         You could say that, Justice

22   Kagan, but I think that part of the enduring force of

23   TVA is that it adopted a third-party standing rule that

24   is still part of this Court's jurisprudence.

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, why couldn't you have

 1   said the same thing in TVA, that, while companies are -

 2   are -- not -- yes, the Federal -- the Federal statute

 3   requires the companies to charge this price, but they

 4   might have decided to charge it on their own anyway, and

 5   therefore you have no standing?

 6                  MR. DREEBEN:         Well, the Court did say that

 7   there was no standing on the grounds that when the

 8   specific argument was made, this takes away the right of

 9   the State to regulate because the Federal Government is

10   regulating.

11                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Dreeben, is your

12   concern that there would be a clash in these cases?

13   You've given the example of the State wants to have this

14   registration system.        Suppose the -- the defendant can

15   raise that and would prevail?                 Well, the State's not

16   party to that suit, its interests have not been

17   represented.     Is that -- is that your concern?

18                  MR. DREEBEN:         That is a major factor in

19   third-party standing generally, Justice Ginsburg.

20                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Suppose a State wanted to

21   be commandeered in Printz?              Suppose they said, we really

22   like having sheriffs take the Federal gun registration

23   law?

24                  MR. DREEBEN:         They can do that.       Justice

25   Kennedy, there's nothing -

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I -- I have -- I have -- I

 2   have serious trouble with that.                 A State can surrender

 3   its -- its -- a State can confer more authority on the

 4   Federal Government than the Constitution does?

 5               MR. DREEBEN:          No, Justice Kennedy.           But a

 6   State in its sovereign decisionmaking process can elect

 7   to participate in a Federal program.                   At least, that was

 8   what Justice O'Connor said in her concurrence in Printz.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why isn't standard standing

10   doctrine able to give you the protection that you're

11   looking after?   If indeed you can't tell whether the

12   State did it because it was compelled to or because it

13   wanted to, there was no causation and you don't have

14   standing.

15               MR. DREEBEN:          That is a perfectly acceptable

16   route of analysis.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I would rather use that

18   route of analysis than inventing the new one that you're

19   -- that you're urging upon us.

20               MR. DREEBEN:          Well, I don't think they're

21   different, Justice Scalia.            They both concern who holds

22   the right and whether there's any redressability -

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, then let's use the

24   one we already have and -- and not -- not have to get

25   into developing one that I've never heard of before.

 1                MR. DREEBEN:         I think, Justice Scalia, that

 2   all the Government is doing in this case is applying

 3   conventional standing principles of redressability and

 4   third-party standing in a specific context, which as Mr.

 5   Clement has made clear, is not before the Court today.

 6   This is not a commandeering case.                      That happens to be

 7   the only specific aspect of a State sovereignty claim

 8   that is distinct from an enumerated powers claim that

 9   the Court has recognized in recent decades.                      Whether

10   some other sort of claim of State sovereignty might some

11   day be recognized and require its own analysis is well

12   beyond the scope of this case.                Our point is a much more

13   basic one.   We agree with Petitioner's counsel that he

14   can raise the claim that he has tried to raise.                      We

15   think that the Third Circuit misunderstood what the TVA

16   decision purported to say when it rejected standing for

17   a type of State sovereignty claim.                      And we think that

18   the currently recognized State sovereignty claim of

19   commandeering fits into the description of the

20   analytical category that was addressed in TVA.

21                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Does that analysis

22   differ in any way because this is a treaty power claim

23   versus a Commerce Clause claim?                 Your briefs go back and

24   forth on which one it is.           Your reply brief now

25   emphasizes Commerce Clause power, but your main brief

 1   was saying this is a treaty provision challenge.                         Do

 2   they differ?

 3                  MR. DREEBEN:         Well, Justice Sotomayor, I

 4   believe that the statute is valid under either the

 5   Treaty Clause plus the Necessary and Proper Clause

 6   analysis under Missouri v. Holland.                      It also can be

 7   sustained in our view under the Commerce Clause, which

 8   follows directly from what this Court said in Raich when

 9   the Court said that the intrastate regulation of a

10   commodity that's used in commerce is a customary,

11   typical method that Congress utilizes.                      It gave as

12   examples of that the nuclear, biological, and plastic

13   explosives statutes which were enacted to implement

14   treaty obligations of the United States.

15                  JUSTICE ALITO:           Given the breadth of this

16   statute, that would be a very far-reaching decision,

17   wouldn't it?     Suppose that the Petitioner in this case

18   decided to retaliate against her former friend by

19   pouring a bottle of vinegar in the friend's goldfish

20   bowl.   As I read this statute, that would be a violation

21   of this statute, potentially punishable by life

22   imprisonment, wouldn't it?

23                  MR. DREEBEN:         I'm not sure, Justice Alito.

24   I will assume with you that it is.                       The statute -

25                  JUSTICE ALITO:           If she possesses a chemical

 1   weapon.

 2               MR. DREEBEN:           I'm not sure that vinegar is a

 3   chemical weapon.

 4               JUSTICE ALITO:             Well, a chemical weapon is a

 5   weapon that includes toxic chemicals.                   And a toxic

 6   chemical is a chemical that can cause death to animals.

 7   And pouring vinegar in a goldfish bowl, I believe, will

 8   cause death to the goldfish, so that's -- that's a

 9   chemical weapon.

10               MR. DREEBEN:           I'm willing to make the

11   assumption with you and accept that it is a

12   broad-reaching statute, but it was adopted as a

13   broad-reaching statute because this is an area, like the

14   medical marijuana instance in Raich, where effective

15   control of the interstate market requires control of an

16   intrastate market.     The statute exempts peaceful uses

17   for agricultural and pharmaceutical purposes of these

18   chemicals, it has other exemptions as well.                   It was

19   intended to be a comprehensive ban that implemented the

20   United States treaty obligations to eliminate the use of

21   chemical weapons both in military instances and in

22   terrorism, and -

23               JUSTICE ALITO:             The difference is that Raich

24   involved one commodity, right?                 Marijuana.    This

25   involves potentially thousands and thousands of

 1   chemicals.     And you would have -- you would make the

 2   same argument with respect to every one of those

 3   chemicals if you take together all of the people who are

 4   -- who would use vinegar to kill goldfish or all the

 5   people who might use antifreeze to kill dogs, you put

 6   all of that together, that has a substantial effect on

 7   the interstate, the interstate market for antifreeze or

 8   for vinegar?     That would be the argument?

 9                  MR. DREEBEN:         Well, I think it's pretty well

10   recognized, Justice Alito, that when Congress seeks to

11   regulate an interstate market as to which there cannot

12   be any question under the Commerce Clause Congress could

13   do, it can control the interstate market as necessary in

14   order to assure that its prohibition is effective.

15                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            You're trying to drive

16   vinegar out of the interstate market?                    Do the people

17   know you're trying to do this?                  Can you really argue

18   that this statute is designed to drive vinegar out of

19   the interstate market?

20                  MR. DREEBEN:         No, of course not.

21                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Dreeben, are we

22   getting to the merits of the case?

23                  MR. DREEBEN:         A lot further than I had

24   intended, Justice Ginsburg.               The merits of the case,

25   though, involve both a Commerce Clause argument, a

 1   treaty-based argument.          As far as the standing

 2   principles go, I don't think that there is any

 3   difference between them.            Missouri v. Holland was a case

 4   in which this Court adjudicated whether a law exceeded

 5   Congress's enumerated authority.                    It did that at the

 6   behest of a State, but there is no reason why under

 7   cases like Lopez and Sabri and Perez that an enumerated

 8   powers argument is in any way off limits to a criminal

 9   defendant.   It's not.

10                If this case does go back down to the Third

11   Circuit, a petitioner can make the argument that this

12   law exceeds the enumerated powers.                       We can rely on the

13   Treaty Clause.   It doesn't affect standing in any way.

14   I think that the amicus in support of the judgment makes

15   the assumption that because Missouri v. Holland is good

16   law, there's no possible claim that Petitioner can make

17   that the law would exceed Congress's enumerated

18   authority.   Therefore, the amicus says this must be some

19   sort of a special State sovereignty claim of a genre

20   that looks like commandeering, perhaps not articulated

21   quite light that.

22                We don't understand Petitioner to be making

23   that argument.   I think Petitioner confirmed today

24   that's not what she's trying to do, and there is no

25   Tenth Amendment claim based on a specific aspect of

                                        32

 1   State sovereignty that Petitioner has ever made.                  In

 2   fact, if you look at Petitioner's brief in support of

 3   the rehearing petition, Petitioner said the Tenth

 4   Amendment argument raised by Bond was not critical to

 5   Bond's other constitutional challenges.                  It is ancillary

 6   to Bond's main argument that Congress acted outside of

 7   its enumerated powers.          I think that's a correct

 8   understanding of what Petitioner has sought to argue in

 9   the court below.     In our view, she is entitled to make

10   that argument.     That argument should also fail on the

11   merits, but that is not an issue that this Court granted

12   certiorari to decide.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:                 In the category that you

14   would like to have saved, you said commandeering, but

15   you said there conceivably could be others.                  Is there

16   anything concrete, anything other than commandeering,

17   that might fall under this State sovereignty side of the

18   line?

19               MR. DREEBEN:            Well, as Justice Alito pointed

20   out, the Court has indicated that moving a State

21   capital, a direction to move the State capital, might be

22   an intrusion on sovereignty.

23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:                 Unlikely to come up as a

24   defense in a criminal case.

25               MR. DREEBEN:            Highly unlikely.

 5               ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER,

 6                  AS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF

 7                           JUDGEMENT BELOW

 8                  MR. McALLISTER:            Thank you, Mr. Chief

 9   Justice, and may it please the Court:

10                  The relevant standing doctrine in this case

11   is the prudential rule against third-party standing.                        No

12   one disputes here that the Petitioner has Article III

13   standing.     One of the difficulties in the case is that

14   the only case that mentions specifically standing in

15   this context is the Tennessee Valley Authority case and

16   it clearly says if it is in fact a Tenth Amendment

17   claim, unless you have a State official or the State,

18   there is no standing.

19                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Pretty harsh, if

20   we're talking about prudential standing, to deny that to

21   a criminal defendant, isn't it?

22                  MR. McALLISTER:            It's potentially harsh,

23   Your Honor, but there are lower court cases that have

24   certainly done it.      There is some circuit cases where a

25   criminal defendant has tried to make a Tenth Amendment

                                        34

 1   claim and the court has said no.                    She still has several

 2   other claims here.      We all agree, I think, to the extent

 3   you could really characterize her claim as an Article I

 4   enumerated powers claim, this Court has assumed many

 5   times that defendants have the standing.                        This Court

 6   generally has not discussed it, but it has assumed it,

 7   and so there are cases that say no standing for a

 8   criminal defendant.       She did make a Fifth Amendment due

 9   process vagueness challenge.                If she had other Bill of

10   Rights type claims.       Even the treaty power cases like

11   Reid v. Covert recognize you could raise that kind of

12   claim, but the Court's cases do distinguish between

13   Tenth Amendment and other claims.                        And a lot of the

14   argument here is about what is on the Tenth Amendment

15   side of the line, what is a lack of power, for a better

16   word, whether it's -- there's an Article I, power

17   doesn't reach it.     And in particular I would point to

18   the Heller case, which Petitioner mentions in her reply

19   brief, but frankly is off by one page in the citation

20   that the Court should focus on, pages 579 to '80.                           The

21   Court says "there are three times in the Constitution

22   where the word "the people" is not talking about

23   individual rights.      And the three examples the Court

24   gives are the Preamble, Article 1, Section 2, and the

25   Tenth Amendment.     And the Court says these provisions

 1   are about reservations of power, not rights.                      And also

 2   the Printz and the New York v. United States cases say

 3   there is something substantive about the Tenth Amendment

 4   that is a limit separate and apart from Article ,

 5   Section 8.

 6                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                  Excuse me.     What do you

 7   see specifically?      Because there's a lot of discussion

 8   about labels and what the labels mean in this case.                      But

 9   tell me specifically what -- not the word she uses, but

10   the specific ways in which prudential considerations bar

11   her standing; meaning:           What about the nature of her

12   claim prudentially should counsel us against giving her

13   standing?

14                MR. McALLISTER:               Well, I would say at least

15   a couple things, Your Honor.                 One is, the usual rule of

16   prudential third-party standing considers the alignment

17   or lack of alignment between the interests of the third

18   party making the claim and the party who is not present

19   whose claim it really is.              And in this case, there's

20   really no argument that her interests align with those

21   of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.                      The Commonwealth

22   in fact prosecuted her and it did not stop her.                      It was

23   unsuccessful as a deterrent.                 And later, when local

24   police wouldn't be involved, the Federal Government got

25   involved.    And -

 1                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Do you think

 2   Pennsylvania would be upset that the Federal Government

 3   got her when they couldn't?

 4                 MR. McALLISTER:            No, that's my point.      And

 5   so my point is that her interests are directly contrary

 6   to Pennsylvania's interests.               So she's not stepping in

 7   saying:    I share the interests of the State; therefore,

 8   let me articulate and argue the interests of the State.

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, in a -- in another

10   case, conceivably, the State Attorney General can

11   exercise his or her prosecutorial discretion not to -

12   not to prosecute this woman, or at least not to

13   prosecute her under the antiterrorism law that gives her

14   8 years.    Isn't that something for the State to be

15   concerned about?    We want to have the discretion of

16   whether to prosecute or not for standard crimes that

17   have no relation to interstate commerce or any other

18   Federal power.

19                 MR. McALLISTER:            Well, it's standard that

20   both sovereigns have the ability often to prosecute if

21   the definitions of crimes overlap, and there's nothing

22   that prevents Pennsylvania from prosecuting her again

23   here.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            She wants to make the

25   argument that the definitions don't overlap.                  She wants

                                       37

 1   to make the argument that this is a strictly State,

 2   local crime, and that any -- any attempt by the Federal

 3   Government to convert it into a treaty-based terrorism

 4   crime is -- is erroneous.

 5                 MR. McALLISTER:             Well, in -

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             That's what she's trying to

 7   do.   Why doesn't she have standing to make that

 8   argument?

 9                 MR. McALLISTER:             Because the lower courts,

10   at least, in their defense, understood this to be a

11   Tenth Amendment claim, and there are reasons for that.

12   Now, in this Court neither the Petitioner nor the

13   government really wants to talk about that or argue

14   about that.    Instead, they talk about the petition for

15   rehearing en banc after the Third Circuit has decided

16   the case.

17                 But if you look in the Joint Appendix, pages

18   26 to 32 is the supplemental brief that her lawyer filed

19   when the Third Circuit said, post-argument:                      Now, wait a

20   minute, maybe this is a Tenth Amendment case and we have

21   a standing issue.     The government, at that point, said:

22   Hey, good idea; we don't think she does have standing.

23                 And she did not come back and answer:                       I'm

24   not making a Tenth Amendment claim.                      Her answer is:     I'm

25   making a Tenth Amendment claim, but I have standing to

 1   make it.

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:              That single sentence

 3   doesn't seem -- I'm trying to figure it out.                It doesn't

 4   seem to refer to just all Tenth Amendment claims.

 5   There's a footnote and it talks about no standing in

 6   this suit.

 7                Then if you look back at the lower court

 8   case, it seemed to be referring to a particular argument

 9   where the challengers had said the Property Clause

10   doesn't give authority to the government to pass this.

11   The reply was, that was true in Alabama, and the Court

12   said it was okay.     Then the challengers say:             Oh, but

13   Alabama agreed.     And then Georgia doesn't agree.              And it

14   was in that context that Georgia says it doesn't make

15   any difference.

16                But if Georgia was going to disagree or

17   agree, if that's what it turned on, we better have

18   Georgia say whether they agree or disagree, and not have

19   people who aren't Georgia.              That's what he seems to be

20   saying to me at the moment.

21                If I'm right, what's comparable to that in

22   this case?   Is there some claim that she's making that

23   it would be constitutional if they agreed in the State

24   and it wouldn't be if not?              I don't think so.    I think

25   she means it's constitutional irrespective.

 1                  MR. McALLISTER:            As a -- I mean, she's

 2   arguing a lack of power.            So -

 3                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.           Yes.   So if that's

 4   so, then how can we take this sentence as barred?

 5                  MR. McALLISTER:            Well, I think, again, the

 6   sentence -- I mean, if we're talking about the sentence

 7   in TVA barring standing in Tenth Amendment claims -

 8                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.           It just says "in this

 9   case."

10                  MR. McALLISTER:            It says "in this case," but

11   there's no suggestion that it will -- frankly, it's hard

12   for us to even tell exactly what this case was in terms

13   of the facts.     It's a rather confusing case.

14                  JUSTICE BREYER:            No, he cites.            He gives a

15   footnote and you read the page and you get an idea.

16                  MR. McALLISTER:            For that particular

17   instance -- and that's certainly an example the Court

18   had in mind.     The language of TVA, though, is in no way

19   limited to that particular instance.                        It just says here,

20   there's -- if this is a Tenth Amendment claim, there is

21   no standing.     And that's why, I think, for 70 years the

22   lower courts have wrestled with, what is a Tenth

23   Amendment claim?     Because TVA is there, this Court has

24   announced it, and if it is a Tenth Amendment claim,

25   there is no standing.

 1                  Sort of back to Justice Sotomayor's

 2   question, though, in terms of the third-party prudential

 3   aspect of it, again, the issue is:                       Is this person a

 4   good person to assert someone else's interests?                       Yes,

 5   she has Article III standing, but not necessarily to

 6   make every constitutional claim one might think of.                          In

 7   the Tenth Amendment context, those claims belong to the

 8   States.     They don't create individual rights.                    And in

 9   fact, there's good reason to think the States do get

10   involved when they perceive actual Tenth Amendment

11   violations.

12                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Could you just

13   articulate for me -- we're speaking in generalities -

14   what in the nature of her claim, taking the labels away,

15   do you think is a pure Tenth Amendment challenge?

16                  MR. McALLISTER:            Well, that's -

17                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               As I read her complaint,

18   and it's always that it's a Tenth Amendment claim

19   because Congress and the president have exceeded their

20   powers in some -

21                  MR. McALLISTER:            As I understand her

22   complaint, basically her argument is that unless this

23   statute is authorized by something in Article I,

24   section 8, the first 17 clauses, there's no power to

25   enact it.     And that's why this case is, frankly, not

 1   clearly governed by Lopez or Raich or Morrison.                     Those

 2   were straight commerce power cases under section 3.

 3   This is a treaty power case under Article II, and she

 4   only wants to read the first half of the Necessary and

 5   Proper Clause, which refers to all the foregoing powers.

 6   But it also says necessary and proper for all other

 7   powers.

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               That's -- you haven't

 9   answered my -- my question.            Why isn't that a merits

10   decision as to whether or not the President and Congress

11   have the power to enact this legislation?

12               MR. McALLISTER:            Well, Your Honor, in

13   essence, at the end of the day, it will be a merits

14   question, but from a standing argument, trying to define

15   what is a Tenth Amendment claim -- and the point I was

16   trying to make, perhaps not successfully, is that she's

17   not saying -- well, she is sort of saying the Article I,

18   section 8 enumerated powers are the limits.                   But

19   frankly, they can't be the limits.

20               In light of the plain language of the

21   Necessary and Proper Clause and Missouri v. Holland and

22   90 years of this Court's precedent under the treaty

23   power, those powers are not limits.                   So she's asserting

24   they're limits and saying, I'm really making an Article

25   I claim, but that simply lets her always have standing,

 1   because, even in the commandeering cases, the plaintiff

 2   can say, this is about Article I, this is not about the

 3   Tenth Amendment.     And so at some point the Court has to

 4   drill down and characterize what the nature of the claim

 5   actually is.

 6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, why do we have

 7   to do that?     It -- it seems to me we've had a lot of

 8   discussion this morning about whether this is an

 9   enumerated powers claim or a Tenth Amendment claim.

10   They really do kind of blend together, and it seems to

11   me awfully difficult to put on a criminal defendant the

12   responsibility to decide whether this is going to be an

13   enumerated powers claim or this is going to be a Tenth

14   Amendment claim.     The basic principles do kind of merge

15   together, and why does it make -- again, why does it

16   make that much of a difference and why do you put the

17   burden on the defendant to parse the claim one way or

18   another, since I assume they can make pretty much all

19   the same arguments under an enumerated powers -- under

20   the enumerated powers clause -

21                  MR. McALLISTER:            Well -

22                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    In an enumerated

23   powers argument.

24                  MR. McALLISTER:            In an enumerated powers

25   case, yes.     The problem -- I think the difficulty with

 1   this case is it's unusual and that there -- until its

 2   reply brief in this Court, the government had not relied

 3   on the commerce power.          In fact, the government had said

 4   throughout:     This is a treaty power case, treaty power

 5   case.   Even at the oral argument in the Third Circuit,

 6   the judge said, couldn't we decide this on the basis of

 7   the treaty power?     Wouldn't -- or the commerce power -

 8   would not that be the easy route?                        And the government

 9   lawyer said, no, that would be the hard route; you need

10   to decide it on the basis of the treaty power.

11                 So I agree in a Lopez kind of case that,

12   really, that's where the Court has often said it's just

13   mirror image.     If the commerce power doesn't go that

14   far, then by definition it's reserved under the Tenth

15   Amendment.    But here, it's a treaty power case.                      It's

16   not an Article I, section 8 -

17                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            Mr. McAllister, I guess I

18   don't understand why that makes a difference.                        The

19   Necessary and Proper Clause says "foregoing powers" and

20   it says "other powers."           This happens to be a case where

21   Congress is acting under the other powers part of the

22   Necessary and Proper Clause, but the question in either

23   event is the extent of the Necessary and Proper Clause

24   and what it allows Congress to do.

25                 So in -- in that sense, whether it's a

 1   treaty power case or not a treaty power case just

 2   doesn't matter.   It's all a question of what Congress's

 3   scope of authority is under the Necessary and Proper

 4   Clause.

 5               MR. McALLISTER:             Well, I would disagree

 6   somewhat, Your Honor, respectfully, that -- her argument

 7   about the Necessary and Proper Clause I don't think is

 8   that this -- this -- she's not arguing the statute is an

 9   irrational or unreasonable way to implement the treaty

10   obligations of the United States.                      What she's arguing is

11   that the treaty power itself does not give Congress the

12   power to enact section 229 unless, in essence, you don't

13   need the treaty, because you already have the power, the

14   government does, under the first 17 clauses of Article

15   I, Section 8.

16               So, yes, the Necessary and Proper Clause is

17   the connection here to Article I, Section 8, but it's a

18   minimal connection, and -- and she's not arguing sort of

19   the -- - the -- I don't think, the Comstock kind of

20   argument that this isn't tied to, rationally, to some

21   sort of articulated power.

22               The government clearly has power to enter

23   treaties under Article II, section 2, and so that to me

24   is the distinguishing feature from all those other

25   Article I, section 8, cases.              This -- I agree; I don't

 1   think I could stand up here and -- and try to argue to

 2   you this is a true Tenth Amendment case if, in fact,

 3   this had been litigated as a commerce power case all

 4   along.

 5                JUSTICE ALITO:           I'm not sure I -- I'm not

 6   sure I understood what you just said.                    Are you saying

 7   that -- that she is arguing that Congress does not have

 8   the power to enact legislation that's necessary and

 9   proper for the implementation of treaties, but only for

10   the making of treaties; that she's making that argument

11   that's been made by some academic writers?

12                MR. McALLISTER:            No, I'm not sure that's

13   what I meant to say, Justice Alito.                    What -- what I was

14   trying to say is her argument is not -- well, I think

15   her argument is in essence a challenge to the treaty

16   power.   It's one step removed, but it is a challenge to

17   the treaty power, because she says the statute has to be

18   based on something in Article I, section 8, first 17

19   clauses; and if it's based on something there, then the

20   treaty power adds nothing to Congress's ability to enact

21   legislation; and that's inconsistent with the plain

22   language of the Necessary and Proper Clause, the fact

23   that the treaty power is in Article II, not in Article

24   I, section 8.

25                And so under her view of the world -- as I

                                      46

 1   understand it; I'm sure Mr. Clement will correct me if

 2   I'm wrong about my understanding -- is that really you

 3   don't need a treaty, the treaty doesn't add anything.                          I

 4   mean, it may be the reason that Congress decides at this

 5   point in time to enact section 229.                      But I believe, as I

 6   understood her argument, if it has the commerce power to

 7   do it, United States never entered -- needed to enter a

 8   treaty in order for Congress to enact section 229.                        So

 9   in other words, as I understand her argument, the treaty

10   power adds nothing to the domestic legislative authority

11   of Congress.

12                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. McAllister, have you

13   found any case other than this one where a criminal

14   defendant was held to have lacked standing to challenge

15   a statute under which the defendant was prosecuted?

16                  MR. McALLISTER:            Not in this Court, Justice

17   Ginsburg, but there are examples in the circuits, a few.

18   There are examples from the Eighth Circuit, from the

19   Tenth Circuit involving criminal prosecutions where the

20   Court characterized the claim as a Tenth Amendment claim

21   and said, in light of TVA, the criminal defendant does

22   not have standing to make that claim.                      So there are

23   examples in the lower courts.                 I'm not aware of an

24   example in this Court.

 1   there's some argument about the separation of powers

 2   cases in which the Court has typically allowed

 3   individuals to make that claim.                 Again, because we're

 4   talking about prudential rules and third-party standing,

 5   or at least I'm talking about that, one prudential

 6   consideration is in those cases, whether it's Chadha,

 7   whether it's Clinton v. New York, the recent Free

 8   Enterprise case, the Federal Government is always very

 9   much present.   It may be representing the defendant in

10   those cases, it may simply intervene or come in as an

11   amicus, it gets notice if the Federal statute is

12   challenged as being unconstitutional.

13               The difference in the Tenth Amendment

14   setting is there's no mechanism, practically, to notify

15   the States or solicit the States for their interests.

16   Someone's raising this claim that says the government is

17   intruding on your sovereign interests; there's no

18   mechanism to allow the States.                Now, if -- if States are

19   aware of it and come and ask to file an amicus, perhaps

20   they would be allowed to, but there's no mechanism that

21   ensures -

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                Isn't that an issue for

23   a civil lawsuit as opposed to a criminal one?                 Because

24   all that would happen in a criminal suit is that the

25   defendant's conviction would be undone, but that doesn't

                                      48

 1   mean that the State is bound in some way.                    The State

 2   wasn't a party to the criminal action.

 3                MR. McALLISTER:            Well, the State isn't a

 4   party, but what gets said in those cases about the scope

 5   of the State's prerogatives vis--vis the Federal

 6   Government could well be brought to bear in other cases

 7   in other settings, commandeering cases.

 8                Again, the concern in the third-party

 9   standing case is that you're not actually a party, but

10   someone else is making arguments in a sense on your

11   behalf.   They lose, because perhaps they don't know all

12   of the arguments they should be making or they don't

13   articulate them the way the State does -- there's still

14   stare decisis effect of those decisions on the States.

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Well, there's two things

16   that could happen.     One is that if the State loses, then

17   -- and it doesn't want to lose -- it passes its own law.

18   Or if it wins, if the case is as stated below, it just

19   lets the status quo go.         I still don't understand what

20   the long-term injury to the State is or could be.

21                MR. McALLISTER:            Well, I guess again, and

22   maybe I'm misapprehending, but the long-term interest is

23   a -- is a decision, say in the criminal case, that says,

24   no, this doesn't intrude on the State's sovereignty, is

25   there as a matter of stare decisis.                    So if in a later

                                      49

 1   case the State wants to in fact assert that this

 2   particular statute does intrude on our sovereignty, it's

 3   not that they can't necessarily raise the claim, but

 4   they will confront contrary precedent that the State

 5   never had a chance to -- to voice its opinion or its

 6   views at the time the issue was being adjudicated.

 7                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Your underlying premise is

 8   that the individual has no interest in whether or not

 9   the State has surrendered its powers to the Federal

10   Government, and I just don't think the Constitution was

11   framed on that theory.

12                 MR. McALLISTER:            Well, Justice Kennedy, I

13   don't know that I would say they have no interest, but I

14   am -- I guess the premise I'm asserting is they do not

15   necessarily get to assert the Tenth Amendment claim of

16   the States.    New York v. United States, for example, was

17   a case where the State initially said we're not

18   concerned about this regulation, and then changed its

19   mind; and the Court in New York said States don't waive

20   those Tenth Amendment rights; States can then -- can

21   change its mind and bring a suit, and there's no

22   indication -

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But it does -- it does

24   assume, as Justice Kennedy said, that the reason that is

25   there in the Constitution is only for the benefits of

                                       50
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the States, and not for the benefit of the people in the

 2   States.   So if a State chooses to give it away, the -

 3   the individual has -- has no standing.                 You say it's

 4   third party, we're raising the States' rights.                 I think

 5   what the other sides is arguing; this is not a right of

 6   the States, it's a right of the individual to have the

 7   State take charge of certain matters and the Federal

 8   Government take charge of other matters.                 I don't see

 9   why that's any different from an Article I, section 8

10   claim.

11               MR. McALLISTER:             Well, and that's a

12   conclusion the Court can reach.                 But what -- what the

13   Petitioner's position essentially holds is that there's

14   never a question of third-party standing for any claim

15   under the Constitution, basically, not the kind I'm

16   talking about; and that no claims are limited to certain

17   categories of litigants.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:             There -- there's a question

19   of causality, so some of them will -- will not be valid

20   because you can't show that the -- that the State was

21   coerced into doing something and therefore you can't

22   show that the violation of the Constitution caused your

23   injury.

24               MR. McALLISTER:             And that's -- but you're

25   talking now really the causality; that's an Article III

                                      51

 1   inquiry.    And again, what I'm trying to talk about is

 2   separate, the next step, the prudential third-party

 3   standing.     And I think Petitioner's view is third-party

 4   standing is just out the window, whether it's separation

 5   of powers, Tenth Amendment, anything.

11               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

12                       ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

13                  MR. CLEMENT:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

14                  Just a few points in rebuttal.                    First of

15   all, one reason not to carve out a special rule for

16   commandeering claims is that not all commandeering

17   claims are created equal.             Mr. Dreeben raises the

18   commandeering claim that has been litigated in the

19   context of SORNA, the sex registration act.                       I don't

20   know the details of that enough to know whether that's a

21   valid commandeering claim or not, or whether there's a

22   redressability problem in that particular case.                       But I

23   can certainly imagine a commandeering case, a Federal

24   statute that purports to commandeer local prosecutors to

25   prosecute Federal crimes, where there would be no

                                        52

 1   standing obstacle; and the problem is right now the

 2   lower courts aren't resolving the standing issue in the

 3   SORNA challenges based on a careful analysis of Article

 4   III standing, redressability or prudential standing, for

 5   that matter.     They're resolving those challenges with a

 6   simple citation to Tennessee Electric and let's move on,

 7   and that's really what should stop.

 8                  A second reason that you should not try to

 9   carve out commandeering cases as being somehow the

10   residuum of the Tennessee Electric dictum is because

11   Tennessee Electric says nothing about commandeering

12   cases.   It just talks broadly about Tenth Amendment

13   cases.   You know, we can disagree or agree; it's kind of

14   hard to figure out what the nature of the claim was in

15   Tennessee Electric.

16                  I don't think it was really much different

17   from the claim that we're raising here, which is in

18   Tennessee Electric they said, well, if the Federal

19   Government gets to regulate power, what's left of

20   State's traditional prerogative to regulate the price

21   for power.

22                  Here is if the Federal Government can go in

23   and prosecute you for putting vinegar in your neighbor's

24   goldfish bowl, what's left of local law enforcement.                    I

25   think they're very similar arguments.                    But whatever else

                                        53

 1   is true, I just don't think Tennessee Electric limited

 2   itself to commandeering claims in any way that would

 3   allow you to say that Mr. Dreeben refers to the enduring

 4   force of Tennessee Electric.                With all due respect, I

 5   don't think Tennessee Electric has any enduring force.

 6                 The central holding of this decision was

 7   overruled.    The further you go in the decision the less

 8   satisfying it is.     If you go all the way to reading the

 9   Georgia Power case cited in footnote 27 as Justice

10   Breyer has done, and you look at the role of consent of

11   the States, it turns out in the district court opinion,

12   that's in the merits section of the opinion.

13                 The Court's already held contrary, actually,

14   to the holding of Tennessee Electric that the utility

15   companies there had standing.                 So what you see is, you

16   know what happens if you apply the legal interest test,

17   you hopelessly conflate the merits and the standing

18   question.    That's kind of happened today in oral

19   argument.    That's a bad approach.                      The Court was right

20   to get rid of it in camp, and it should perfect the camp

21   decision by saying this sentence no longer survives.

22                 Two other minor points.                      One is on the

23   Commerce Clause, I think Justice Alito shows why the

24   Government was right never to make that argument below,

25   but I do think it's important that if this Court says

                                        54
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   anything about the Commerce Clause issue, it doesn't

 2   somehow reinject it in the case in a way that would not

 3   allow us to argue that it has been clearly waived in the

 4   Third Circuit.    The Government gets to confess air, it

 5   doesn't get to confess, oh, actually, we have a better

 6   argument to defend the statute that we've never raised

 7   before.    Plain error should be a two-way street, and

 8   they should not be allowed to sneak the Commerce Clause

 9   back into the case at this late stage.

10                 Finally, there is no difference between the

11   separation of powers case and the Federalism case.                       The

12   best example of that is this Court's Free Enterprise

13   Fund case.    When it wants a case to cite for the

14   proposition that the Executive Branch cannot waive or

15   acquiesce in a separation of powers violation, because

16   the separation of powers is there to protect the

17   individual, what does it cite?                 New York against United

18   States.    Please reverse the decision below.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, Mr.

20   Clement.

21                 Mr. McAllister, this Court appointed you to
