 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  We'll hear argument

 4   this morning in case 06-1221, Sprint/United Management

 5   Company v. Mendelsohn.

 6               Mr. Cane.

 7                   ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL W. CANE, JR.,

 8                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. CANE:       Chief Justice Roberts, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               Our basic principal of evidence of the need

12   for foundation explains why the court of appeals should

13   be reversed.    An employment decision is made by the

14   person who made it, the decision-maker.                  If some other

15   person harbors bias, that's unfortunate; but it is not

16   probative of claims by a plaintiff who is not affected

17   by it.   This Court's discrimination cases, both in the

18   employment context and in other contexts, consistently

19   focus on the decision maker's intent, not on the intent

20   of other persons.

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             If you were to read the

22   district court's minute order -- and this is that short

23   minute order -- as saying that evidence of pattern and

24   practice simply is not admissible, that would be error,

25   would it not?    Error to -- if the -- if that had been


                                         3

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   his ruling, that would have been error.                 In my Court,

 2   you don't introduce pattern and practice.                 That can't be

 3   --

 4              MR. CANE:       Yeah, if the district court had

 5   held that under no circumstances could a pattern or

 6   practice of discrimination be shown, I think that would

 7   have been error.

 8              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Is there anything in the

 9   other parts of the record colloquy, comments by the

10   district judge, that you think Respondents have called

11   to our attention to indicate that he had this sweeping

12   view?

13              MR. CANE:       No.      I don't think that's what

14   the court was focusing on.          The district court focused

15   on the nexus of the disputed witnesses to the plaintiff.

16   The district court did not hand out a cookie cutter

17   ruling at the courthouse door.              The district court did

18   not say oh, this is a discrimination case, hear are the

19   rules of evidence I apply in a discrimination case.

20   What the district court here did was consider Sprint's

21   motion in limine, which was grounded in the evidence

22   that had emerged in discovery in this case.

23              Plaintiff then responded to that motion in

24   limine by trying to explain why the evidence was

25   relevant given the facts of this case.

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                The plaintiff then filed a witness list,

 2   which explained what each of the disputed witnesses

 3   would say in this case; and the plaintiff finally made

 4   an offer of proof which again collaborated on what

 5   plaintiff contended the disputed witnesses would say in

 6   this case.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:            We don't really know, do

 8   we, what the district court's order was based on?

 9   Whether it was based on 401 or 403?                     Did the district

10   court explain its order at all?              It didn't, did it?

11                MR. CANE:     The district court did not

12   specifically invoke rule 403.             I think it's -- my

13   reading of it that it is grounded in both 401 and 403.

14                The motion in limine relied on both 401 and

15   403, the district court told counsel that she wanted the

16   jury to be focusing on the claims of this plaintiff and

17   not be distracted by claims of others.

18                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, to the extent it was

19   grounded on 401, it was error, wasn't it?

20                MR. CANE:     I don't think so, because I don't

21   think there's --

22                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, if you have three

23   supervisors, and one is discriminating and another is

24   discriminating, isn't that some evidence that you're in

25   an industrial situation in which discrimination goes on,


                                        5

 1   and therefore doesn't it have the tendency that amounts

 2   to relevance under 401?

 3                 MR. CANE:     We have here five persons, who

 4   out of 15,000 --

 5                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, what about my

 6   question?

 7                 MR. CANE:     The answer to the question is no,

 8   it doesn't.    As this Court taught in Teamsters --

 9                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            No relevance at all?

10                 MR. CANE:     A pattern or practice is not

11   established by anecdotes.           And what we have here are

12   anecdotes of 5 persons out of the 15,000 --

13                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            What about my question?   We

14   have evidence that there are three supervisors, two of

15   them are discriminating.          Isn't that some -- doesn't

16   that have some tendency to indicate that in an equivocal

17   situation, that one was -- it may not be strong

18   evidence, it may not win the case, it may not be

19   powerful, but it has the tendency that gets you over the

20   line on 401, doesn't it?

21                 MR. CANE:     That's why I started with the

22   importance of emphasizing foundation.                    To --

23                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            I don't want to -- I don't

24   want to emphasize my question, before we get the --

25                 MR. CANE:     For relevance to exist, there

 1   would have to be a foundational showing.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What do you mean by that?

 3   You repeated several times there must be -- must lay a

 4   foundation.    You do recognize, I think in your reply

 5   brief, that some other supervisor evidence would be

 6   relevant and admissible, but you refer to the

 7   foundation.

 8                 Tell us what you think a proper foundation

 9   would be.

10                 MR. CANE:     The foundation, Justice Ginsburg,

11   would be some linkage between the decision making

12   supervisor and the supervisors whose acts or conduct is

13   assailed by the plaintiff.           And if there's no showing of

14   nexus other than the fact that they both happen to draw

15   a paycheck from Sprint --

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What do you mean by

17   "nexus"?    If they both work in the same physical

18   facility, is that a nexus?

19                 MR. CANE:     No.      I think the nexus requires

20   more than a common zip code.

21                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            What if you've got 20

22   supervisors and you've got evidence that 19 of them have

23   discriminated after making expressly discriminatory

24   remarks.    The 20th is the subject to the action.               Is the

25   evidence of the 19 admissible?

 1              MR. CANE:         I think --

 2              JUSTICE SOUTER:                Is a nexus there?

 3              MR. CANE:         I think, in a company that was

 4   not small, where a nexus could be inferred, that there

 5   was consultation or that there were directions from more

 6   senior management, then I think that would be an

 7   appropriate foundation.

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:                All right.          So, if we've

 9   got 19 and there's a question of 1, we've got a nexus.

10   If we've got three and there's a question, two are

11   accounted for as discriminatory, and the question is the

12   third, we don't have a nexus.               Is that the way you're

13   doing the math?

14              MR. CANE:         I'm sorry.            Did I under your

15   question to be three supervisors in the whole company or

16   three supervisors out of this vast company that we're

17   talking about?

18              JUSTICE SOUTER:                At this point, I'm saying

19   three supervisors out of a whole company.                       Will that do

20   it?

21              MR. CANE:         Not absent some reason to believe

22   that they conferred or they received directions.

23              JUSTICE SOUTER:                Three supervisors, and

24   that's all there is in the company.                       That consists of

25   the company.     Have a nexus then?

 1                MR. CANE:     If there were -- if two out of

 2   three, I think there might be an argument that at least

 3   it was a jury question at that stage.

 4                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.

 5                MR. CANE:     But here we're dealing with a

 6   70,000-employee company.         We have five witnesses who are

 7   principally assailing two persons.                 So --

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You agree that it

 9   has to be a case-by-case determination?                    There's no

10   absolute rule either way?

11                MR. CANE:     I think there -- there should be

12   a guiding principle.      And the guiding principle was that

13   other-supervisor evidence should be presumptively

14   irrelevant, and that would be the rule in the normal run

15   of cases, at least in dealing with entities of this

16   magnitude.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So I assume it would

18   be addressed as it was here, in a motion in limine, the

19   plaintiff would say here are the witnesses we intend to

20   call; the company would say we don't think they're

21   relevant because, as you say, there's no connection

22   between them, and then the judge would decide.

23                MR. CANE:     That's normally how --

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That's on the issue

25   of relevance.

 1               MR. CANE:       That's normally how it would

 2   present itself, and indeed the district court normally

 3   would consider Rule 403 consideration if that's the

 4   case.

 5               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Excuse me.           Did I hear

 6   mishear you?   You said it's a 7,000-person?

 7               MR. CANE:       70,000.          7-0-0-0-0.         Yes.

 8               JUSTICE BREYER:             If that's the way to do it,

 9   you didn't do it that way, did you?                      I mean, as I read

10   it -- they put in here, on 163a, the motion that you

11   made to the district court said that you have to be

12   "similarly situated" -- "Plaintiff has to have been

13   'similarly situated' with other employees" -- and you

14   put that in quotes -- "similarly situated."                     And then

15   you say "employees may be 'similarly situated' only if

16   they have the same supervisor."               Period.        Not -- it

17   wasn't a period actually, but the rest of the sentence

18   isn't important.    And then you cite Aramburu, which is

19   where the Tenth Circuit said that.

20               So I don't see how you can say this wasn't a

21   401 case.   You were saying that weren't similarly

22   situated, period.     And then the district judge virtually

23   quoted those words.

24               MR. CANE:       The motion was grounded in both

25   Rule 401 and --

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, that may be, but the

 2   -- I don't see -- I mean, that may be, but this is the

 3   argument you made, and this was the argument the

 4   district judge adopted.        Is that not so or is it so?

 5               MR. CANE:      That is so, but what the district

 6   judge adopted was grounded in the offer of proof that

 7   had been made here and the evidence that was proffered

 8   here.   The district court was not issuing a blanket

 9   ruling that would have governed any potential --

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Excuse me --

11               JUSTICE SOUTER:            How do we know?

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yeah.       How do we know

13   that's what the district court adopted?                 I have -- is it

14   the order on 24a of the appendix to the petition?

15               MR. CANE:      Yes.

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:            It doesn't mention -- it

17   doesn't mention which of the two of your arguments the

18   district court is relying on.

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It doesn't mention the

20   offer of proof.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And didn't the Tenth

22   Circuit read it to be an absolute prohibition?                 That it

23   must be the same supervisor?            "'Similarly situated'

24   requires proof that Paul Reddick was the decisionmaker."

25   That seems as though that the district court thought


                                       11

 1   there -- it must be the same supervisor, and I thought

 2   that's how the Tenth Circuit read --

 3                 MR. CANE:      And I think --

 4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- the district court.

 5                 MR. CANE:      That would be the rule in the

 6   normal run of cases where there is no showing of

 7   connection.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            We're not talking about the

 9   rule.     We're trying to find out what it was the district

10   court did.

11                 Now, the court of appeals assumed the worst.

12   I mean, assumed what makes the case the hardest for you,

13   and that is the court of appeals assumed that the

14   district court relied on 401.               Is it customary to assume

15   the worst?

16                 MR. CANE:      No.      I think it would be

17   customary to assume that, particularly on an issue of

18   evidence, that the district court was presumptively

19   correct, and that --

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            If there's any basis on

21   which the district court's decision would have been

22   correct, the district court's decision is upheld.

23                 MR. CANE:      It could be affirmed on that

24   ground.

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:            That's why I don't

 1   understand your answer.          I'm confused here.               What I

 2   said, and you seemed to agree, is different from what

 3   was just said, which you also seemed to agree.

 4                 (Laughter.)

 5                 I thought that you said in your brief that

 6   you have to have been -- quote -- "similarly situated."

 7   All right?     "Employees must be similarly situated to

 8   Plaintiff."     That's true, isn't it?                    I'm quoting the

 9   brief, from page 163.        And then you say, "Employees may

10   be similarly situated only if they have the same

11   supervisor."

12                 Then the district court says that plaintiff

13   may offer evidence who are "similarly situated" to her

14   and then -- quote -- "similarly situated employees" --

15   quote -- "for the purpose of this ruling requires proof

16   that Paul Reddick, his supervisor, was the

17   decisionmaker."    That's why I thought it was fairly

18   clear, since he used the same words and substituted the

19   word "Paul Reddick" for the same supervisor, that he was

20   taking that right from your brief where you made that

21   general argument and said nothing about the particular

22   case in those sentences.

23                 MR. CANE:      The general rule applies because

24   there was no showing here of any relationship between

25   the decision at issue here and --

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You -- you want to defend

 2   the harder ground, I understand.               But what Justice

 3   Breyer has just said is not necessarily so.               The

 4   "similarly situated" argument applies under 403 as well.

 5   If they're similarly situated, the -- the time it would

 6   take to let in these other things and rebuttal of them,

 7   plus the prejudicial effect on the jury, would be

 8   outweighed by the fact that they're similarly situated,

 9   and, therefore, that it is stronger proof.               I don't see

10   that one can tell from the district court's order

11   whether the district court was relying on 401 or 403.

12               And certainly, you just don't want to defend

13   403.  I think you're digging a hole for yourself.

14               MR. CANE:      No, I absolutely want to defend

15   403.   If there was any minimal probative value here,

16   Justice Scalia, all the countervailing 403 factors are

17   present.

18               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, don't we have to

19   address 403 in any event?          Because the Tenth Circuit

20   ruled, as I understand it, ruled that the evidence could

21   not be excluded under 403.          It would have been an abuse

22   of discretion --

23               MR. CANE:      That is what --

24               JUSTICE ALITO:          -- for the trial judge to

25   have excluded it under 403.

 1               MR. CANE:       That is correct.                Had the "me,

 2   too" evidence been admitted, then we would have had to

 3   respond with what might be called "not you, either"

 4   evidence.   And then the plaintiff would have made a

 5   rebuttal to that showing, and we would have had trials

 6   within a trial on whether these couple of persons that

 7   plaintiff identified as potential bad actors were, in

 8   fact, bad actors.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Would that be done

10   typically at the motion in limine stage?                     I mean, do you

11   establish whether or not there was discrimination in the

12   "me, too" cases at trial or prior to the trial, outside

13   the jury's --

14               MR. CANE:       I think it can happen both ways.

15   And really here it happened both ways, too, because

16   although it was teed up as a motion in limine, as the

17   trial evolved, the district court actually relaxed her

18   ruling and expanded it to permit attacks both on

19   Reddick, who was the direct supervisor, but also

20   decisions made by Blessing, who was Reddick's boss.                      And

21   the district court explained that, as she thought about

22   it further, that additional bit of latitude should be

23   given to both sides because there was evidence that

24   Blessing had consulted with Reddick.                     And, in other

25   words --

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But that didn't present

 2   the other supervisor, which I think is more -- a better

 3   way to comprehend this, because "me, too" could be 10

 4   witnesses working under the same supervisor.                   But these

 5   two people, as I understand it, were in the direct chain

 6   of supervisory command.

 7                MR. CANE:      That's correct.              And that to me

 8   is the proper test.      If the decisionmaker's supervisor

 9   was demonstrated to be biased, then I think that has

10   some relevance because it raises a question as to

11   whether that bias --

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But that's not "other

13   supervisor."    They are both supervisors of this

14   employee.    She's in a unit that includes both superior

15   officers.    I thought that the issue here was simply

16   other supervisors, witnesses who had worked for other

17   supervisors, people for whom the -- with whom the

18   plaintiff had no connection.

19                MR. CANE:      And, more importantly, the other

20   supervisors were persons that were not shown to have any

21   connection with the decisionmaker with respect to this

22   plaintiff.

23                And so, yes, if you are going to define

24   "other supervisor" not to include the chain of command,

25   then that's the reason why I think there is no relevance

 1   and a Rule 403 --

 2              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                But you say -- I thought

 3   you said in your reply brief that other-supervisor

 4   evidence could be relevant.

 5              MR. CANE:         It could be relevant if there

 6   were a showing that the bias on the part of the other

 7   supervisors somehow tainted the decision making of the

 8   instant decisionmaker.

 9              And in the cases that Ms. Mendelsohn cites

10   in her brief, those are all cases in which a directive

11   was given from a more senior official to the

12   decisionmaker.

13              What we have here are decisionmakers in

14   far-flung areas elsewhere within the company with no

15   showing whatsoever that there is any relationship

16   between them.

17              Each of the five disputed witnesses here

18   testified in deposition that they had no information

19   whatsoever to shed about the decisionmakers with respect

20   to Ms. Mendelsohn.

21              And so in those circumstances there's no

22   foundational showing of relationship, no foundational

23   showing of nexus.

24              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Was there an attempt by

25   the plaintiff during the discovery phase of the case to

 1   show other evidence of pattern and practice, statistical

 2   evidence; or was it just these five people?                      Was that

 3   all that the plaintiff presented?

 4               MR. CANE:        It was just these five people.

 5   The only statistics in the case were that the number of

 6   persons over 50 in this particular unit, the Business

 7   Development Strategy Group, actually increased; and that

 8   the oldest person at any particular level within the

 9   Business Development Strategy Group was retained and not

10   laid off.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   What about the

12   spreadsheet evidence?        I thought there was some effort

13   to show a connection through the spreadsheet showing the

14   age of the dismissed employees?

15               MR. CANE:        That spreadsheet was linked to

16   some supervisor named Kennedy, who bore no relationship

17   to this department and no relationship to these

18   decisionmakers.

19               Let's assume that -- that allegation is

20   untested, but let's assume that Mr. Kennedy was

21   correctly identified as a bad actor.                      Again, that has no

22   relationship.     It might have everything to do with any

23   layoff decision made by Kennedy or made by someone

24   Kennedy supervised.       But it bears no relationship to

25   Ms. Mendelsohn's circumstances because there was no


                                         18

 1   showing that a similar spreadsheet was used by any of

 2   her decisionmakers.

 3               Let's assume that Kennedy is, like the two

 4   others, Stock and Voorhees, perhaps a bad actor.                  That

 5   just doesn't shed any meaningful light on the

 6   circumstances of the plaintiff here; and even if it did

 7   shed some -- some bit of light --

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:            I am somewhat puzzled.

 9   How many bad actors does there have to be before you can

10   draw an inference that someone superior to the bad

11   actors had a motivating part in the whole situation?

12               MR. CANE:      I don't know that --

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            The inference they are

14   trying to prove is there was somebody upstairs that told

15   everybody what to do.

16               MR. CANE:      And they had full and fair

17   discovery to try and demonstrate that.                  But their own

18   witnesses testified that they were unaware of any

19   relationship between themselves and their decisionmaker

20   and the plaintiff and the plaintiff's decision-maker.

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Does the record show in

22   this 70,000-person company how many supervisors there

23   were?   Do we know that?

24               MR. CANE:      No.      It doesn't say, Justice

25   Kennedy.

 1              Let me --

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Let me ask this, though.

 3   Does it show whether the person more senior to the five

 4   supervisors involved here was the same person or a

 5   different person?

 6              MR. CANE:         It is a different person.             Sure,

 7   if you go far enough up the corporate ladder, eventually

 8   you will end up --

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               The next step up would be

10   --

11              MR. CANE:         Not the next step up, the next

12   step after that, and not the next step after that.

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Your theory doesn't

14   depend on where in the hierarchy the other supervisors

15   are located, I take it, if there's a connection?                   In

16   other words, if there's a lower-level supervisor who

17   discriminates and that is somehow communicated to the

18   supervisor in question, and whatever -- that you know,

19   the point is that the other one wasn't disciplined or

20   something, that would still -- under your theory that

21   would be admissible, correct?

22              MR. CANE:         If a -- no matter what level, I

23   would disagree that if a discriminating supervisor is in

24   the chain of command and supervises the decisionmaker,

25   then I think there's --

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, I'm talking

 2   about a situation -- let's say it is a lower-level

 3   supervisor outside the chain of command who commits

 4   another "me, too" act, but that is communicated to the

 5   other in a way that suggests, for example, that the

 6   company tolerates it or accepts it.

 7                I take it that that would be potentially

 8   admissible subject to 403 under your theory.

 9                MR. CANE:     I think that's right.             If there's

10   a showing the actual decisionmaker could have been

11   tainted by it, I would agree with that.

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I see your -- does 404

13   bear on the case, Rule 404 of the Rules of Evidence?

14                MR. CANE:     Yes, I think it does.            I think

15   that if you're going to have -- what we have here is, in

16   effect, an assault on the corporate character of the

17   company and not an assault --

18                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Have we said that 404

19   applies to corporations?         Corporations have a character?

20                MR. CANE:     I don't think the Court has ever

21   held that.   I think the individual has a character, and

22   there is no character-evidence problem with showing that

23   a particular decisionmaker engaged in other

24   discriminatory conduct, because I think that falls

25   within the exception to 404.            But where the

 1   decisionmaker is somebody else, then what you really

 2   have is an assault on the corporate character, and I

 3   think that's impermissible.

 5   reserve the balance of my time.

11               MR. GARRE:       Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

12   and may it please the Court:

13               Evidence of discrimination by other

14   supervisors within the company is sometimes but not

15   always admissible in a disparate-treatment case to help

16   prove discrimination by the plaintiff's own supervisor.

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 That's under --

18   under 401, it's not always admissible, or do you need

19   403 to reach that conclusion?

20               MR. GARRE:       I think you need to look at the

21   evidence under both rules, the first question being

22   whether it meets the minimum-evidence threshold in 401.

23   And that is a very low threshold set by the Federal

24   rules.   The second question being whether it may be

25   excluded under Rule 403, which would --

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But do you think

 2   there are situations where other-supervisor evidence is

 3   not admissible under 401 itself?

 4              MR. GARRE:       Yes.       We do think that there are

 5   some instances where other-supervisor evidence is not

 6   admissible under 401.     For example, if you have a large

 7   company and you have a plaintiff in the Chicago office

 8   claiming that her supervisor had it out for her and she

 9   wants to put on the testimony of an employee in the

10   Seattle office who two years ago complained that her

11   supervisor had it out for her, we think that that would

12   not be relevant under 401.

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, but here you have a

14   company of 70,000 people.

15              MR. GARRE:       You have a company of 70,000

16   people, but you have allegations that supervisors in the

17   same division, implementing the same company-wide

18   reduction-in-force plan in the same timeframe and giving

19   similar explanations under similar circumstances,

20   engaged in discrimination.

21              We think that the district dissenting judge

22   in the court of appeals was right to say that evidence

23   of that kind is at least marginally relevant, which

24   would then put the focus on whether this evidence could

25   be excluded under 403.

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It is hard to see what

 2   wouldn't be marginally relevant if you think that's

 3   marginally relevant.       It has to be a different

 4   supervisor in a different time frame.                     I mean, sure.

 5                 MR. GARRE:      Well, I think you've got other

 6   situations as well, Justice Scalia.                      I think we've got a

 7   situation of a general comment of discriminatory animus.

 8   For example, older people just don't get it, something

 9   like that.    I think the -- the -- by a different

10   supervisor.

11                 I think even if that's within the same

12   office, the plaintiff is going to be hard-pressed even

13   to meet the minimum-relevance threshold.                     But the

14   relevance threshold, as this Court has recognized in the

15   Furnco v. Waters case and the Huddlestone case, this is

16   a broad threshold that allows evidence in.                     And then we

17   look at the other parts of Article IV of the Federal

18   Rules of Evidence to see whether it may be excluded --

19                 JUSTICE ALITO:         How do you articulate the

20   rule that separates these situations?

21                 MR. GARRE:      Well, I would point to several

22   criteria, Justice Scalia, in determining relevance.

23   First, whether you're dealing with same alleged -- same

24   kind of alleged discrimination and a common catalyst;

25   second, whether the proffered witnesses are working in


                                        24

 1   the same corporate vicinity; third, whether they are

 2   alleging discrimination in the same time frame; four,

 3   whether they are alleging a pattern or practice of

 4   discrimination.

 5               JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, that's the relevant

 6   factors, but what do you look at the factors to

 7   determine -- what's the test for determining whether

 8   they are sufficient?

 9               MR. GARRE:        Well, you would look at the

10   proffered evidence.      For example, in this case you have

11   evidence that all of the proffered witnesses were

12   terminated under the same companywide reduction in

13   force.   You've got a common catalyst.

14               In this case, you've got employees who

15   worked in the same geographic vicinity, the headquarters

16   of Sprint, the same office complex or at least the same

17   vicinity.   You've got witnesses who were terminated on

18   the same day --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why is that relevant -- the

20   same vicinity?    You're -- you're --

21               MR. GARRE:        I think it is more likely --

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Opposing counsel has said

23   they are -- they are three supervisors up.               What does

24   the same vicinity have anything to do with this?

25               MR. GARRE:        Where you have supervisors in

 1   the same division, in the same vicinity, carrying out

 2   the same plan, providing the same distinct explanations

 3   in similar circumstances, a reasonable juror might infer

 4   that plaintiff's own --

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Even if those supervisors

 6   RIF'd two thousands employees, and only three made this

 7   complaint?

 8                MR. GARRE:      Yes, with respect to the minimum

 9   threshold of relevance.        Keep in mind, once --

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           No matter how many

11   employees were RIF'd, only three supervisors --

12   hypothetical case, three supervisors.                   No many how many

13   employees were RIF'd, the three is sufficient so that

14   these witnesses could testify?

15                MR. GARRE:      Well, I think if you're talking

16   about pattern of practice, maybe doesn't -- certainly as

17   a matter of law that's not a -- going to prove a pattern

18   of practice, and the employer can make that argument to

19   the district judge, to the jury, and that evidence could

20   be limited or excluded.        If you have got, for example, a

21   -- a proffered witness who's complaining that

22   supervisors in the same complex used the same

23   distinctive explanation that my supervisor gave me --

24   for example, in this case, several of the witnesses were

25   going to testify that their supervisors told them they

 1   were being -- they were removed because their positions

 2   were being eliminated, and then they later found out

 3   that younger persons assumed their jobs.

 4                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So take it in this case,

 5   and in all cases, the plaintiff has the burden of laying

 6   the foundation for this evidence; is that not correct?

 7                 MR. GARRE:      The plaintiff has --

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And you say the foundation

 9   is satisfied if they were the same supervisors in the

10   same division, I thought.

11                 MR. GARRE:      I --

12                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You want us to write that

13   in a case as a rule?

14                 MR. GARRE:      The plaintiffs --

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Without reference to how

16   many employees were involved?

17                 MR. GARRE:      The plaintiff has the burden of

18   showing that the evidence is relevant, Justice Kennedy.

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I think you said in your

20   brief that the plaintiff does not have to lay a

21   foundation.    And that's the difference between you, I

22   thought -- with respect to Justice Kennedy's question.

23   Your brief takes the position that it is not necessary

24   to lay a foundation in order to introduce

25   other-supervisor evidence.

 1               MR. GARRE:         That's correct, and that's why

 2   as I said the plaintiff has to show that the evidence is

 3   relevant, that it has some tendency to make a fact or

 4   consequence more likely.

 5               This Court in the Huddlestone

 6   case confronted --

 7               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, one -- one would have

 8   some -- some tendency --

 9               MR. GARRE:         And Justice Scalia --

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:              What about one instead of

11   three?   Would that have some tendency?                   I guess it

12   would.

13               MR. GARRE:         It might.           And that probably

14   would be a strong candidate for exclusion under 403.                    In

15   the Furnco case --

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Why, by the way, do you

17   think this was excluded under -- under 401 rather than

18   403?

19               MR. GARRE:         Well, we -- we acknowledge that

20   the record isn't precisely clear on that.                    We think that

21   --

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, then why should it be

23   assumed it was done properly rather than improperly?

24               MR. GARRE:         Largely because of what was said

25   in the order, and because of the way it was briefed.

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            What was said in the order?

 2   I see nothing in the order that indicates it is under

 3   401.

 4                 MR. GARRE:       Well, it doesn't say 401, but

 5   the reason why the evidence can't come in is because the

 6   -- the proffered witnesses didn't have the same

 7   supervisor.    The order is on page 24.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But --

 9                 MR. GARRE:       What the court excluded is any

10   evidence of the pattern --

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's very relevant to the

12   403 determination.

13                 MR. GARRE:       It's relevant, but not it's

14   certainly not determinative, and we think in a case like

15   this, where this kind of evidence is the critical

16   evidence for the trial -- in the case --

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Picky, picky, picky on the

18   trial court.    I must say.

19                 MR. GARRE:       Yeah --

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            It seems to me this order

21   should be -- should be given -- it should be treated as

22   if, it could be sustained, it should be sustained.

23                 MR. GARRE:       With respect, Justice Scalia, in

24   this case, this proffered evidence was the crux of the

25   trial, the critical issue.            It came up not only in the


                                         29

 1   context of the motion in limine, it came up in the

 2   context of the motion for a new trial.                  And if you look

 3   at what the district court said in denying a motion for

 4   a new trial, she said again -- and this is on page 436

 5   of the JA -- she says, "none of the proffered evidence

 6   makes it more likely that the decisionmakers in this

 7   case discriminated against the plaintiff."

 8              That's relevance language, and you're quite

 9   right --

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  The determination of

11   the relevance of the "me, too" evidence -- and I assume

12   also the 403 status -- needs to be made at the motion in

13   limine stage, or is it a question for the jury?

14              MR. GARRE:        Well, the district court serves

15   as a gateway.   District courts have tremendous

16   discretion under the Federal rules to determine whether

17   or not evidence is relevant, and whether or not it

18   should be excluded under 403.             So that determination is

19   made by the district court.

20              In some cases, as happened in the

21   Huddlestone case -- that was a 404(d) case -- the court

22   acknowledged in some cases the evidence may go in and

23   then the jury may instruct that that evidence is

24   allowed.

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So if it's -- if on


                                       30
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the "me, too" evidence it's a "he said/she said" type of

 2   case, does that get admitted to the jury?                      Or is that

 3   excluded at the motion in limine stage?

 4                 MR. GARRE:      Well, if you're pointing to

 5   other acts of discrimination by other supervisors that

 6   are relevant, then that would be allowed in, and the

 7   employer would come in and present their counter

 8   evidence --

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, they're only

10   -- it is only relevant, of course, if it is true; and if

11   the company denies that the "me, too" episode even took

12   place, don't you have to have a separate trial on that

13   before you can determine whether it's even admissible?

14                 MR. GARRE:      In our system we put that

15   evidence before a jury.         If it is relevant under the

16   Federal rules, it is admissible.                We put before a jury

17   --

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, I get back to

19   my -- the predicate to my question.                      It's only relevant

20   if it happened.

21                 MR. GARRE:      And --

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And it seems to me

23   we've had a lot of discussion whether it is relevant if

24   it happened, but we don't know how we determine whether

25   it happened or not.

 1               MR. GARRE:       In the Furnco case, the Court

 2   said that -- that the evidence doesn't have to

 3   conclusively demonstrate the fact.                 It simply has to be

 4   relevant.   We put relevant evidence before juries, we

 5   instruct them on the consideration of that evidence,

 6   permit the defendants to put that evidence into context,

 7   and then we ask juries to draw a conclusion --

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So an allegation --

 9   an allegation of discrimination in a "me, too" context

10   is automatically relevant?

11               MR. GARRE:       No.       I think you'd look at it

12   under the relevance threshold, and I think you'd look at

13   it under 403.   403 is going to exclude a lot of this

14   evidence.   It is going to exclude the barely evidence,

15   the barely relevant evidence.             But it -- we would expect

16   a trial court in this kind of situation to make some

17   kind of findings as to why this evidence is excludable,

18   and we would expect the court of appeals not to

19   undertake a de novo 403 balancing in its own instance.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Garre, do I

21   understand correctly that the reason the Tenth Circuit

22   thought that the district court was ruling under 401,

23   making a relevance determination, was that the court of

24   appeals had a precedent in the area of employee

25   discipline, and the Tenth Circuit said well, the


                                       32
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   district court was following that precedent, but that

 2   precedent doesn't apply in this situation.                    So that's

 3   why the court of appeals, as I understand it, read the

 4   district court as just applying an absolute ban.

 5                MR. GARRE:       That's correct, and that's the

 6   way this case was litigated all the way until to the

 7   reply brief in this case.           If there are no further

 8   questions?

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

10   Mr. Garre.

12                ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS E. EGAN

13                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14                MR. EGAN:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

15   please the Court:

16                If we'll turn to 3a in the white book, the

17   court of appeals properly understood that this was a

18   blanket order based on only one fact.                    If you weren't

19   supervised by Paul Reddick, it was not admissible.                    At

20   page 2a, the court said prior to trial, Sprint filed a

21   motion in limine seeking to exclude among other things

22   any evidence of Sprint's alleged discriminatory

23   treatment of other employees.              Relying exclusively on

24   Aramburu, Sprint argued that any reference to alleged

25   discrimination by any supervisor other than Reddick --

 1   it was irrelevant.

 2                 Throughout -- and let me mention here, Your

 3   Honor, that the order of things was not as Mr. Cane got

 4   it.     He said the order was grounded on an offer of

 5   proof.

 6                 If I may address the chronology, on December

 7   15, 2004, Sprint filed its motion saying that if -- it

 8   is not the same supervisor, it doesn't come in.                   There's

 9   no mention, ever, about the facts of the proffer.

10   Never.    It never came up below.              We --

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel, what if you

12   have a situation that's been referred to earlier, where

13   you have four other supervisors that are presented as

14   "me, too" evidence.       They are in the Los Angeles office.

15   The defendant's supervisor is in the Fresno office.                   Is

16   that evidence relevant?

17                 MR. EGAN:      It depends what the evidence is

18   and what it is tied to, Your Honor.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It is just that they

20   -- they are alleged to have fired people for an

21   impermissible basis under the age discrimination act as

22   well.

23                 MR. EGAN:      In your hypothetical was it was

24   during the same common employer initiated action, such

25   as a reduction in force?

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 All right, let's

 2   take it and say yes.

 3                 MR. EGAN:      Okay.        What the court of appeals

 4   noted here was that in this case it makes a difference

 5   that we're talking about a common employer-initiated

 6   event.   We're not talking about --

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, but doesn't

 8   that beg the question?         We don't know.             This isn't a

 9   pattern and practice case.            You don't have evidence of a

10   company-wide policy of discrimination.                    Take my

11   hypothetical.     There are just four people who are

12   alleged to harbor age-based bias, and they -- in the Los

13   Angeles office.     No connection to the Fresno supervisor

14   at all, other than that they work for the same company.

15   Is that enough for relevance?

16                 MR. EGAN:      If there is no connection, it

17   might not be, Your Honor.

18                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It might not be

19   relevant.

20                 MR. EGAN:      Might not be relevant.                 Let me

21   say that --

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But you assert that the

23   mere fact that it is pursuant to the same reduction in

24   force is enough of a connection.

25                 MR. EGAN:      Yes, Your Honor, because the

 1   standard arises out of Article IV, which is entitled

 2   "Relevancy and Its Limits."             There are no categorical

 3   bars within Article IV except when -- Congress and the

 4   Court have mentioned, 401 has no categorical bar.                      The

 5   test is, does a fact have -- if evidence has any

 6   tendency to make a fact of consequence more likely than

 7   without it?    So it depends.           In rule 401, there is no

 8   categorical bar.    In Article IV, if there are areas

 9   where there are problems, we list them.                      407, 411 -- no

10   mention of liability insurance.               410.

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                404.

12                 MR. EGAN:     404(b), Your Honor.                 And in this

13   case the lower courts had used 404.                      We did not address

14   it.   I don't think anybody really did in a brief, other

15   than the Government mentioned the Huddlestone case.                      The

16   Huddlestone case is important because it said that there

17   is no preliminary determination as to whether or not

18   something is relevant.        What you do is the court looks

19   at all the evidence.       The evidence that Ellen Mendelsohn

20   wanted to offer has connections to it.

21                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Well suppose you're -- if

22   you're right on 401 and 402, would -- do we not still

23   have to go on and decide whether it would have been a

24   abuse of discretion for the trial judge to exclude this

25   under 403?

 1               MR. EGAN:        Your Honor, I believe that --

 2               JUSTICE ALITO:            If we find that it would not

 3   have been abuse of discretion, then how could we affirm

 4   the Tenth Circuit?

 5               MR. EGAN:        Your Honor, I believe that what

 6   you have to do is look at what the court did, because

 7   what the court did was it ruled on what they presented,

 8   which was not anything having to do with the weight of

 9   the evidence, confusion of issues.                   There is nothing to

10   indicate.   And the court of appeals quoted its own law

11   that says we are in no position to speculate.                  As a

12   superintending court, they ruled only one thing -- a

13   categorical bar of evidence that was before it, and they

14   said that's wrong.      You followed the wrong case law.

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But I thought they said

16   that it should be admitted.              I thought they went to the

17   opposite extreme.

18               MR. EGAN:        I'm not sure that they went to

19   that extreme.   Their language is this, Your Honor:                   They

20   say, "Based on what we see" -- and they have the proffer

21   in front of them at that time, and they also have the

22   full transcript, which hasn't been talked about -- how

23   Ellen Mendelsohn's case and her theory tied into these

24   people.

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               How did they?

 1                 MR. EGAN:      Your Honor, in several different

 2   ways.   Barred evidence of culture.                  We had evidence of

 3   culture from open remarks, that someone needs to be

 4   "blessed with lots of runway ahead of them" in order to

 5   get a good rating.      Bonnie Hoopes said being told she

 6   was too old for the job right after she received that

 7   memo, being told openly and repeatedly, "I'm too old for

 8   the job."     If there are too many --

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Are these episodes

10   that were necessarily communicated to the supervisor at

11   issue here?

12                 MR. EGAN:      No, Your Honor, but this is on

13   the question of culture.

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You don't make the

15   -- you don't suggest that he was even aware of these

16   other anecdotes.

17                 MR. EGAN:      We do not suggest, but what we

18   say is that what was going on in the culture -- you've

19   got a supervisor like Ted Stock, openly saying, "I can't

20   wait for RIF's, so that I can get rid of the older

21   people in my department."            That supervisor's conclusion

22   is that it's okay.

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But you're conceding

24   that we don't even know that that comment was

25   communicated in any way to the supervisor at issue here.

 1   He may not have been aware of it.                  The supervisor -- he

 2   may have been in Fresno and that supervisor in Los

 3   Angeles.

 4              MR. EGAN:         Your Honor, what way do know is

 5   that they attended the same meetings, the key leadership

 6   meetings, that took place in January 2002 that covered

 7   something very important to our case -- the

 8   establishment of a forced ranking system and also a

 9   discussion of the RIF's that are ongoing and continuing.

10   They're at the same meeting.              It's after this meeting,

11   where Jack Welch is presented to the group, that they

12   come out with the philosophy of forced --

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I assume there's no

14   dispute over any direct evidence you have that the

15   supervisor was being guided by a company policy or

16   statement or the RIF program that was discriminatory.

17   The issue here is whether or not you can bring in

18   testimony that -- which has no demonstrated connection

19   to the supervisor.

20              MR. EGAN:         Your Honor, the rules of evidence

21   simply talk in terms of "not demonstrate a connection."

22   It doesn't exist.     If we look at the rules of evidence,

23   the standard -- and the standard we believe applies here

24   -- is a two-step methodology.               It would be, number one,

25   what is the party -- the thing the party is trying to

 1   prove, such as culture -- is that a subsidiary fact of

 2   consequence?

 3                 Something that's been missed in the

 4   Petitioner's position and even in the district court, is

 5   that Rule 401 says that you have three levels of

 6   evidence.     The ultimate issue, and the Petitioner has

 7   always said this doesn't prove that Reddick

 8   discriminated against Mendelsohn.                  That's the ultimate

 9   issue.     We have many intermediary facts to which the

10   evidence relates.     They are facts of consequence, and

11   the evidence had a tendency to show these facts of

12   consequence.    So that --

13                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            May I ask you to elaborate

14   on that somewhat?

15                 MR. EGAN:      Yes, Your Honor.

16                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            I went through to kind of

17   pin down what the facts of consequence were.                 I went

18   through the offer of proof.              I don't have my notes in

19   front of me, but I think my recollection is right on

20   this.    It struck me that the admissible evidence that

21   was indicated by the offer of proof boils down basically

22   to this:    There were three employees who would testify

23   that, following their dismissal, some or all of their

24   work was done by a younger person.

25                 MR. EGAN:      Yes, sir.

 1                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            There was one employee who

 2   would testify that he received -- she saw a spreadsheet

 3   in front of one supervisor that indicated age.

 4                 There was one employee who would testify

 5   that her immediate supervisor had made

 6   age-discriminatory remarks.

 7                 And another employee would testify that her

 8   supervisor's boss had made age-discriminatory remarks.

 9                 Now, basically, out of this company of

10   70,000, that seems to be the sum total of the -- the

11   kind of circumstantial evidence of culture that you

12   presented in the offer of proof.

13                 Am I selling your offer of proof short here?

14                 MR. EGAN:       No, you are not, Your Honor.             The

15   -- you have hit it precisely.               And we believe that with

16   culture, it's the openness of what's going on.                   The

17   openness.     The number of events goes to weight.                All the

18   weaknesses and frailties of the evidence go to weight.

19   And we never got to that portion of determining the

20   weight of the evidence.           The weight --

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.       So what should

22   we do then?     Sorry.     Go ahead and conclude.            But I want

23   to ask this after you finish answering Justice Souter.

24                 MR. EGAN:       Your Honor, we believe that --

 1   Justice Souter.

 2              MR. EGAN:         Thank you, Your Honor.            The --

 3   this ties in, in several different ways, if I can take

 4   them all, to culture, to modus operandi, and this

 5   wouldn't require discriminatory conduct.                  For instance,

 6   the story line that jobs have been abolished and given

 7   to youngers.   That's where that would be modus operandi.

 8   The fact that the office shadow rating system -- they're

 9   under the same rating system that's not supposed to

10   apply to employees like Ellen Mendelsohn and those who

11   we are presenting, but it was --

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:               What if even one of these

13   three had existed?      Only one these three?

14              MR. EGAN:         One of these three what, Your

15   Honor?

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:               One of these three other

17   employees who complained about age discrimination.

18   Would that have the same tendency to show it?

19              MR. EGAN:         It depends what it's offered for

20   because relevance does --

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:               You think one is enough?

22              MR. EGAN:         If it's culture --

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Yes.

 1   happens -- but under --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:             No, I'm not talking about

 3   somebody up at the top.          I'm talking about somebody on

 4   the same level as the supervisor that you're concerned

 5   with.   One other supervisor in this company of 70,000

 6   has -- is accused of having made age-discriminatory

 7   decisions.

 8                MR. EGAN:       Well, if they're just accused,

 9   no, Your Honor.     The assumption has to be --

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, all of these are just

11   accused.   We have -- none of this has been proven.

12                MR. EGAN:       Your Honor, we have not even

13   addressed at any time the content of the decision -- I

14   mean the content of the testimony.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:             So --

16                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Let's assume the testimony

17   at least shows these points that you and I agreed the

18   offer of proof offers to prove.

19                They're going to be met -- I think it's

20   reasonable to suppose, they're going to be met by

21   counter-evidence.

22                MR. EGAN:       Yes, Your Honor.

23                JUSTICE SOUTER:             We're going to have

24   litigation on these points, and they're going to take --

25   in effect, become subsidiary chapters in this trial.

 1   And what concerns me, I guess, is that, at the end of

 2   the day, it's -- it strikes me as though there is reason

 3   to believe that the proof itself is not going to be

 4   anything close to overwhelming.               We will have had a

 5   potentially confusing trial on this subsidiary

 6   third-party evidence.       And we seem to be very close, if

 7   we have not gotten over the line, of the subsidiary

 8   evidence, in effect, being substantially misleading or

 9   prejudicial.    And -- and basically I'm raising a

10   question of weight under 403.

11               What's your response to that?

12               MR. EGAN:       My response, because I'm hearing

13   you talk about the mini-trial issues, first of all, as

14   you know, it will not happen here.                  We had a pretrial

15   January 29, 2007, after -- before Sprint had filed its

16   petition for cert, in which we discussed will this be a

17   longer trial.   One and a half, maybe two days.                   The fact

18   of mini-trials, Your Honor, it just doesn't happen that

19   often.   You can try joinder cases.                 I've tried joinder

20   cases with eight plaintiffs, and you handle that with

21   instructions.   The answer isn't to keep out possibly

22   probative evidence; the answer is to let --

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But what --

24               MR. EGAN:       -- to let Sprint put on

25   counter-evidence --

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What happens in this

 2   case?   Let's say there are five "me, too" situations

 3   presented, and the court make a determination in each

 4   one, and the jury finds for the plaintiff.                   And then

 5   it's appealed, and the argument on appeal is, well, in

 6   three of those five cases there wasn't age

 7   discrimination and here's why.                And that evidence is --

 8   well then the court of appeals agrees, yes, those three

 9   cases shouldn't have been admitted.

10                 Is that reversible error?

11                 MR. EGAN:      Your Honor, I think that what you

12   handle that with is limiting instructions.                   It would be

13   the evidence of acts or statements of anyone else that

14   you've heard are relevant only to the intent of Paul

15   Reddick.     Nobody would contend that Bonnie Hoopes was --

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No, under my

17   hypothetical, in the three cases, the court of appeals,

18   let's say, determines that the alleged statements did

19   not occur.     That's the argument.              And this was admitted

20   to the jury in three of the five cases, and those

21   statements did not occur.

22                 MR. EGAN:      At least that's part of our

23   adversary system, Your Honor, where we have both sides

24   presenting and countering.            The super- --

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Five gets you cases

 4   when the court of appeals determines that three did not

 5   occur?

 6                MR. EGAN:     If it's determined under your

 7   hypothetical --

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, that's exactly what's

 9   sort of bothering me.      You are the trial lawyer.

10                MR. EGAN:     Yes, Your Honor.

11                JUSTICE BREYER:           And I'm not.           And what's

12   worrying me most about this is I will say something that

13   will muck up quite a lot of trials.                     So, therefore, the

14   sentence that jumps out the page here was where the

15   court of appeals says that Rule 403's exclusion is an

16   extraordinary remedy that should be sparingly -- used

17   sparingly.

18                Is that a general rule?

19                Because my impression was -- and this is why

20   I asked you as a trial lawyer -- is that if you take 401

21   and 402 and read them literally, we'll have trials that

22   last a thousand years.

23                And, really, the way a trial judge keeps the

24   trial under control is to say:              Well, maybe there is

25   some slight tendency here to make a fact more likely

 1   than not; but, even if that's so, this is a waste of

 2   time.

 3              And I thought that kind of decision is what

 4   trial judges are there to make.

 5              MR. EGAN:       Yes, Your Honor.

 6              JUSTICE BREYER:             And, therefore, I thought

 7   this court of appeals is trying to second-guess that

 8   trial court judge unless that trial court judge is

 9   making an absolute rule, which he may have been.

10              But as soon as we get into this case, I

11   thought we might do quite a lot of harm by trying to let

12   the court of appeals second-guess trial courts on this

13   kind of thing.

14              Now, I would appreciate your response to

15   that.

16              MR. EGAN:       Yes, Your Honor.             That requires,

17   under 403 requires, a balancing.               And I think you must

18   have, contrary to what -- all due respect -- Justice

19   Scalia suggested, Rule 403 is the only rule that

20   expressly says "substantially outweighs."                We have no

21   evidence here --

22              JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, then, how are we

23   going to -- I'm not arguing about what it says so much

24   as I'm arguing about who has the right between the court

25   of appeals and the trial court to decide?

 1               MR. EGAN:      Your Honor --

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:            And all I'm worried

 3   about -- and you tell me if that's the law in the Tenth

 4   Circuit or elsewhere.      I was an appeals court judge for

 5   a quite a while.   And I think we have never -- not

 6   "never," but hardly ever second-guessed a trial judge on

 7   that kind of question.

 8               MR. EGAN:      Yes, Your Honor.

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:            Now, you tell me if the

10   rules are different in the Tenth Circuit?                    Do they out

11   there second-guess trial judges on this kind of question

12   all the time?

13               MR. EGAN:      No, Your Honor.

14               JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.          If they don't

15   normally, why should they here?              If this kind of rule is

16   -- as you say, this kind of evidence is like any other

17   evidence, any other evidence at all.                    It may be

18   relevant, or it may not be.            It depends on the case.             A

19   waste of time or not depends on the case.

20               MR. EGAN:      Yes, Your Honor.                Is that a

21   problem, and why is it an evidentiary exclusion before

22   trial?

23               JUSTICE BREYER:            I got your blanket part.            I

24   got that.

25               MR. EGAN:      And so once you are there, we

 1   have no quarrel if the Tenth Circuit -- and I think the

 2   Tenth Circuit leaves room for sending it back, remand

 3   it, and then the court could still make rulings, as the

 4   Tenth Circuit said, on cumulative nature of evidence,

 5   hearsay objections.      These haven't been addressed.

 6                Sprint has been --

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:            Oh, no, not -- I'm

 8   saying -- well, you got my point, but you're just not

 9   answering my question.

10                MR. EGAN:      I am sorry, Your Honor.             I'm not

11   understanding --

12                JUSTICE BREYER:            And I don't want to repeat

13   it.    And I'm not talking about whether it is hearsay or

14   not.   I'm not talking -- I'm talking about whether it

15   comes in 401, 402, 403.         That's the issue.

16                MR. EGAN:      Yes, Your Honor.             Our -- we

17   believe that it does.       Because the evidence has a

18   tendency to make more probable than without the evidence

19   facts of consequence, on culture, on impeachment, on

20   pattern, on pretext.

21                That's our standard.               We have no indication

22   here that the judge ever engaged in a balancing -- none.

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Egan, what if I think

24   that, had he engaged in a balancing, it would have been

25   an abuse of discretion not to exclude it?                  What if I

 1   think that?

 2                 Then what happens with this case?

 3                 MR. EGAN:     If you believe that it is so

 4   clear, then, of course, that would be -- if you believe

 5   that it is so clear that it is an abuse of discretion

 6   not to exclude it, then that is the prerogative of the

 7   Court to do.    But it must be done under this standard,

 8   Your Honor; that is, the judge looks at the evidence and

 9   asks the question like he would for submissibility.

10                 What would a reasonable jury say, and is

11   there room for disagreement?

12                 If you have Federal judges, for instance,

13   who disagree on admissibility --

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           No, but I am worried about

15   having five trials -- you know, one trial turning into

16   six trials.    I mean those are the factors that I am

17   concerned about.

18                 MR. EGAN:     I understand, Your Honor.         And --

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yes.

20                 MR. EGAN:     But let me just say this, if I

21   might.   Discrimination cases are important.             In the

22   McKennon case Justice Kennedy wrote for the unanimous

23   Court in saying every time a single plaintiff advances

24   the cause and prevails in a discrimination case, it

25   serves the national public purpose.

 1                 So it's important.             And the idea of there

 2   being cases on this, the court house doors should be

 3   open.    The decision may be -- may be --

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What if I assume

 5   your rule cuts the other way?

 6                 Let's say in this company of 70,000 or

 7   17,000, or whatever it is, there are a thousand

 8   supervisors.    Four or five are alleged to have

 9   discriminated on the basis of age.

10                 I assume the company can call the other 995

11   and say:    Are there any allegations against you?                  Did

12   you fire people?    And did you in some cases keep the

13   oldest one?

14                 And then they have to -- you know, they say

15   yes.    So the, "me, too" evidence works both ways, right?

16                 MR. EGAN:     Absolutely.             And that is

17   important, because in your Court, cases and

18   jurisprudence --

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So if you are

20   talking about culture, what is the culture of the

21   company if 995 supervisors don't supervise -- don't

22   discriminate in their decisions and 5 do?

23                 MR. EGAN:     Your Honor, the culture -- they

24   have the right to bring on evidence, but the trial court

25   retains the discretion.         And I hope this answers Justice


                                        51
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Breyer's question, also.           The court retains the

 2   discretion to keep out marginal evidence.

 3              JUSTICE ALITO:             Well, maybe, just as an

 4   example, you could take Mr. Borel and Mr. Hoopes and

 5   explain why their testimony should not have been

 6   excluded under 403?       As I read Trent, the only thing I

 7   have as to either one of them is that they were replaced

 8   by young women in their position.                  That's it as far as

 9   admissible evidence for either one.

10              Now, if you do that, the 403 balancing

11   there, why doesn't that lead to exclusion?

12              MR. EGAN:         Because John Borel's evidence

13   goes to pretext, Your Honor.              And pretext under the

14   Reeves case is something that is highly, highly

15   important,and highly important to the trial lawyer.                  His

16   pretext evidence is twofold.

17              He was going to get a job before he knew

18   that he was RIF'd.      He goes to apply for the job after

19   the RIF, and he is told:           Sorry, you've got a secret

20   adverse rating.

21              Now, mind you, the company says:                   We don't

22   use these ratings.

23              Now, in Ellen Mendelsohn's trial without

24   corroboration, she's isolated.                That's John Borel's

25   important testimony in this case.                  John Hoopes -- he's

 1   told by a vice president why can't you hire someone

 2   younger?   Why would you hire someone age 48, which

 3   indicates that at Sprint, it's something that is

 4   determined to be okay.        So that's --

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So if company can

 6   admit evidence to show the opposite of your "me, too"

 7   evidence by other supervisors and you say five shows the

 8   culture of discrimination, how many are they allowed to

 9   admit before -- to show the opposite culture?                     Certainly

10   more than five if they say this isn't representative.

11   You have to look at these 15 others.

12               MR. EGAN:       I can't pick a number, Mr. Chief

13   Justice.   And we're not saying that the five proves the

14   fact as you said of proving culture.                     But it is evidence

15   that is relevant to it.         A reasonable juror --

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Right.     There are

17   15, 30, or however many is equally relevant.

18               MR. EGAN:       Yes, Your Honor.

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             You said there was going

20   to be an agreement that this would be a trial or a day,

21   a day and a half.

22               MR. EGAN:       Yes, Your Honor.

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Was that before or after

24   the premise this testimony would not be admitted.

25               MR. EGAN:       That was after the premise that

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the testimony would not be admitted.                     But, Your Honor,

 2   this was after remand.

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You told it can be done in

 4   a day and a half.     Because these five were excluded.

 5                MR. EGAN:      No, Your Honor.                I'm sorry.       What

 6   happened here was the remand or the reversal came down.

 7   We have a pretrial because we're going back to trial.

 8   We have a trial on January 29, 2007.                     Excuse me.     A

 9   pretrial, and at that trial the court asked well, will

10   this be a long trial, four weeks, five weeks?                    We say if

11   you open up discovery, if they want to bring people to

12   refute -- Sprint said no.

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I don't think that has any

14   bearing on the ruling that the trial judge made that's

15   under review in the Court of Appeals for the Tenth

16   Circuit and that we're looking at here.

17                MR. EGAN:      Well, Your Honor, it goes to

18   whether or not saying that there's going to be a lengthy

19   trial it is some evidence as you look at what the actual

20   experience is -- look at the cases cited by the

21   defendant.   We cited them in our brief.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:            They may have just thought

23   the game isn't worth the candle.                Just thought we've

24   sunk so much money into this case by now and it's just

25   not worth the risk.

 1              MR. EGAN:       That's fine, Your Honor.               But

 2   they should be not take out the legs from the plaintiffs

 3   to try to prove their case.

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:             And that's the problem that

 5   concerns me.   It is not the question of whether the

 6   trial is going to last for three weeks.                 It is a

 7   question at the prospect that the trial will last for

 8   three weeks and they will have to go out and find other

 9   people in their organization and depose them and bring

10   them in to show them it is not the culture.                They just

11   say it is not worth the candle.              Just settle the case

12   and get out.   All of these things are relevant to how

13   you rule on 403 it seems to me.

14              MR. EGAN:       Your Honor, we're simply asking

15   for balance, because other supervisors --

16              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Doesn't that get to the

17   point, though, hasn't the last hour of questioning from

18   the court shown that what we really ought to take place

19   here is a remand to the trial court for a 403 balance?

20              MR. EGAN:       Yes, Your Honor.

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Okay.

22              MR. EGAN:       If I might offer some concluding

23   thoughts because my time is running down.                The district

24   court erred in categorically barring all other

25   supervisor evidence.      It was a categorical bar.               When


                                       55

 1   you get into the chronology of what happened, you will

 2   see no indication otherwise.             Neither Rule 401 nor Rule

 3   403 support such a blanket prohibition.                  As I mentioned

 4   under rule 401 --

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So you think the

 6   court of appeals erred as well in ruling that the

 7   evidence was admissible?          Because as I understand your

 8   answer to Justice Souter, it is that there should be a

 9   403 evaluation and the court of appeals didn't allow the

10   district court to undertake that.

11               MR. EGAN:       Your Honor, I think that what the

12   -- my reading of the Tenth Circuit, for what it's worth,

13   is that they were looking at the exclusionary order

14   based on the wrong legal rule and said, we are going to

15   reverse that.    And that we see nothing that indicates

16   that the evidence is overly prejudicial, since that's

17   basically all that they were looking at.

18               There could be, and we assume there would

19   be, new motions filed upon remand, in which case we'll

20   answer anything going to the merits because we've never

21   been allowed to talk about the content of the testimony

22   itself.   Will it be cumulative?              Is it overly

23   prejudicial?    We've got --

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  And if on the remand

25   that you conceded is necessary, that will take place in

 1   the context of a motion in limine and not in the context

 2   of a new trial?

 3               MR. EGAN:       It should be in the context of

 4   going back and being remanded, for the court maybe to

 5   make determination, but our position is in the context

 6   of a new trial the court can address any new motion that

 7   hasn't been made.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So you think a new

 9   trial is required for the district court to make the 403

10   determination?

11               MR. EGAN:       I think that you have to get back

12   before the district court procedurally.

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Has this Court said that

14   403 determinations must always be made on the record?

15               MR. EGAN:       No, Your Honor, you haven't said

16   that they should be on the record, but we're not asking

17   for that.   We're asking for some indication of what --

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, I thought that's

19   precisely what you are saying, that that there is no

20   balancing shown, that he didn't do the balance.

21               MR. EGAN:       Well, Your Honor, there should --

22   we believe, if -- as you write the opinion, there should

23   be -- the court should show there work.                  You know, it's

24   -- as I was taught in grade school, you your work so

25   that we know what you did rule on.                  They should follow

 1   the rules as well.

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:               It seems very strange to me

 3   that we -- there's been -- the case went to the jury

 4   without the evidence you wanted to get in.                   The jury

 5   found for the company.         Now if the -- if the trial court

 6   is going to properly exclude the evidence under 403, we

 7   should then have the very same trial with a new jury?

 8   That doesn't seem proper.

 9              MR. EGAN:         No, Your Honor, if may I answer

10   that question.

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Yes.

12              MR. EGAN:         The only thing that can't happen

13   on remand --     I want to make sure this is clear -- is

14   that the judge can't exclude on the same basis that

15   caused the problem the first time; that is, well, it is

16   not Reddick; it's excluded.              Not Reddick, it's excluded.

17   Any other factors would be open.

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, Mr. Egan.

19              MR. EGAN:         Thank you.

22              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL W. CANE, JR.,

23                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

24              MR. CANE:         Let me begin by addressing

25   Justice Kennedy's question about the Rule 403 issue.                      I

 1   think there are two reasons why no remand is necessary.

 2   The first, as Justice Scalia said, is that you assume

 3   that the order is correct.            You don't assume that it's

 4   incorrect.     The second --

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But the -- how can we

 6   make that assumption when the Tenth Circuit says we know

 7   why this district judge ruled as he or she did?                       We had

 8   a precedent.     It -- it dealt with employee discipline.

 9   We said, categorically, it's got to be the same

10   supervisor; otherwise it's not relevant.

11                The district judge was simply applying that

12   case to this case.

13                MR. CANE:       Neither --

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              So it wasn't any 403

15   question.    It was this doesn't some in.

16                MR. CANE:       Neither that case nor this case

17   involved any attempt to show that foundation, the

18   linkage between these other persons, these other alleged

19   bad actors, and the decision here.

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But that's not -- the

21   point is that the Tenth Circuit said this judge made an

22   absolute rule:    It doesn't come in.                     We know why he made

23   an absolute rule; that was our precedent.

24                MR. CANE:       Well, I think the Tenth Circuit

25   -- it -- it applied the incorrect presumption.                       It


                                         59

 1   should have applied the presumption that an evidentiary

 2   ruling is correct rather than incorrect.

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:            How could ut have been?

 4   What about the date problem he just mentioned?             You said

 5   -- your opponent said that when you filed this motion in

 6   limine on December 15, 2004, by that time, there hadn't

 7   been any fact-specific things at all brought up in the

 8   trial that were relevant to this, and there's certainly

 9   none in the notion that I could see.

10              MR. CANE:      Well, that always will be true in

11   the case of a motion in limine.             But the motion in

12   limine anticipated the specific evidence that had

13   emerged in discovery --

14              JUSTICE BREYER:            But where does it say?      I

15   can't find in the motion, although there is something on

16   disparate impact, anything that says well, you see, I

17   don't know about the general mine run of cases, but in

18   this particular case, it's not sufficiently material, it

19   is a waste -- it's not -- it is a waste of time.                Now, I

20   just can't find that.

21              MR. CANE:      I don't think district judges can

22   be expected to, you know, write opinions that are -- to

23   be affirmed to be worthy of publication in F. Supp.2d. I

24   think the district court considers the evidence thrown

25   at him or her, and in this case all --

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:             Did anyone argue that

 2   before December 15, 2004, that we don't know about the

 3   mine run of cases, but this case, in fact it's a waste

 4   of time?   Did anyone argue that before December 15,

 5   2004?

 6               MR. CANE:       That's the time when --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:             I'm asking yes or no; did

 8   they or didn't they?

 9               MR. CANE:       No.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:             Okay.

11               MR. CANE:       Because that's when the court

12   considered notions in limine.              The court was not setting

13   standards in anticipation of a trial until the trial.

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             You said there were two

15   points about 403.

16               MR. CANE:       Yes, the second is I agree with

17   Justice Alito's observation, or I think it was his

18   observation, that it would have been abuse -- an of

19   discretion to admit this evidence anyway; and so that

20   gets you easily by the 403 issue.                 I don't think you

21   need -- there's a lot of court of appeals cases that say

22   that where 403 factors are obvious, where they're

23   implicit, there's not any obligation on the court of

24   appeals' part -- or on the district court's part -- to

25   -- to set them forth and explicitly engage in

 1   rebalancing.

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Do you not think that

 3   there is an important value that the Tenth Circuit

 4   recognized in making it clear that there is no absolute

 5   bar?   If we just assume in favor of the district court,

 6   when we don't know that the district court didn't take

 7   it as an absolute rule, that -- this is a point of law

 8   that should be clarified for the benefit of district

 9   courts.    Either there's a categorical bar or there's

10   not.

11                MR. CANE:      I think that, absent some showing

12   of relationship of nexus, then the presumptive rule in

13   the run of cases should be that this evidence should not

14   be admitted.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:            You -- you don't want that

16   clarification to be done at the expense your client, I

17   take it?

18                (Laughter.)

19                MR. CANE:      Of course not.               Of course not.

20                Let me respond to a couple of the Solicitor

21   General's points.    The Solicitor General in his brief

22   said three things with which we agree:                    the plaintiff's

23   burden to lay foundation; anecdotes don't comprise --

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The -- the Government

25   said it was not necessary to lay a foundation.

 1   Mr. Garre confirmed that point.

 2              MR. CANE:      He did say that, Justice

 3   Ginsburg, but that's not what their brief says.

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, Mr. Cane.
