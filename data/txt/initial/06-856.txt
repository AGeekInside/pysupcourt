 7                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS

 8                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                 MR. STRIS:      Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10   and may it please the Court:

11                 Let me begin with the first question on

12   which this Court has granted certiorari.                     Sections

13   502(a)(2) and 409 of ERISA permit restoration of "any

14   losses to the plan."

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            What are the code numbers

16   of those?    I really get confused with you people who

17   work with ERISA all the time -- can refer, you know

18   Section 3 of ERISA.      I use the code.                 What -- what code

19   sections are you talking about?

20                 MR. STRIS:      I never thought the day would

21   come, Justice Scalia, when I was described as working

22   with ERISA all of the time, but I will tell you the code

23   provision.    The code provision is -- for 502(a)(2) of

24   ERISA -- is 29 U.S.C. 1132(a)(2).                 It's found on page

25   10a of the blue brief.        Section 409 of ERISA is 29


                                         3

 1   U.S.C. 1109, and I was quoting specifically from

 2   1109(a), and that is found on page 9a of the blue brief.

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Thank you.

 4              MR. STRIS:        Now, the statute plainly states

 5   that "any losses to the plan" may be recovered if they

 6   were caused by fiduciary breach.               Our position on the

 7   (a)(2) question is straightforward.                     The plain meaning

 8   of "any losses to the plan" includes any diminution in

 9   value of defined contribution plan assets, regardless of

10   the number of participants ultimately affected.

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But the plan itself

12   is nowhere in the record, is that right?

13              MR. STRIS:        Well, the summary plan

14   description was attached to the complaint.

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Right, the summary.

16   And I looked at the summary and saw nowhere the rules

17   about investment options, what you get to choose, how

18   often -- and for all we know, the plan might say you

19   have no choice about investment options, it's all going

20   to be invested in T-bills or whatever.

21              MR. STRIS:        Respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice,

22   that's not true.   I would point your attention to page

23   19a of the appendix to the brief in opposition.                    And

24   this is the page of the summary plan description that

25   makes clear that participants in the plan like Mr. LaRue

 1   will have the opportunity to direct their investments.

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But that wasn't in the

 3   record.

 4                 MR. STRIS:      It is in the record.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            It is in the record.

 6                 MR. STRIS:      Yes.        And to be clear, Justice

 7   Scalia --

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Where in the record

 9   is it?

10                 MR. STRIS:      It is page 19a of the --

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, that's in the

12   opposition to certiorari, and I don't believe that's in

13   the record.

14                 MR. STRIS:      It is in the record; it was

15   attached to the complaint that was filed by Mr. LaRue in

16   this case.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Oh, that's the

18   summary of the plan.

19                 MR. STRIS:      The summary plan description,

20   that's correct.    And as you know, Mr. Chief Justice, if

21   there is a conflict between the summary plan description

22   and the plan, the summary plan description governs; it's

23   a legitimate document.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                The summary on the

25   page you mentioned says that you will be able to -- you

 1   have certain investment choices are available to you,

 2   and that the administrator will provide you with

 3   information on what they are and how you can change it.

 4                 MR. STRIS:      That is correct.

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But we don't know

 6   those details, correct?

 7                 MR. STRIS:      That's true, but this case was

 8   decided at the pleading stage.               And so to be clear, we

 9   alleged that the right given to Mr. LaRue under the plan

10   was violated.    If true, then that would constitute a

11   fiduciary breach.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                It would also

13   presumably more obviously constitute a breach of the

14   plan, correct?

15                 MR. STRIS:      Yes, that's correct; and that is

16   a fiduciary breach.      Under 404 (a)(1)(D), failure to act

17   in accordance with the terms of the plan is a classic

18   example of breach of fiduciary duty.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Your position is

20   anything that is remediable, if that's a word, under

21   (a)(1) can also be pursued under (a)(2)?

22                 MR. STRIS:      No, that is not my position.              My

23   position --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Let me step back.

25   Do you agree that you could bring an action under (a)(1)


                                         6

 1   for this breach of the plan?

 2                 MR. STRIS:       I think that's far from clear,

 3   but what is clear is that we could not recover what we

 4   wanted under (a)(1).        (a)(1) only permits a lawsuit

 5   against the plan.     Here the plan doesn't have the funds

 6   that are relevant.

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Where does it say that

 8   (a)(1) is available only against the plan?

 9                 MR. STRIS:       The specific language of (a)(1)

10   doesn't state that.       It states that you can get benefits

11   due under the plan, or you can enforce your rights under

12   the plan.     I'm not aware of a single case, Justice

13   Ginsburg, where an (a)(1)(B) action has been permitted

14   to recover personally from a fiduciary.                   That is the

15   purpose of (a)(2), which specifically states that you

16   can personally recover from a fiduciary.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             That's fine, so why doesn't

18   he proceed first under (a)(1)(B), against the plan?

19                 MR. STRIS:       Well --

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Because the plan owes him

21   this money.     And if the plan turns around and says well,

22   you know the fiduciary didn't invest your funds the way

23   it was supposed to, the plan still owes him the money,

24   doesn't it?

25                 MR. STRIS:       I think the answer to that -- I


                                          7

 1   think there are two reasons why that's incorrect.                And

 2   the first reason is 502 (a)(2), unlike 502(a)(3), is not

 3   a catchall provision, so if he has a remedy under

 4   502(a)(2) --

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I'm talking about

 6   (a)(1)(B).

 7                MR. STRIS:      Right.         And it is -- there is

 8   nothing to suggest that that provision is mutually

 9   exclusive with another provision.                So my first response

10   to your question, Justice Scalia, is that even if he

11   could have proceeded under (a)(1)(B), there is nothing

12   to suggest that he had to, if he wanted to proceed under

13   the express terms of (a)(2).

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, there is -- there is

15   this to suggest that only -- only that manner of

16   proceeding preserves the structure of -- of the

17   legislation which is that you're supposed to first apply

18   to the plan and exhaust your remedies there before you

19   come into court; and interpreting it that way would

20   preserve that -- that exhaustion requirement.               You have

21   to apply to the plan first, and if you establish that

22   the plan owes you money, then it's a loss to the plan

23   and you can sue in court.

24                MR. STRIS:      Well, what I would say to that,

25   Justice Scalia, and is that this administrative


                                        8

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   exhaustion requirement that you're referring to is a

 2   judicial gloss on the statute.             I find it hard to

 3   believe that the express terms of (a)(2), which the

 4   plain language authorizes restoration to the plan of any

 5   losses to the plan for any breach of duty --

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Your approach, if

 7   can you go under (a)(2) -- you're right that we

 8   judicially have developed a number of glosses on (a)(1),

 9   including I think most importantly the Firestone

10   deference principle.     But if you're right that you can

11   go under (a)(2), then all of that work has been in vain.

12   You can avoid all the limitations on (a)(1) just by

13   saying we want the same relief under (a)(2).

14              MR. STRIS:       I would not agree with that

15   characterization because there are very few cases where

16   the specific conditions for (a)(2) are met.                You would

17   need to prove a loss to the plan.               In welfare plan

18   cases, for example, you would not be able to proceed

19   under (a)(2) because you would never be able to show

20   that the fiduciary breach caused a loss to the plan.

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You told me earlier

22   that any breach of the plan was a fiduciary duty.

23              MR. STRIS:       That's correct.

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Now you're -- the --

25   what is it -- the obverse or the converse of that you're


                                       9

 1   saying is not true.

 2               MR. STRIS:         No, that's not true.               There are

 3   two requirements for an (a)(2) action.                      One is that

 4   there be a fiduciary breach.              That's what you just spoke

 5   to when you referred to a breach of the term of the

 6   plan.   But there's a second important requirement which

 7   goes to the heart of why (a)(2) is what it is.                         There

 8   must be a loss to the plan.              This Court recognizes --

 9               JUSTICE ALITO:            Could I ask you whether the

10   (a)(2) argument would be available to you on remand even

11   if we agree with your interpretation of that provision?

12   Didn't Judge Wilkinson say pretty clearly that the

13   argument had been waived?            He said, "even if the

14   argument were not therefore waived."                      Doesn't that mean

15   that it was waived?

16               MR. STRIS:         I don't read the Fourth

17   Circuit's decision that way.              I read it as -- as dicta,

18   not an alternative holding.              And to be clear, the

19   Respondents concede that point on page 5 of their brief

20   in opposition, and I quote.              They state:          "After

21   suggesting this claim may have been waived" and then

22   they proceed.     So even Respondent agrees that it was

23   merely dicta --

24               JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, maybe -- maybe they've

25   waived the waiver, but Judge Wilkinson is a careful

 1   writer, and if you use the subjunctive there -- "even if

 2   the argument were not therefore waived" -- doesn't that

 3   mean it was in fact waived?

 4               MR. STRIS:       Not in my opinion, but that's an

 5   issue that the Fourth Circuit and the lower courts will

 6   need to resolve.   If they interpret their opinion as

 7   having held that, certainly we would be precluded.                   I

 8   don't think that that is what they held, and I think we

 9   have a very strong argument that we pled a 502(a)(2)

10   claim as required under the Federal rules.

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Let me come back to your

12   earlier point that the second requirement of (a)(2) --

13   it's actually a requirement of 1109 --

14               MR. STRIS:       That's correct.            Yes.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA: -- is not met.                 And that is

16   -- that is to -- to make good to such plan any losses to

17   the plan resulting from each such breach.                 In these

18   welfare plans, if you sue the plan, claiming some

19   welfare benefits that haven't been provided, wouldn't

20   the plan have to provide those benefits?

21               MR. STRIS:       Yes.       That is a classic action

22   under (a)(1)(B), Your Honor.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:            And that would be a loss to

24   the plan.

25               MR. STRIS:       No.       I don't agree with that

 1   characterization.    In a defined benefit plan of which a

 2   welfare plan is the classic example --

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Right.

 4              MR. STRIS:         -- there are no assets that you

 5   have an entitlement to as a beneficiary.

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:              I have an entitlement to

 7   certain -- certain welfare payments.

 8              MR. STRIS:         That's -- you have entitlement

 9   to a contractually provided benefit.                     So, if there is a

10   fiduciary breach in terms of the administrator stating,

11   "We're not going to give you this cancer treatment that

12   really was provided under plan" --

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Right.

14              MR. STRIS:         Or, "we're not going to give you

15   this drug" --

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Right.

17              MR. STRIS:         -- that breach doesn't cause any

18   diminution in value in plan assets.

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:              It does if you sue the plan

20   and require the plan to pay what the plan has committed

21   to pay, whereupon the plan would have a right of action

22   against the fiduciary, I assume, for the fiduciary's

23   failure to do what he was supposed to.

24              MR. STRIS:         Well, that may be true, but with

25   respect, I think that that is -- that's the tail wagging

 1   the dog.   The argument that you made is that a loss

 2   occurs if your fiduciary duty claim is successful.

 3   That's another statute.          That's --

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, but that would

 5   preserve the necessity of going through the exhaustion

 6   requirement first.      You apply to the plan and say the

 7   plan owes me this cancer treatment, and the plan says

 8   "yes, we do" or "no, we don't."                If it says "yes, we

 9   do," it's liable to you and then the plan can -- can

10   recover over against the trustee.

11               MR. STRIS:         Let me take a step back because

12   I think we are 100 percent in agreement, but I want to

13   be clear what our position is.                Under the factual

14   scenario that you described, I agree with you 100

15   percent that you would need to proceed under (a)(1)(B),

16   because you would be requesting a benefit that you are

17   entitled to under the plan.

18               In this case, the only benefit that you are

19   entitled to, if you are a participant in an individual

20   account plan, is the value of the contributions that

21   you've put or your employer has put into the account, as

22   they have either appreciated or depreciated.                So my

23   first response -- it's actually the second response I

24   was going to give earlier that I never got to is that I

25   believe that it's not clear that there is even a


                                         13

 1   legitimate (a)(1)(B) claim that Mr. LaRue could have

 2   asserted here because --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, it isn't just if the

 4   money is payable to him today.              It says, "to enforce his

 5   rights under the terms or to clarify his rights to

 6   future benefits under the terms of the plan."

 7               MR. STRIS:       That is correct.

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:            And if there's no money in

 9   his account, it seems to me he could bring an action to

10   clarify that even if there is no money in his account

11   the plan owes him future benefits in that amount.

12               MR. STRIS:       And then one of two things at

13   that point would happen, Justice Scalia.                 Either he

14   would get paid by the plan, which would pick the pockets

15   of the other participants and require the plan to then

16   bring an action under (a)(2) --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Right.

18               MR. STRIS:       -- which is perfectly

19   legitimate, but my response to that is there is no

20   language in the statute to suggest that that is

21   required.   If he has an action to do that directly under

22   (a)(2), there's no language in the statute to suggest

23   that he need bring an (a)(1) action first and require

24   the plan to then proceed under (a)(2).

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I -- I'm not sure


                                       14

 1   about your characterization that he would pick the

 2   pockets of the other plan participants.                 By definition

 3   he only prevails if this was a benefit to which he was

 4   entitled under the plan.        So that doesn't seem unfair to

 5   the other plan participants.

 6              MR. STRIS:        Well, a defined contribution

 7   plan is nothing more than a collection of assets that

 8   have been allocated to a group of participants.                 So, if

 9   those assets are depleted through fiduciary breach,

10   which is what occurred here, and you bring a claim

11   saying that your interest in the plan was depleted, if

12   you brought that claim against the plan, the plan no

13   longer has the money.      So either they can pay you --

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, it may or may

15   not have the money.     You could have failed to follow his

16   instructions in a way that enriched the plan, and it's

17   simply a question of getting that money properly

18   allocated rather than improperly allocated to the other

19   plan participants who are picking the pocket of your

20   client.

21              MR. STRIS:        Well, I think under the example

22   that you just gave, Mr. Chief Justice, there would not

23   be a loss to the plan.

24              Our fundamental argument about the plain

25   text of this statute is that a loss to the plan is a

 1   diminution in plan assets.            If I'm a participant in a

 2   plan, and the administrator doesn't like me and takes my

 3   money and allocates it, just because they feel like it,

 4   to another participant in the plan, it is not our

 5   position that there would be a claim under (a)(2)

 6   because there has been no diminution in plan assets.

 7   One would need to proceed under (a)(3).

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But the plan wouldn't

 9   necessarily pay out any money.                What would happen is,

10   after the administrative determination by the plan that

11   it does owe the money, he would sue the plan for the

12   money and the plan would implead the trustee who was

13   responsible for this.        It ends up the same way.

14                 MR. STRIS:       Well, I would say two things

15   about that.     First, it may end up the same way depending

16   on how the facts play out, which is the perfect evidence

17   for my point, which is 502(a)(3) of ERISA has been

18   interpreted as a catchall provision.                      502(a)(2) is

19   anything but.     It sets forth very specific conditions

20   and very specific relief that is available if those

21   conditions are met.       There is nothing to suggest that

22   the availability of a potential remedy under (a)(1)

23   precludes a remedy under (a)(2).

24                 Now, my second response, Justice Scalia, is

25   that depending on how the facts play out, the result may

 1   not be as you suggest.         The plan may choose not to go

 2   after the fiduciary, and if that's the case, all -- at

 3   most my client could get is a declaration under (a)(1)

 4   that doesn't ultimately get him any money.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            What would happen if the

 6   trustee does not have the money?                 The trustee not only

 7   squandered your client's money; he squandered his own.

 8   He's just really in bad shape.                He has no money to cough

 9   up.     What happens to your client?               Doesn't your client

10   get that money from the plan anyway?

11                 MR. STRIS:       I think that that --

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            By picking, as you put it,

13   by picking the pockets of the other plan participants?

14                 MR. STRIS:       I think in an individual account

15   plan, that presents a very difficult question.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            What's the answer to it?

17                 MR. STRIS:       I think probably he would not be

18   able to recover that money.              I think that money would be

19   lost and he would have no remedy because, at that point

20   in time, someone is going to lose.                   Either my client is

21   not going to recover money that he is entitled to or

22   other participants in the plan are going to have money

23   taken away from them.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            They participated in the

25   plan.    It was a failure of the trustee for the plan.                 It


                                         17

 1   seems to me the whole plan should be liable for it.                        I

 2   mean that's how I --

 3               MR. STRIS:         I don't think there's any

 4   evidence for that.      ERISA imposes a duty of loyalty to

 5   all plan participants.         If they breach a fiduciary duty

 6   which causes a diminution in plan assets that ultimately

 7   will affect only one participant, there is -- it goes

 8   against the very core of ERISA to say that they can

 9   remedy that by taking money from innocent fellow

10   participants.   And that really goes to the core of the

11   difference between an (a)(2) claim and an (a)(3) claim

12   on one hand, and an (a)(1) claim on the other hand.

13               One thing is clear here.                      Whether or not

14   Mr. LaRue could have brought an (a)(1)(B) claim, it

15   would not under any circumstances have resulted in

16   getting money from the fiduciary back into the plan.

17   Absent money being returned to the plan, there can be no

18   meaningful remedy for the breach that occurred.

19               So it returns us to the core question in

20   this case, which is were the terms of (a)(2) satisfied?

21               Now, the court of appeals basically advanced

22   two arguments as to why the plain text of the statute

23   should be ignored.      The primary argument was a

24   fundamental misinterpretation of this Court's opinion in

25   Russell.   So I'd like to speak about that.

 1                JUSTICE ALITO:         If we agree to you on

 2   (a)(2), is there any need to get to (a)(3)?

 3                MR. STRIS:      Certainly if you agree with us

 4   on (a)(2), the court of appeals can be reversed on that

 5   issue.   We ask that you also reach the (a)(3) question,

 6   because this case was decided at the pleading stage.

 7                Although it may be unlikely, there are two

 8   reasons why we might need to avail ourselves of (a)(3)

 9   on remand.   The first is that facts could develop.             I

10   don't have any reason to believe they will, but facts

11   could develop where there is a loss to Mr. LaRue's

12   beneficial interest but not a loss to the plan.            In

13   other words, they took his money and they gave it to

14   someone else.

15                We should be able to plead, if we have a

16   cognizable claim under two statutes, both of them and

17   then discover the relevant facts.

18                The second reason why you should reach the

19   (a)(3) question is additional relief may be available

20   under (a)(3) that is not available under (a)(2).

21                JUSTICE ALITO:         What would that be?

22                MR. STRIS:      Well, our theory of surcharge,

23   and it's also the government's theory, is that surcharge

24   is a make-whole remedy for pecuniary losses that are

25   caused by a breach of trust.            It is clear that the core


                                       19
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   losses are diminution in trust assets or failure of

 2   trust assets to appreciate.            But there are individual

 3   pecuniary losses that were historically remediable under

 4   surcharge.

 5                For example, if you paid out of pocket for

 6   an auditor to figure out what the extent of a fiduciary

 7   breach was, a premerger court of equity would not only

 8   surcharge your harm, the harm to your interest in the

 9   trust, but they also would return to you the money that

10   you spent for that audit.

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I thought your own

12   argument was that (a)(3) is the catchall.                So if (a)(2),

13   which is described as very precise, if that's

14   applicable, you would not get to (a)(3).                You would be

15   asking us at this point to assume that somehow the

16   (a)(2) case folds, and then we flip over into (a)(3).

17                But why should we get there prematurely?                  It

18   seems to me if it's right that (a)(2) comes before

19   (a)(3), it isn't -- it's not quite a ripeness issue, but

20   it's close to that.

21                MR. STRIS:      Well, the Court certainly may

22   choose not to reach the (a)(3) issue, so I can't speak

23   to that.   But what I can say is that the dicta in Varity

24   that describes (a)(3) as a catchall provision -- it is

25   clear that at the end of the day if the release is


                                       20

 1   coterminous under the two provisions, it would not be

 2   appropriate for us to proceed under (a)(3).

 3                But that is not a pleading question.                 My

 4   position as to why you should reach (a)(3) is if we have

 5   a cognizable theory under (a)(2) and (a)(3), and we

 6   believe we do, we shouldn't be required to choose at

 7   this point in time if, as the litigation proceeds, it

 8   turns out that the relief we would be entitled to is

 9   coterminous, then we concede it would not be appropriate

10   to proceed under (a)(3).

17                MR. ROBERTS:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

18   please the Court:

19                ERISA authorizes a participant in a defined

21   caused by a fiduciary breach even if the losses are

22   attributable to the participant's individual plan

23   account.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But that means every

25   participant, right?      In other words, for the failure of

 1   the plan to follow this individual's instructions, any

 2   participant in the plan can bring suit under (a)(2)?

 3              MR. ROBERTS:          It's -- that's theoretically

 4   possible because the loss to the -- loss to this

 5   individual account is a loss to the plan.               Although it's

 6   unlikely that a participant that has no -- that is --

 7   whose own benefits are not going to be affected has much

 8   incentive to sue, and it's also possible that a court

 9   might conclude if such a participant did bring suit,

10   that such a suit shouldn't proceed under prudential

11   standing principles or because the suit wouldn't be

12   appropriate, but here --

13              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Wouldn't the theory be that

14   if ultimately the other accounts could be robbed to sort

15   of make up for at least part of the loss of this one,

16   that for a loss to any account is a threat to all the

17   others?

18              MR. ROBERTS:          Well, we agree that a loss to

19   any account is a threat to the plan as a whole, but I

20   think for a different reason.             We don't think that you

21   could rob the other accounts to pay this -- this

22   participant.   That would likely violate the fiduciary's

23   duty of loyalty to those participants, the fiduciary

24   duty of prudence under -- under ERISA.

25              It would also probably violate the terms of

 1   the plan, because they have a right to future benefits

 2   by the amount that's in their allocation but --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Mr. Roberts, Section (a),

 4   (a)(1)(B) --

 5               MR. ROBERTS:           Yes.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Unlike Section (a)(2),

 7   which refers you to 1109, does not say who gets sued.

 8   Under 1109 it's clear who gets sued.                      It's the fiduciary

 9   who gets sued.     I find it very curious that (a)(1)(B)

10   just says a civil action may be brought to recover

11   benefits due to him under the terms of his plans or to

12   clarify his right under the terms of the plan.

13               MR. ROBERTS:           Yes, but --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:              I think the implication

15   there is that the suit -- the suit is against the plan.

16               MR. ROBERTS:           The implication is that the

17   suit is against the plan or against a fiduciary in --

18   under (a)(1)(B).    Against the plan or against the

19   fiduciary whose initial capacity is representative of

20   the plan.

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Where?

22               MR. ROBERTS:           If you can't sue the fiduciary

23   under (a)(1)(B), that just reinforces the point even --

24   even more, Your Honor, that Petitioner's cause of action

25   here arises under (a)(2) because he is seeking relief

 1   for the plan not relief from the plan.

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:               It may well.       But I'm just

 3   talking right now of (a)(1)(B), and it would seem to me

 4   that the logical reading of that is that the suit is

 5   against the plan.

 6              MR. ROBERTS:            Under (a)(1)(B), most courts

 7   require that the suit be brought against the plan.                   I

 8   think the suit in certain circumstances could be brought

 9   against the fiduciary to require the fiduciary to take

10   action that is required by the terms of the plan such as

11   if you fought against the fiduciary to pay benefits out.

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    How do we know that

13   this is a breach of fiduciary duty under (a)(2) without

14   having the plan before us?            In other words, it may not

15   be a fiduciary obligation to follow an instruction from

16   somebody if the plan provides a different way in which

17   those instructions are going to be handled.

18              I'd say, as I think a lot of these plans do,

19   you can change your investment options only during a

20   particular period.      Well, if the instruction came at a

21   different time, it wouldn't be a breach of fiduciary

22   duties because it wasn't a breach of the plan.

23              MR. ROBERTS:            And if it's not a breach of

24   fiduciary duties, Petitioner will lose on the merits or

25   on remand in their motion for summary judgment based on

 1   facts that could be decided.

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But I thought his

 3   argument -- his argument reduces to the fact that it's a

 4   breach of fiduciary duty because it's a breach of the

 5   plan.     But if not a breach of the plan, then it's not a

 6   breach --

 7                 MR. ROBERTS:         It's a breach of fiduciary

 8   duty both of a failure to follow the terms of the plan

 9   and a breach of the duty of prudence, because when a

10   plan provides that participants can direct their

11   investments --

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So we need to know

13   -- we need to know what the plan provides before we can

14   decide.

15                 MR. ROBERTS:         The case was dismissed on the

16   pleadings, Your Honor, and it alleges that there was a

17   breach of fiduciary duty.            And Respondent hasn't

18   disputed, in fact, that the plan requires

19   participants -- allows participants direct, in fact --

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 The pleadings don't

21   include the plan.     So we have to assess the pleadings

22   without the terms of the plan.

23                 MR. ROBERTS:         Yes, but the inferences

24   shouldn't be construed against the plaintiff in motion

25   to dismiss on the pleadings, Your Honor.

 1                In addition to that, Respondent's answer --

 2   this is on page 2a of the red brief -- admitted that

 3   participants in the DeWolff plan are permitted to direct

 4   the investment of their contributions to the plan.

 5   That's in paragraph eight on page 2a.

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But we don't know

 7   under what terms.    I mean I've seen plans where you are

 8   entitled to direct, but that's subject to conditions and

 9   limitations.

10                MR. ROBERTS:         That's certainly true, Your

11   Honor.    But here, the court of appeals assumed that

12   there was a fiduciary breach.              That's on page 3a in the

13   star footnote of the -- it's the appendix to the

14   petition for certiorari.          There is no reason for this

15   Court to second-guess that, particularly since

16   Respondent didn't argue in its motion to dismiss that

17   there was no fiduciary breach here.                      So the case comes

18   to the Court on the assumption that there is a fiduciary

19   breach.    And these are very important questions

20   concerning whether assuming there is a fiduciary breach,

21   a participant in a defined contribution plan can sue to

22   recover for the plan the losses to the plan that are

23   caused by that breach when the losses are attributable

24   only to that individual's account.

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Roberts, would you

 1   clarify what the government's position is on this

 2   (a)(1)(B) argument?     Are you saying it is available, but

 3   (a)(2) is available?

 4              MR. ROBERTS:         We don't think that there is a

 5   claim at this point under (a)(1)(B), because the -- the

 6   money the Petitioner seeks -- what's happened here is he

 7   has alleged that there has been a fiduciary breach that

 8   caused a loss to the plan.         The appropriate remedy for

 9   that is a recovery from the fiduciary in its personal

10   capacity to put the money back in the plan.            That's what

11   section 502(a)(2) provides.           Once the money is back in

12   the plan and then it's allocated pursuant to the duty of

13   prudence to the Petitioner's account, then if the plan

14   didn't pay out the money to him when he was entitled to

15   it, which he appears to be entitled to it now since he

16   has withdrawn his account balance, he would have a 502

17   (a)(2) claim -- a 502(a)(1)(B) claim, excuse me -- but

18   he doesn't have a claim under that provision now.            We --

19   at least we think it's very unlikely that he does,

20   because generally plans provide that the benefits that

21   are owed to people are the money that are in -- in the

22   account.

23              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, now we know what

24   benefits would be due because he has withdrawn, but when

25   he made this complaint and he hadn't been withdrawn, he


                                      27

 1   could have made an unwise investment the next time.                  And

 2   --

 3                MR. ROBERTS:         That's right, and then he

 4   would -- it would be even clearer, I think that he has

 5   no (a)(1)(B) claim, if he didn't have -- say he was

 6   still participating in the plan and he wasn't -- he

 7   hadn't withdrawn his account balance and didn't have a

 8   right to withdraw his account balance at that time, then

 9   he wouldn't have a right to any benefits from the plan.

10                The crux of the matter here is that the plan

11   has suffered a loss and that the appropriate remedy is

12   against the fiduciary in his personal capacity;

13   (a)(1)(B) doesn't provide for suits against the

14   fiduciary in his personal capacity to recover money for

15   the plan.    It provides, again, suits against the plan to

16   pay money out of the plan.           This money isn't in the

17   plan; it can't paid from the accounts of other

18   participants because it would breach these duties under

19   ERISA.    The appropriate remedy is to get the money back

20   in the plan.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Do you agree that if

22   it is within (a)(1)(B) that it's therefore not within

23   (a)(2)?

24                MR. ROBERTS:         No, because (a)(1)(B) provides

25   an action for benefits from the plan and (a)(2) provides

 1   an action against -- it's a different -- against a

 2   different defendant for a different kind of claim.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I thought your

 4   answer would be yes.        In other words, if it's in (a)(1),

 5   it's not in (a)(2).

 6                 MR. ROBERTS:         If it's a claim for benefits

 7   under (a)(1) or to enforce the terms of the plan, such

 8   as if the fiduciary says, "I'm just not going to follow

 9   your instruction," and the participant wants a

10   clarification of that and an order compelling the

11   fiduciary in his official capacity to do that, yes, that

12   would be a suit under (a)(1)(B) and there would be no

13   suit under (a)(2).

14                 There's only a suit under (a)(2) if there

15   are losses to the plan and if the remedy is to put the

16   money back in the plan by getting it from the breaching

17   fiduciary.

18                 If I could turn to (a)(3) just very briefly,

19   Your Honor.    We think that suits against fiduciaries to

20   recover losses by fiduciary breaches are also authorized

21   by section 502(a)(3), which provides for appropriate

22   action, I believe.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is that 1132 we are talking

24   about?

25                 MR. ROBERTS:         Yes, that's 1132(a)(3).

10               MR. ROBERTS:          That provision provides for

11   appropriate equitable relief, and a suit against a

12   fiduciary to recover losses caused by a breach of

13   fiduciary duty seeks equitable relief because it's

14   analogous to an action for breach of trust seeking the

15   equitable remedy of surcharge.

22               MR. GIES:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

23   please the Court:

24               Petitioner in our view suggests an awkward

25   reading of Section 409, one that is particularly hard to

 1   reconcile with the structure of the civil enforcement

 2   provisions of Section %02, 1132 of the U.S. Code,

 3   starting of course with Section (a)(1)(B).

 4              To us this is the opposite end of the

 5   spectrum of the kind of case the Court was talking about

 6   in Russell and what Russell has been assumed to have

 7   been meant --

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Russell was about a

 9   welfare plan, not a pension -- and as I recall, the

10   plaintiff in Russell was seeking medical benefits that

11   she didn't get and she wanted, not the benefits because

12   she did get those, she wanted straight out damages,

13   compensatory and punitive damages, for delay in the

14   receipt of benefits.     That's quite a different thing

15   from saying I want the contributions made so that I will

16   get the benefits to which I'm entitled.

17              MR. GIES:      You're right, Your Honor, that

18   that is certainly distinguishable on the facts.           We

19   think the central teaching of Russell, though, applies

20   with equal force to a defined contribution case like

21   this, for several reasons.

22              The first of which is that Russell has been

23   assumed to reflect the dicing that we are talking about

24   which provision in Section 502 is appropriate.

25   Individual claims have traditionally been brought either


                                      31

 1   under (a)(1)(B) or under (a)(3).                 When a claim is being

 2   brought on behalf of the plan as a whole, Russell

 3   teaches and -- and helps define when those claims are

 4   available.   It is an odd case here, where the plan is a

 5   defendant, to at the same time assert that this claim is

 6   being brought on behalf of the plan.

 7                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, that is an oddity but

 8   what do you say to Mr. Roberts' argument that the only

 9   recovery under (a)(1)(B) is against the plan, and the

10   plan doesn't have the money in the account so that if

11   there is going to be any relief it's got to come from

12   the fiduciary and that gets you into (2).

13                MR. GIES:       Well, because neither (a)(2) or

14   (a)(1)(B) were invoked in the district court and the

15   case comes up on a very spares record, it's hard to --

16                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Okay, but we've got to

17   assume at this point that we've -- we've got a -- a

18   Section (2) claim before us and the argument simply is,

19   is that in effect to be disallowed because it should

20   have been an (a)(1)(B) claim?               And the argument that the

21   United States has made, the argument that the other side

22   has made is, we cannot get to any money under (a)(1)(B).

23   We've got to get that from the fiduciary and we can only

24   do that under (2).

25                MR. GIES:       The difference between defined

 1   contribution plans and defined benefit plans in ERISA is

 2   an important consideration in answering that question.

 3   (a)(1)(B), the first clause, speaks of recovering

 4   benefits due to him.      As you know from our briefs we

 5   argue this is a case for lost profits, not benefits,

 6   certainly not vested benefits in the way the Court used

 7   the term in Firestone.

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So then you would agree

 9   that (a)(1)(B) is not available?

10               MR. GIES:      No, Your Honor.              We believe that

11   (a)(1)(B) definitely was available for the Petitioner

12   here.   What relief he might have recovered under

13   (a)(1)(B) had he invoked that provision remains to --

14   would have remained to have been seen had it been

15   invoked.   There are three --

16               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, the argument of the

17   United States is you can't rob Peter to pay Paul, so

18   that if in fact his account didn't have the money, the

19   plan didn't have any place to get the money, and the

20   only way the money could be had would have been from a

21   fiduciary, which again gets you to subsection (2).

22               MR. GIES:      It would only get you into

23   subsection (2) if it could be argued that that claim was

24   for the benefit of the plan as a whole, as this Court

25   has taught in Russell; and it seems to me, Your Honor,

 1   that one way to think about this in terms of which

 2   provision applies to which of these claims, is whether

 3   Congress really intended for these individual kinds of

 4   "he said; she said" claims to be brought.                   We think not.

 5                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.       But it seems to me

 6   you're answering a different question in that response.

 7   The argument here is basically an argument between the

 8   possibility -- an argument based on the claim that under

 9   (a)(1)(B) you can't go against the fiduciary.                    The only

10   way you can get the money is from a fiduciary and

11   therefore (a)(1)(B) would have been of no value to you.

12   Do you -- do you take issue with that premise?

13                 MR. GIES:      Well we think --             no.   No, Your

14   Honor.     In general we do not take issue with that

15   premise.

16                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay, then doesn't that

17   leave you in the position of having to say that you've

18   either got to bring the claim under (a)(1)(B), or you've

19   got -- subsection (2) -- or you've got to bring it under

20   subsection (3)?

21                 MR. GIES:      We think not for this reason.

22   The second clause of (a)(1)(B) permits a cause of action

23   to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan.                    This

24   is a case that if you give the Petitioner full benefit

25   of the doubt probably could have been resolved with a

 1   telephone call.     (a)(1)(B) permits an action to enforce

 2   his rights under the terms of the plan.

 3                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            And the answer, if the

 4   premise you have just agreed to is correct, will be,

 5   "you bet.     He is entitled to have another $150,000 in

 6   his account for the benefit of future payments to him."

 7                 MR. GIES:      Well, we think --

 8                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            "But we haven't got the

 9   money and we can't rob Peter to pay Paul and therefore

10   we are very sorry, go away."              That would necessarily be

11   the answer.

12                 MR. GIES:      Well, we think not with respect,

13   Justice Souter, for this reason.                 Keep in mind the

14   theory here is one for lost appreciation in the account.

15   This plan does not have pooled assets.

16                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            But that's going to the --

17   it seems to -- with respect, I think that's going to the

18   merits.   And the question is, if you can recover against

19   anybody, the claim is,         the argument is you're going to

20   get nowhere under (a)(1)(B)              because the plan can't help

21   you by itself.    The only way you can get any value from

22   your lawsuit is by going against the fiduciary.                 Maybe

23   you have good reasons to defend that, but if you're

24   going to have a suit against anyone, it's got to be

25   under subsection (2).

 1              MR. GIES:       I think the answer to that,

 2   Justice Souter, is that it reflects how careful and

 3   interrelated these provisions in 502 are.

 4              JUSTICE SOUTER:             And they're saying they are

 5   careful and interrelated provisions mean that you got to

 6   go under subsection (2).

 7              MR. GIES:       To which we say --

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:             And you're I think saying,

 9   we -- we agree with you that ultimately (1)(B) couldn't

10   get you any relief because the fiduciary -- the plan

11   doesn't have any money.        And you're now arguing, well,

12   if you go against the fiduciary, ultimately we have a

13   good defense to that.      But the fact is, the question

14   before us is whom do you sue and under what -- under

15   what section?   And I think your own logic forces you to

16   say that -- that has got to be subsection (2).

17              MR. GIES:       Well, one more answer to your

18   question about (a)(1)(B), Justice Souter, is this:            As

19   you know, ERISA is a statute that provides for limited

20   remedies, and the question of what remedies might be

21   available under (a)(1) and whether or not this defendant

22   would be solvent or somebody else would have to be

23   impleaded in our view need not be decided in this case.

24   We think it's sufficient to identify that --

25              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, it hasn't been

 1   reached yet, has it?

 2               MR. GIES: -- as another remedy that could

 3   have been pursued     here.

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   If there is a suit

 5   under (a)(1)(B) for a breach of the plan by a fiduciary,

 6   do you agree that the plan, if it's liable, could then

 7   sue the fiduciary?      I realize I'm talking about a suit

 8   by one of your clients against the other, but would that

 9   be a feasible result under the statute?

10               MR. GIES:        Yes, it is, and it's also

11   possible depending on the facts.                 And again, from this

12   sparse record, it's hard to know that there could be an

13   action filed against whoever it was who is alleged to

14   have made the mistake.         One of the issues, of course, in

15   this case is it's not clear who made the mistake or

16   whether or not the mistake was in fact a breach of

17   fiduciary duty.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Is it entirely clear that

19   the plan itself does not have any money to pay this off

20   unless it takes the money from other individual

21   accounts?   I thought one of the briefs said that -- that

22   some plans have independent funds.                   I forget what

23   sources they came from, but some slush fund that they

24   could use for this purpose.

 1   think, Justice Scalia --

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            It wasn't called a slush

 3   fund.   I know that.

 4                 (Laughter.)

 5                 MR. GIES:      -- was a plan that provides for

 6   pool of assets.     This plan does not.                   And so the answer

 7   to your question is no, there is no other place to get

 8   the money from, which we think is another reason why

 9   this is not on appropriate claim under (a)(2).                      It is

10   not losses to the plan in the conventional way we

11   understand those words.          But the --

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But what is the plan

13   other than a collection of individual --                      I mean the

14   trustee is the trustee for the plan.                      All of the assets

15   are there.     The individuals do not have them in their

16   pockets.     So the trustee is managing this fund, which is

17   then segmented into accounts for each individual.                      So I

18   think your -- your suggestion is that these defined

19   contribution plans, they come out entirely because --

20   because of the segmented accounts.                   So you could never

21   bring a claim because it would always be an individual.

22                 MR. GIES:      Well, we think that (a)(2),

23   properly read, does not permit an individual claim.

24   (a)(3) permits a claim for equitable relief, and

25   (a)(1)(B) would permit a claim for benefits for the

 1   other two.

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, why?           Why?   That's

 3   the question, it seems to me, in the case.                       Why?    I mean

 4   -- imaginary example -- a plan, a thousand members.                           The

 5   trustee invests in a thousand diamonds.                       He puts it in a

 6   bank deposit vault.       One day he takes all 500 diamonds

 7   and runs off to Martinique.              We catch him enjoying the

 8   sun.     We can sue him under (2), right?                   That's what (2)

 9   is there for, right?        Right.        Okay.           Now, everything is

10   the same except each of the thousand diamonds was put in

11   individual safe deposit box with the participant's name

12   on it.    Everything else is the same.                    Why should it

13   matter?

14                 MR. GIES:      We think relief in that

15   situation, including recovery of the diamonds and any

16   profits associated with it, would be available under

17   (a)(3).

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, I'm sorry.            I'm not

19   interested in that question.              I'm interested in my

20   question.    Why isn't it available under (a)(2)?                       In both

21   cases, the trustee took 500 diamonds that belonged to

22   the plan and went to Martinique.                 Now, if you can sue

23   him when the plans are all put in one big safe deposit

24   box with the diamonds, why can't you sue him when

25   they're put in 500 small safe deposit boxes?

 1               MR. GIES:        I think the structure of defined

 2   contribution plans makes that a little inapt of an

 3   analogy, with respect, Justice Breyer.                       In this plan, as

 4   we know, the assets are not pooled.                       It is, of course,

 5   the sum and total of the individual plan accounts, but

 6   the question of legal ownership is different from the

 7   question of whether or not in this case it ought to be

 8   read as losses to the plan.              Here it is by definition

 9   the most individual kind of claim that anybody could

10   think about.   It is a run of the mill, as alleged claim

11   between an investor and a stockbroker essentially that

12   the stockbroker did not execute the trade.

13               JUSTICE ALITO:            But do you dispute that

14   there was not -- that there was a loss to the plan in

15   the literal sense?

16               MR. GIES:        Yes, we do.             For --

17               JUSTICE ALITO:            If --

18               MR. GIES:        For two reasons, first of all,

19   there was no distribution until after he cashed out and,

20   second, the nature of this claim, again, is for lost

21   profits.   It is not for benefits as in the sense of a

22   defined benefit plan.

23               JUSTICE ALITO:            But if you accept the truth

24   of his allegations, wouldn't the plan have greater

25   assets than it had?

 1                 MR. GIES:      No.      Because there's no way to

 2   imagine that anybody made out on this.                     This is a case

 3   where the investment instruction was not followed.

 4   There's no way to imagine that my clients made any money

 5   on that.

 6                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, but you're arguing that

 7   ultimately he couldn't prove damages.                     We're talking

 8   about allegations at the pleading stage.

 9                 Let me ask you a slightly different

10   question.     You said there's no -- there's no, as Justice

11   Scalia put it, there's no slush fund; there's no pooled

12   assets here.     All the assets are assets which are

13   accounted for, attributable to, individual accounts.

14   Therefore there can be no -- there can be no loss to the

15   plan which is not a loss to an individual account, can

16   there be?

17                 MR. GIES:      Yes, sir.           That's correct.

18                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Then what is your theory on

19   how we determine whether a loss to the plan from an

20   individual account suffices as a loss to the plan for

21   purposes of pleading?        Has it got to be, you know, 500

22   losses out of 1000?       I don't see why that should make a

23   difference.     I'm going back to Justice Breyer's

24   question.

25                 MR. GIES:      Yes, I don't think the actual

 1   number makes any difference, but I think the nature of

 2   the allegation, the type of fiduciary breach, does.

 3               JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, but why doesn't the --

 4               MR. GIES:      In the "stock drop" cases --

 5               JUSTICE SOUTER:            There's something I'm not

 6   understanding about your argument.                 When you say the

 7   nature of the fiduciary breach pleaded is what makes the

 8   difference, I am understanding you to be answering the

 9   question whether on the merits ultimately there will be

10   a -- they will be able to make out a claim.                   And I am

11   saying, as I said once before, that that seems to me a

12   question that comes after you answer the question before

13   us.   And the question before us is not whether

14   ultimately you've stated a winning claim, but whether

15   ultimately -- whether right now you have stated a claim

16   for a loss to the plan.

17               Now, that is not your view.                    Why is it that

18   I am taking your answer to be an answer on the merits to

19   a different question and you're saying my answer, i.e.,

20   nature of duty breached or -- is one that goes to the

21   question of pleading at this stage?

22               MR. GIES:      Because of the words "losses to

23   the plan" in the text, the words on the page, in the

24   context of the rest of 502.            The words "losses to the

25   plan" connotes something collective.                    The example --

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Yes, but you said -- you

 2   said it doesn't have to be every single member of the

 3   plan.

 4               MR. GIES:        That is correct, Justice

 5   Ginsburg.

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               You said it has to be

 7   more than one.    How then do we read the statute to say,

 8   well, it doesn't have to be the plan as a whole because

 9   there may be some people that are not entitled to this?

10   How do we get that number between more than one and less

11   than everybody?

12               MR. GIES:        I would -- I don't think that

13   that's a useful way to think about it either, Justice

14   Ginsburg, which is why I think the right way to think

15   about it in the context of this statute is to think

16   about the nature of the allegation at the pleading

17   stage.   In the stock drop cases, the fiduciary breach

18   alleged is an imprudent investment in holding company

19   stock.   I think the diamond analogy is closer to that.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But I'm -- I'm asking you

21   just -- in your -- you have said, you conceded, that to

22   bring the suit against the trustee, it doesn't have to

23   involve every member, every contributor to this defined

24   contribution plan.      But it has to involve --

25               MR. GIES:        I think that's too harsh a rule.

 1              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                -- more than one.    So

 2   that's the question I'd like to you address.               You

 3   recognize that there can be a claim against the

 4   fiduciary for breach of trust on behalf of contributors

 5   to the plan?     So in that lawsuit, how many people would

 6   there have to be to qualify?              You say not everybody, but

 7   more than one.

 8              MR. GIES:         Well, as we've argued we think it

 9   ought to be a substantial subset reflecting the nature

10   of the breach alleged.         That is, something systemic,

11   something that affects the interests of the plan as a

12   whole rather than just --

13              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                For example.

14              MR. GIES:         -- one individual plan

15   participant.   For example, the choice of an imprudent

16   investment, Your Honor, where -- and that's where most

17   of these stock drop cases come -- they involve company

18   stock held in 401(k) plans, and the allegation is that

19   it is imprudent to continue to hold the shares of the

20   stock.

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:               If you do that in two

22   accounts is that enough?

23              MR. GIES:         It -- it very well might be.             Two

24   --

25              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Why not one?

 1              MR. GIES:       Because --

 2              JUSTICE SOUTER:             If it -- if it is the --

 3   and I still don't get this, but if it is the nature of

 4   the particular dereliction in duty that counts, why do

 5   we need more than one?

 6              MR. GIES:       Because the nature of the

 7   dereliction of duty here is the most -- hard to conceive

 8   of a more individualistic kind of a breach.             This is

 9   just one dispute, one he said/she said between a

10   participant and the -- -

11              JUSTICE SOUTER:             It's an individualistic

12   kind of breach when it is viewed as -- as only one

13   account, but it is a breach against the plan when it is

14   understood that there is nothing to the plan except an

15   aggregation of accounts.         You can't have a breach

16   against one without a breach against the plan.

17              MR. GIES:       To which we would say, Justice

18   Souter, that it's qualitatively different to breach a

19   duty as alleged here on an individual basis, on a

20   one-transaction basis, in one account --

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Then why, if that is your

22   answer, why does it matter what the nature of the

23   dereliction is?   Because you're -- you're saying the --

24   the really important question is the nature of the

25   dereliction.   If it is, then I don't see why the

 1   multiple of the number of accounts affected has anything

 2   to do with it.

 3                 MR. GIES:     Well, I suppose you could

 4   imagine, Justice Souter, a fact pattern where there was

 5   evidence -- not in this case, of course -- that there

 6   was a pattern, a systemic failure to handle properly

 7   investment requests made by --

 8                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           And then you've got a lot

 9   of plaintiffs but what difference does it make?

10                 MR. GIES:     Well we think that comes closer

11   to what -- how we read Russell and how Russell has been

12   understood.

13                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           That may be close to the

14   way you read it, but why is your reading correct?                      Why

15   should that make any difference?

16                 MR. GIES:     Because in context with the rest

17   of 502, 502(a)(2) has been understood, and we think for

18   good reason, not to apply to an individual case.                      There

19   are other remedies available, in (a)(1)(B) --

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What?         What other

21   remedies?

22                 MR. GIES:     In (a)(1)(B), and in (a)(3) for

23   equitable relief.

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But you said this isn't

25   -- you said it isn't a claim for benefits.                     It's a clam

 1   for lost profits.    You said that a few times.                  I thought

 2   (a)(1)(B) is a claim for benefits, current or future.

 3                 MR. GIES:     The third part of (a)(1)(B)

 4   permits a participant to sue to enforce his rights under

 5   the terms of the plan.

 6                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Which will -- which will

 7   get him nothing.

 8                 MR. GIES:     It might have got him the trade

 9   made, maybe a few days late.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I want to go back to amend

11   my example.    He only took one diamond.                  It was a big

12   vault he took it from -- one diamond.                    You still have

13   the claim, right?

14                 MR. GIES:     And -- and is that a --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           It's a big vault.         He took

16   it from one big safe deposit box -- one diamond.

17                 MR. GIES:     And -- and is it identified in

18   one account?

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:           No, this is just there in

20   the big vault.

21                 MR. GIES:     Well, that's -- that's a

22   fundamental difference.

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, of course.         Well--

24   no, no.   I'm going to, of course, ask you, since you

25   seem to be turning this thing on how individualized this

 1   loss was, well, it was just one diamond, out of

 2   thousand.

 3                 Now obviously I'm going to ask you, because

 4   I haven't yet heard the answer -- at least I didn't seem

 5   to hear it -- what the difference is whether that one

 6   diamond came from a big vault or from one little safe

 7   deposit box with the participant's label on it.

 8                 MR. GIES:      It's still the same kind of loss,

 9   obviously.     You're correct, Justice Breyer.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Exactly, the same kind of

11   loss.     And what we have here is the footnote that was

12   alleged in -- written in the opinion -- we assume the

13   defendant's conduct amounted to a breach of fiduciary

14   duties.     So therefore all of the discussion you have,

15   that maybe it didn't -- well, maybe you're right.              But

16   we better send it back so that they can decide that

17   question.     And I just don't see what the other

18   difference is.     It can't be a difference in the size of

19   the diamond.     And people are saying, well, why -- well,

20   you see the question.

21                 MR. GIES:      I do indeed, Justice Breyer.        I

22   think the structure of the plan bears something on the

23   right answer because this plan does not have pooled

24   assets accounts, there is no way that this alleged loss

25   could have had any impact on any other plan participant,

 1   nor could any recovery here benefit the plan as a whole.

 2                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Can I ask a question about

 3   your individual point?         What if the individual's account

 4   was 60 percent of the assets of the total plan?                      Because

 5   different accounts are of different sizes.                      Would you

 6   give the same answer to that?

 7                 MR. GIES:      I'd give the same answer, Justice

 8   Stevens, in a situation like this with what I call the

 9   classic one-off, he said/she said request to make a

10   brokerage trade.

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Even if it was 90 percent,

12   you'd give the same answer?

13                 MR. GIES:      I could imagine a situation where

14   the percentage gets so high that the assets might be

15   held in such a way that they could be more easily seen

16   to be a loss to the plan as a whole.                      For example, in

17   some of these plans there's a --

18                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            So just one individual, as

19   far as we know it's a very small percentage of the

20   total.     That's the whole case as I understand it.

21                 MR. GIES:      That -- that's correct, Justice

22   Stevens.     I think it probably depends in your

23   hypothetical on the nature of the asset.                      If it's mutual

24   fund shares, as in this plan held by individuals, I

25   don't think it would make any difference.                      Some plans

 1   hold assets in common.       This one does not.

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:           You know I could understand

 3   your case if you said even if there were a hundred

 4   diamonds, each of them in an individual plan, there

 5   still is no loss to the plan until the plan itself has

 6   been held liable to make up for the loss.               Up until that

 7   point, it's just a loss in each of the individual

 8   accounts.

 9               But you're not willing to say that.                  You say

10   at some ineffable point it becomes a loss to the plan.

11   I think there is a clear line between -- between saying

12   there is no loss to the plan unless -- unless the plan

13   is first adjudicated to be liable; then there is a loss

14   to the plan.

15               MR. GIES:      Well, we certainly --

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Prior to that it's just a

17   loss to the individual account.             That makes some sense.

18   I mean, I can understand how that works.               I can't

19   understand how your system works.               You're telling me it

20   depends on how big the diamond is and -- and what kind

21   of a breach it was.     How can we write an opinion like

22   that?

23               (Laughter.)

24               MR. GIES:      I'm fortunate to have that not as

25   my job, Justice Scalia.

 1                 (Laughter.)

 2                 MR. GIES:     But I think -- I think it's

 3   clearly right as this discussion indicates that the

 4   right place to begin here is with (a)(1)(B).              If you

 5   have a claim like this, you look at the statute, it

 6   comes first.    It has the benefit of being first on the

 7   page.

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I know, because in making

 9   this, hitching your wagon to the (a)(1)(B) -- I thought

10   you were arguing -- what did you say the remedy for this

11   person would be?    Assuming it's true that he put in his

12   slip and he said invest in X set of mutual funds and the

13   trustee missed it, lost it?

14                 MR. GIES:     Right.

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What is his remedy?

16                 MR. GIES:     That's a very difficult question

17   to answer because this is a defined contribution plan

18   and not a defined benefit plan and this is a claim for

19   lost profits.    It's not an easy claim for lost benefits.

20   Now that's why the second clause of (a)(1)(B), to

21   enforce his rights under the plan, we think is the best

22   part of (a)(1)(B) that this individual could pursue.

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is that what you argue in

24   your brief?

25                 MR. GIES:     We did not, but our amici did.

 1              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So what did you argue is

 2   his remedy, in your brief?

 3              MR. GIES:       What we argue in our brief and

 4   what we still say is that he could have pursued

 5   equitable relief under (a)(3).

 6              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What would that be?

 7              MR. GIES:       He could have picked up the

 8   telephone and called and said, like I think most of us

 9   would, say I asked you to sell my sells of stock and it

10   hasn't happened yet.      And --

11              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             He didn't know until he

12   got the report.

13              MR. GIES:       Well, that's not so clear from

14   the record, Justice Ginsburg, but in any case what

15   equitable relief under (a)(3), just as (a)(1)(B) would

16   permit him, is to get an injunction to force the trade

17   to be executed.

18              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But it's much too late.

19   It's over and done.     It wasn't made.

20              MR. GIES:       It may or may not be much too

21   late, Justice Ginsburg, which we think is another reason

22   why as to (a)(2), we think it's unlikely that Congress

23   intended every one of these he said/she said cases to

24   give rise to a cause of action for damages.            There would

25   be no end to the kinds of claims that one could imagine.

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Let's take, because this

 2   case was tossed out on the pleadings, the -- there are

 3   forms to fill out and says I want this set of

 4   investments as opposed to that set of investments.                   The

 5   contributor fills out that form, gives it to the

 6   fiduciary.   A careless employee for the fiduciary loses

 7   it, and that's the story.          So what's the remedy for the

 8   contributor who gave his instruction that weren't

 9   followed, not out of anything deliberate but just

10   carelessness?

11                MR. GIES:     Well, certainly injunctive relief

12   under (a)(3) would have been available.

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Enjoining him to be

14   careless?

15                MR. GIES:     Enjoining him to execute the

16   trade was clearly a remedy available.                   And perhaps there

17   would have been a remedy --

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            If you say I want these

19   funds invested in this particular set of shares for this

20   period, for this six-month period, then two years later

21   you can have that trade made?             I don't understand it.

22                MR. GIES:     Well, we think the fact that it

23   took him so long to sue is another reflection of the

24   fact that this is a claim for damages.                  Had he really

25   intended the trade to have been made, the normal thing


                                       53
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to have done would be to call up and say my trade wasn't

 2   made, please make it.        And if that he didn't get an

 3   adequate response, you'd bring an action for an

 4   injunction.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            What's done meanwhile?             He

 6   came in right at the bottom and a week later, it had

 7   gone up 30 points.

 8                 MR. GIES:      And we think the Congress --

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- no remedy?

10                 MR. GIES:      We think that Congress did not

11   want those kinds of claims to be brought under (a)(2)

12   precisely for that kind of reason.                   There would be no

13   end to the kind of arguments about damages.                       And those

14   kind of cases impose costs that will ultimately be borne

15   by the plans, which is inconsistent with the

16   congressional purpose in ERISA to encourage plan

17   formation.

18                 So this statute on this kind of a situation

19   may provide him some remedies but maybe not a complete

20   remedy for loss of all the profits that he claims he was

21   denied.

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You view it as a

23   lost profits claim.       Would your position be different if

24   he directed a sale of the stock and then the stock went

25   down 30 points instead of going up?                       That's not lost

 1   profits.   That's avoiding losses to the plan.

 2               MR. GIES:        We think we have a different

 3   situation indeed if there actually had been a

 4   distribution here and the amount of the account had gone

 5   down between the alleged mistake and the distribution.

 6   There is clear as a claim for benefits under (a)(1)(B),

 7   and there I think quite easily the Court could say that

 8   in that situation the full value of the account at the

 9   time of the alleged mistake would be benefits under the

10   terms of the plan.      And we think that's a material

11   distinction between this case and others, including the

12   case called Glories v. Charles Schwabb that comes out of

13   the Ninth Circuit.

14               Now with respect to (a)(3), we think that

15   the equitable relief is properly understood not to

16   include compensatory damages and that this Court's

17   decisions have been clear on that.                   As to surcharge, it

18   would seem to me that the one -- the best that one could

19   say is that it was the exception and not the rule and

20   not typically available in the course of equity as this

21   Court has understood --

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               And never available in a

23   court of law.

24               MR. GIES:        And never available in a court of

25   law.   You're exactly right.

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, then what is it?

 2   It's got to be something.

 3                MR. GIES:      Well, I think what it was, as I

 4   understand the history of the equity jurisprudence, is

 5   that you could only sue the trustee in the equity

 6   courts.    And so if you needed to get money and if it was

 7   a damages claim, that was the only place where you could

 8   bring the action.

 9                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             This isn't like a

10   cleanup.

11                MR. GIES:      It is not, Your Honor.              As we

12   understand the argument on surcharge, it is separate

13   from clean up and we understand that and accept that.

14   But it still sounds more like damages.                   It sounds

15   something very different from what Congress, we think,

16   meant when they wrote the language of 502.

17                Unlike the Landrum Griffin Act, which

18   permits actions for damages, ERISA does not, and Landrum

19   Griffin was one of the statutes on which ERISA was

20   based.

21                It also has fiduciary duty obligations.                    It

22   also has the interests of beneficiaries, members of

23   labor unions at heart.        And unlike this provision in

24   ERISA, the Landrum Griffin act explicitly permits an

25   action for damages.      And we think that's further

 1   evidence of the fact that appropriate equitable relief

 2   in a situation like this under (a)(3) does not include a

 3   claim like this for compensatory damages.
