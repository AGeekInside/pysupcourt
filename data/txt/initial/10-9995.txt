 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN A. LORD

 7                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8               MS. LORD:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10               The Tenth Circuit, after finding that

11   Mr. Wood's petition presented two substantial

12   constitutional claims, denied him habeas relief solely

13   on the ground that his petition was untimely.                It did

14   this even though the State had done three things that

15   should have precluded this result:                First, the State

16   deliberately relinquished a known statute of limitations

17   defense.

18               Second, in doing so, the State acted

19   strategically, not inadvertently.

20               And, third, in doing so, the State induced

21   the district court to expend substantial resources in

22   deciding claims of exhaustion and -- and deciding claims

23   on the merits.

24               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Counsel, we asked for

25   two questions presented.       The first was:           Do court of


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                             4
 1   appeals have the power sua sponte to raise issues?                And

 2   in your reply brief, you appear to say, yes, they do in

 3   some circumstances.      So, are you conceding that that

 4   power exists or that there is no power whatsoever?

 5                MS. LORD:      I'm proposing a clear line that

 6   would divide situations in which the court of appeals

 7   would have power and those in which it absolutely has no

 8   power.

 9                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Is that a question of

10   power or a question of exercise of discretion?

11                MS. LORD:      I would say it's a question of

12   power, and this is why:        I --

13                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           That seems sort of

14   strange.   Both rely on a factual situation.               Either you

15   can do something or you can't.            That's power.      If you

16   can do it sometimes, that's still power, and then the

17   question is, did you do it when you couldn't do it?

18                MS. LORD:      Well, what I'm proposing is that

19   there are situations when it is never a proper exercise

20   of the appellate court's jurisdiction to consider sua

21   sponte a statute of limitations defense even in the

22   habeas context.   And now --

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And that's what we

24   said in Day, isn't it?

25                MS. LORD:      Correct, that in Day the Court

                                                                           5
 1   said that courts -- "courts" -- it wasn't directed at

 2   appellate courts, but no court would be free to

 3   disregard a deliberate waiver of a statute of

 4   limitations defense.

 5                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So, all this fight is

 6   about is whether there was a deliberate waiver or not?

 7                  MS. LORD:    Well, that's --

 8                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         As opposed to power?

 9                  MS. LORD:    That's our primary -- our primary

10   argument is that there was a deliberate waiver in this

11   case, and, given what this Court said in Day, the case

12   could be resolved on that narrow ground.

13                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Well, it is -- it is what

14   the -- swords are crossed over here because you say this

15   is a deliberate waiver, and the government says, no,

16   it's -- it's a forfeiture, and forfeiture -- if it's

17   forfeiture, then the court of appeals has discretion to

18   take it up.    If it's a waiver, then Day makes clear --

19   so, it's a question of which box this case fits into:

20   Is it forfeiture or is it waiver?             And your position is

21   it's waiver.

22                  MS. LORD:    That's correct, and my position

23   also is that there is an overlap between those boxes and

24   that when the statute of limitations defense is

25   forfeited in the sense of not being preserved in a

 1   timely manner because of a deliberate choice, I mean --

 2   and in this instance --

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Are there a lot of cases

 4   raising the -- you know, the ambiguity that exists in

 5   this case?   I mean, if you tell me that's all this case

 6   is about, I think we ought to dismiss this -- dismiss it

 7   as improvidently granted.

 8                MS. LORD:    Well --

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:       We don't sit here to decide

10   whether when the government says, you know, we do not

11   concede it but we're not arguing it, or whatever the

12   language was -- we don't sit to decide factual questions

13   like that, that come up in a particular case.

14                I thought we took this case to decide the

15   more significant issue, on which there is a division in

16   the lower courts, as to whether there is, as you say,

17   power of the court to disregard the fact that a statute

18   of limitations defense has not been raised.        We all

19   agree it wasn't raised.      Now, whether it was forfeited

20   or not is another question.        If that's all you want us

21   to decide, I don't want to decide that.

22                MS. LORD:    Well, I clearly want a decision

23   that would favor my client.        This --

24                (Laughter.)

25                MS. LORD:    This Court granted cert on two

                                                                      7
 1   issues, and certainly this case presents the first

 2   issue, which is whether a court of appeals, once the

 3   State has had an opportunity to raise the statute of

 4   limitations defense and chooses not to, whether the

 5   court --

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Only the opportunity or

 7   when it acknowledges -- in Day, we faulted the district

 8   court for not telling the State, essentially, which we may --

 9   not telling the State that it had a potential statute of

10   limitations defense.

11               Is it your position that if the State had

12   just been silent about the statute of limitations

13   defense and not raised it, that the court of appeals

14   wouldn't have power?    Or is it your position that

15   because they knew they had the defense and didn't raise

16   it that the court of appeals didn't have power to sua

17   sponte raise it.

18               MS. LORD:   Well, both -- the district court

19   ordered the State to announce --

20               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         You're not answering my

21   question.

22               MS. LORD:   I'm sorry.

23               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Does the court of

24   appeals have the power to sua sponte raise it if the

25   State -- neither the court or the State addressed the

 1   issue?

 2               MS. LORD:       Probably yes.          Probably yes.

 3               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            All right.     So, it

 4   doesn't have the power if the issue has been raised?                   Is

 5   that your position?

 6               MS. LORD:       That's correct.          If the stage of

 7   the proceedings is after it was in Day, because in Day

 8   when the issue arose under the Rules of Civil Procedure

 9   and under traditional treatment of statute of

10   limitations defense, there was still time for the State

11   to announce we -- there was still time for the State to

12   change or to raise the statute of limitations defense.

13   Here --

14               JUSTICE ALITO:          It sounds to me that what

15   you're -- what you're arguing is that the court of

16   appeals abused its discretion in viewing this as a plain

17   forfeiture, which you've just said would permit the

18   court of appeals to raise the issue sua sponte, instead

19   of a deliberate waiver.        Is that what it comes down to?

20               MS. LORD:       Or a purposeful forfeiture.            I

21   mean, there are forfeitures by --

22               JUSTICE ALITO:          They put it in the wrong --

23   they -- they abused their discretion by putting it in

24   the wrong box.   They didn't put it in the forfeiture

25   box; they put it in the deliberate waiver box.

 1                 MS. LORD:    Well, the way the court of

 2   appeals handled it will create problems if it's approved

 3   by this Court because --

 4                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, this is what -- this

 5   is what troubles me about your argument that the court

 6   of appeals abused its discretion.            Is it correct that

 7   you did not raise the issue of the court of appeals'

 8   lack of authority to raise this sua sponte until

 9   rehearing?

10                 MS. LORD:    What happened, Your Honor, is

11   that we were appointed at the certificate of

12   appealability stage, and we were ordered to brief

13   timeliness.   Perhaps I took the order too literally.             I

14   briefed timeliness, but I also set out exactly what

15   happened, which is in the briefs and which sets forth

16   the State's position.

17                 The court itself raised Day and raised its

18   limited authority under Day to consider a statute of

19   limitations defense.      They found, rather than a

20   deliberate waiver, which I believe the record supports,

21   that the State's comments were cryptic, and I will

22   stress --

23                 JUSTICE ALITO:       But you're -- but you're arguing

24   that the court of appeals abused its discretion by

25   failing to rule in your favor on an argument that you

 1   didn't make?

 2                  MS. LORD:    No.     I -- the court was aware of

 3   Day, and the court analyzed what it was doing under Day,

 4   and it determined whether there was a deliberate waiver.

 5   Once the court found there was a deliberate waiver, I

 6   definitely challenged that finding.                I -- there's a very

 7   strong argument not included within the -- the -- the

 8   questions presented, that this is a totally timely

 9   petition.    And it's only a -- it's a very difficult

10   argument, which is one of the reasons why it shows how

11   much the State's actions in the district court were

12   strategic.

13                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But you had two

14   opportunities at least to make the argument based on the

15   original postconviction motion, the 1995 postconviction

16   motion.   You -- you did not raise that.              You were silent

17   twice.

18                  MS. LORD:    Silent on the impact of the 19 --

19   we were not silent on the impact of the 1995 motion.

20   We've always said, and in fact the State has never

21   disputed, that that was a properly filed motion, and the

22   only issue was whether it was tolled -- whether it

23   tolled the statute of limitations period until 2004.

24   And the State realized that that issue -- if they were

25   to prevail on the timeliness issue, it was a very, very


                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   difficult issue.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Well, then, I'm confused

 3   because I thought that there was -- it was conceded that

 4   the question was asked, did you file another

 5   postconviction motion?      Answer:       No.

 6                 MS. LORD:    I understand your question now.

 7   When Mr. Wood was pro se, he filled out pro se motions,

 8   and in those pro se motions, he did say that there --

 9   and I'm talking about the 2004 motion -- he said there

10   was no prior postconviction motion.

11                 And I believe he was confused because if you

12   look at the forms, both the Federal forms and the State

13   forms that show what a -- a defendant should check, it

14   makes it sound like a motion has to have been ruled on.

15   And Mr. Wood was pro se and simply confused.           And no one

16   else was confused once the State entered their

17   appearance.   They knew that the 1995 motion was still

18   pending.   All they had to do was sit at a computer and

19   bring up the minute orders from the State, and they

20   could learn that.

21                 So, the courts in making their rulings

22   always from the time -- and, you know, one of the

23   reasons why what happened was so strategic and so clear

24   is that the district court had initially dismissed

25   Mr. Wood's petition as untimely.            And --

 1               JUSTICE KAGAN:        Ms. Lord, could I ask you

 2   about the first question presented?

 3               MS. LORD:     Yes.

 4               JUSTICE KAGAN:        As I understand the opposing

 5   argument, it goes sort of like this:             It says, in Day,

 6   we said it's fine to do this in the district court.

 7   Even if the party hasn't raised it, the court can raise

 8   it on this exact issue.      In Granberry, we said with

 9   respect to a different issue that the appellate court

10   could raise it.   And, in Day, we said that those two

11   issues were really the same.

12               So, that seems sort of like a logical

13   argument that just gets you to a place where you lose on

14   the first question, unless perhaps there's a difference

15   between a court raising a question sua sponte and a

16   court allowing a party to raise it later than the party

17   ought to have raised it.      Are you relying on that

18   distinction, or are you questioning the logic of the

19   basic argument that Granberry and Day decided this?

20               MS. LORD:     Both.         And with respect to the

21   first argument about there being a difference between a

22   party presenting an issue and a court sua sponte raising

23   the issue, there is a difference.           And the courts -- the

24   circuit courts do not always make that distinction and

25   do not always focus on that.            For example, in Granberry,

                                                                         13
 1   it actually was a case where the party presented -- the

 2   State presented on appeal the exhaustion issue, and the

 3   court agreed to hear it even though the State hadn't

 4   raised it below.

 5               Here, you know, at least five times in our

 6   joint appendix, you'll see the court saying that they

 7   can't act as an advocate for Petitioner.              And in,

 8   fact, when the Petitioner, Mr. Wood, tried to raise an

 9   -- the exhaustion issue again, the Tenth Circuit in its

10   certificate of appealability said he is bound by his

11   decision to dismiss these unexhausted claims,

12   notwithstanding his pro se status.              And in the same

13   breath, the court of appeals resurrected the at least

14   concededly forfeited statute of limitations defense on

15   behalf of the State.

16               But I'd also like to --

17               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         I'm a little confused.

18   You seem to be arguing that because the court of appeals

19   raised it before the party did, that that's worse than a

20   party raising it first.     Is that your position?           That

21   that -- that the court of appeals has more power after a

22   party who has forfeited below or waived below now tries

23   to come up on appeal and assert a defense that they

24   didn't assert below?   Now the court of appeals has more

25   power?

 1               MS. LORD:    It raises different concerns.             My

 2   concern is not the relative power.              It's that when a

 3   court is raising something sua sponte, it defeats the

 4   party presentation principle.           That's one concern.

 5               When the court is -- when the party raises

 6   it after having forfeited, everyone concedes here that

 7   they wouldn't be allowed to.           So, in essence, what

 8   happens is the court is acting as a super-advocate

 9   for --

10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           But those arguments were

11   rejected in Granberry and Day.

12               MS. LORD:    Well, that --

13               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Why should they win now?

14               MS. LORD:    Well, and that was -- I was going

15   to -- I had a second part of my answer to Justice Kagan,

16   which is there's something really different going on in

17   Granberry and in Day, and you can't add the two and come

18   up with a neat package such as what's suggested by the

19   State.

20               And, in Granberry, of course, as the Court

21   all knows, the Court was dealing with exhaustion, and it

22   was dealing with exhaustion, which goes to the heart of

23   habeas and comity and all those concerns, at a time when

24   dismissing a case to exhaust claims -- all that would do

25   is delay Federal relief.     It wouldn't eliminate Federal

 1   relief.

 2               And this Court in Rhines v. Weber recognizes

 3   that when AEDPA -- AEDPA was passed, it transformed the

 4   landscape, and it really made some changes.          And whether

 5   the -- the notion in Granberry that exhaustion can be

 6   raised for the first time on appeal transfers to the

 7   statute of limitations -- I think there's real doubt

 8   about that, and I think that goes to an important

 9   question and the question that the Court granted cert

10   on.

11               JUSTICE KAGAN:       But didn't Day say that

12   those two issues were functionally identical for this

13   purpose?

14               MS. LORD:    Not for this purpose.        And by

15   "this purpose" I mean the court of appeals' authority to

16   raise sua sponte the defense.          In Day, this Court --

17   there were two prongs to Day.          In the context of Day,

18   which was, you know, where the State had filed a Rule 5

19   response and patently erroneously calculated the -- the

20   limitations period, and the court noticed it, and

21   there's no law that required, as this Court held, the

22   court to muzzle itself and not mention you've

23   miscalculated these days.

24               We're in a totally different situation.             And

25   the Rules of Civil Procedure allowed what happened in

 1   Day.    They don't allow what happened in our case.

 2   And --

 3                  JUSTICE ALITO:       What Rule of Civil Procedure

 4   applies here?    You're talking about appellate procedure

 5   here.    Is there a rule of appellate procedure that

 6   governs this?

 7                  MS. LORD:    I'm referring to Civil Rule of

 8   Procedure 8(b) and 12.

 9                  JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, they refer to what

10   happens in the district court, and Day dealt with that.

11   Now you're in the court of appeals.                What rule is there

12   that addresses the situation in the court of appeals?

13                  MS. LORD:    Well, there's the traditional

14   rule that if you don't raise it, you lose it, when we're

15   talking about a statute of limitations defense.               And

16   it's really key here because when AEDPA engrafted this

17   1-year statute of limitations into the habeas

18   proceedings, it knew how 1-year statute of limitations

19   were treated.    And, yes, in Day, quite correctly the

20   Court held that in that context you're going to treat

21   those defenses the same, especially with respect to Rule

22   4, which would allow a court to dismiss a petition just

23   on its face.

24                  JUSTICE ALITO:       You made an argument in your

25   brief that I found a little difficult to follow, but --


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                           17
 1   so, maybe you can explain it.            You seemed to suggest

 2   that the State's position on timeliness in the district

 3   court somehow induced your client to dismiss the claims

 4   that were arguably not exhausted.            And I found it

 5   difficult to understand why the -- why your client's

 6   strategy as to whether he wanted to dismiss those claims

 7   or not would be affected by the State's position on

 8   timeliness.

 9                 MS. LORD:    Well, if the State had challenged

10   timeliness at the stage that AEDPA contemplates it

11   would, it would have created a real complicated issue on

12   abandonment, and I think the briefs suggest just how

13   complicated that is under Colorado law.            And if that had

14   happened, the court very well could have, district

15   court, could have appointed counsel for Mr. Wood, I

16   mean, if there had been an evidentiary hearing, if, as

17   the Tenth Circuit found, the issue was so complex that

18   counsel was necessary.

19                 So, once you had counsel, in the State's

20   reply or in its answer, they indicated that several of

21   Mr. Wood's claims were not exhausted.             And some of those

22   claims were in that 1995 motion that was pending.             With

23   counsel, there could have been a request for a stay and

24   abey.   There could have been so much that was done.

25   Mr. -- but because the State chose to simplify the

                                   Official

                                                                              18
 1   proceedings -- that's what they did, and it was not

 2   inadvertent; and it wasn't a mistake.                They chose to make it

 3   simple and to focus on exhaustion.                So, they got four

 4   claims dismissed on exhaustion grounds, and then they

 5   dealt with the other two claims on the merits.

 6                 They also had a procedural default issue

 7   which was totally unconstitutional.                They were relying

 8   on a procedural default that didn't exist at the time

 9   you had to raise it.

10                 But that simplified the proceedings, made it

11   more a question of law.       Mr. --

12                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          So, what's wrong with

13   that?    Why should we be penalizing the State for trying

14   to simplify an action and make it move more

15   expeditiously?

16                 MS. LORD:    Absolutely we should not.            But we

17   also should hold them to that strategic choice, which is

18   what Day says you do.      And we have to hold them to that

19   choice because there were consequences, and there were

20   changes of positions.      And they got the benefit of going

21   forward and just looking at exhaustion.                They eliminated

22   the risk of an evidentiary hearing.                They eliminated the

23   risk of a lawyer.    They induced Mr. -- and I -- they

24   induced Mr. Wood to dismiss four claims because -- oh,

25   sorry.   Because -- I'm sorry.           I didn't see you.

 1                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              No, no.    Keep going

 2   with your --

 3                  MS. LORD:    No -- because he was assured that

 4   he could go forward on two substantial constitutional

 5   claims without worrying about time bar, because the

 6   State said that.    They said twice we are not

 7   challenging, we will not challenge, timeliness.

 8                  JUSTICE ALITO:       That's what I don't

 9   understand.    I -- why -- you have two situations.                One

10   situation, the State's raising timeliness.                   So, he says,

11   okay, they're raising timeliness; I'm not going to

12   dismiss my -- the claims that they say are not

13   exhausted.    The other situation, they -- they don't say

14   anything about timeliness.          And he said now I'm going to

15   dismiss the claims that are -- that they say are

16   unexhausted.

17                  I don't understand the connection.

18                  MS. LORD:    Well, the connection is the State

19   guaranteed that they would not challenge timeliness, and

20   that allowed Mr. Wood to go forward on two

21   constitutional claims without ever having to worry that

22   they would be subject to time bar.

23                  And when the court --

24                  JUSTICE ALITO:       Yes, I understand why that's

25   a benefit to him, but what is the connection between

26   that and the dismissal of the unexhausted claims?

 1                  MS. LORD:    Oh.     Because if they had -- if

 2   they had challenged timeliness, they would have raised

 3   this very complicated issue, because the only way they

 4   can win on timeliness is to win on this newfangled

 5   notion of abandonment under Colorado law, which under

 6   Colorado law requires a hearing and requires factual

 7   development.

 8                  And once they pursued in the district court

 9   that claim of abandonment, it was very likely that a

10   lawyer would be appointed.          That lawyer could see that

11   there were claims still pending in the 1995 motion and

12   could possibly have sought a stay and abey, could have

13   gone and tried to exhaust those claims, serious

14   constitutional claims that were in the 1995 motion.

15                  And -- and maybe a better way of putting it

16   is if they had raised timeliness in the district court,

17   abandonment would have been front and center.         And even

18   though the court of appeals ultimately resolved this

19   issue without an evidentiary hearing, that was an abuse

20   of discretion itself, too.          It was totally contrary to

21   Colorado law, analyzing that issue.

22                  It is no small thing that the position that

23   they took in the district court allowed Mr. Wood to go

24   forward on two claims, two constitutional claims that

25   are substantial that the court has granted a certificate

 1   of appealability on.

 2               This is -- this case is so unlike Day in the

 3   sense -- if an appellate court can raise sua sponte the

 4   statute of limitations in a case like this, it can raise

 5   it in any case.   It invites the State to take a position

 6   in the district court which would be totally contrary to

 7   AEDPA's desire for streamlined proceedings.               It would --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Ms. Lord, an amicus brief

 9   filed on behalf of 15 States contends that the Civil --

10   the Rules of Civil Procedure are not what should be

11   consulted here, because they govern only to the extent

12   that they're not inconsistent with habeas rules, and

13   asserts that the -- the habeas rules should rather apply

14   and that they -- that they cut against your case.

15               Do you have a response to that?               Was it --

16   was it in your reply brief or --

17               MS. LORD:     It may be.        I believe in some of

18   the briefs what I've said is there is no inconsistency

19   between Rule 5's requirement that the defense be set

20   forth and the traditional recognition that statute of

21   limitations is lost if not raised.               And I cited the

22   Court to Jones v. Bock, which stresses that, for mere

23   policy reasons, we shouldn't deviate from the rules that

24   would otherwise apply.     And I think --

25               JUSTICE ALITO:        Isn't the screening function

 1   that the -- that a district court performs in the habeas

 2   case inconsistent with the traditional rule about

 3   raising affirmative defenses?

 4               MS. LORD:     Well, that's the district court,

 5   and that's one of the key differences between the

 6   district court and the appellate court.              The appellate

 7   court can issue a certificate of appealability.              The

 8   district court has that prescreening function, which is

 9   just like the prescreening function in the PLRA, where

10   this Court looked at a circuit's attempt to create rules

11   that would address policy concerns and deviated and put

12   an enhanced pleading requirement on prisoners and said,

13   I believe unanimously, that that shouldn't be done.

14               There's a real virtue in having a

15   predictable rule.   There's a real virtue in letting the

16   States or -- letting the States know in the context of

17   this Court's Federal timing rules that they have to

18   raise it, the statute of limitations defense, when

19   they're ordered to and when Rule 5 requires them to.

20               You should not adopt the State's position

21   when it will just invite the sort of sandbagging that

22   this Court has taken care to avoid.              You don't want

23   straddling by the State on something as important to

24   judicial efficiency as asserting the statute of

25   limitations in a timely manner.

 6                  MR. DOMENICO:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 7   please the Court:

 8                  In contrast to the new and fairly

 9   complicated set of doctrines my friend asked the Court

10   to adopt today, this Court can resolve this case by

11   applying two straightforward longstanding rules.

12                  First, in Granberry v. Greer, the Court

13   recognized that courts are not bound by a State's

14   failure to properly argue and preserve a procedural bar

15   to a habeas claim.

16                  And, second, to the extent there is an

17   exception to that rule for deliberate waivers, the Court

18   should apply the common rule that a waiver must be

19   unequivocal.

 1   question?   Well, that's a common rule.            From

 2   statutory rights such as in Olano --

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:         No, just give me a citation.

 4               MR. DOMENICO:       College Savings Bank is one,

 5   probably the clearest case.

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:         Has to -- has to be what?

 7   What's the word?    "Unequivocal"?

 8               MR. DOMENICO:       Unequivocal is a common --

 9   for waiver of everything --

10               JUSTICE BREYER:         Because I'll look at the statute.

11   Now, I did look at Black's Law Dictionary, and Black's

12   Law Dictionary, looking up forfeiture and waiver, it

13   seems like you lose.

14               My analysis would be this:             Forfeiture is

15   the "loss of a right" -- that's what's at issue --

16   "because of a crime."     That doesn't apply.          "Because of

17   a breach of obligation."       That doesn't apply.        "Neglect

18   of duty."   Now, that does because you didn't file the

19   answer.   Okay?   So, that's forfeited.

20               Now you look over to waiver and, as you say,

21   it says "voluntary relinquishment of a legal right."

22   Okay, what's the legal right?             The legal right is to get

23   the case dismissed.

24               So, I'm the judge.            I say, State, do you

25   want to get the case dismissed?            I just gave your

                                                                             25
 1   answer.    Okay.   I say you voluntarily relinquish your

 2   legal right.    Your legal right was to get the case

 3   dismissed, and you relinquished it.                You didn't assert

 4   it.

 5                  That said, that would be the difference.

 6   And she's saying that.       She's saying that makes a lot of

 7   sense.    When you read Day, they're worried about the

 8   State doing something inadvertently, making a mistake.

 9   So, what the judge says is:          State, you know you have a

10   pretty good claim here on statute of limitations,

11   but you didn't assert it.         So, I'm going to give you the

12   right to assert it.      Go ahead, assert it even though

13   it's late.    You overcome the forfeiture.

14                  Now you say:     I assert it, Your Honor.

15   Okay, you haven't waived it.              Now you say:   I don't

16   really care.

17                  MR. DOMENICO:      Justice Breyer, what the

18   State was doing here was not strategically trying to --

19                  JUSTICE BREYER:       Oh, no.        I assume they

20   didn't do anything mean -- strategic; it wasn't a trick.

21   It was just what is it that they did?               And what they did

22   is they were given the opportunity to overcome the

23   forfeiture, to assert the statute of limitations claim,

24   and they didn't do it.       They didn't want to do it.             I

25   don't know why they didn't want to do it, because there

 1   was a lot of trouble raising other issues, dah, dah,

 2   dah.    But that's their business.           The fact is they

 3   didn't do it.

 4                  MR. DOMENICO:      Justice Breyer, the -- the

 5   Court has been clear that a State's failure -- normally,

 6   that's true.    The normal rule under the Rules of Civil

 7   Procedure is a forfeiture of that sort, failure to raise

 8   an argument, is deemed essentially to be a waiver under

 9   those definitions.

10                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But this wasn't failure

11   to raise an argument; this was representing to the court

12   we will not challenge timeliness.             That was the

13   representation made to the court.             That was not

14   negligent oversight in not raising the question.             It was

15   an affirmative representation to the court that,

16   although we might have done it, we will not challenge

17   timeliness.

18                  MR. DOMENICO:      Justice Ginsburg, there --

19   there was an element of mistake, of negligence, as you

20   say, but -- but it also was --

21                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       Didn't the State adhere to

22   that?

23                  MR. DOMENICO:      That's right, Justice Scalia.

24                  JUSTICE SCALIA:       It kept its word, didn't

25   it?

 1                  MR. DOMENICO:      What the State was trying to

 2   do, I think, is slightly different than would make sense

 3   in any other context.       Because of the special procedures

 4   we're under in a habeas -- a pre-answer response, what

 5   we were telling the court was we will not assert this

 6   argument unless there's further inquiry from the court.

 7   Now, normally in court there would be --

 8                  JUSTICE BREYER:       Wait, wait, wait.      When you

 9   say "further," I want to be very precise about the

10   distinction.    You have to put it in your answer.            You

11   didn't.    Okay.   So, that's a forfeiture.           So, now the

12   judge says you didn't put it in your answer, but I'll

13   raise it.    So, now you have the right to have the case

14   dismissed for statute of limitations.              Do you want to

15   exercise that right?      The answer to that question was

16   you didn't.

17                  MR. DOMENICO:      That is --

18                  JUSTICE BREYER:       You said you didn't care.

19                  MR. DOMENICO:      That's -- I don't think

20   that's quite an accurate characterization of what the

21   State --

22                  JUSTICE BREYER:       All right.      Well, but, one,

24   first question, because so far I'm just stuck on Black's

25   Law Dictionary.     And I would like you to have better

 2                MR. DOMENICO:       Well, the Black's Law

 3   Dictionary, of course, applies a usual rule.              This Court

 4   has made clear in Granberry and Day that the usual rule

 5   that a forfeiture of a legal right means that it's not

 6   to be brought up again, that it doesn't apply to bind

 7   the court's hands.    Granberry and Day make that quite

 8   clear.   What happened in Granberry would have been a

 9   forfeiture --

10                JUSTICE KAGAN:        But, Mr. Domenico, you're

11   saying something considerably more.               You're saying that

12   when a State gets up -- after inquiry by the district

13   court, when a State gets up and says we do not want to

14   press this argument; now we're not saying the

15   argument is wrong, because after all we're a repeat

16   player and we're going to hear that argument again, and

17   we are not saying that argument is wrong, but in this

18   case we do not want to press that argument.              That's --

19   that's unequivocal to me.

20                MR. DOMENICO:       It's unequivocal that we were

21   not going to press it again, though I think the

22   implication -- there would have been no reason to have

23   raised it initially.     There would have been no reason to

24   include this caveat about refusing to concede, if that

25   was all we were trying to say.           There are easy ways for

 1   a State to take the issue off the table.

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Can I -- can I ask you,

 3   do you mean to tell me that, using your own words in

 4   your brief, that a waiver is the intentional abandonment

 5   of a known right?   I think you're equating intentional

 6   abandonment of a known right to be I have to admit I

 7   could win and I'm giving up that argument.

 8                MR. DOMENICO:      Well, in this case --

 9                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Is that what you're

10   saying -- deliberate?

11                MR. DOMENICO:      Well, you have to know what

12   it is you're giving up.

13                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Well, you knew you had a

14   defense under the statute of limitations.

15                MR. DOMENICO:      Sure.

16                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         You thought, because you

17   conceded, that you weren't conceding that it was

18   untimely.   So, you were conceding you thought it was

19   untimely, and despite admitting that you knew you had a

20   defense, that you knew it could win, you were choosing

21   not to assert it.   So, tell me why that's not either an

22   intentional waiver, a deliberate waiver, or an

23   abandonment of a known right?

24                MR. DOMENICO:      The -- what we were

 1   it was our ability to force the court to address the

 2   issue.   In any other context, I agree that maybe --

 3   there may be a distinction with no difference, but in

 4   this case because there is discrete --

 5                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         You were protecting the

 6   court's right to do whatever it wanted.

 7                 MR. DOMENICO:      There was a screening --

 8   there is a screening function.           We were raising the

 9   issue precisely to put it on the court's table for

10   consideration.   In a habeas --

11                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So, why isn't it an

12   abuse of discretion for an appellate court, when there

13   has been an intentional abandonment of a known right, to

14   sua sponte raise that defense?

15                 MR. DOMENICO:      Well, we did not take off the

16   table the court's right to consider the issue.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:       You say you didn't abandon

18   the right.    Isn't that your position?           You did not

22   opportunity to raise it yourself.

 1   district court, unless asked, to argue the issue.

 2                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, let me give you this

 3   example of -- of a regular civil case:            There -- there

 4   are two defendants and the same claim against two

 5   defendants.   One defendant files an answer and raises a

 6   statute of limitations defense; the other one doesn't.

 7   The judge asks the second defendant, are you going to

 8   amend your complaint?      And the defendant says no.       Now,

 9   is that a waiver or is that a forfeiture?

10                 MR. DOMENICO:      Well, I think in your typical

11   case, it doesn't matter because forfeitures generally

12   are deemed to be waivers, I think, in your typical case.

13   That's not true under Granberry and Day.           The court has

14   made clear that a forfeiture is different than a

15   deliberate waiver.

16                 JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, under the terminology

17   that we're using, wouldn't that be a forfeiture?

18                 MR. DOMENICO:      I think it's better

19   understood as a forfeiture.         Simply you're not going to

20   argue the issue, but the issue doesn't necessarily need

21   to be taken off the --

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:       Well, that's why your

23   colleague on the other side -- why she made this point

24   the way she made it.     I think there's no disagreement,

25   at least as far as I hear Justice Scalia.           Look, he did

 1   abandon his right, the State, to push the matter.

 2   That's abandonment.      He didn't abandon the right to get

 3   the case dismissed if the judge pursues it.

 4                So, your colleague says -- or as she says, a

 5   court of appeals does have the power on its own to

 6   overcome a forfeiture.       That's Day.           But they don't have

 7   the power on its own to overcome the waiver.               And that's

 8   what they're doing.      They don't have the power, in other

 9   words, to decide it themselves.            They only have the

10   power to overcome a forfeiture.

11                MR. DOMENICO:        Well, if the Court looks at

12   the -- where this deliberate waiver exception to the

13   Granberry and Day rule comes from, it comes from Day,

14   and the concern there is with a court overriding a

15   State's decision to waive, to take the issue off the

16   table.   There are examples of States doing that.              And

17   when they do it, they are clear about it, and you can

18   tell when it would be overridden.

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But the consequence of

20   that was the district court then had to deal with the

21   case on the merits, had to take up the two exhausted

22   claims and rule on them, after having told the district

23   court you don't need -- we're not raising the statute of

24   limitations, we will not challenge timeliness.               So, you

25   put the district court to the necessity of deciding the

 1   case on the merits.      It does.         It takes up the two

 2   unexhausted claims and deals with them on the merits.

 3                 In -- in Day, absolutely nothing transpired

 4   between the State saying the claim was timely and the

 5   magistrate's detection of the computation error.             The

 6   district court wasn't put to what was unnecessary work.

 7   If the -- it was the consequence of saying we won't

 8   challenge it that forced the district judge to deal with

 9   them on the merits.

10                 In Day, the counsel didn't bring up the

11   question because counsel thought that it was timely.               He

12   had miscalculated and made a mathematical error.             And

13   the judge then said, you know, I see that the number of

14   days that's required by statute, they have run.             And as

15   Day pointed out, at that point, the trial judge could

16   have said:   Now, you know, you miscalculated; wouldn't

17   you like to amend your complaint and put it in a

18   defense?

19                 So, the two cases, the two situations are --

20   are so different.    The district judge wasn't -- nobody

21   was made to do anything extra.             But in -- here, because

22   the attorney said we won't challenge it, the judge had

23   to deal with the case on the merits.

 1   obligation to protect the district court from having to

 2   engage in what, had we properly argued this, would have

 3   been unnecessary effort.

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Those are sunk costs,

 5   aren't they, Mr. Domenico?

 6                MR. DOMENICO:      They are, Justice --

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:       It's water over the dam,

 8   and the issue is whether the court of appeals will then

 9   have to repeat the district court's excursus into the

10   merits.

11                MR. DOMENICO:      That's exact --

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Right?

13                MR. DOMENICO:      That's exactly right.         The --

14   we have already spent that time.           The question now is

15   if -- if Mr. Wood prevails now, the court of appeals

16   will have to proceed to resolving the case on the

17   merits.   Instead, in this case, they applied the very

18   common principle that a court of appeals will affirm for

19   any basis supported by the record in order precisely to

20   avoid -- that happens fairly often.              They avoid having

21   to address a constitutional problem.              They save having

22   to engage in those efforts again.

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              That's a matter of

24   discretion with the court of appeals?

25                MR. DOMENICO:      Absolutely.         We recognize

 1   that this is in that middle ground where the court of

 2   appeals was certainly under no obligation to do this.

 3   Had the court of appeals refused to do it, we wouldn't

 4   be here demanding that they be forced to consider this

 5   issue.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:        And the court of appeals

 7   could have gotten mad at the fact that the district

 8   court was compelled to go through the merits, right?

 9               MR. DOMENICO:       Absolutely.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:        And for that reason could

11   have denied it.   But it didn't get mad, I guess.         I

12   don't know why.

13               MR. DOMENICO:       Well, it didn't get mad

14   partly, I think, perhaps because Mr. Wood never argued

15   that the issue was forfeited or waived at all until

16   after -- after the court of appeals had already resolved

17   the question.

18               JUSTICE ALITO:        Well, why do you say that

19   the position that the State took in the district court

20   prevented the district court from considering the

21   timeliness issue?   If it wasn't a deliberate waiver,

22   then the district court under Day wasn't prohibited from

23   -- from deciding the case untimely.

24               MR. DOMENICO:       Absolutely.      I do not think

25   that the district court was prohibited from considering


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

 1   it.    The only reason for us to have raised this sort of

 2   skeletal outline of the argument was precisely so the

 3   court of appeals would have the opportunity to consider

 4   it.

 5                 Remember, this was raised initially in the

 6   pre-answer response stage where the -- which is

 7   specifically part of the district court's preliminary

 8   consideration of the issue.         So, it was certainly ex

 9   ante quite possible that the response of the district

10   court would not be to simply ignore the issue as it did

11   but to either ask for additional briefing, as happens

12   with some regularity, to issue a show-cause order as it

13   had already done, or perhaps to dismiss the case again

14   as it had already done so.

15                 So, the issue was not off the table.       The

16   district court very much could have addressed the

17   question.

18                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Mr. Domenico, do I

19   understand your argument correctly to think that if you

20   had not said, or if the lawyer for the State had not

21   said we're not conceding, if all that the lawyer for the

22   State had said is we're not challenging this, Your

23   Honor, would that count as a deliberate waiver under

24   Day?

25                 MR. DOMENICO:      I think that's a harder case.

 1   The lead-up to that, I think, undermines the -- at

 2   least, the unequivocal nature of -- of that statement

 3   because there would have been no reason to have laid out

 4   the potential argument if what we were really trying to

 5   do was waive the -- waive the entire issue as Day uses

 6   that language.    If that's what we were trying to do,

 7   there would have been no reason to do that either.

 8                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          The new --

 9                 JUSTICE KAGAN:        But this is --

10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          I'm sorry.   The new case

11   law is what I said.      When you say I won't raise this

12   defense, I waive it, everything you said except saying I

13   don't admit it, today, before a circuit court abuses its

14   discretion, you also have to say I am waiving the right

15   of the court of appeals to raise this sua sponte.

16   That's -- that's -- you want that to be what you need to

17   do for us to find a waiver.

18                 MR. DOMENICO:       I don't think you need to say

19   that.    I don't think there necessarily need to be any

20   magic words at all, but it needs to be unequivocal and

21   clear, not ambiguous language that we're going to spend

22   an hour here today trying to debate what it was that we

23   meant.    That's the only rule we're asking for today.

24                 And the contrary rule really provides some

25   perverse incentives to States.            I mean, here the State

                                   Official

                                                                           38
 1   was trying to be candid with the court.             It discovered

 2   this 1995 motion on its own.             Mr. Wood had never

 3   mentioned it in his filings.             He had already briefed the

 4   timeliness issue twice in the district court without

 5   mentioning it, let alone raising it in any of his

 6   petitions.

 7                 The State found this and tried to be candid,

 8   that we weren't entirely clear about how the argument

 9   played out.   The alternative is that States will be

10   forced into something more than scorched earth, throw

11   everything at the court, see what sticks, and that's not

12   in anybody's interest, let alone the Federal courts' or

13   habeas petitioners'.

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           There is something about

15   the principle of party presentation.              The party raises

16   the issue.    The court of appeals is the court of review,

17   not first view.   Here -- in Day, the -- the lawyer did

18   not know that he had a statute of limitations defense,

19   that -- did not know because he had miscalculated the

20   time.   Here the State knew very well that it did have a

21   statute of limitations argument, but it says we're not

22   challenging it.

23                 And then the ordinary thing is that a court

24   of appeals reviews decisions of the district court;

25   doesn't decide questions in the first instance.               But


                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   here you are saying the attorney can tell district judge

 2   don't decide this; go on to the merits.            Then the court

 3   of appeals, which is supposed to be reviewing what the

 4   district court does, instead deals with that question in

 5   the first instance.      That seems like an odd inversion of

 6   the role of the -- of the district court and court of

 7   appeals.

 8               MR. DOMENICO:         Justice Ginsburg, again, I

 9   don't think it's quite accurate to say that we told the

10   district court not to address the issue.            We told the

11   district court there was an issue that we were going to

12   refrain from presenting our full argument on it.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You didn't say we're

14   going to refrain from it.         You said, District Judge,

15   Your Honor, we will not challenge timeliness.

16               MR. DOMENICO:         Right.

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Didn't have any

18   qualifications.

19               MR. DOMENICO:         Well, I -- I do think we

20   qualified it.   The only reason to include the language

21   about not conceding was to qualify that.            The only

22   reason to lay out the argument was to make sure that the

23   court was able to consider it in its screening

24   procedures and --

25               JUSTICE KAGAN:          But isn't the concession

 1   language really going to a different point?                 The

 2   concession language is going to the point of why it is

 3   that you're not raising it, that you're not challenging

 4   it.

 5                 MR. DOMENICO:      I don't think it is.

 6                 If I may, Mr. Chief Justice, finish.

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Please.

 8                 MR. DOMENICO:      I don't think that there is

 9   any reason for us to have been concerned about how -- if

10   we had simply stated we are not challenging it, there

11   would have been no concern about this affecting any

12   other case whatsoever.      The only case in which to be

13   concerned that what we said would be misconstrued as a

14   waiver was this case.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

23   may it please the Court:

24                 This Court's decisions in Granberry and Day

25   answer the first question presented.               I think Petitioner

 1   no longer contests that, and the Court can simply

 2   decide the first question presented on that basis and

 3   reaffirm what it said in Granberry.

 4                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Ms. Sherry, there is one

 5   difference.   If you put Granberry and Day together, it

 6   gets you most of the way there.           The one difference is

 7   that here there was a sua sponte decision by the court;

 8   whereas, in even the combination of Granberry and Day,

 9   it was a party that raised it, although the party raised

10   it late.

11                 So, why should that difference not matter?

12   If you think that party presentation has some

13   consequence in this area, you might think that that

14   difference does matter, that once you get to the court

15   of appeals and even then the party doesn't raise it,

16   sort of enough is enough.

17                 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:          A couple of responses to

18   that.    Number one, I think it's significant that Day

19   itself was a case in which the court raised it.           It

20   raised it on its own.

21                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       But at the trial court

22   level.

23                 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:          At the trial level.

24                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Of course, the habeas court

25   has a significant screening function.

 1                MS. ARBUS SHERRY:            No, that's certainly

 2   true.   I think the procedural default cases are another

 3   good example.   This Court in Day cited a number of them,

 4   a number of them of which were cases in which the court

 5   of appeals was raising the issue sua sponte.

 6                On page 12 of our brief, we cite a number of

 7   procedural default cases.         A lot of them come up in the

 8   sua sponte context.      And the courts of appeals have not

 9   made a distinction between the two.

10                I think they certainly implicate different

11   concerns.   For example, to the extent this Court has

12   been worried about sandbagging or strategic behavior, I

13   think that's largely absent in circumstances where the

14   court is raising it on its own motions as opposed to the

15   party belatedly raising the issue on appeal.

16                So, I do think if you look at Granberry, you

17   look at Day, you look at Caspari, you look at Schiro,

18   and you look at the procedural default cases, I think

19   that really does resolve the first question presented.

20   And, again, I don't think Petitioner really argues

21   otherwise at this point.

22                JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, I may have forgotten

23   the procedural complications of this case, but here, did

24   the State have any opportunity before the court of

25   appeals to raise the timeliness issue prior to the time


                           Alderson Reporting Company

                                                                      43
 1   when the court of appeals issued its certificate of

 2   appealability?   And if the court of appeals had not

 3   issued a certificate of appealability on the issue of

 4   timeliness, would the issue have come up at all?

 5               MS. ARBUS SHERRY:           The State did have an

 6   opportunity in the court of appeals because, after the

 7   application for a certificate of appealability was

 8   filed, the court did order the State to file a response,

 9   and the State didn't argue timeliness in that response.

10   But when the court of appeals did ask for briefing on

11   this issue in the certificate of appealability process,

12   the State, of course, did have an opportunity to respond

13   there, and it did argue that the petition was untimely,

14   and it strongly argued that.

15               And so, I guess, turning to the second

16   question presented, of deliberate waiver, I don't think

17   there has been a deliberate waiver in the way that Day

18   spoke about that term here for two primary reasons.

19   Number one, when Day spoke of deliberate waiver, it

20   spoke of overriding a State's deliberate waiver, and I

21   think if you look, when the court of appeals decided the

22   timeliness question, there's no way to look at that as

23   the State -- as a court, rather, actually overriding the

24   State's deliberate waiver.        At that point, the State had

25   argued that the petition was untimely.


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1               Petitioner never argued that the court

 2   shouldn't decide the issue, never argued that that --

 3   that the State had waived that issue below.           And I think

 4   at that time, it's really difficult to characterize that

 5   as overriding the State's deliberate waiver.

 6               The other point I would make is in the

 7   district court --

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           And the difference is

 9   that in Day counsel didn't know that he had a statute of

10   limitations defense.    So -- but the court suggested it.

11   In this case, the defendant -- I mean, the -- the

12   attorney knew, the State's attorney knew, they had a

13   statute of limitations defense and nonetheless told the

14   court we won't challenge timeliness.

15               It seems a big difference between the

16   factual background of Day, where the lawyer didn't know

17   there was a statute of limitations defense, and this

18   one, where the lawyer knew very well there was and

19   decided to tell the district court not to -- not to deal

20   with that issue.

21               MS. ARBUS SHERRY:           I -- I think that

22   certainly is true, but I think it's important, in

23   deciding whether or not this should be treated as a

24   deliberate waiver, to look at what the consequences of

25   treating it as such would be.           The consequences of


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   treating it as a deliberate waiver under the language of

 2   Day is that the court's hands would be bound; the court

 3   would be unable to decide the timeliness question.                  And

 4   it's not just the court of appeals; it's the district

 5   court as well.    So, if this were a clear deliberate

 6   waiver in district court when the State filed its

 7   pre-answer response, the district court would have been

 8   without any authority to consider --

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:         So, why is that -- why is

10   that a bad result?      The -- I -- imagine the facts are

11   these:   The State forgets to waive the issue, to raise

12   the issue in the defense.          All right?        Forgets.

13                 Judge:    State you haven't raised a statute

14   of limitations.

15                 State -- one possible answer -- thank you,

16   Your Honor.   We overlooked our forfeiture.               We want to

17   raise it.

 1   because of habeas.    So, we protect the State at least by

 2   giving them a chance to make the argument when they

 3   forget or some other reason.             Now we gave them the

 4   chance.   Now they say:     Huh?         Who cares?

 5                 All right?    If that's their attitude, why is

 6   it the habeas court's business to protect the State from

 7   themselves?

 8                 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:           Because it's not just

 9   about the State.   Because it's -- because of the

10   institutional interests that are at stake.             And that's

11   why Granberry and Schiro and Caspari and Day allowed

12   there to be consideration of these issues despite

13   forfeiture.   It's because of the institutional

14   interest --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:       Despite forfeiture?

16                 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:           Despite forfeiture.

17   Right.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:       And --

19                 MS. ARBUS SHERRY:           And -- and that's the

20   very question here, whether it should be treated like

21   forfeiture or whether it would be treated like waiver.

22   And the reason why I think it would be a bad result to

23   treat it as waiver here and why it would be bad to have

24   bound the district court's hands in this case, if you

25   look at what happened here, the district court on its

                                                                         47
 1   own motion initially dismissed this as untimely.          It

 2   came back and it went to the State and said, you know, I

 3   need more information.     And the State provided that

 4   additional information.

 5                It would be a somewhat odd system for --

 6   when the district court now had this information in

 7   front of it, now knew about the 1995 motion, for it not

 8   to have been able to do anything further with respect to

 9   timeliness on -- on that point.          The fact that the State

10   for whatever reason decided to press other issues

11   shouldn't bind the district court's hands except in the

12   rarest of circumstances.

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Except we have a system

14   where the court doesn't raise issue on its own.          The

15   ordinary rule is the party presents it, and when the

16   party says to the court we will not challenge

17   timeliness, it seems to me that's quite a different

18   thing from just having an answer that doesn't raise the

19   defense.   It's affirmatively representing to the court

20   that we -- we are not making this an issue.

21                MS. ARBUS SHERRY:          And -- and to be clear, I

22   think that's certainly a factor that the courts can and

23   do consider in deciding whether to exercise their

24   discretion to consider a timeliness issue.          The question

25   here is whether or not the court should lose any

                                                                           48
 1   discretion to consider that issue.

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But Day did say that

 3   if -- if a party knowingly waives a limitations defense,

 4   then no court can bring it up.         The party has made the

 5   choice.

 6               MS. ARBUS SHERRY:          That's -- that's what

 7   this Court said in Day, and I guess the question is --

 8   is how strictly that should be construed.             And our

 9   position would be that it should be strictly construed

10   because of the consequences of that waiver.             And, again,

11   I think it's significant that the Court in Day did talk

12   about overriding a State's deliberate waiver.

13               In the dissent, Justice Scalia, you

14   mentioned the example of a court amending a party's

15   pleading over that party's objections.             And I think that

16   really is a narrow circumstance in which the waiver rule

17   should operate.

18               It's not that the State's behavior is

19   irrelevant to the question before the court as to

20   whether the court should exercise its discretion; it's

21   actually quite relevant, and it's something that courts

22   of appeals can and do look at.         The question is whether

23   or not the courts lack any authority to consider a

24   limitations defense or other procedural defense --

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              So, you're saying


                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that if the court of -- court says, you know, you have a

 2   good state -- limitations defense, you would clearly win

 3   on that, but I'm going to ignore it, even though you

 4   didn't raise it?

 5               MS. ARBUS SHERRY:          I'm sorry, Your Honor.

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Would it be an abuse

 7   of discretion for the court not to accept a valid,

 8   evident statute of limitations defense on the ground

 9   that the State didn't raise it?

10               MS. ARBUS SHERRY:          I think under Day -- the

11   question is whether it's a deliberate waiver, and I

12   think, under Day, the Court said quite plainly that it

13   would be an abuse of discretion in those circumstances.

14   And I think there are a limited number of circumstances

15   where -- where that makes sense, and I think the Court

16   has seen examples of that recently this term, for

17   example.

18               The Court denied cert in a case, Buck v.

19   Thaler, earlier this term, where -- a predecessor case

20   that is an example of the State expressly waiving a

21   procedural default defense because it wanted the court

22   to reach the merits.   In that case, the State said quite

23   plainly -- in the predecessor case, I should say, the

24   State said quite plainly because the use of race in the

25   punishment phase seriously undermined the fairness and

                                                                            50
 1   integrity of the judicial process, the director

 2   expressly waives any procedural bar with respect to that

 3   claim.

 4                Now, that is the quintessential deliberate

 5   waiver.   And it took it off table, unlike what happened

 6   in this case.

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

 8                Ms. Lord, you have 3 minutes remaining.

 9              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN A. LORD

10                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11                MS. LORD:    The problems with the rulings

12   urged by the amicus and by the State are severalfold.

13   One, it's not contemplated at all by AEDPA that the

14   1-year Federal timing statute of limitations would be

15   subject to such a wide latitude in the court of appeals

16   to resurrect defenses.

17                JUSTICE ALITO:       If a State knows that it has

18   a potential statute of limitations defense and says

19   nothing, is that a forfeiture or a waiver?

20                MS. LORD:    It would be a violation of

21   Rule 5, which requires them to assert a time bar if they

22   are required to file a response.           In our case, it also

23   would have been a violation of the court's order.

24                JUSTICE ALITO:       So, simply saying nothing

25   can be a waiver, in your view.

 1               MS. LORD:    Probably not.          But if you are --

 2               JUSTICE ALITO:       If the answer to that is

 3   not, then what is the difference between saying nothing,

 4   knowing that you have a defense, and saying we're not

 5   challenging but we're not conceding?

 6               What is the difference?

 7               MS. LORD:    Well, by not conceding, that

 8   doesn't undercut the deliberateness of the waiver.           It

 9   actually establishes it.     It establishes that they know

10   that there's a defense, and they're not agreeing that

11   the petition is timely, but they're deliberately

12   choosing not to assert the statute of limitations.

13               JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, let me just ask it one

14   more way, and then I'll --

15               MS. LORD:    I'm sorry.

16               JUSTICE ALITO:       Back in the office, they're

17   considering -- in the State's office, they're

18   considering what they're going to do.           And they say,

19   well, what we're going to do is we're not going to

20   challenge it, but we're not going to concede it.           And,

21   therefore, they say nothing.

22               MS. LORD:    In the face of Rule 5's

23   requirement, it could very well be a waiver.           And I'd

24   cite the court to Hill v. New York, which also addresses

25   one of the State's lawyers' points, which was a


                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                            52
 1   waiver -- for the State to waive a statute of

 2   limitations defense, its waiver has to be unequivocal

 3   and clear.   I don't know if they're suggesting that

 4   there also has to be an advisement by the court.               I

 5   don't think they're going that far.

 6                But the fact is, you look at the nature of

 7   the waiver or the right being waived.              And this Court

 8   recognized in Hill v. New York and other cases that if

 9   the right being waived is, for example, the right to be

10   tried in a timely fashion under IAD, it can be waived

11   just by a lawyer accepting a date.

12                And the statute of limitations issue here is

13   a typical strategic decision.           And when AEDPA brought

14   this in, it didn't bring it in as it brought in comity.

15   It is something to move the case along from the Federal

16   point of view.   And for this Court to adopt what --

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Finish your

18   sentence, please.

19                MS. LORD:    -- the State is suggesting will

20   just take away all the efficiencies that -- that that 1

21   year brought to bear.

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.
