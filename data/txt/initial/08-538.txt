 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               We'll hear argument

 4   next in Case 08-538, Schwab v. Reilly.

 5                 Mr. Goldblatt.

 6                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG G. GOLDBLATT

 7                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                 MR. GOLDBLATT:          Thank you.      Mr. Chief

 9   Justice, and may it please the Court:

10                 The debtor in this case claimed, in the

11   third column of Schedule C, a $10,718 exempt interest in

12   her kitchen equipment.       That claim of exemption was

13   fully proper.     The trustee did not object to it because

14   it was unobjectionable.

15                 The debtor's position here is that because

16   of what she wrote in the fourth column, where she

17   estimated the value of the equipment as the same amount

18   of the exemption, that her claim of exemption itself

19   should be read to say something different from and

20   greater than what it actually says.

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Mr. Goldblatt, I thought

22   that what she said -- I'm looking at Schedule C,

23   property claimed as exempt.            She lists, as property

24   claimed as exempt, "See attached list of business

25   equipment."     And then we have an inventory going for


                                       3

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   several handwritten pages of all these items of kitchen

 2   equipment.    And that's what she says is the property

 3   claimed as exempt.

 4                 MR. GOLDBLATT:          With respect, Justice

 5   Ginsburg, that's incorrect.           If you turn to her Schedule

 6   C, which is in the joint appendix at pages 57 and 58a,

 7   the first column is a description of the property, and

 8   the third column contains the value of the claimed

 9   exemption.

10                 The property claimed as exempt here is the

11   $10,718 interest in the asset listed in column A.             And

12   the reason that's clear, Your Honor, it's clear from the

13   language of the statute itself because the statutory

14   language of 522(l) provides that the debtor files a list

15   of property that the debtor claims as exempt and that,

16   unless a party in interest objects, the property claimed

17   as exempt is exempt.

18                 522(l) refers to the property claimed as

19   exempt under subsection (b), and subsection (b) in turn

20   references subsection (d), which is the basis for the

21   claim of exemption here.

22                 And 522(d), when it describes the exemption,

23   says the following:     "The following property may be

24   exempted:    One, the debtor's aggregate interest, not to

25   exceed $18,450 in property" -- it goes -- and it


                                       4

 1   enumerates a series of exemptions.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But she -- in her

 3   inventory, she gives figures, and they add up to the

 4   amount that she's claiming, so she evidently thinks that

 5   those numbers will cover all of her business equipment.

 6                 MR. GOLDBLATT:         Justice Ginsburg, it may --

 7   that may well be true.       She may -- the debtor here may

 8   well have believed that the value of the equipment here

 9   was equal to the amount of the exemption.               But no one

10   contends in any serious way that the trustee is required

11   to object to the debtor's valuation of the equipment.

12                 After all --

13                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Mr. -- Mr. Goldblatt,

14   this is -- this is really my concern.              It seems what she

15   wants is her cooking equipment, not the money

16   equivalent.    And if the trustee had objected, she could

17   have said:    Well, if they think that this cooking

18   equipment is worth more than the value that I put down,

19   I'll cut out the coffee maker, I'll cut out the

20   microwave; but what I want is the equipment, not the

21   dollar -- dollars for it.

22                 MR. GOLDBLATT:         Your Honor, the debtor here

23   may well have wanted the equipment.               The question here

24   is, did she make a claim on her schedule that the

25   equipment was itself exempt in kind?               There are a number


                                      5

 1   of ways that debtors can do that.            They can write, "I

 2   claim an exemption in the full amount."               Here, take --

 3   take a debtor who is saying:            Look, all I want is the

 4   exemption that Congress gives me.            I understand that all

 5   I'm entitled to here is a $10,718 interest in my

 6   equipment.   I think my equipment is worth that.              If it

 7   turns out that I'm wrong and it's worth more, I don't

 8   want any more than the Bankruptcy Code gives me.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, that would be

10   a remarkable coincidence if her equipment happened to be

11   worth exactly what Congress said she could exempt, which

12   is a very odd way of reading what she's put in the

13   schedule.

14                MR. GOLDBLATT:         We -- Mr. Chief Justice, we

15   think the most natural way to read what she has said in

16   the schedule is that she's claiming exactly what she

17   says, which is that she is claiming a $10,718 interest

18   in the property.   To get to --

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I would have thought

20   the most natural way of reading it is that she's

21   claiming the equipment because she thinks that's the

22   value of the equipment.

23                MR. GOLDBLATT:         If she wanted to claim the

24   equipment itself as exempt, there were a number of ways

25   that one could do that.      She could say:          I claim 100


                                     6

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   percent interest in the equipment; I claim an in-kind

 2   interest.    Here it would be odd to read that, because

 3   there is no suggestion that has been made by anyone that

 4   she has any entitlement to an in-kind exemption in the

 5   equipment.

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Where would she say that,

 7   100 percent interest in the equipment?               Would she say

 8   that in -- in column 3?

 9                MR. GOLDBLATT:           In either column -- yes, in

10   column 3.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Column 3 says "Value of

12   claimed exemption."

13                MR. GOLDBLATT:           Debtors can certainly list

14   in the schedule.   They can list an asterisk and say:                 I

15   claim an interest in the property itself.               Here the --

16   because --

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, I mean, you say that.

18   But, boy, I wouldn't read -- I wouldn't read the -- I

19   wouldn't read the -- the chart that way.

20                MR. GOLDBLATT:           There's a --

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:           It has a column that says

22   "Value of claimed exemption."

23                MR. GOLDBLATT:           Correct, and the value of

24   the claimed exemption here was $10,718 --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Right.

 1                  MR. GOLDBLATT:         -- which is exactly what the

 2   trustee proposes to give her.

 3                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         Right.

 4                  MR. GOLDBLATT:         That claim of exemption was

 5   proper.     In response to Justice Ginsburg's fair

 6   question, which is what -- what is a debtor to do here

 7   if she wants equipment itself, the debtor is surely

 8   entitled, Justice Ginsburg, to -- if the trustee seeks

 9   to sell the equipment at auction, to participate in that

10   auction and to credit-bid her exemption.             And no -- no

11   one disputes that.     So if the -- if the debtor wants to

12   come to the auction and say, look, I'm bidding my

13   exemption, and that will buy me as much of my equipment

14   as it will buy me, the debtor is fully entitled to do

15   that.     And in that --

16                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Then you're going through

17   all the administrative expenses of having an auction

18   where if the trustee had tipped her off, it would be

19   like amending your pleading.

20                  MR. GOLDBLATT:         Well, in fairness, in this

21   case itself, the trustee happened to come to the section

22   341 meeting and say:        I believe that there's value here

23   for the estate.     I think there's value in excess of --

24                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          And she was so --

25   so upset, she said:        I'll get out of the bankruptcy; I

 1   want my cooking equipment.

 2                MR. GOLDBLATT:         That's right, but ­-

 3                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          It was very clear that

 4   that's what the debtor wanted.

 5                MR. GOLDBLATT:         And it was equally clear

 6   that the trustee took the position that she was entitled

 7   to the exemption that Congress permits and no more than

 8   that.   And the debtor didn't say --

 9                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          The question is whether

10   -- the question is whether the trustee had to make an

11   objection, when it seemed really as clear as could be

12   that what she was seeking was to keep her equipment, not

13   to get the -- some monetary equivalent for it.

14                MR. GOLDBLATT:         With respect, Justice

15   Ginsburg, imagine you had a debtor who -- who came into

16   court and said:   Look, I believe my equipment is worth

17   something equal to the amount that is permissible, that

18   I may permissibly claim as exempt, but I don't mean to

19   make an improper in-kind exemption.              I don't -- I don't

20   want more value than Congress intends me to keep.              If it

21   turns out to be worth more, that belongs to my

22   creditors.   All I want is what I'm entitled to by

23   statute.

24                That debtor would have no alternative way to

25   express that but to do exactly what this debtor did


                                     9

 1   here.    And we think the most plausible way to read it is

 2   -- is to read it to have this debtor be expressing an

 3   intention that is consistent with law and not one that

 4   is improper.    There is -- there is no basis under which

 5   this debtor is entitled to keep more than a $10,718

 6   interest, and under the ordinary presumption that you

 7   presume parties --

 8                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, then she has -- on

 9   your reading, her claim is improper because she's

10   claiming more than she's entitled to.              If her claim is

11   improper, then the trustee has an obligation to object

12   to it.

13                MR. GOLDBLATT:         Justice Ginsburg, it's only

14   improper if it's read to mean something different from

15   what it says.     What she said here in the schedule is:             I

16   claim an exempt interest of $10,718 in the equipment,

17   and I believe the equipment is worth that amount.              The

18   question is, should that be read to be making an

19   improper claim that the equipment itself is exempt in

20   kind, a claim that would be -- would be clearly

21   improper, or --

22                JUSTICE ALITO:         When I look at that number,

23   I -- and maybe I don't understand this, so maybe you or

24   your adversary can clarify it for me.              But when I look

25   at that number, it seems to me there are two ways to


                                      10

 1   interpret it.   One is that she is saying:             I want the

 2   full amount that I'm allowed by law.              And the other is:

 3   That I want the value of my equipment, and it just so

 4   happens to total exactly to the dollar the amount that

 5   I'm entitled to by law.       Am I correct that those are the

 6   two possible readings of that?

 7                MR. GOLDBLATT:        That's -- that's certainly

 8   -- we think that that's right.

 9                JUSTICE ALITO:        And the question is which of

10   those is the more plausible reading?

11                MR. GOLDBLATT:        Right, and we -- we think

12   that -- that for a number of reasons, the more plausible

13   reading is to say:    All I want is what the law permits

14   me.   The -- the principal reason is that as a general

15   proposition you wouldn't presume someone to be making a

16   claim for which there would be no legal basis.             And in

17   any --

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Except that the -- that the

19   last column does -- it's very clearly entitled "Current

20   market value of property" without deducting exemptions.

21   There's no way to read that last figure of 10,718 except

22   as her assessment of the market value of her cooking

23   equipment.

24                MR. GOLDBLATT:        That's exactly right,

25   Justice Scalia, but the critical point is that there is

 7   it may have been wrong, but it's the NACBA brief at page

 8   27 -- said "Challenges to valuation are the most common

 9   types of objections to exemptions."

10                MR. GOLDBLATT:         Let me -- let me explain

11   this for a moment, if I may.              Imagine the debtor here

12   had listed the value at $15,000 and her exempt interest

13   as 10,718.   In that case, the debtor -- the trustee

14   would surely be entitled to sell the asset.                The debtor

15   themselves acknowledges that on page 30 of the

16   Respondent's brief.     In that case, what the value that

17   the equipment would obtain would be whatever a willing

18   buyer and willing seller would pay.                It could be

19   $15,000, it could be $30,000, it could be $130,000.                 And

20   the fact that the actual value of what -- what a buyer

21   would pay for it was different from the debtor's

22   valuation would be of no moment.              Whatever value the

23   trustee was able to obtain for the asset --

24                JUSTICE BREYER:          In that case -- in that

25   case, I guess there wouldn't be a -- a lawsuit.

 1                MR. GOLDBLATT:       No.      That's exactly right,

 2   Justice Breyer.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:        I mean, in that case, the

 4   debtor is never going to object.            So we're never going

 5   to have that one.

 6                MR. GOLDBLATT:       That's exactly right.      But

 7   -- but the point here is that there is no requirement

 8   that the -- when a debtor files an individual

 9   bankruptcy case, on Schedule B the debtor lists the

10   valuation, their estimated valuation of all of their

11   assets.   There is absolutely no requirement in the

12   Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, or anywhere else

13   that a trustee go through and say whether they agree or

14   disagree with the debtor's positive valuation.            Instead,

15   what a trustee does is they liquidate the asset, they

16   generate the value that is there, and they distribute

17   that value to creditors.

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, they don't always

19   liquidate the asset, if they -- if they elect -- if

20   everybody agrees that they get the asset itself, they

21   don't have to sell it.

22                MR. GOLDBLATT:       That's exactly right.      The

23   trustee may determine to abandon an asset to the debtor

24   if there's no --

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What -- what -- what you

 1   are doing there, you -- you argue that ambiguities are

 2   construed against the person that made the form.              I

 3   think that's a little harsh when the trustee is a repeat

 4   player and knows -- and knows the rules.

 5                  MR. GOLDBLATT:       Well ­-

 6                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           On the other hand, I think

 7   what you have going for you is that the trustee is going

 8   to always be at risk that the asset is worth more than

 9   what's listed and is going to have to take steps to

10   value it in every -- every case.

11                  In this case, it's -- it's clear that she ­-

12   she knew that the Honda was worth more.              She was only

13   claiming $2,900, $2,950 on a Honda.

14                  MR. GOLDBLATT:       That's right, and that was

15   subject to a security interest here.

16                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And -- and if you take

17   that together with -- and -- and the kitchen equipment

18   comes next, and she -- and the value is the same in each

19   column.     So that indicates that she was claiming the

20   full value.

21                  MR. GOLDBLATT:       With -- with respect to

22   the -- the automobile, there's -- there's a claim of

23   exemption and the rest is subject to a security

24   interest.     Here -- I mean, the critical point is if a

25   debtor wants to -- to put to -- to the issue and say,


                                      14

 1   listen, I really want to keep the equipment itself, I

 2   don't think there's any value here for the estate, there

 3   is a statutory mechanism to address that.               Section

 4   554(b) says quite clearly that if -- if a party in

 5   interest believes that there is an asset as to which

 6   there is inconsequential value, they can seek an order

 7   compelling the bankruptcy -- compelling the trustee to

 8   abandon that asset to the debtor.

 9                So there is -- I mean, Justice Ginsburg's

10   question -- there is a mechanism for addressing the

11   concern that Your Honor has with a debtor who wants a

12   determination that they keep a particular asset, but --

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          My concern is keeping it

14   simple, giving fair notice to people.              She's got the

15   same amount under exempt -- the last two columns.                 A

16   rule is proposed.   It says when the two columns have the

17   same amount, that's a clue to the trustee that the

18   debtor is claiming all of the -- that particular

19   property.   That's a nice, simple rule.              It tells the

20   trustee when he has to object, and the end of the

21   matter.

22                MR. GOLDBLATT:       With respect, Justice

23   Ginsburg, a -- a simpler rule would be that if a

24   debtor wants to say, I have an in-kind exemption in an

25   asset, the debtor should say that.               They should use a


                                    15

 1   term that is understood to mean that.

 2               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But it's not in kind in

 3   the sense that she keeps the asset no matter what.

 4               MR. GOLDBLATT:         Well, that's exactly what

 5   the debtor is contending here.           She -- the debtor here

 6   is saying that this -- this said even if I'm wrong

 7   about the value --

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            She is contending that

 9   she would like to keep her cooking equipment and she was

10   entitled to notice before it's going to be sold at an

11   auction.

12               MR. GOLDBLATT:         With respect, Justice

13   Ginsburg, that's not right.          Here the debtor was told at

14   the 341 meeting that the trustee intended to sell it.

15   Her claim is that even -- even if he can get more value

16   than she said it was worth, she keeps all of that value,

17   regardless of what it's worth, because -- because her

18   schedule told us unequivocally that she got to keep it

19   regardless of its actual value.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Then -- then her claim is

21   wrong, her claim is objectionable, and the trustee

22   should have made an objection.

23               MR. GOLDBLATT:         But the best reading of her

24   schedule is not to make such a claim, but rather to read

25   her schedule to -- to mean what it says, which is that


                                     16

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   she claimed to have a $10,718 exemption in the property,

 2   and insofar as the property is worth more than that,

 3   that that's -- that -- that is a question of valuation,

 4   which isn't the subject of an obligation to raise an

 5   objection.

 6                 Also, to the point of simplicity, Justice

 7   Ginsburg, if I may, the -- the virtue of the rule

 8   that we urge here is that -- that it does provide for

 9   simplicity.   A debtor can clearly put the trustee on

10   notice.

11                 The consequence of the debtor's rule would

12   be to require trustees, whenever schedules happen to use

13   the same number, to come in and file pro forma

14   objections.   And it doesn't seem that there is any

15   reason as a matter of bankruptcy policy or statutory

16   construction to simply require more paperwork to get to

17   the same result.

18                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Has that happened in the

19   two circuits that apply a rule similar to this, the

20   Sixth and the Third?

21                 MR. GOLDBLATT:       What I understand, Justice

22   Sotomayor, is that that -- the answer to that is yes and

23   that in the Third Circuit following this decision that

24   trustees are filing those kinds of pro forma objections.

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:        Why?    I mean, you sit down

 1   with the creditors, and you look at the list and you try

 2   to work things out.     That meeting goes on as long as you

 3   want.   And if it appears there's an argument about

 4   valuation, you file an objection.

 5                 MR. GOLDBLATT:        And --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:         If it appears everybody can

 7   work everything out, fine.          What's the problem?

 8                 MR. GOLDBLATT:        The -- the question is what

 9   is the rule where -- where there remains disagreement?

10   And as --

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:         The rule is -- and that's

12   what it's about -- the rule is about where you object,

13   the trustee objects to the list.             The list.

14                 MR. GOLDBLATT:        And -- and --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:         That's called Schedule C.

16   If you have an objection to the list, then

17   it says:    Here's what you do, trustee.               Meet with the

18   creditors, try to work it out.            And if in fact 30 days

19   thereafter and you don't need any more time, so you

20   don't ask the judge for more time, file an objection.

21                 MR. GOLDBLATT:        No, Justice Breyer.

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:         What's the problem?

23                 MR. GOLDBLATT:        It's just different from

24   what the -- what the statute says.                 What

25   the statute says is that in the absence of an objection,

 1   the property claimed as exempt becomes exempt.                  And if

 2   you look at 522(d) and see its description of the

 3   property that becomes exempt, that language is clear

 4   that it is the debtor's interest up to a dollar amount

 5   in an asset.     The term "property" here is subject to

 6   monetary caps.     It's not the asset itself.              And the

 7   statutory language in that regard couldn't be clearer.

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             If it's not the asset

 9   itself and it's just about money, here I have a piece of

10   property and it wouldn't matter whether it was a case of

11   widgets or my grandmother's diamond ring.                 But

12   Congress -- this is a peculiar list it has.                 It has

13   personal jewelry, tools of trade.             It sounds like --

14   even though those have a dollar cap, it sounds like

15   Congress said these are the kinds of things a debtor

16   would want to keep in kind.

17               MR. GOLDBLATT:          Well, but those have always

18   been subject -- as this Court explained in Owens v.

19   Owens, those types of -- of -- of assets have always

20   been subject to monetary caps, and the same is true

21   here, and 522(d) makes that clear.                 Insofar as the

22   debtor would like to keep it, the debtor is entitled to

23   credit-bid at an auction.

 6                 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

 7                        AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 8                    SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 9                 MR. WALL:    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                 The government is not saying that it's a

12   coincidence that these numbers in the third and fourth

13   columns are the same.      It is a common practice.            A

14   debtor will often estimate what she believes to be the

15   market value of her property and then divvy up a wild

16   card across items in hope -- hopes of keeping them.

17                 The government's and Petitioner's only point

18   is that where a debtor does that, as Respondent did

19   here, she's still claiming the fixed exemption of what

20   she believes to be the market value.

21                 Now, I take your concern, Justice Ginsburg,

22   this might be unfair to debtors who wouldn't be

23   tipped off.    That is not true here, where the trustee

24   came to the creditors' meeting and said:                I construe

25   your exemption as limited, and I think the property is


                                     20

 1   worth about $7,000 more, and I intend to sell it.

 2                 And at that point, a debtor who really

 3   believed that her schedule claimed full value would, it

 4   seems to me, have said:        You're misreading my schedule.

 5   She didn't do that.       She didn't do that until after the

 6   30-day period had run when the trustee moved to sell

 7   the property.     Now, she --

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           What she did do, she

 9   said:   That unsettles me so much that I'm going to

10   withdraw from this bankruptcy proceeding; beyond

11   anything, I want to keep that -- that property.

12                 MR. WALL:     That's right.           But she -- but

13   she -- she did walk in.        She didn't say:          You're

14   misreading my schedule.        She said:           I don't want you to

15   sell the property if indeed it's worth more than the

16   exemption I've claimed, and so I want to dismiss my

17   bankruptcy.     Which she doesn't have a right to do under

18   Chapter 7.    She has to show cause under section 707(a).

19   The Bankruptcy Court found that she had not shown cause,

20   and the debtor didn't appeal that determination, which

21   is not before this Court.

22                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But the -- but the

23   Bankruptcy Court did that simultaneously with saying:

24   And I'm going to deny the trustee's motion to have an

25   auction.

 1                 MR. WALL:    That's right.            And on remand, it

 2   would certainly be open to her to attempt to convince

 3   the Bankruptcy Court again that she had shown cause

 4   under 707 to dismiss.

 5                 I think the government's point is that there

 6   is a process for sale.      So even beyond the facts of this

 7   case, when the trustee wants to sell property, he has to

 8   give 20 days' notice to the debtors and the creditors

 9   under section 363 of the code and Rule 2002.                So if the

10   trustee here had not even said anything at the

11   creditors' meeting but had moved to sell, he would have

12   had to give notice to the debtor, who at that point

13   could always amend her schedules under Rule 1009.

14                 If she had any exemption left to claim, she

15   could walk in and say:      I'm going to amend my schedule,

16   and I'm going to increase my exemption, because I

17   underestimated the property value.                The reason she

18   didn't and couldn't do that here is because she had

19   maxed out her wild card.       But it's -- indeed, even on

20   remand --

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          What she could have done

22   is trimmed some items from the list.

23                 MR. WALL:    And she still could on remand.

24   Even on remand, she could walk in and amend her schedule

25   and say:    I'm going to itemize exactly the equipment


                                     22

 1   that I want to keep with my wild card.              And I'm going to

 2   say which of my kitchen equipment I want to keep with my

 3   $10,225, and which I don't.

 4                  So, it's not that -- there's nothing about

 5   Petitioner's approach that denies the debtor the fresh

 6   start to which she is entitled under the code.               She ­-

 7   she can always claim right up to the legal limits.               What

 8   --

 9                  JUSTICE BREYER:        That sounds very

10   complicated.     I -- I mean, the thing that sort of

11   persuaded me so far on this is this is what Collier

12   says, the other side -- it's what all the bankruptcy

13   judges.     Ambro is a bankruptcy judge.           This is a simpler

14   thing.

15                  MR. GOLDBLATT:       Well --

16                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Look at the procedural

17   rule.     It's just what I've said.           It says:   If you have

18   an objection to the list of property -- the list of

19   property is C, okay?      So here's what you do, trustee:

20   Sit down with the creditors.              See if there's really an

21   argument.     Now, if there's no argument, fine; they'll

22   let you do what you want.

23                  If there is an argument and it has to do

24   with that list, C, particularly valuation, which is what

25   these things are all about, then file your objection.

 1   That's so simple.    And it seems in most places they do

 2   it.

 3                 So why do we want to run around Robin's barn

 4   or something to get somewhere we can get to much

 5   simpler?

 6                 MR. WALL:    Well, there are a number of

 7   questions there, Justice Breyer.            But with all respect,

 8   that is not what the statute and the rules say.              What

 9   the statute and the rules say is if you have an

10   objection to the property claimed as exempt on the list

11   -- and as a historical matter over time, Schedule C has

12   required debtors to put additional information besides

13   their exemptions.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:        But Rule 403 doesn't say

15   that.   My Rule 403 says:      "A party in interest may file

16   an objection to the list of property claimed as ­- as

17   exempt within 30 days after the meeting."            Okay?

18                 MR. WALL:    That's right.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:        It says "the list."      So

20   that's where I think you're becoming awfully legalistic,

21   to try to distinguish between the list and the property

22   in A and B.

23                 I mean, what do you -- these are about

24   valuation, says Collier.       That's all we're interested

25   in.

 1               MR. WALL:       Well, it says the list of

 2   property claimed as exempt.           So, for instance, for

 3   nearly the first 100 years after they set up the system

 4   in 1898, on Schedule C and its predecessors the debtor

 5   put down the location and present use of property.              But

 6   no one thought that the location was part of the claim

 7   of exemption, such that if the trustee believed the

 8   property was in one place than another, he had to

 9   object.

10               The idea was we'll provide some useful

11   information to the trustee beyond the claim of

12   exemption, so that if he wants to file a turnover

13   complaint to get the property into the estate, he knows

14   where it's located.

15               But it just isn't true, as a historical or

16   logical matter, that everything that shows up on

17   Schedule C is part of the claimed exemption.

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Is it also true ­-

19   tell me about this:     One of my concerns is that the

20   trustees simply don't have time in every case to have a

21   creditors' meeting and go through every asset.

22               If they did, then Justice Breyer's

23   suggestion, where they'd sit down and talk about all

24   this stuff, would be -- would be fine.              Am I right or

25   wrong in making that empirical assumption?              I mean, I

 1   just don't know.

 2                 MR. WALL:     I think that's entirely fair.

 3   They do have to have a creditors' meeting, so they do

 4   have to -- you know, within 20 to 40 days of the filing

 5   of the petition.     But I think what will happen on

 6   Respondent's approach as a practical matter is the world

 7   will look no different; it will just have a lot more

 8   litigation.

 9                 Whenever the numbers in columns 3 and 4

10   match up, the trustee will file a pro forma objection or

11   extension request.     Cases will proceed exactly as they

12   do now.   Property can be sold.             Some will be returned to

13   the debtor and some will not.

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            He has to.    Otherwise, he

15   is at risk that it might be worth $400,000 or whatever.

16                 MR. WALL:     Exactly.         And I think the reason

17   that it's odd to set up that kind of presumption is

18   because you're basically presuming that the debtor is

19   acting to claim an exemption in kind to which he is not

20   entitled under the code.

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So what does she put

22   down if she thinks this is what the property is worth,

23   but she doesn't know for sure?              I mean, I don't know how

24   you would accurately value a bunch of kitchen equipment.

25   What is she supposed to do?

 1                  MR. WALL:    Well, the debtor would do

 2   exactly what she did here, and if the trustee went to

 3   sell and she had remaining exemption left, she could

 4   come in and amend her schedules and say --

 5                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But that goes

 6   through -- I think as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, you

 7   have to go through a long process if you're going to

 8   have an auction, and for this sole proprietorship, it

 9   seems like a waste of money and time.

10                  MR. WALL:    Well, if the debtor actually

11   wanted to claim, say, full value or 100 percent of value

12   -- there are debtors that commonly do that.                 Since at

13   least Taylor 20 years ago, debtors on the form have been

14   writing down, in the third column --

15                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, that's right.

16   I mean, this is a government form, and you say, even

17   though it says "Value of the claimed exemption" and

18   "Current market value," that these debtors should know,

19   oh, you should put in, as your friend said, put in an

20   asterisk and write something else in there.

21                  MR. WALL:    I don't even think it has to be

22   an asterisk.     It's -- debtors commonly will put in on

23   these forms where they want to claim full value, even if

24   they're not entitled to it under the code, full value,

25   100 percent of value.       The debtor in Taylor wrote down


                                      27

 1   "Unknown."     Some contingent term that places the trustee

 2   on notice that says:       Hey, whatever the value of the

 3   property is --

 4                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          That's much less

 5   informative than if she said -- I mean, here she -- she

 6   has one list that's showing what she paid for it.            She

 7   makes her best guess.       It's -- you're suggesting that

 8   she would be entitled to the notice if she put down

 9   "unknown," "value unknown" or "value 100 percent."

10                  So your -- on your theory, in order to do

11   what she obviously wants to do, preserve her kitchen

12   equipment, she has to give no information or inaccurate

13   information.

14                  If she said -- I think what you're saying is

15   if she said a 100 percent, instead of saying what she

16   thought was the -- the value, or if she said unknown,

17   she would be entitled to notice from -- to an objection

18   from the trustee.     But because she has tried her best to

19   put down what the form calls for, she doesn't get any

20   objection from the trustee.

21                  MR. WALL:    Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg,

22   the debtor does have a duty to report the market value

23   in the fourth column, what she believes it to be, but

24   the third column supports her claim and --

25                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        That -- is that where she


                                      28

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   would write 100 percent -- in the third column,

 2   rather than the fourth?

 3                MR. WALL:      Well, no.        She'd write it in

 4   the third column because what she'd be saying is --

 5   the third column is just subjective.               It's just what you

 6   want to claim, and, under "Value of claimed exemption,"

 7   she'd say 100 percent of value.

 8                And then, in the fourth column, she would

 9   make an estimate as to what she believed that value to

10   be.   And, in the event that she underestimated, she

11   could always come in and amend her exemptions.

12                I think it would be odd to read a form where

13   she cited statutory provisions that allow her to claim

14   interest up to a dollar cap and then she had put down

15   definite and fixed numbers to say to the trustee, you

16   should assume, despite the statutory text she is citing

17   and the numbers she is giving you, that she is claiming

18   an unauthorized, in-kind exemption, despite the very

19   statutory provisions on which she's relying as the bases

20   for her exemption.

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Would she --

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Well, now, wait.      Why would

23   the trustee object?      I mean, he would still be objecting

24   to the valuation.     You say that he has no -- no

25   obligation to object to the valuation.

 1               But if she writes 100 percent of value

 2   in the third column, that's what she's claimed, and then

 3   values it at something above the exemption, right?

 4   Above the permissible objection, he's still objecting to

 5   the valuation, isn't he?       No?

 6               MR. WALL:      Justice Scalia, wherever the

 7   debtor lists a contingent term in the third column,

 8   whether it's unknown or 100 percent of value, the

 9   trustee absolutely has to object.

10               It -- but -- but where the trustee doesn't

11   object is where the debtor does what she did here and

12   lists a fixed sum.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:          I see.

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, Mr. Wall.

18               MR. BRUNSTAD:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19   please the Court:

20               Justice Ginsburg, your reading of the

21   schedules is completely accurate.             There was nothing

22   more that Ms. Reilly could have done to indicate her

23   intent to exempt the property in full.

24                The bankruptcy court looked at this.               The

25   bankruptcy judge sees thousands of these kinds of

 1   schedules and made that determination.

 2                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But she could have said

 3   "in full."   You can't say she couldn't have done

 4   nothing more.   She'd put "in full."

 5                MR. BRUNSTAD:      Well, Justice Kennedy, the

 6   form --

 7                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Or "100 percent of

 8   value."

 9                MR. BRUNSTAD:      Justice Kennedy, the form

10   doesn't call for that.     The form calls for a list --

11                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Now, you've said that

12   there's nothing else she could do, and I said, of

13   course, there's something else she could do.            In Taylor,

14   the case you cite, they put "unknown."

15                MR. BRUNSTAD:      That's --

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I mean, I understand your

17   position, but you can't say there's nothing else she

18   could have done.   That's -- that's the issue in the

19   case.

20                MR. BRUNSTAD:      Yes, Justice Kennedy, but

21   consistent with the form and the information the form

22   requests, she completely and accurately provided the

23   information the form requests.

24                And she -- as the bankruptcy court looked at

25   this and said, this is -- she's claiming the property in

 1   full.   The district court looked at this, the court of

 2   appeals looked at this, all to the same conclusion.

 3               Now, I think it's important to underscore

 4   the purpose of the statute and the rules.               They address

 5   a very practical problem.       We need to know, right away,

 6   at the beginning of the case, is this property the

 7   debtor gets to keep, or is this property of the estate,

 8   which the trustee can sell?

 9               We need to know this because, under section

10   363(b), a trustee cannot sell property if it is not

11   property of the estate.      And if the property is claimed

12   as exempt and nobody files an objection, it is exempt

13   under 522(l).   The trustee cannot sell it.              Now --

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So if it turns out

15   that this business equipment was worth $100,000 and the

16   trustee looks at it and says, oh, she's only claiming --

17   you know, less than she's entitled, $10,000, and doesn't

18   object, she gets that dramatic windfall.

19               MR. BRUNSTAD:       Just so I'm clear, Chief

20   Justice Roberts, if she claims that she -- $15,000, but

21   she puts a value of $100,000?           Is that --

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Oh, no, no.   She --

23   she -- and it may be even in good faith or -- or bad

24   faith, depending on the rule we -- we adopt, but she

25   gets that incredible bonus because it turns out her


                                    32

                                  Official


 1   business equipment is worth a lot more than she put

 2   down.

 3               MR. BRUNSTAD:       Well, if she undervalues her

 4   equipment, for a hundred years, Chief Justice Roberts,

 5   that has been grounds for objection.               For a hundred

 6   years, the practice has been --

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, this -- the

 8   trustee doesn't know.     He doesn't know.            He looks at it

 9   and says, oh, that sounds like kitchen equipment might

10   be worth that, and so he doesn't object.

11               What you're doing is, I think Justice

12   Kennedy pointed out, you're requiring the trustee to

13   object to everything, lest he lose the $100,000 that it

14   turns out this is worth.

15               MR. BRUNSTAD:       Not quite, Chief Justice

16   Roberts, and here's why:      The trustee gets the form, and

17   then there is the meeting of creditors, and the trustee

18   gets to ask questions before the deadline actually

19   occurs.

20               Here, the trustee went and asked somebody

21   else, do you think this is worth more than she's

22   claiming?   And, apparently, somebody said, perhaps it

23   is.

24               Then the trustee could ask the questions of

25   the debtor directly, and if the debtor -- if the trustee


                                    33

 1   needs more time, the trustee can do one of two things:

 2   move for an extension of time to object or simply

 3   adjourn the meeting of creditors.

 4                  The timing is completely in the trustee's

 5   control.     They have plenty of time.

 6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              No, but the point

 7   is, that drags out the whole process.                You're imposing a

 8   burden on the trustee.       He loses everything if he

 9   doesn't object, and I think the idea is that these

10   things move as quickly as you can, and you don't want

11   the trustees -- you know, I may be severely prejudiced;

12   the creditors might if I don't object, so I'm going to

13   object to everything; we'll sort it out later.

14                  MR. BRUNSTAD:      Yes, Your Honor, but that's

15   what the statute does.       It poses the burden on the

16   trustee.     The rule, Rule 4003, imposes the burden on the

17   trustee to object if the trustee has any grounds for

18   thinking what the debtor has done is improper.

19                  Now, these schedules are signed under

20   penalty of perjury.     There are criminal sanctions under

21   18 U.S.C. sections 152 and 157 if the debtor is engaged

22   in fraud.     There are penalties under section 727 or 707.

23   The case can be dismissed.          The debtor can lose her

24   discharge.     This is very serious affair, stating this

25   information.     The debtor here very thoughtfully itemized


                                      34

 1   all of the property, she filled out all the information

 2   on the form, and she did something else, Chief Justice

 3   Roberts.     On page 28a of her schedules, she checked a

 4   box that's required, and that box that the debtor

 5   requires -- is supposed to check basically tells the

 6   trustee:     This is a no-asset case; there's not any value

 7   left over for anybody else after you account for my

 8   exemptions.

 9                 It's very clear from the box she checked

10   off, from the information that she provided, she was

11   claiming the property in full, the very property that

12   she wanted, her tools of trade to engage in her

13   business.

14                 Again, thousands of these forms are done.

15   Here, the bankruptcy court looked at this and said she

16   was exempting the property in full.                The trustee knows

17   this.   The trustee sees thousands of forms.               He had the

18   information that he claims forms the basis of his

19   objection well before his deadline passed, yet he

20   allowed the 30-day period to go by without presenting an

21   objection.

22                 JUSTICE ALITO:        Well, when she put down the

23   figure $10,718 on page 58a of the Joint Appendix, what

24   did she mean by that?

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:         Yes.

 3                MR. BRUNSTAD:        She meant that the value she

 4   claimed in full of her property was what she was

 5   claiming as exempt.     The entire --

 6                JUSTICE ALITO:         She meant that that was --

 7                MR. BRUNSTAD:        She held the property.

 8                JUSTICE ALITO:         She had -- she had figured

 9   out the value of the property, and her estimation of its

10   fair market value was $10,718?

11                MR. BRUNSTAD:        Yes.     She very carefully

12   listed it, and a debtor in bankruptcy --

13                JUSTICE ALITO:         It wasn't $10,717?     It

14   wasn't $10,719?   It was $10,718?            That's what she meant?

15                MR. BRUNSTAD:        That was her valuation of the

16   equipment, Justice Alito.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Well, it's not a realistic

18   valuation.   Nobody thinks that that's an honest

19   valuation of the equipment.           It's simply adding up the

20   -- the exemption she was entitled to.

21                MR. BRUNSTAD:        No, Justice Scalia, because

22   she didn't exhaust --

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:          It's just -- her valuation

24   just happened to be exactly the amount that the two

25   exemptions she had would add up to.

 1               MR. BRUNSTAD:      No, Justice Scalia, she did

 2   not exhaust her exemption availability.            She had

 3   additional exemption availability left over after she

 4   took for her equipment.     She detailed, she listed the

 5   assets, she listed a value.        And under our law, debtors

 6   in bankruptcy who own property are considered experts

 7   with respect to the valuation of their own property.

 8   Shane v. Shane, 891 F.2d at 872, the owner of property

 9   is competent to testify as to its value, is competent to

10   testify to it.

11               Here, the trustee offered nothing.               There's

12   nothing in the record to rebut her valuation that she

13   swore under penalty of perjury was accurate.

14               She did -- again, Justice Scalia, she had

15   more exemptions she could have used.            And if --

16               JUSTICE ALITO:       But that's a -- that's a

17   totally different question.        It's just -- it is ­- your

18   submission is that it is a pure coincidence that her

19   good faith estimation of the current market value of

20   this property just happens to add up, to the dollar, to

21   the amounts that she was entitled to exempt under the

22   specific statutory provisions that she cited in the

23   previous column?

24               MR. BRUNSTAD:      No, Justice Alito, because

25   $10,718 is not her max.     That's not the maximum amount

 1   of value that she could have claimed.             She properly did

 2   what all debtors have to do.             They are required to do

 3   this under the forms.      They are required to inventory

 4   their property in Schedule B; they are required in

 5   Schedule C to state a value, if in fact they know it.

 6   And in good faith --

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Now, can you elaborate on

 8   this additional -- she -- you said she could have listed

 9   something that came to a higher number.            Are you talking

10   about the part of the leftover of the wildcard exemption

11   that she -- she used it for food, didn't she?

12                 MR. BRUNSTAD:      She used it for perishable

13   food items.    She didn't have to use it for perishable

14   food items.

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, but she was maxed

16   out.   Once she used it for that, she was maxed out, but

17   she wanted to have her cake and eat it too.            She wanted

18   to get the exemption for the food and she wanted to get

19   the exemption for the -- for the equipment.            And so it

20   just so happened that the equipment valuation added up

21   to precisely what was left over after she took the

22   exemption for the -- for the food.

23                 MR. BRUNSTAD:      Actually, the other way

24   around, Justice Scalia.       She valued the equipment first.

25   Then she determined she had leftover, leftover exemption

 1   ability, and she applied it to additional items.

 2                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But how do you know that

 3   from the form?   Number one, I think both sides have --

 4   have an argument as to what the form means.              I don't

 5   think it's at all clear-cut.              As I say, I'm looking for

 6   some kind of a rule to tilt the case one way or the

 7   other.   All right?    I don't put a lot of credence in the

 8   fact that she -- the ambiguities are construed against

 9   her.

10                I am concerned that in every case, under

11   your rule, the trustee is at risk unless he makes an

12   objection, and I think that's just going to make

13   bankruptcy proceedings much more protracted and much

14   more complex.

15                MR. BRUNSTAD:        Actually, I think, Justice

16   Kennedy, the opposite.       After Taylor, after this Court's

17   decision in Taylor, trustees understood if they had a

18   valuation objection, if they had concern that the debtor

19   might be getting a windfall, they needed to make an

20   objection.

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, but therein -- the

22   problem was triggered when they put in the word

23   "unknown."

24                MR. BRUNSTAD:        That's correct, Justice

25   Kennedy, but that was the appropriate thing to say for

 2   we're talking about tangible property such as cooking

 3   equipment, where you can figure out -- you look at the

 4   pot and you have an idea of what it's worth, you are

 5   required to state that amount.

 6                Now, I think, Justice Kennedy, a good rule

 7   of decision is -- or a good principle of decision here

 8   is that the exemptions are part of the fresh start in

 9   bankruptcy, and we construe exceptions to that fresh

10   start against creditors, against the trustee.

11                JUSTICE BREYER:        Do you have any sense of

12   how it works in practice?       I'm a little worried by

13   Justice Kennedy's question, because the government says

14   in practice what's been happening is that in most

15   places, trustees don't -- they don't object to these

16   kinds of valuations problems, and now suddenly when the

17   rule has changed in some circuit, they do object as a

18   matter of form, which is unnecessary paperwork.

19                The impression I had from reading Collier,

20   and it was -- the opposite was so, that normally when

21   you have the creditors' meeting, things would appear,

22   what was a problem or what wasn't, and the creditor

23   would then file an -- or the trustee would then file an

24   objection.   Well, what is the case?             How does the

25   practice work?   I'm -- I'm pretty uncertain.             I'm not a

 3   has not been an avalanche of pro forma objections being

 4   filed in these cases.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Yes, but how did it work

 6   normally for years and years?             You'd go into a committee

 7   meeting of creditors.       They'd get into an argument about

 8   the valuation.     I'm sure that happened.

 9                 MR. BRUNSTAD:       Yes.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:         And when that happened, did

11   trustees file objections within 30 days or didn't they?

12                 MR. BRUNSTAD:       Yes, Justice Breyer.

16                 MR. BRUNSTAD:       In the court of appeals, yes,

17   Your Honor.     He's a former bankruptcy judge.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:         He had been a bankruptcy

 1   rules, the trustee has the burden of objecting if the

 2   trustee has any basis for objection, including

 3   valuation, and -- but the trustee has to have a good

 4   faith reason for objecting, and how that is determined

 5   is the trustee looks at the schedules, asks questions at

 6   the meeting of creditors, a section 341 meeting, and

 7   then if the trustee has any objection at all, present

 8   it.   If the trustee doesn't present it, you move on.           We

 9   have -- finality is very important here.

10                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Now, under your rule,

11   the trustee has 30 days to get this good faith basis.

12   Does that mean that he or she has to get a valuation on

13   everything that's listed at full value, that that is

14   really the burden we're talking about?

15                It's not the burden of filing a piece of

16   paper that says I want an a exemption, or even one that

17   says I have an objection.       It's what it takes to support

18   that objection and how much effort goes to that

19   activity.

20                MR. BRUNSTAD:      Yes, Justice Sotomayor, and

21   the trustee has had that burden for about a hundred

22   years.   And under the former Bankruptcy Act, they had

23   much shorter deadlines -- 20 days, 15 days.

24                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         No, there's a huge

25   difference between a rule that says you don't have to

 1   actually go after this information in a formal way.

 2   If someone's claiming only the exempt amount, then I'll

 3   go ahead and I'll administer the estate, and over time

 4   I'll talk informally to people and get a sense of

 5   whether the valuation is right or not, but I won't

 6   actually -- actually have to get a formal appraisal

 7   because I'll just use my judgment.

 8                 Your rule would require something else.

 9   They would have to get the appraisal to lodge the

10   request for an extension or to lodge the request for an

11   objection.

12                 MR. BRUNSTAD:      But they'd have to do

13   that in their motion to sell anyway, Justice Sotomayor.

14   And also in most cases it's going to be simple.             The

15   most common asset that this is about is a car.             You take

16   the car and you check the book value of the car, and the

17   trustee can do a simple, easy, expedient comparison.

18   It's a little more complicated when --

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You mean in every single

20   case where an asset is sold, there has to be a valuation

21   beforehand?

22                 MR. BRUNSTAD:      In a situation where the

23   debtor claims the property as exempt, yes, and here's

24   why, Justice Kennedy:      Because the trustee again can --

 1   whole property is exempt?

 2                 MR. BRUNSTAD:      Well, if the debtor claims

 3   the whole property is exempt, then it's not property of

 4   the estate unless the trustee interposes a timely and

 5   successful objection, because section 362 of the

 6   Bankruptcy Code, which authorizes sales, only

 7   specifically authorizes sales of property of the estate;

 8   and if someone claims property as exempt, if no

 9   objection is interposed under 522(l), then the property

10   claimed as -- is exempt.

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           My question was ­- I

12   thought I understood your remark to say anytime there's

13   a sale, there has to be a valuation or an appraisal

14   before the sale.

15                 MR. BRUNSTAD:      If, in fact, the debtor

16   claims the property as exempt, that's correct.             Unless

17   the debtor concedes, the trustee can sell it.             That has

18   to happen anyway, Justice Kennedy.

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Do we know what -- what's

20   --

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But that -- but the very

22   fact that it's -- that there's going to be a sale may

23   indicate that your premise is not true most of the time.

24                 MR. BRUNSTAD:      No, Justice Kennedy, and

25   here's why:    because the statute, for example, points

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   that the court is going to determine in the first

 2   instance whether the objection claim is valid, if there

 3   is in fact an objection.     How do we know this?            Because

 4   section 522(a) says value is determined as of the date

 5   the debtor files for bankruptcy.

 6               We do not have sales to determine whether,

 7   in fact, the property is what it's worth.            We determine

 8   whether the -- that the claim of exemption is valid.

 9   First, there's a judicial determination of value.                 It's

10   geared towards the date of the petition date.              Why?

11   Because Congress understood that debtors want this

12   property, not just a check from the trustee.               It's part

13   and parcel of their fresh start.          As this Court

14   explained in Rousey and in Owen, that the fresh start

15   policy embraces the exemption.         That is very plain.

16               JUSTICE BREYER:        I'm very confused because

17   of your answer to Justice Sotomayor.            I thought what you

18   were saying -- she said, well, you only have 30 days;

19   you get all this value.     That doesn't say very much.

20   You said, well -- you -- you said less.            Okay?

21               MR. BRUNSTAD:      I'm sorry, Justice Breyer.

22               JUSTICE BREYER:        You said less time.

23   Which isn't much of an answer, but it's something.                Now,

24   I would have thought you were going to say but it's 30

25   days from the creditors' meeting ending, and that's a

19   answer to that question?

20                  MR. BRUNSTAD:      Justice Breyer, the practical

21   reality is that there are over a million bankruptcy

22   cases that are filed a year.              Most of those are Chapter

23   13 or Chapter 7 cases, hundreds and hundreds of

24   thousands of them.

25                  And that's why the box that's checked on


                                      46

 1   page 28a is a key piece of information for the trustee.

 2   When the debtor says, this is basically a no-asset case;

 3   after you take account of my exemptions, there's no

 4   property left over for unsecured creditors ­- the

 5   trustee looks at that.      And as a practical matter, the

 6   trustee makes a judgment -- a judgment call:               Hmm.   I

 7   look at all the things, does it look right?               If I feel

 8   like I need to ask questions, I will ask them at the

 9   meeting of creditors. Which is what happened here.

10                 If the trustee then is still suspicious in

11   some way, then the trustee can seek an appraisal, and if

12   the trustee wants to get that appraisal, then the

13   trustee can ask for additional time to do it.               If the

14   court thinks that there's perhaps merit to it, the

15   trustee will give -- the court will give the trustee

16   additional time.    More --

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Here I thought that the

18   trustee got the appraisal before the creditors' meeting,

19   because at the creditors' meeting he said to her, you

20   put down, what, 10,000; I have an estimate that says

21   $17,000.

22                 MR. BRUNSTAD:      Yes.     The facts of this case

23   are exactly that, Justice Ginsburg.               The trustee here,

24   before the meeting of creditors, went and talked to an

25   auctioneer.   In the ordinary situation, it will happen a


                                     47

 1   little bit differently, where the trustee will look at

 2   the schedules, and perhaps before the meeting of

 3   creditors, the trustee might inquire with someone else,

 4   but oftentimes the trustee might ask questions at the

 5   meeting of creditors.      And then if the trustee wants to,

 6   if the trustee thinks it's worth it to get an appraisal,

 7   then the trustee will ask for the -- for the additional

 8   time to do -- do the appraisal, by either asking the

 9   court for an extension or by adjourning the meeting of

10   the creditors.

11               But it's very important at the beginning of

12   the case -- there's a very important finality question

13   here, a finality principle.          The debtor needs to know as

14   soon as possible -- and this is why we have an objection

15   deadline.   The debtor needs to know as soon as possible:

16   Is this my property?     Can I take this cooking equipment

17   and can I use it?    Am I the one who is to insure it?

18   Can I conduct my business?         Can other creditors lend me

19   money now, now that I'm going through bankruptcy and I

20   have my discharge?     Or is this something that the

21   trustee is going to take and sell?

22               That is why we have this objection deadline,

23   to basically say to the trustee, if you have any

24   objections whatsoever about the debtor keeping this

25   property -- whether their value, or the statutory basis


                                     48

 1   under 522(d) is incorrect -- whatever reason it may be,

 2   make your objection and we'll have a quick determination

 3   by the court.

 4                  It cannot be true, as the trustee would like

 5   it, that the trustee can sell at any particular point in

 6   time in the future without having to make an objection,

 7   because that --

 8                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Mr. Brunstad, do we know

 9   what is the division among bankruptcy judges on this

10   issue?   I mean, you are urging that when those columns 3

11   and 4 match, that's a tip-off that the debtor is

12   claiming the entire property is exempt.              Do we know what

13   is the lay of the land among bankruptcy judges?

14                  MR. BRUNSTAD:      Not precisely, Justice

15   Ginsburg, because many of these issues are resolved by

16   unpublished orders.     That it is very difficult to

17   evaluate and get a hold of.           But I think by and large

18   the vast majority of bankruptcy courts follow Taylor in

19   this -- in this area and will say, well, when you list

20   the value of the asset, if the trustee has an objection

21   as to value, then the trustee must make the objection.

22   If the trustee doesn't make the objection --

23                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, once again, Taylor

24   had the word "unknown," and this doesn't.              And that's

25   the problem.

 1               MR. BRUNSTAD:        Yes, Justice Kennedy, so the

 2   courts have to apply the holding in Taylor to a slightly

 3   different factual context.         But most bankruptcy courts

 4   say this is really the same situation.             Because after

 5   all, in Taylor, what the trustee was saying was that I

 6   think the debtor is getting too much -- was getting too

 7   much at the end of the day.          And the same thing here,

 8   the trustee is saying:      I think the debtor is getting

 9   too much; it may be worth more.

10               But if the debtor thinks there's a

11   problem with the valuation -- again, make an objection,

12   because we need to have that finality.             Finality was a

13   key concept in --

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             You mean if the trustee

15   thinks there's a problem?

16               MR. BRUNSTAD:        Yes, Justice Kennedy, thank

17   you for correcting me.      If the trustee thinks there is a

18   problem, the trustee has to make an objection.             We get

19   that finality taken care of, and then we can move on.

20               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Counsel, in -- what's

21   interesting is that all of the circuits or most, the

22   majority, have not announced the fixed rule.             The rule

23   they've said is:    It depends on the circumstances.

24   And so it appears to me that most of the courts are

25   saying to us:   We don't want a default rule, because we


                                     50

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   have to see what has happened and see what has happened

 2   between the parties to determine in one situation rather

 3   than another what the intent was.

 4               It's not an irrational rule.         Why shouldn't

 5   we be considering that as an alternative?         Because once

 6   we make an announcement like the one that you're

 7   proposing, it is an inducement to undervalue your

 8   property, for a debtor, because -- in the hopes that an

 9   overly worked trustee won't have either the time or

10   opportunity or wherewithal to understand that the value

11   is off and that they're going to lose something that the

12   estate is entitled to.

13               MR. BRUNSTAD:       I can see that, Justice

14   Sotomayor, but I think that here are much worse

15   incentives with the trustee's rule, and much worse

16   problems, much greater harm to the statutory scheme.

17               Now, Your Honor's question about these court

18   of appeals' decisions -- I think a lot of them are

19   driven by the following, which has since been cured by

20   an amendment to the rule.       A lot of them involve

21   situations where the court of appeals was thinking ­-

22   and looking at the record and thinking the debtor was

23   engaging in some kind of misrepresentation or

24   manipulation.   And, as Justice Stevens pointed out in

25   his concurrence in Taylor, you know, there is this ­-


                                    51

 1   what about this    problem?       Are there 105 powers?           Are

 2   there -- is there authority for the bankruptcy court to

 3   basically act, if you have a basically bad-acting

 4   debtor?

 5                Now the current version of Rule 4003 makes

 6   an exception for fraud.        If there were bad things that

 7   happened, that's been taken care of now under the rule.

 8   But we shouldn't assume that and certainly not in this

 9   case.   Ms. Reilly was perfectly honest and

10   straightforward.    She set forth everything that the

11   forms required.    The really --

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           No.      There are

13   comparable circuit court opinions and situations very

14   analogous to this one, where the circuit courts have

15   looked at what the trustee and the debtor have done

16   during the process.

17                And if the debtor has not made it clear that

18   they're seeking the full value of the property, as

19   happened here, there was a conversation that the value

20   was off, the debtor did not tell the trustee that she

21   was claiming the full amount of the property.                  And there

22   are analogous situations where the circuits have said,

23   no, that doesn't show your intent because you didn't

24   articulate it to the trustee in the informal meetings.

25                That's not an irrational conclusion by those


                                      52

 1   circuits.

 2                  MR. BRUNSTAD:      It's not an irrational

 3   conclusion, except it is one that is contrary to the

 4   statutory scheme.     It basically says to the trustee, you

 5   need not object by the 30 days, if you want to sell the

 6   property.

 7                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         No.      What it says is, if

 8   you're engaged in good faith negotiation over a value or

 9   over the claimed exemption, you should -- both sides

10   should be open about it.

11                  MR. BRUNSTAD:      Yes, but, Justice Sotomayor,

12   it is the filing of the objection that triggers the

13   negotiation, and this is key.             This is -- this is really

14   quite key because the practice is that, if the trustee

15   exempts to the -- exempts -- sorry -- objects to the

16   valuation, then there is a court hearing, and the court

17   will resolve the objection if the parties can't

18   negotiate it afterwards.

19                  And if you look --

20                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Most of these cases, the

21   objections are -- the discussions are not at the time of

22   objection.     They are at the time of the creditors'

23   meeting.     It is part of the discussion.             That's what the

24   courts are looking to.       What's happening between the

25   parties?     Have they made their intent clear, and what


                                      53

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   does that intent reflect?

 2               MR. BRUNSTAD:         But if there is no objection,

 3   then is no involvement of the court, and the

 4   conversation stops.     And the reason why you have the

 5   objection is because the trustee has the burden of

 6   coming forward and demonstrating that the debtor's

 7   valuation is wrong.     And that's important because when

 8   the trustee is now saying, oh, I just need to sell, I

 9   don't have to object, the trustee is evading his burden

10   of proof.

11               By just simply saying, I'm authorized to

12   sell, I am going to sell, as long as it is not the

13   debtor who doesn't object.          The trustee's proposal

14   inverts the burden of proof.

15               It's now under the trustee's proposal, when

16   the trustee files a motion to sell, the debtor has to

17   come forward and object and now say, wait, I have a

18   valuable exemption here.

19               What -- what the trustee then has done is

20   simply said, I don't have to comply with my burden of

21   proof that's set by the rule and the statute.          After

22   all, section 522(l) puts the burden on the trustee, as

23   well, to object.

24               So they are inverting the burden of proof,

25   and Congress and rules have put the burden of proof


                                      54

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   completely in the opposite way.           And, again, we need

 2   that -- we need that finality.

 3                The trustee would basically have, under his

 4   proposal, an ability to file a motion to sell a year

 5   later, 2 years later, 4 years later, by reopening a

 6   case that's been closed, if the trustee thought that.

 7                Our whole point about finality, which was a

 8   key principle animating the decision below and also this

 9   Court's decision in Taylor, where the Court made the

10   observation that, although these deadlines may yield, in

11   some situations, unwelcome results, they serve very

12   important finality interests.

13                The debtor needs to know, is this my

14   property?   Can I use it?

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But this debtor did know

16   at the creditors' meeting -- she certainly knew that the

17   trustee was claiming the property was worth more than

18   what she listed it as being worth.

19                She could have, at that point -- so she had

20   the notice of what he was thinking.              She could have, at

21   that point, said, I will remove as many items as

22   necessary to bring me safely within the limit.              She

23   didn't do that.

24                MR. BRUNSTAD:      That's correct, Justice

25   Ginsburg.   Instead she said, this -- the trustee wants


                                    55

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   to sell all of the property.              He's filing -- he filed a

 2   motion to sell all of it.

 3                  The trustee did not give her an opportunity

 4   to do that allocation, which she would have had if the

 5   trustee had filed an objection.

 6                  In responding to the objection, she could

 7   have said, well, I'm only going to allocate something,

 8   because the objection would have been under the

 9   exemption rules; whereas, the trustee, when the trustee

10   filed the motion to sell, it was under 363, which is the

11   motion to sell rules, where the debtor would then have

12   had to come forward and object to the motion for some

13   reason, but, again, you don't have that allocation

14   option under section 363.

15                  And, again, the trustee puts the cart before

16   the horse.     The trustee cannot sell property, unless it

17   is property of the estate, and under section 522, if, in

18   fact, the debtor claims property as exempt, if there is

19   no exemption -- no objection, it is exempt, and,

20   therefore, it's not property of the estate.             "Exempt"

21   means exempt from property of the estate.             A trustee

22   cannot sell.

23                  Congress set up this regime purposefully, to

24   have judicial determinations of exemptions right away,

25   and that, again, is triggered by an objection being


                                      56

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   filed.   That way, we know, at the beginning of the case,

 2   does the debtor have the property?                Can she use it?   Can

 3   she continue?    Third parties -- can they rely on that?

 4   Or is this something the trustee is going to be able to

 5   sell?

 6                 Now, it's important also because the

 7   practice, in bankruptcy, as reflected in the Collier

 8   forms, is that the bankruptcy court can make a judicial

 9   determination.    Say, for example, the bankruptcy court

10   here had said:    I think there is some merit to the

11   trustee's objection; the property is worth $12,000.

12   The practice, as reflected in the sample form, is for

13   the court then to say to the debtor:               Debtor, if you

14   want to keep this property, give the trustee a check for

15   the difference between what you're entitled to claim and

16   what I'm establishing the value to be.

17                 That can happen if an objection to the

18   exemption is filed, and we're under section 522

19   exemptions.    That can't happen if we're under section

20   362 sales.

21                 So, again, the trustee's rule eliminates

22   that established practice and that established option in

23   favor of the debtor.     Also, the debtor could say --

24   could reallocate -- the debtor has the right, under the

25   rules, under Rule 1009, to reallocate her -- her


                                     57

 1   exemptions after the trustee has -- she could have

 2   sacrificed some other area or something and taken --

 3   taken her additional exemption availability somewhere

 4   and applied it.

 5                 All those options are foreclosed, where the

 6   trustee doesn't file an objection and the trustee moves

 7   to sell instead.

 8                 Now -- I see my time has not expired.                If

 9   there are no further questions?

17   points, one practical and one about what the forms here

18   mean.   First, as a practical matter, the task of

19   liquidating and selling the -- the assets of the

20   estates is the work that is done throughout

21   bankruptcy case.

22                 Mr. Brunstad's suggestion that,

23   historically, that there was -- the deadline applied to

24   the work of liquidating the estate is simply incorrect.

 1   question, you asked, where do I turn to find out how

 2   hard it is to simply extend the deadline?       The answer to

 3   that question, with respect to the 341 meeting, is page

 4   7-7 of the U.S. Trustees' Manual, which says, quite

 5   clearly, that such extensions should be granted only

 6   under exceptional circumstances, and the trustee should

 7   not continue the 341 meeting when the debtor appears at

 8   that meeting.

 9               So that we have a real practical problem

10   of basically undermining Congress's judgment about

11   giving the trustee adequate time to liquidate the assets

12   for the benefit of creditors.

13               With respect to what these schedules mean

14   and whether the debtor was claiming an in-kind

15   exemption, Chief Justice Roberts, you had it right when

16   you said -- you know, when the debtor files what the

17   value of the property is worth is unclear, the debtor

18   doesn't know, when they file, what this will obtain at

19   auction.

20               The debtor is giving an estimate.      The

21   question is whether one should read these forms to say,

22   if it turns out that my estimate is wrong, I want that

23   anyway, or if the -- or if you should read these forms

24   to say, if it turns out that my estimate is wrong, all I

25   want is what Congress gave me.

 1                And we think that one shouldn't lightly

 2    impute to the debtor a claim to be making an improper

 3    and unlawful claim to keep the thing itself, when

 4    Congress quite clearly gave the debtor a monetary

 5    interest.

 6                And, finally, with respect to the question

 7    of allocation, the debtor can, at any time, Justice

 8    Ginsburg, reallocate, including after the motion to

 9    sell, their schedules.         Rule 1009 says you can amend as

10   a matter of course.     So there is still the opportunity to

11     give the debtor exactly what Congress intended.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, counsel.

13                 The case is submitted.

14                 (Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the case in the

15    above-entitled matter was submitted.)
