 7                    ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN M. FLANAGAN


 8                          ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


 9                MS. FLANAGAN:              Mr.        Chief Justice,             and may      it


10   please the Court:


11                In      1988,         Congress           enacted           the           spousal


12   impoverishment protections of the Federal Medicaid Act, 42


13   U.S. Code        section 1396r-5,             to     accomplish two             competing


14   purposes.         First,      Congress          sought       to     protect           spouses


15   living at home         from impoverishment when the                        other spouse


16   is institutionalized              and requires long-term                   nursing home


17   care.     Secondly,        Congress sought              to ensure that                married


18   couples seeking           medicaid bear a fair share of the cost of


19   such care.


20                This      case       concerns          whether       States        have      the


21   discretion to achieve those competing goals by taking into


22   account     at the        time medicaid             eligibility is             determined


23   available        income       which       the       nursing       home         spouse      is


24   permitted to use after eligibility                        to support the at-home


25   spouse.


                                                    3

                                         Alderson Reporting Company
                   1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
 1                When     the        nursing          home     spouse         applies           for


 2   medicaid, section 1396r-5 permits                        the community spouse to


 3   retain     certain      income        and     resources            to meet          his     own


 4   monthly     maintenance          needs.            The     statute          permits          an


 5   increase in        the standard resource                  allowance, however, if


 6   the     at-home spouse can            show at        a fair hearing                 that the


 7   allowance will be inadequate to provide him with income at


 8   the     State-protected level               once the        nursing home              spouse


 9   qualifies for medicaid.


10                When making this determination, Wisconsin,                                   like


11   more than 30 other States,                  first considers whether income


12   available     to     the at-home            spouse        from the        nursing home


13   spouse will be sufficient to ensure the protected level of


14   income once medicaid             eligibility occurs.                 This      method of


15   determining        whether       to    increase or            to     substitute             the


16   standard     resource allowance               is     called the           income-first


17   rule.


18                QUESTION:         And what do the other States do?


19                MS.     FLANAGAN:              The     remaining          States         use     a


20   methodology        called      resource first,              in      which they            look


21   first     to the     additional          resources          above       the         standard


22   resource     allowance.           These       cases        only arise          where the


23   couple has resources above the standard allowance.


24                In this case --


25                QUESTION:           It would be             very helpful to              me if,


                                                   4

                                        Alderson Reporting Company
                  1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
 1   right at this point, you               pointed the statutory -- pointed


 2   out the statutory           provision that authorizes the                           State to


 3   transfer income at this stage.


 4                MS. FLANAGAN:            The statutory provision, I think,


 5   specifically is found in 42                  U.S. Code 1396a(a)(17), which


 6   deals    with       State      standards           for        eligibility           and   the


 7   Secretary's        authority to          set       standards for            determining


 8   availability.


 9                QUESTION:         Do     you have a handy reference in the


10   brief somewhere to the, where we can see that?


11                MS.     FLANAGAN:             It's      in        the Attorney --            the


12   Solicitor     General's appendix                  at --        the first       thing       in


13   their appendix is the codified statute, 30 -- 1396r-5, the


14   one we   are discussing              primarily, and --               no, I'm          sorry,


15   1396a is in -- the first thing in the Solicitor                                General's


16   appendix.


17                QUESTION:         Page 1a?


18                MS. FLANAGAN:            Yes, and (a)(17) --


19                QUESTION:         That's 8a.


20                QUESTION:         8a?


21                QUESTION:         It looks like 7 --


22                MS.     FLANAGAN:           Yes, Your             Honor,     it is.          I'm


23   sorry.   It is correct.


24                QUESTION:              Then where           in     number (17)           is the


25   language that you're answering Justice Stevens with?


                                                   5

                  1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005
 1                MS. FLANAGAN:             Okay,       a(a)(17) provides that the


 2   Secretary shall include reasonable standards, and then you


 3   skip the     one parenthetical,                for determining               eligibility


 4   for and the        extent of medical assistance under                          the State


 5   plan, and then under (b),                provide for taking into account


 6   only such income and resources as are -- as determined                                    in


 7   accordance     with       standards          prescribed by             the     Secretary


 8   available to the applicant or recipient, et cetera.


 9                QUESTION:           Well, and let             me ask you a question


10   on this point, if I may.                There is a section,                  5(b)(1), r-


11   5(b)(1)    of section 1396              that says          that pre-eligibility,


12   none of the income of the community spouse shall be deemed


13   available to the institutionalized spouse, right?


14                MS. FLANAGAN:             That's right.


15                QUESTION:           And     you're talking              now about          post


16   eligibility?


17                MS.        FLANAGAN:                 We're       talking          about       a


18   determination made at the point                     of eligibility, but which


19   concerns income available post eligibility.


20                QUESTION:         Well, it says pre-eligibility none of


21   the   income       of    the     community          spouse       shall        be      deemed


22   available to the institutionalized spouse.


23                MS. FLANAGAN:             That's right.            That's right.


24                QUESTION:            And      that      provision wouldn't                 make


25   sense if income          of the        community spouse itself                      included


                                                   6

 1   income of the institutionalized spouse.


 2                MS. FLANAGAN:             Well, I think, Your Honor, the --


 3                QUESTION:            Would           it?        It     wouldn't        make any


 4   sense?


 5                MS. FLANAGAN:              I        think you          have to     take into


 6   account     that you're talking about income being calculated


 7   at different points in the temporal spectrum for different


 8   purposes.


 9                QUESTION:            Well,           you're --          you   seem       to     be


10   arguing     that    the phrase,              community             spouse's     income in


11   (c) --      in      (e)(2)(c)               includes              income       from         the


12   institutionalized spouse --


13                MS. FLANAGAN:             I think --


14                QUESTION:            --        and       yet      it can't       under        that


15   section I read, I think.                    I don't understand how you                      get


16   there.


17                MS.    FLANAGAN:                No,        that       particular        section


18   (b)(1) refers only to prohibiting                           income of the community


19   spouse from being deemed available to the nursing home --


20                QUESTION:           Right, but Justice                   O'Connor's point


21   is undoubtedly correct that income of the community spouse


22   there     means income of the community spouse alone, not any


23   attributed       income      from       the          institutionalized               spouse,


24   right?     Isn't that right?                It       has to mean only the income


25   of the community spouse.

 1                MS. FLANAGAN:             I think you have to look at --


 2                QUESTION:         In that section


 3                MS.     FLANAGAN:             --      what's available                 at    that


 4   point.


 5                QUESTION:         I understand.               Do you have any other


 6   section in     the act         in which           the phrase,          income of           the


 7   community     spouse,        means       not       just     the      income          of    the

 9   attributed from the institutionalized spouse?


10                MS. FLANAGAN:             Under the definition of community


11   spouse, income        maintenance allowance, I                     believe -- which


12   is under subsection (d)2(B) --


13                QUESTION:         (d)2 what?

15                QUESTION:           Can     you tell us            where in            the SG's


16   appendix that is?


17                QUESTION:         It's on 59a of your cert petition.

19                QUESTION:         59a.


20                MS.     FLANAGAN:           At       any     rate, that          particular


21   section refers        to monthly           income otherwise available                       to


22   the community spouse, and the -- our position is that this


23   evidences a recognition of the                     fact, as medicaid has long


24   recognized,        that    spouses         are      required to           support          one


25   another, and that this is a background rule.

 1                QUESTION:         Ms.     Flanagan, it might help                       if -- I


 2   think    one of        the main       features of this                legislation was


 3   that    income        from the       community spouse                was never         to be


 4   attributed       to     the    institutionalized                spouse,        but         vice


 5   versa, there is no such prohibition.


 6                MS. FLANAGAN:            That's right, and that's --


 7                QUESTION:         None      of this makes sense                  unless you


 8   appreciate that that             was an       absolute prohibition.                        Now,


 9   tell us where that is             in this statute, that says,                         income


10   from the community spouse is                  not to be attributed to                       the


11   institutionalized spouse.


12                MS. FLANAGAN:            It's in subsection (b)(1), 1396r-


13   5(b)(1), and that was referred to --


14                QUESTION:         That was the section I read to you --


15

16                MS. FLANAGAN:            Right.


17                QUESTION:         -- in my question.


18                MS. FLANAGAN:            Yes.


19                QUESTION:            Could       I     have        an     answer         to     my


20   question?        The section you just                referred me to                 is still


21   not another       section other than the                   one at issue              here in


22   which the simple          phrase, income of the                  community spouse,


23   is used in a sense            that means the community spouse's                             own


24   income plus any income attributed                      to the community spouse


25   from the institutionalized spouse.

 1                You     say that that's                 the way     it's used           in the


 2   provision at        issue here.          My         question is, where              else in


 3   the entire statute is it used in that fashion?


 4                MS.     FLANAGAN:             I        don't    believe          it's     used


 5   anywhere else.          That's        why the          difficulty in           this case


 6   arose, is to try to figure out what that means.


 7                QUESTION:         Well, no, I             think that rather solves


 8   the difficulty, frankly.


 9                MS. FLANAGAN:            I --


10                QUESTION:         I would normally think that income of


11   the community spouse means income of the community spouse,


12   and you say        it means         no, the          community spouse's              income


13   plus   attributed income. I don't know anywhere else in the


14   statute that it's used in                that fashion, just in this                     one


15   section   where you          say we should              interpret it           that way.


16   There are other         sections where it clearly                      means only the


17   community spouse's income.


18                MS. FLANAGAN:               With respect,             Your Honor,          the


19   medicaid statute          has long considered                  available income as


20   part of   the income of the person to which it's referring,


21   and we --


22                QUESTION:         I     mean, where            it does that,            that's


23   all I'm asking        for.         If it's long done that, just give me


24   another section where income of the community spouse means


25   what you say it means here.                    The phrase is used a lot, I'm


                                                    10

 2                MS.     FLANAGAN:           That particular               phrase is           not


 3   used     frequently       in this        statute.           That's        part       of the


 4   problem.     It's only used --


 5                QUESTION:         And isn't it            true that the situation


 6   you're talking about we're deeming in the other direction,


 7   where     they     deem    the      community            spouse        income        to     be


 8   attributable        to the       institutionalized               spouse, not              vice


 9   versa?


10                MS.     FLANAGAN:               Well,       Your        Honor,         Justice


11   Stevens, the        background rule               which I       referred to           which


12   this Court clearly           articulated in              Gray Panthers case                 is


13   that     spouses are expected to support one another.                                That's


14   a two-way street.


15                QUESTION:         That was           for purposes of determining


16   how much of the community spouse's income should be deemed


17   to belong to the institutionalized spouse.


18                MS. FLANAGAN:             That's right.               I'm just          saying


19   that spousal support obligations are a two-way street, and


20   the Court clearly recognized that.


21                QUESTION:           In this          case, we       have the           unusual


22   circumstance where           Congress sought to                 provide additional


23   protection to the          community spouse                to reverse the             prior


24   deeming rule which           permitted States               to take income                from


25   the     community spouse and             require it           to be used            for the


                                                  11

 1   cost of care.


 2                In this       case,        in     the     spousal          impoverishment


 3   provisions and        this provision                specifically, Congress                 is


 4   trying to protect the community spouse by making available


 5   to   the     at-home       spouse        income            that    is     specifically


 6   contemplated to be           made available as soon                     as eligibility


 7   occurs.


 8                QUESTION:           But it is clear, is it not, that the


 9   resource-first        rule       gives        greater         protection             to   the


10   community spouse than the income-first rule?


11                MS. FLANAGAN:              The        result is       that it           permits


12   the -- in general it frequently permits the at-home spouse


13   to   retain a greater share of the couple's joint resources


14   than would be       the case           under the State-defined                      standard


15   resource     allowance,          and     in         that     sense,       yes,        that's


16   definitely correct.


17                QUESTION:         Ms. Flanagan, am               I right in thinking


18   that the,     neither the act we're talking about nor the SSI


19   actually define community spouse's income?


20                MS. FLANAGAN:             No, it doesn't.             That's the exact


21   problem     in this case.              There        is no definition,                and our


22   position is      that community               spouse's income             means income


23   possessed by the community spouse,                         income that the spouse


24   has a right to, and income that is available to the spouse


25   at the particular point when it's being considered.

 1                   QUESTION:               Was         the          income-first            rule     in


 2   Wisconsin        adopted         by     the        legislature,             or by        a     State


 3   agency?


 4                   MS. FLANAGAN:                It     was initially             adopted as           a


 5   matter of        policy by            the State             agency immediately                 after


 6   passage of        the statute.                    Then in          1993 the        legislature


 7   amended     the       statute          to     have          an     express        income-first


 8   requirement.


 9                   QUESTION:         So        then your State court, I take it,


10   under     prevailing          Wisconsin rules,                     could not        ignore the


11   legislature's          determination                unless          it     found        that     the


12   Federal statute was unambiguous.


13                   MS. FLANAGAN:                That -- well, that is                      what they


14   did,     yes,     Your       Honor.               They interpreted                the        Federal


15   statute as        being unambiguous.                        They        concluded that           the


16   State law conflicted                  with the plain terms                   of the Federal


17   statute and therefore could not be enforced.


18                   QUESTION:             Ms.     Flanagan, as                I understand           it,


19   there's a        provision -- and                  these have             been referred           to


20   this      morning,         but        there's           a    provision        that           forbids


21   attribution           from        the             community              spouse         to       the


22   institutionalized             spouse,             period,          no     qualifications on


23   that.

25                   QUESTION:         That's right, yes.

 1                There's        also a          provision which              recognizes the


 2   possibility          of          transferring               income          from         the


 3   institutionalized           spouse          to the        community        spouse after


 4   eligibility has been determined, but                            does not require any


 5   such transfer.        It simply in effect says how you do it, is


 6   that basically correct?


 7                MS. FLANAGAN:                It doesn't explicitly require the


 8   transfer.        There are, however,               powerful incentives in the


 9   statute to basically require them to do it.


10                QUESTION:           But it doesn't, that latter provision


11   doesn't     make      any         reference          to         the     period        before


12   eligibility,        and     I guess          my question              is, why       don't we


13   infer     some     kind     of        a    negative inference --                 when    the


14   provision refers totally to                   the post eligibility                   period,


15   why don't we        find some negative                implication that it                was


16   not expected in the pre-eligibility period?


17                MS.     FLANAGAN:               Well,        the     fact is        that    the


18   calculation that the              hearing officers ask to be made here


19   concerns the post eligibility period.                            The question is, is


20   the at-home        spouse going to have sufficient income in the


21   post eligibility          period, or           does the resource                 allowance


22   need to be jacked up              in order to provide that                      additional


23   income, so in that context, the hearing officer is looking


24   at the     same period           of       time when        the standard             resource

 2                  QUESTION:          So basically the              answer is, the fair


 3   hearing       has     got    to     take       place before            eligibility               is

 5   question.


 6                  MS.     FLANAGAN:         That's right. If the calculation


 7   is looking ahead, if there are no --


 8                  QUESTION:          Ms. -- I have one further question.


 9                  MS. FLANAGAN:            Okay.


10                  QUESTION:           And if       you can't give              me an answer


11   right     away, maybe you can when                    you come back.             It's sort


12   of the flip side of               the question I asked earlier.                             Do --


13   can     you    give us       at     least some           other        portions of               the


14   statute where          income of         the institutionalized spouse                            is


15   clearly used          to mean       the institutionalized                   spouse's own


16   income        plus --          plus        income          attributed                 to        the


17   institutionalized spouse from the community spouse?


18                  MS.     FLANAGAN:         Well,        that really doesn't arise


19   because       of subsection           (b)(1), which             expressly precludes


20   that.

 1                     ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN


 2        ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


 3                           SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


 4                QUESTION:              Mr.       Lamken,         you've          heard     the


 5   questions, and it is difficult, looking at the text of the


 6   statute,     to     figure out         what        supports the           petitioner's


 7   view, although,         as I understand it, that is also the view


 8   of the Federal Government here.                     That income-first rule is


 9   okay.


10                MR. LAMKEN:          Yes, Your Honor.               It's our --


11                QUESTION:           Now, are there             proposed regulations


12   of HHS that        would allow either resource-first                          or income-


13   first rules?


14                MR. LAMKEN:          Yes, Your Honor.               There's currently


15   a pending rulemaking before HHS, and the Secretary in                                   the


16   notice of     proposed rulemaking has determined                            that States


17   should     be permitted to decide whether                       to use the income-


18   first methodology or the resource-first --


19                QUESTION:         How far along is that                   process?        When


20   is that going to be adopted?


21                MR.     LAMKEN:           The        comment       period        closed     on


22   November 6.         There's been a little bit of a delay because


23   there's     concern       that      many          comments       might        have     been


24   quarantined in the           Brentwood facility.                   However, we          are


25   hoping the Secretary can proceed and complete that process


                                                  16

 1   with all due speed.


 2                QUESTION:              Can      I     ask     what        authority         the


 3   Secretary has       to say that the statute is ambiguous, so it


 4   can mean either one?              We don't even let Federal                         agencies


 5   do that under Chevron.                I mean, we didn't say                   in Chevron


 6   that a Federal agency can                 either say that a bubble                     means


 7   this, or say that a            bubble means the other, willy                          nilly.


 8   We   said, since it          can mean            one or     the other,              we'll go


 9   along with whichever one the Federal agency says it means,


10   but here     we    have a        Federal agency             that       says, we         have


11   ambiguous language, so hey, do whatever you like.                                    I mean,


12   it may     be ambiguous, but surely                  it was intended                 to mean


13   one thing     or the other.               How can the Secretary                     come off


14   just telling the          States, it's ambiguous, you                       know, do it


15   either way, we don't care?


16                MR. LAMKEN:          Justice Scalia,               I think the answer


17   comes    in two parts.            The first          is, one doesn't                 have to


18   think that the        statute means two different things at once


19   in   order    to    accept        the      Secretary's view.                   Community


20   spouse's     income can          have      a meaning,           but     there may         be


21   different methodologies,                all of which are reasonable, for


22   determining and calculating what is the community spouse's


23   income.


24                In addition, this               Court has --             and the         States


25   have liberties        in order to            decide to choose               among those


                                                  17

 1   reasonable methodologies, because under section 17 on page


 2   8a   of our,          of     the appendix                 to our        brief        they are        to


 3   establish        reasonable              methodologies                 consistent           with the


 4   Secretary's regulations.


 5                In addition --


 6                QUESTION:                   You        could        say     that        about        every


 7   ambiguity,            I     mean,            that     there            are      two        different


 8   methodologies.               You could have                    said the same              thing with


 9   Chevron.          Now, could                 the     Secretary in              Chevron have --


10   there      are        two         different           methodologies                  of     deciding


11   what's --        what        is        it, point           of     emission,           or -- point


12   source, yes, point source of emission.


13                MR. LAMKEN:                 In fact, Justice Scalia, this Court


14   has upheld precisely that type of regulation issued by the


15   Secretary.            In     a case called                 Batterton v.              Francis, and


16   again in a case              called Lukar v. Reed, in which                                you wrote


17   the opinion           for        the     Court,           when the           statute        did     not


18   clearly      preclude                  one     methodology               or      another,           the


19   Secretary,        because              the     Secretary           has quasi-legislative


20   authority        to        set     standards              in     this        area,        may     adopt


21   standards that permit variations from State to State.


22                In Batterton v. Francis, it                                was under AFDC, and


23   the question              is, what was              unemployment?              Did        it include


24   striking workers,                 or did it not, and                    the Secretary said,


25   States, you           may determine                 that based           on your           own State

 1   law.     In Lukar v. Reed, the question was whether or                                    not a


 2   tort     judgment would           be considered            income or           resources.


 3   The Secretary threw guidance                  to all the States                 that they


 4   had the     option        of choosing         it     as income           or     resources


 5   because both are reasonable.


 6                This        Court     in Lukar         v.     Reed again           held that


 7   decision, so in           this particular            area, where States                    have


 8   the principal           responsibility            of establishing              standards,


 9   the Secretary may establish the boundaries, the reasonable


10   boundaries         within         which       those         standards               may      be


11   established, but           unless the, and so long as the standards


12   established        by     the     State are         not     contradicted              by the


13   statute,      are        not      contradicted             by     the         Secretary's


14   regulations, and are reasonable --


15                QUESTION:           But    Mr. Lamken, isn't this                      a little


16   different, because              in this      statute, if           I understand              it


17   correctly, there           is express         statutory authorization                       for


18   the resource-first method, whereas the income-first method


19   is drawn by inference from what you consider ambiguities?


20                MR.        LAMKEN:        No, Your          Honor.      I    believe that


21   neither methodology is particularly compelled or expressly


22   authorized     by the statute.                The statute            simply does not


23   speak to the issue of              whether when a spouse, a                     community


24   spouse     is going to           have a      shortfall in income                    you make


25   that up     first by paying additional money to the person in

 2   home, which        is the      income-first methodology,                      or whether


 3   first you raise the resource allowance                          so that she may --


 4   so     that the     person at         home        has additional            income from


 5   resources.


 6                I think        I should         probably go           back and         answer


 7   Justice O'Connor's and Justice Scalia's question about the


 8   meaning of        community spouse's               income in         section (b)(1),


 9   because     there has        been      a     suggestion about               necessarily


10   includes only the           income paid            directly to the             community


11   spouse.      It is in our           view a subtle legal tradition that


12   the community spouse's income, or                      one spouse's income may


13   include     income from another                  spouse that is           deemed to be


14   income of the        community spouse               in contemplation of               law,


15   and so in     (b)(1) community spouse's income                          could include


16   income      from     the       institutionalized                spouse         that    the


17   institutionalized           spouse         can     make     available.              That's


18   consistent        with the presumption               of spousal           support, and


19   it's     consistent with,           for example,            existing regulations


20   such as those in --

 2   as deeming?


 3               MR. LAMKEN:             Right.        All it says is that income

 5   available to the institutionalized spouse.


 6               QUESTION:         Correct.


 7               MR. LAMKEN:            The inference to be drawn from that


 8   is that there is no           prohibition in deeming income of                         the


 9   institutionalized spouse --


10               QUESTION:         But     even if there's no                 prohibition,


11   where is your authorization for doing this?                            That's what I


12   don't find in the statute.


13               MR. LAMKEN:            Your Honor, it was -- it's a --


14               QUESTION:         If     you start from a               background rule


15   with the name      on the check as                a background rule                for the


16   whole SSI    program, how can               you change that              rule without


17   authorization?


18               MR. LAMKEN:            That's the mistake, Justice --


19               QUESTION:         Pardon me?


20               MR.    LAMKEN:              That's        the       mistake,           Justice


21   Stevens.       You don't           start with         the presumption               of the


22   name-on-the-check rule.               You        start from         the presumption


23   that the    income of one spouse may be deemed the income of


24   another spouse because              the general           rule is that             spouses


25   may be expected to support --

 1                  QUESTION:            Where in           the     statute does             it say


 2   that?


 3                  MR. LAMKEN:            The statute             doesn't but             Congress


 4   said it       when it       enacted the              Medicaid Act         in the         first


 5   instance,       and     that was         the         established rule            under the


 6   Secretary's policies               at the       time that          this statute            was


 7   enacted.       If you look          at the Secretary's regulations that


 8   existed when Congress enacted this, it said the income --


 9                  QUESTION:            That        was         deeming,      not          reverse


10   deeming.


11                  MR. LAMKEN:          I'm sorry.


12                  QUESTION:            That        was         deeming,      not          reverse


13   deeming.


14                  MR. LAMKEN:            No, Your Honor.                 In fact, deeming


15   did occur --          reverse deeming                did occur,        or could          occur


16   under the       prior policies, particularly in                          section 209(b)


17   States.        Now, in most situations --                      well, first for post


18   eligibility determinations, States did set aside a certain


19   amount of       money of the            institutionalized spouse's income


20   for the       support of the community spouse, and they treated


21   that money as          unavailable to                the spouse        in the          nursing


22   home so that it could be available to the                              spouse at home.


23   That     is    this     situation which                you     have      called reverse


24   deeming.


25                  Second,         even        at         the      eligibility              stage,

 1   particularly           in     section        209(b)         States,        it     would      be


 2   permissible to              deem the        income of         the institutionalized


 3   spouse to be income of the community spouse.


 4                   Now,        it might not         often come up,              but it would


 5   come up when, for example,                    both were applicants, in which


 6   case that would be permissible,                        so the settled background


 7   principle that existed at the                        time Congress acted is that


 8   spouses        support         each      other         mutually,          and          Congress


 9   eliminated one of              those presumptions                on a going             forward


10   basis     in     (b)(1)        and said,         no,      the      community spouse's


11   income shall not be deemed available                            to institutionalized


12   spouses, but left              in place the background                    principle that


13   an institutionalized spouse,                     if they have the                funds, can


14   support the spouse --


15                   QUESTION:             You       can     leave       that         background


16   principle in           place, and we can               all concede that                 it's in


17   place, without thereby coming to the belief that                                       when you


18   say income of           the community spouse,                   you mean, income             of


19   the community spouse plus whatever is deemed                                 attributable


20   to the community spouse.


21                   I mean,        I don't        contest the           principle, but 
 I

22   don't -- that's just not a reasonable way to use language.


23   I agree it can be              deemed, but you should say --                           it would


24   have been very easy to say, income of the community spouse


25   including any attributed income.

 4   your applicant        for SSI, for example, it said, we count as


 5   your income your income plus                  income from other people, so


 6   that it treated it as the individual's income, and that is


 7   consistent     with        the       background          principle            that        each


 8   spouse's income         is income to              the other spouse,                 and when

16   Justice Scalia, actual income that's passed over you don't


17   need a deeming rule, because that's actually --

21   there were categories,               such as spouses, such                  as parents,


22   such     as -- there is another category I can't remember the

 1                QUESTION:           But I       take it        the only          thing that


 2   you've got express in the record anywhere to indicate that


 3   really is     what Congress had in                  mind is the            statement in

 5   refers to other income attributed, is that right?                                   That's


 6   the only thing in black and white.


 7                MR. LAMKEN:           That is the only thing in black and


 8   white, other       than the         fact that          the settled            background


 9   principles     the      Secretary            operated         under        before      the


10   enactment     would        treat      the     income          of     one      spouse    as


11   available to       the other.          It     was not merely               deeming from


12   the to     community spouse to               the institutionalized spouse,


13   but deeming in the other direction occurred.

16                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MITCHELL HAGOPIAN


17                         ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


18                QUESTION:           Counsel, would             you mind          telling us


19   why it matters which rule is followed by a State, resource


20   first or income first, not just in an individual case, but


21   overall?     Who saves         what in terms of money if                      you do one


22   thing or the other?


23                MR. HAGOPIAN:            Yes, Justice O'Connor.                   Under the


24   resource-first rule the applicant, the community spouse of


25   the applicant,        of     the institutionalized                   spouse, is        the

 1   person who gets the money,                   and they get the money                   in the


 2   form of     an expanded          community spouse               resource allowance


 3   that then generates income that                      brings the monthly -- the


 4   community spouse's             actual income up to or as close to the


 5   monthly need amount that's set by the State.


 6                Under income             first, the           income is         fictionally


 7   imputed from the institutionalized spouse to the community


 8   spouse,     but    it     doesn't        actually           go to      the     community


 9   spouse.       That        would        not         ever     happen         until       after


10   eligibility had actually been determined.


11                So    in the        aggregate,           the resource-first                rule


12   allows     community          spouses        who     would      not        adequately be


13   protected     by        the     formula        community            spouse          resource


14   allowance, because that does not generate income up to the


15   monthly need amount and because they have no other income,


16   or not enough        income to bring them                   up to that level,             it


17   allows them to actually have                   resources that will generate


18   that      income        and      protect            them      even           after       the


19   institutionalized spouse passes away.


20                QUESTION:           Doesn't it           also      make possible            the


21   payments, the actual payments start earlier?                                 I mean, the


22   reason      this        was      of      such         concern         is      that       the


23   institutionalized spouse would not be eligible monthly for


24   checks,     so that       the immediate effect                  was she        could pay


25   down more rapidly what was her excess resources before she


                                                   26

 1   qualified.         Isn't that the primary effect?                       It's that the


 2   payments under medicaid start earlier?


 3                MR.     HAGOPIAN:             Yes.          If I      understand           your


 4   question     correctly,          Justice           Ginsburg,       the income-first


 5   rule requires        that those assets be                   spent down.              Is that


 6   the answer to your question?


 7                QUESTION:            Yes,       so that --           Justice           O'Connor


 8   asked you what the effect of --


 9                MR. HAGOPIAN:            Yes.


10                QUESTION:         And I think            the immediate effect of,


11   she starts     to collect medicaid sooner and doesn't use the


12   spousal resources.


13                MR.      HAGOPIAN:              Oh,      now     I    understand           your


14   question.     No, that's not             true.        Under income first,                the


15   institutionalized spouse               does not become eligible.                        Only


16   under     resource first          does       the institutionalized                    spouse


17   become eligible, and             then that           allows the payments                post


18   eligibility to actually occur to the community spouse.


19                QUESTION:         Maybe       I am not making              myself clear.


20   I thought the principle of that is to the couple, of using


21   your    resource rather           than the           income       first -- resource


22   first, is that the institutionalized                         spouse, it pays down


23   quicker,     and is       therefore          eligible         for medicaid             money


24   sooner.      That's what your position achieves,                            is that not


25   so?

 3                QUESTION:         But doesn't that assume your case and


 4   not    the more typical           case, the more              typical case, given


 5   statistical projections, is                  that the husband will                  be the


 6   institutionalized person, and                     so in     the typical case               it


 7   will not work to the advantage of the couple?


 8                MR. HAGOPIAN:              Well,       I would        agree with            you,


 9   Justice Kennedy,          that the          typical case           is statistically


10   that is the husband that goes into the nursing home first,


11   and we    don't have that             case here today, but                  I believe I


12   disagree with you as to               the effect that this has.                      First


13   of    all the sex of the spouses doesn't necessarily matter,


14   as is indicated         by this case.               It's possible for               a male


15   spouse to be       the community spouse                   and have exactly               what


16   happened here happen.


17                QUESTION:         Mr. --        I'm sorry.          Are      you finished


18   with that?     I didn't want to cut off your answer.


19                MR. HAGOPIAN:              I    don't think           I answered            your


20   question, Justice Kennedy.


21                But    the      institutionalized                spouse,         if    it     is


22   the -- are you asking me whether, if the institutionalized


23   spouse has a higher income,                  that what happened here won't


24   happen?    Is that the question, or --


25                QUESTION:           Yes.        I     assume in         many cases           the


                                                  28

 1   husband is the first to be hospitalized, and he is the one


 2   with the greater income.


 3                MR. HAGOPIAN:             That's correct,             so in many cases


 4   the income     first rule will have                    a worse effect               when the


 5   husband is the one that goes in first.                          Because his income


 6   will    be higher, there              will be         more income that               will be


 7   attributed to the community spouse in this pre-eligibility


 8   determination,        and      that      will prevent            her      from        having


 9   income of     her own        that would              raise her        to the         minimum


10   monthly needs allowance.                 If         resource-first was used                  in


11   that case, she would be                able to retain assets that                         would


12   generate actual income to her that                       would meet the monthly


13   need allowance.


14                QUESTION:         Mr. Hagopian --


15                QUESTION:           Well, if            States cannot           follow this


16   income-first       rule,       maybe       they        would     just        respond         by


17   reducing the       minimum monthly maintenance                        needs allowance


18   and adjust it that way.


19                MR. HAGOPIAN:             Yes.


20                QUESTION:           Or     adjust         downward        the     resources


21   protectable for the community spouse.


22                MR. HAGOPIAN:             Yes.         Yes, Justice O'Connor, that


23   could    happen.        That      is     where         the flexibility               in     the


24   spousal impoverishment provisions exists for the States.


25                QUESTION:           How     many States            are     using         income

 1   first?


 2              MR.    HAGOPIAN:                 We       don't         exactly          know.


 3   According, I believe, to the petition, the State estimated


 4   that it's in the neighborhood of 30 to 35 States.


 5              QUESTION:         Of     course, I suppose a                 really hard-


 6   nosed State could        do both, right,               could use the              income-


 7   first rule plus       adjust downward the other --                        I mean, the


 8   two don't go with each other.


 9              MR. HAGOPIAN:            That's correct.


10              QUESTION:         You either adjust downward or use the


11   income first.


12              I have       this question.               You      maintain that           the


13   statute is not ambiguous, if they --


14              MR. HAGOPIAN:            That's correct, Your Honor.


15              QUESTION:           -- do       it this         way.       What is        your


16   burden if it     is ambiguous?              If it        is ambiguous, do             you


17   lose, do you acknowledge that you lose?


18              MR.    HAGOPIAN:              Oh,      absolutely          not,        Justice


19   Scalia.


20              QUESTION:           Do you think the ambiguity has to be


21   resolved, or can        the Secretary             just leave the             ambiguity


22   floating out there?


23              MR.    HAGOPIAN:            Well,       that's essentially                what


24   they've decided to do in the proposed rule --


25              QUESTION:         Right.

 1                  MR. HAGOPIAN:              -- is to          leave it floating.              I


 2   don't think that's the proper method to do it.


 3                  QUESTION:         By proper, you mean lawful?


 4                  MR. HAGOPIAN:             Lawful, that's correct.


 5                  QUESTION:         They are not permitted to do that?


 6                  MR. HAGOPIAN:             That's right.             I agree, actually,


 7   with     the    way you        framed        it in       your       questions to          the


 8   petitioner,          and that       is     that it          just     is illogical          to


 9   assume that          Congress, when            they enacted            this particular


10   protection, which we believe is a fail-safe protection for


11   those few couples who would not adequately be protected by


12   the formula          resource allowance,               that to         have these         two


13   wildly     divergent interpretations                     spring        from the         exact


14   same language seems totally unreasonable.


15                  QUESTION:         Well, what did it do with a case like


16   Batterton v. Francis, then?


17                  MR. HAGOPIAN:             Well, Your          Honor, I believe that


18   in a case like Batterton                  v. Francis, we have a                  different


19   set of rules          here.      First of           all, I believe that               was an


20   AFDC case.


21                  QUESTION:         Well,       but you         know, it's still             the


22   general same ball park.


23                  MR.     HAGOPIAN:             Well,          we     believe       that     the


24   enactment in the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of the


25   no-more-restrictive              rule under           SSI        resolved that          whole

 2   found at the appendix to              our brief -- it's the only                          page


 3   in the appendix -- that the                 question is actually resolved


 4   by the application of the SSI methodologies.


 5               QUESTION:            Well,       you      say      the      question            is


 6   resolved.    Do you mean by that that the Secretary does not


 7   have any    discretion to            decide that            a State          is free        to


 8   follow either (a) or (b)?


 9               MR. HAGOPIAN:            Yes, Your Honor.


10               QUESTION:          And how does that follow?


11               MR. HAGOPIAN:               Well, there's             a     couple           of --


12   first of all, the authority that                    the Secretary has relied


13   on    to issue its       proposed rule and                apparently from which


14   its     authority        to      develop           the       rule       at         all      is


15   1396a(a)(17)(B).


16               Now, it       is our position initially                      that that --


17   that 1396a(a)(17) was actually superseded                             by operation of


18   1396r-5(a)(1).


19               QUESTION:           This is          very difficult              to take        in


20   aurally.


21               MR. HAGOPIAN:            I believe that.


22               (Laughter.)


23               QUESTION:          But go ahead anyway.


24               (Laughter.)


25               MR. HAGOPIAN:             It's almost as difficult                       to say

 1   it.


 2                   But    the spousal impoverishment                       provisions, one


 3   of     the     main    things        that       they did         was      supersede         the


 4   authority that the State and the United States have relied


 5   upon     to issue the           rule and         to engage in             this so-called


 6   reverse deeming,             so -- and          at     the same         time that          they


 7   superseded that rule, they also enacted 1396a(r).


 8                   Now, this rule --               what this rule did,                    and this


 9   rule was actually -- I want to back up.                             Another provision


10   of the spousal impoverishment enactment was 1396r-5(1)(C),


11   and this provision retained the                        SSI methodologies, or any


12   existing         methodologies              that        were        not      specifically


13   overridden by the spousal impoverishment enactments.


14                   Now, the one           thing that           was left untouched               by


15   these spousal          impoverishment provisions was the                               way that


16   income was determined for eligibility purposes.                                   Now, that


17   brings us to 1396a(r), and that provision is the provision


18   of the Medicaid            Act mandates              that the SSI          methodologies


19   apply to income            and resource              determinations for all                 the


20   eligibility groups that were relevant                            in these cases, and


21   that     statute does allow               States and           HCFA, or CMS              or the


22   Secretary        to    issue        rules that          deviate         from      those SSI


23   methodologies, but those                  rules, if they're going                       to do a


24   rule that deviates from that methodology, the rule has                                       to


25   have     the     effect       of     making          more     people       eligible         for

 2   first rule, fails that test.


 3                What      it        does     is --        because       under          the    SSI


 4   program,     if the SSI            methodologies were strictly applied,


 5   the income     of the two spouses                     is separated and              is never


 6   commingled,      and        so     because           under     SSI this         would      not


 7   happen, a     rule which allows it                     to happen in         medicaid is


 8   considered to be no more restrictive and not -- I'm sorry,


 9   more restrictive than                  the SSI        methodologies, and is                not


10   permitted by that statute.


11                QUESTION:             May I ask you              a question?           I know a


12   case   is    easier         if you        don't        look     at the      legislative


13   history, and so it's probably easier for my colleague than


14   for me.

17   interpret the parenthetical                     phrase that's quoted on                   page


18   18 of the     Government's brief, and                        the -- it says           taking


19   into   account         any        other     income            attributable           to    the


20   community     spouse.              I     find        that     kind   of     a       puzzling


21   parenthetical.         How do you read that?


22                MR. HAGOPIAN:               Well, I've two responses to that,


23   Justice Stevens.            First, within the spousal impoverishment


24   enactment, the term, attribute, or attributable is used in


25   two different fashions.                  When        it's used in -- to describe


                                                     34

 1   resources, it has the effect                  of commingling the resources


 2   and pooling them.            When it's used in conjunction with the


 3   term, income, it has             the effect of separating                     the income


 4   between the two spouses.


 5                So     it's       my     initial          position         that             income


 6   attributable        to the other -- other income attributable to


 7   the community spouse             merely confirms the way                     it was done


 8   SSI statutes,        and that is consistent                   with the way                it is


 9   done, where        income is talked about at all, in the spousal


10   impoverishment provisions, and I think there is actually a


11   reason for that           to be in there, and that is that it would


12   be    possible      in     some cases         for      a    community spouse                 to


13   attempt to get           an expanded         resource allowance by                       coming


14   into the hearing and saying, I have income, and it's in my


15   name right now.


16                Typical        would be,         maybe it's           from employment,


17   and at this date when I'm trying to establish eligibility,


18   or my    institutionalized             spouse is           trying       to     establish


19   eligibility, I have that income,                     but I don't believe                    you


20   should count that income to                  me because it's going to                       end


21   next month when my job ends.


22                So I think that is what they were talking about,


23   trying to        foreclose that type               of argument at             a hearing,


24   and     so   I      believe         that     the       real      effect             of     that


25   parenthetical phrase is to confirm the                          separate treatment


                                                  35

 1   of   the income.          The reason              it isn't in        the statute and


 2   it's in the legislative history is because the SSI mandate


 3   under    1396(a)(R)        accomplished                 that     purpose        precisely.


 4   Every    other part of           that legislative history essentially


 5   becomes 1396r-5(e)(2)(C).                   That phrase is missing.


 6                QUESTION:            In        that        particular provision,                to


 7   retain an adequate amount of resources, all that any other


 8   income attributable to                the community spouse need                      mean is


 9   income    attributable           to        him         from     sources        other       than


10   interest on      his      resources.                  I mean,     that phrase             could


11   include his actual wages, couldn't it?


12                MR. HAGOPIAN:                  The institutionalized                   spouse's


13   wages, or the --


14                QUESTION:         The community spouse's wages.


15                MR. HAGOPIAN:             Oh, yes, absolutely.                    It would --


16   I think it does.


17                QUESTION:         I mean --

19                QUESTION:                --         resource        allowance           is     the


20   resources     that      provide income,                  which     means, you             know,


21   stocks or     whatever, and all that phrase there may mean is


22   something,     any      other         income attributable                 to     him       from


23   something other than his stocks.


24                MR. HAGOPIAN:             Right.


25                QUESTION:         Such as his wages, right?

 2                   QUESTION:           You --       your argument             in the         event


 3   that we     find ambiguity I guess                     boils down simply                 to the


 4   fact that        for a variety of reasons it would frustrate the


 5   congressional          policy        behind the             act     itself if           we held


 6   against     you, and yet             in a       way, haven't you               provided an


 7   answer to        that, a counter to that argument in your answer


 8   to the question a few moments ago?


 9                   You said, and I think                  have to say, that if                 the


10   States     lose on the            particular issue before                    us here, the


11   States     as a practical matter can                        get to the same kind of


12   rough dollar          and sense          results simply              by adjusting           the


13   amount of resources,                that is the baseline amount                         for the


14   community spouse to retain and                        the amount of income which


15   is     thought to        be necessary for                  the community          spouse to


16   live decently,           so it       almost seems                as though       it doesn't


17   very     much     matter,         necessarily,              to      the    enactment         of


18   whatever        policy       Congress         had,         whether the         flexibility


19   comes in income versus resource first, or whether it comes


20   in setting the allowances                   for income and assets.                       What's


21   your answer to that?


22                   MR.    HAGOPIAN:          Well, I think that the answer to


23   that is that the resource-first allowance,                                resource-first


24   rule was        placed in a provision                  that is what we                 call the


25   fail     safe     provision.             This        was     a provision          that      was


                                                     37

 2   those few couples -- and I want to stress that this is not


 3   going to affect a lot of people.


 4                   A few couples would not be                     adequately protected


 5   by those formula allowances, and                          so -- because the policy


 6   of the statute was to defeat spousal impoverishment.                                          That


 7   was certainly one             of the primary purposes                     behind it, and


 8   the vast majority of cases                    the formula resource allowance


 9   was going to adequately serve that interest, but in --


10                   QUESTION:          So you're saying               this is kind of               an


11   exceptional case kind of mechanism,                           regardless of how you


12   set income and resources.


13                   MR. HAGOPIAN:            Absolutely.


14                   QUESTION:          And as an exceptional case mechanism,


15   it's only going to work if it works the way you say,                                          on a


16   resource-first basis?


17                   MR. HAGOPIAN:              That's right, and to                  stress the


18   exceptional case component of it, you have to remember how


19   you get        one     of these        hearings.            This      is not           an     easy


20   matter. This is             not something that s accomplished                               by the


21   local agency for every single                        applicant who walks through


22   the door. You have to have - know that you re in                                       excess -


23    have     resources          in     excess           of    this     formula            resource


24   allowance. You have                to go to          your local welfare                 office.


25   You     have     to        apply     for      benefits         knowing           that         your

 1   application is         going to be denied.                   You get             denied, and


 2   then    you have to          request a           hearing, go to                 the hearing,


 3   prove    up    the         need     with        all     sorts         of        mathematical


 4   calculations for this.


 5                 This is        not something that                 people -- the faint


 6   of heart are         going to be           doing on purpose,                    so it is     an


 7   exceptional procedure.


 8                 QUESTION:             Have        you read        the        notice        of the


 9   proposed rulemaking?


10                 MR. HAGOPIAN:            Yes, I have, Justice Ginsburg.


11                 QUESTION:           And I suppose your argument is to the


12   effect that         that's just not              a permissible interpretation


13   of the statute?


14                 MR. HAGOPIAN:            Yes, that's           certainly one of our


15   arguments against            it.     We also believe,                 though, that the


16   statutory      authority           that     the        Secretary           is     using     for


17   promulgating         it,      which        is        1396a(a)(17)(B)               has     been


18   superseded      in spousal impoverishment,                       so the rule itself


19   is probably promulgated pursuant to invalid authority.


20                 QUESTION:           Do we owe any deference to the agency


21   here in its interpretation?


22                 MR.     HAGOPIAN:            Well, because              our position           is


23   that the position they are taking is totally unreasonable,


24   no, you don't owe any deference to the agency.


25                 QUESTION:           Does the income-first rule                       mean that

 2   medicaid care?


 3                 MR.      HAGOPIAN:              Not     necessarily.                   In      the


 4   immediate -- the effect of denying an application based on


 5   income first          would at       that moment            prevent someone                 from


 6   being eligible for medicaid, but -- and so therefore would


 7   save Federal dollars, no question about that, but you have


 8   to remember that the resources that the couple is required


 9   to    spend     in      order       to    become        eligible,            there's          no


10   requirement that those               resources be spent on                   the nursing


11   home, and so it's             possible that those resources could                             be


12   spent for some          other purpose, and                then the person                  could


13   immediately become eligible for medicaid, you know, within


14   a short time after the initial application was denied.


15                 And      the important           thing        about       that point            is


16   that, if      that happens, if              those resources are                  gone, and


17   the    income that's generated from them                         is gone, then when


18   you get to the post eligibility determination, the less of


19   the institutionalized spouse's income is                            going to be able


20   to    be used to        defray the          cost to the           medicaid program,


21   because more of it is going to have to be used to increase


22   the allowance to the institu --                      or, the community spouse,


23   so    in   the short          run    it     may      be --       save      the        Federal


24   Government.          In the long run, it does not.


25                 QUESTION:             Would      you comment            on     one          of the

 3   better view        is the background rule is one of deeming, and

 7   Lamken's presentation             of the          background rule.                  I       don't


 8   believe     that     there       is    any        precedent for           the           reverse


 9   deeming     that he's talking about                     in any of the background


10   rules.     The deeming that            was permitted was strictly                             from


11   the nonapplicant spouse               to the        applicant spouse, and                       it


12   was for the purpose of denying that person eligibility.


13                The one       rule he         talked about            where there                 was


14   some     reverse     deeming          was,        was     also --        was            a     post


15   eligibility        rule.         Under the          old     rules        pre-MCCA, the


16   nursing home spouse could allocate a small amount of money


17   to the community spouse, usually just enough to bring that


18   community spouse above the local welfare threshold so that


19   they wouldn't have to support that person                              on welfare, but


20   that     was a     post    eligibility             deeming,        it     was           not     an


21   eligibility, and in the               SSI program, which is                    what -- we


22   believe     where the        methodologies occur                  that dictate                 how


23   income is to be determined,                  there is no deeming from                          the


24   applicant spouse back to the nonapplicant spouse.


25                QUESTION:         Well,       even under this program,                           as I

 1   understand        it,     in    the     post         eligibility        determination


 2   income     can     be     transferred          from         the     institutionalized


 3   spouse to the community spouse.


 4                MR. HAGOPIAN:             Yes.


 5                QUESTION:          Yes.


 6                QUESTION:          I     might ask one question.                       Examples


 7   help     a lot for me in these               cases.          I couldn't understand


 8   them without them, and the amicus briefs were                               filled with


 9   them,     which        was helpful,        but        the example         I'm carrying


10   around in        my head       is that we            have, say,        a woman            in an


11   institution who has about $200,000                          or $300,000 in assets,


12   and maybe        a small pension of                 $8,000 or $10,000,               and her


13   husband's at home, and he                has a pension coming in,                         maybe


14   of $10,000 to $12,000, and so he's lacking about $6,000 or


15   $7,000 or        $8,000 or $9,000 or $10,000 to bring himself up


16   to the $24,000 level.


17                Now, if you're             right, what               we'll do is,            we'll


18   take the     $300,000 the             wife has,            and we     give it to            the


19   husband.          It     generates about,              I     don't     know, $10,000,


20   $12,000,     and        eventually         that        $300,000        goes          to     the


21   children, and if you're                right, she doesn't have                      to spend


22   it down,     and if you're             wrong, by the way,               if that money


23   goes to     the husband, later on, when her pension comes in,


24   and there's        about 8 or $10,000 coming in, that money goes


25   right to the institution to pay for the health care.                                        She


                                                    42

 1   doesn't get to keep it.                 So that's one way.


 2                Now,        the     other way         is    that she          keeps -- she


 3   spends down        the     $300,000.          She has         to        spend down         the


 4   $300,000, maybe that money goes                     to the institution, maybe


 5   it goes to        fix the roof, but               then when the income                   comes


 6   in, it goes right to the husband.


 7                So I        don't know, you know, I mean, it's sort of


 8   what -- the Government seems to think that it's better off


 9   financially        by making        her spend           the money          down,         but I


10   guess     that depends on           whether the alternative                      is to pay


11   the $300,000        to the doctors            or pay        it to         get the         roof


12   fixed, so when I end up thinking that, I haven't a clue.


13                (Laughter.)


14                QUESTION:           And so therefore             I'd say, well, if I


15   were writing this              statute, I guess I'd leave it up to the


16   Secretary, and           if the Secretary wants                  to leave it             up to


17   the     States,     that's        his     business,         so      I     look      at     the


18   language, and the              language there seems                not to solve            the


19   problem, and -- okay, what's the response?


20                (Laughter.)


21                MR. HAGOPIAN:              That was a question?


22                QUESTION:           I was putting the thing because --


23                MR. HAGOPIAN:              Yes, I --


24                QUESTION:            -- I     want you         to see         that at         the


25   moment I     think,        well, I        can't figure             it     out, but         I'm


                                                  43

 1   working    with those examples,                    and since       I can't,           I say,


 2   leave it     up to      the Secretary,                  leave it     up to          a State,


 3   leave it     up    to somebody           else, as           long     as the          statute


 4   allows that.


 5                I wanted to             expose that to you,               because I want


 6   you to have a chance to say no, you're wrong, your example


 7   is wrong, your reasoning's                   wrong, everything's wrong,                   so


 8   go ahead.


 9                (Laughter.)


10                MR. HAGOPIAN:             I concur with everything you just


11   said, Justice Breyer.


12                (Laughter.)


13                MR. HAGOPIAN:              I think           your first example             was


14   the wrong one,        the one that             oddly enough is bad                   for me,


15   and   that's      because        I     think        you're assuming            that      the


16   resources that are going to                   be protected for the care                   of


17   the   spouse will be transferred on                        death to the children.


18   That's possible, but if the                   community spouse outlives the


19   nursing    home      spouse,          that     resource         pool,       because for


20   whatever reason         there         isn't        an     independent         stream      of


21   income available to            that community spouse, it's                          going to


22   be that resource          fund that creates the income                        stream for


23   that community spouse.


24                If it's protected, and not have to be spent down


25   to medicaid       eligibility,           that community              spouse is          much


                                                   44

 1   more likely to retain it,                 not spend it on things                   that he


 2   doesn't need      in order to             preserve that income                stream so


 3   that he    can take       care of          himself, hopefully,                not in     a


 4   nursing home but perhaps in                 some sort of noninstitutional


 5   setting that he would prefer over that.


 6               So that's my response to your question.


 7               QUESTION:         You make a           big point of that.                 What


 8   happens if you lose and the institutionalized spouse dies,


 9   and   that is a problem.              I don't         know why the Government


10   doesn't, as a matter of policy, make a pretty strong case,


11   but the -- I guess the             response will be, well, you                       know,


12   everybody knows this.


13               Everybody, no matter                 how well-educated or badly


14   educated, or -- they all know,                   when they get that pension


15   choice, that      if you either take                it all for           yourself, or


16   you say,    when I       die I want          my spouse           to get       some, and


17   so -- they've all made that conscious choice, and                                  if they


18   make it to protect the spouse, that's up to them, and they


19   probably will.           I mean,          that will        be     the response, 
 I

20   think, to that argument.


21               MR. HAGOPIAN:            It     would be.           The    problem, when


22   you -- my understanding -- I'm not a pension expert by any


23   means, but when        you exercise an option                    that protects the


24   surviving spouse, you so deflate the value of the                                  pension


25   that it's economically a poor decision to make.

13   to the question.

15                MR. HAGOPIAN:               Well, it was in the opening                  that


16   I didn't get a chance to make, so --

18                QUESTION:             In your           response to Justice Breyer,


19   isn't it so, or am I -- counsel, am I --


20                MR. HAGOPIAN:               Pardon me.


21                QUESTION:         -- wrong in thinking that under ERISA


22   there   is    a    requirement             to        provide for       the     surviving


23   spouse, it isn't the option of the insured individual?


24                MR. HAGOPIAN:               Well, I'm no expert on ERISA, but


25   I believe that there is                  a notice requirement and a                  sign-

 1   off     requirement in ERISA.                  If the           community spouse does


 2   sign     off    for     her rights,            then        it     doesn't necessarily


 3   happen.        It's not a mandated --                     it can't be         overcome by


 4   activity by the surviving spouse.


 5                  QUESTION:           But it's not             the insured's election


 6   in the first place.              Of course, if the surviving -- if the


 7   spouse     wants      to       cooperate            and     says,      I      don't     want


 8   anything --


 9                  MR. HAGOPIAN:            Right.


10                  QUESTION:              But      it     isn't         the     wageearner's


11   choice --


12                  MR. HAGOPIAN:            No.


13                  QUESTION:         -- to say, I don't want, usually her,


14   to be any part of it.


15                  MR. HAGOPIAN:             That's right, but I                  think those


16   decisions are         made at a time                when long-term care               is not


17   necessarily in the immediate offing,                             and maybe -- usually


18   at     age 65 or thereabouts,                long before nursing home stays


19   may be inevitable, and so the couple is making an informed


20   choice about how best to maximize their income stream.


21                  I mean, nobody is ready                     for nursing home stays,


22   and to plan for that, you know, based at the time that you


23   make your pension            election would be counter                      to, I think,


24   human nature.


25                  QUESTION:         Mr. Hagopian, I                 want to come back to


                                                    47

 1   the snippet from          legislative history that is                       referred to


 2   on page     18 of     the Government's               brief.          I guess         if you


 3   believe that legislative history, then it would have to be


 4   done the way the Government says it need only may be done.


 5   I mean, if you believe              the Government's interpretation of


 6   that legislative          history, it             certainly        doesn't say          the


 7   Secretary has the option.                  It either says what you                    think


 8   it means,     or it requires the Secretary to use the income-


 9   first method, no?


10                MR. HAGOPIAN:            I think I frankly agree with you,


11   Justice Scalia.


12                Thank you.


13                QUESTION:         Thank you, Mr. Hagopian.


14                Ms. Flanagan, you have 3 minutes left.


15               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN M. FLANAGAN


16                         ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


17                MS.    FLANAGAN:          Thank you, Your               Honor.         I would


18   like     to talk about the            impact of what the resource-first


19   rule is.     I think there have been questions on that.


20                The    impact        of the          resource-first            rule is      to


21   devote     limited medical            assistance funds               to     couples who


22   have resources substantially above the Federal maximum set


23   levels and that, in turn, necessarily means, since we have


24   limited pots of income, that that deprives States of money


25   needed to serve --


                                                  48

 1                   QUESTION:         Why is that?            I mean, he just said on


 2   that that -- and it certainly                        was in the briefs, that                 if


 3   you say        they have to spend down the $300,000, they're not


 4   going     to     give it        to     the      doctors         in the       institution.


 5   They'll        fix     the    roof,       they'll         pay off         the     mortgage,


 6   they'll figure           out one of 50               other things, so             the State


 7   will actually end             up with less money,                  because they won't


 8   get that        $300,000 as a            set-off and, moreover,                   they lose


 9   the income coming in later as a set-off.


10                   MS.     FLANAGAN:            Well,      neither         of us          have any


11   statistics on that.               I'm sure that people do pay off their


12   long-term        financial obligations,                   but      they also            have to


13   pay for        the nursing home, and                  that bill doesn't                 go away


14   every month, so if they're                    not eligible, they're going to


15   have to be           providing for that in                some way, so            while the


16   statute doesn't force                them to          devote their resources                 to


17   that, there are powerful practical                          reasons why people are


18   going to do that.


19                   Another part           of the impact             that I'm         concerned


20   about is        touched on by Mr. Hagopian, who says that States


21   can just lower           their resource               standards and lower                 their


22   income maintenance standards.                         Well,      what that says             is,


23   States, you should              serve fewer people.                   You should serve


24   fewer elderly           so that        you can         have the         money to          serve


25   people who happen to have resources in excess, and in many


                                                     49

 1   cases    substantially in            excess of          the standard               resource


 2   limits.


 3               The Cleary case,              which is cited in                the briefs,


 4   is a    good example        of that kind            of potential             situation.


 5   That was    a situation in which the nursing home spouse had


 6   something in the neighborhood of a $1/4 million of                                   excess


 7   resources, but because             of the income of               the -- set-up of


 8   the spouses it would have taken that -- those resources to


 9   make up that      income, even though that                     particular spouse,


10   as I recall, also would have had money.


11               CHIEF      JUSTICE          REHNQUIST:              Thank         you,       Ms.


12   Flanagan.    The case is submitted.


13               (Whereupon, at            11:04        a.m.,       the     case         in   the


14   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
