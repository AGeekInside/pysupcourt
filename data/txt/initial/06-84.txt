 8                ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

 9                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10                 MS. MAHONEY:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11   please the Court:

12                 I'd like to turn first to the Ninth

13   Circuit's interpretation of the term "willfully" and its

14   determination that the case had to be remanded for

15   further proceedings to permit an opportunity to explore

16   Petitioners' communications with their counsel.                 We ask

17   this Court to find that there is no necessity for any

18   such inquiry for waivers of attorney-client privilege

19   because summary judgment should have been affirmed in

20   this case.

21                 Petitioners and their counsel, if you think

22   about what communications you might find, they could not

23   have known anything more about these statutory issues of

24   first impression than the district court did.                 It's

25   questions of law.    And if the district court's opinion


                                         4

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   does not reflect reckless disregard for the law, for the

 2   reading of the statute, then it would be inappropriate

 3   to characterize Petitioners' adoption of the very same

 4   views as either a knowing or reckless violation of the,

 5   of the FCRA.

 6              The first -- the Ninth Circuit nevertheless

 7   reached a contrary conclusion, and said it was time to

 8   go ahead and look at privileged communications if the

 9   Petitioners wanted to defend the case, because they made

10   self-interpretive errors about the meaning of willfully.

11              And the first is that they read willfully in

12   this setting to mean recklessly, and relied on several

13   cases where this Court has read the term willfully in

14   civil statutes to mean recklessly.

15              But this Court has said repeatedly that the

16   word willfully is contextual, that you have to look at

17   all of the sections of the statute to see how it's used

18   to determine whether it means with knowledge that your

19   conduct violates the law, or whether reckless violations

20   are sufficient.   And in this particular statute, unlike

21   the other three that were at issue, Congress has used

22   the term willfully in other sections of the law to mean,

23   as Plaintiffs concede, that the Defendant knows that

24   their conduct violates the Act.

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, it's also used in the


                                        5

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   phrase "knowing and willfully."             That appears in several

 2   other parts of the statute, and that wouldn't make any

 3   sense if the only meaning of willful is knowing.

 4              MS. MAHONEY:         Well, it actually says

 5   "willfully and knowingly --"

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:             In one formulation or

 7   another, but it combines the two words, knowing and

 8   willful.

 9              MS. MAHONEY:         Well, this Court, though, has

10   held that willfully and knowingly, when that phrase is

11   used together, it's been discussed in a number of cases

12   including Dixon recently, that it means -- willfully

13   means knowledge that the conduct violates the law, and

14   knowingly means knowledge of the relevant facts.                  And

15   that would make perfect sense in this setting, and so

16   the term willfully when, again, used --

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:             You mean willfully alone?

18              MS. MAHONEY:         It --

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Where -- where it -- where

20   it means what you think it means, which is knowingly,

21   that does not mean knowing the facts?                  If you mistake

22   the facts and are laboring under a misimpression of the

23   facts, you have nonetheless willfully violated the law?

24              MS. MAHONEY:         Your Honor, in Ratzlaf, the

25   phrase was willfully, not willfully and knowingly, and


                                       6

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the Court held that it meant that you knew that your

 2   conduct violated the law.          And that seems to be the most

 3   reasonable reading here because if you look, there are

 4   also sections of Section 1681n that refer to knowing

 5   conduct, and that would require the conclusion that

 6   Congress used willfully in this section to mean a -- a

 7   less -- a more -- a less culpable mens rea than

 8   knowingly.   And that's --

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So that if you're

10   the CEO of your company, and a lawyer -- Federal counsel

11   comes in and says we've got a real issue under the Fair

12   Credit Reporting Act, I need to brief you on that, we

13   need to make an important decision about whether we are

14   complying, you say I don't want to hear about it, I

15   don't want to know about it.            That would not be

16   willfully violating the statute?

17                MS. MAHONEY:        Well, under -- some cases have

18   suggested that there could be a willful blindness

19   instruction that would govern whether you define that as

20   knowing or not.   Certainly --

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So it doesn't have

22   to be actual knowledge?

23                MS. MAHONEY:        I think that the best reading

24   of knowingly is actual knowledge or something that is,

25   that is everything but, you know, that really is --


                                        7

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            How about reckless

 2   disregard?

 3                 MS. MAHONEY:        Well, conscious disregard is a

 4   recklessness standard, and even if the Ninth Circuit

 5   correctly determined that this should be interpreted as

 6   a recklessness standard, this Court has defined

 7   recklessness to mean that it has to be conscious

 8   disregard, actual knowledge of a high risk of, of -- of

 9   harm or in this case illegality.                And in these

10   circumstances, you can't say that there was a high risk

11   of illegality because what the district court found is

12   that the Petitioners' interpretations of the statute

13   were actually not only reasonable, but correct, and

14   having --

15                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Since the term knowingly or

16   knowing appears in two places in 1681n, can't we infer

17   from that that willfully in that provision also means

18   something different?

19                 MS. MAHONEY:        I think the way it's used, it

20   says knowing, knowingly that they did not have a

21   permissible purpose.       Permissible purpose, that may not

22   be knowledge of the law, it just may be knowledge that

23   your purpose wasn't permissible.                And even if they were

24   using it --

25                 JUSTICE ALITO:         I thought the statute says


                                         8

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   what the permissible purposes are.

 2                 MS. MAHONEY:        It does, but it doesn't

 3   necessarily mean that the individual knew precisely what

 4   the statute said.    Because for instance, users are told

 5   what the permissible purposes are when they get a credit

 6   report from, from a credit agency.                  But more

 7   importantly, Your Honor, I think that the use of the

 8   term knowingly there can also be explained.

 9                 If you look at Section 1681h, it actually

10   provides that certain tort actions cannot proceed unless

11   there is a willful intent to injure, except as provided

12   in Section 1681n, and they are the same kinds of actions

13   that are carved out in 1681n.

14                 And so I think it was to make clear, I think

15   it was to make clear that you didn't have to have a

16   willful intent to injure.           So even if they meant it to

17   be interchangeable with a knowing violation of the law

18   there, I think there was a reason for it, it wasn't just

19   surplusage.    It was to clarify that they didn't have to

20   have a willful intent to violate.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Would you say it's all

22   right to use the model penal code definition of

23   reckless, which is basically what you -- taking it here,

24   you would have to consciously disregard a substantial

25   and unjustifiable risk that the action is unlawful?

 1               MS. MAHONEY:         That's correct, Your Honor.

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:            If you come across anything

 3   that would use that, I mean "reckless" itself is

 4   unclear.   The model penal code tried to clarify it based

 5   on this Court's opinions primarily.

 6               MS. MAHONEY:         But I think you can look to

 7   the way this Court described recklessness in Farmer vs.

 8   Brennan as well, though, as well as --

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:            What's the difference?

10               MS. MAHONEY:         The difference is just, there

11   is two forms of recklessness.             One which says that if

12   the risk is sufficiently high, if a person should have

13   known, you could be -- you could be liable.                But that

14   the form of recklessness that Congress presumably used

15   here in this setting, where there is the potential for

16   very punitive sanctions, was what is referred to --

17   Farmer versus Brennan calls it "criminal," the criminal

18   recklessness standard.

19               And that means that not only do you have to

20   have an objectively high risk of illegality, but you

21   must be actually conscious of that risk.                But in this

22   case, you don't even need to get to the issue of

23   consciousness.

24               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, you said there is no

25   way they couldn't have been conscious of the risk here.

 1   I mean, after all, that's why they went to lawyers.

 2   They know there's risk that this is unlawful.

 3              MS. MAHONEY:         The question is --

 4              JUSTICE BREYER:            But consciousness, I mean,

 5   maybe it should come in in the standard, but I don't

 6   know that that would help you.

 7              MS. MAHONEY:         I think the issue of conscious

 8   -- the risk, though, it has to be a high risk.                    And if

 9   it is a reasonable interpretation of the statute, or

10   even if it is an interpretation of the statute that is

11   fairly debatable, that you have a fair chance of

12   success, then how can you say that is a high risk of

13   illegality, so high that we should say that Congress

14   wanted to sanction you for taking that position?

15              And for saying that, you know, you shouldn't

16   be permitted to adopt a compliance program if there was

17   a fair ground for believing that it was lawful.                    And

18   here what the Ninth Circuit did --

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Suppose there is a fair

20   ground for believing it was lawful.                    Lawyers are in

21   disagreement, but in fact, I believe the lawyers who say

22   it is unlawful, and I nonetheless go ahead and do it.

23   Is that a willful violation?

24              MS. MAHONEY:         I don't, I don't think so,

25   Your Honor, if, in fact, it was a fair ground for -- -

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:           But I think I'm violating.

 2               MS. MAHONEY:        I don't -- yes.           But you

 3   couldn't know you were violating it, and because if it

 4   really is a fair ground for litigation --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:           I'm a better lawyer than my

 6   advisors.

 7               (Laughter.)

 8               MS. MAHONEY:        Your Honor, I think if it's an

 9   area where the law is truly unsettled.                 And here an

10   issue of first impression, a lawyer's assessment that

11   you may lose is inherently predictive.                 These are not

12   true or false answers when there is almost nothing to go

13   on.

14               And so in that area, it's much like what

15   this Court did in Screws, where it said that this was a

16   case involving a willful violation of, or interference

17   with rights secured by -- by Federal law.                 And what the

18   Court says, well, it's not just any bad purpose that

19   Congress had in mind, it is a bad purpose to defy

20   announced rules of law.       They have to be, there has to

21   be sufficient clarity in the law to say that there was a

22   high risk of illegality that you could disregard.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Would you look to the

24   subjective intent of the actor at all?

25               MS. MAHONEY:        Only --

 1              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Or would you just look to

 2   the outcome and say, well, you know, it was a close

 3   question, so even if the actor indeed thought he was in

 4   violation, it was a close question; it's okay?

 5              MS. MAHONEY:         I don't think you would look

 6   at the intent until you found that there -- there was no

 7   reasonable ground or at least no, no -- no fair ground

 8   for debate about the question.             And at that point, Your

 9   Honor, if there was an objectively high risk of

10   illegality, then you do have to ask, what were they

11   consciously aware of; what did they do?

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:            I must say that -- that is

13   not the normal meaning of willful, willfully violating

14   the law.

15              MS. MAHONEY:         Well, I think in Screws --

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:            You're changing it to mean

17   willfully, willfully and blatantly violating the law.

18              MS. MAHONEY:         I don't think so.

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:            I mean, if I know that what

20   I'm doing is in violation of the law, even if it's a

21   close question, it seems to me I am willfully violating

22   the law.

23              MS. MAHONEY:         Your Honor, Screws says you

24   can't know the unknowable.         And if the law, if it's

25   really, truly an issue of first impression, you may

 1   think you're violating the law, but you -- you can't

 2   know the unknowable.        And that's why this setting is so

 3   important, because you can't, you know, put -- impose

 4   sanctions.   Here we're talking about the potential for

 5   an industry facing billions of dollars without any

 6   actual harm to -- to individuals.                  And that --

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Is it really billions?

 8   How many of these have been certified as class actions?

 9                MS. MAHONEY:          I believe that there are two

10   certified class actions.           But many -- there are many

11   cases pending and it could be billions of dollars, Your

12   Honor.   Certainly if the classes are certified, and --

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Would you, would you, as

14   representative of the insurers, would you have a sound

15   objection to class action certification in these cases?

16                MS. MAHONEY:          Your Honor, I'm sure there

17   would be some bases to resist.                But classes have been

18   certified, so I --

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And gone to, gone to

20   judgment?

21                MS. MAHONEY:          I do not believe any have gone

22   to judgment, but I don't, I don't -- I think that the

23   point is that if you allow a thousand dollar penalty or

24   the potential for a thousand dollar penalty for every

25   consumer who didn't get a notice, simply because they


                                         14

 1   may have gotten a better price if they had even better

 2   credit, across the country, if you interpret the statute

 3   that way, and then you can say you can get this thousand

 4   dollar, what is in essence a penalty, and you multiply

 5   that by the number of consumers, then you certainly have

 6   the potential for very, very substantial liability.

 7              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             It's a question how many

 8   will sue for a thousand dollars, given the litigation

 9   costs.

10              MS. MAHONEY:         Well, given that these are

11   proceeding as class actions, the answer is there is

12   plenty on the line to incentivize plaintiffs' attorneys

13   to bring these class actions, and they have been

14   brought, and this is a class action.                   There are two

15   class actions.

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             They haven't -- neither

17   has been certified, has it?

18              MS. MAHONEY:         No, it has not.              They are

19   putative class actions, Your Honor.                    But I, but I think

20   that whether it's a class action or not, we have to look

21   at what did, what did Congress presumably have in mind

22   when it authorized these kinds of penalties and punitive

23   damages based on a willful violation in a technical area

24   where there is no potential for harm?                   And certainly --

25              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I have just two, two

 1   questions on, on willful and then -- because you may

 2   want to talk about the other issue in the case.                  First,

 3   you began by saying that here a district judge has come

 4   to the contrary conclusion; by definition, it can't be

 5   reckless.   Do you have any authority, where we -- for

 6   that proposition, where we have said that?

 7               MS. MAHONEY:           Well --

 8               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              We find all the time that

 9   a right is not clearly established under AEDPA, and so

10   forth -- and disregard what I just said.                  That's my

11   first question.

12               And the second is willfully, as Screws

13   itself makes very clear, it is interpreted differently

14   in the criminal context than it is in the civil context.

15               MS. MAHONEY:           Except Screws, Your Honor,

16   actually says that it was adopting a criminal

17   recklessness standard, not a knowing standard, but a

18   reckless standard.      And that is the same standard that

19   has been applied in the civil cases that use willfully

20   in the punitive damages context.

21               So I think it's exactly the same standard in

22   that Screws does say that the, you can't have, it can't

23   just be a bad purpose, that it has to have been a bad

24   purpose to violate clearly defined rules.                  And this

25   Court has said in various contexts in the, in the

 1   qualified immunity area that picking the losing side

 2   does not mean that your conduct was objectively, you

 3   know, wrongful.

 4                 And that's really -- I think that there is

 5   great significance to the district court's ruling.                   I'm

 6   not saying that in every case, it would absolutely be

 7   dispositive.     I think you have to look at what was the,

 8   you know, the clarity of the law, what was the reasoning

 9   of the district court.         But what the Ninth Circuit did

10   is that it, in essence, said that you can't rely on

11   creative but unlikely answers to issues of first

12   impression.

13                 Well, if an administration official goes to

14   a lawyer in the administration and asks about a course

15   of conduct, and is told, well, it's completely an issue

16   of first impression, there is probably a 40 percent

17   chance of success, do you say it's reckless to proceed

18   on that basis?

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, just because

20   an issue is one of first impression doesn't mean there's

21   a high degree of uncertainty.               The statute may be

22   clearly addressed to that issue.                 It hasn't come up

23   before.

24                 MS. MAHONEY:         Absolutely, Your Honor.

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 First impression.

 1                 MS. MAHONEY:        It certainly -- this Court has

 2   made clear that if the language of the statute is very

 3   plain, then, of course, that can be noticed, that can be

 4   adequate warning.    But certainly this statute doesn't

 5   satisfy that standard.        Congress didn't provide the

 6   benchmarks that you have to use for comparison to

 7   determine whether there has been an increase in a charge

 8   or whether there has been an adverse action based on the

 9   consumer report.    You need benchmarks to answer those

10   questions, and there aren't any regulations and there

11   were no cases.

12                If I could save the balance of my time for

13   rebuttal.

16               ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT,

17                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

18                MS. MILLETT:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19   please the Court:

20                The Court of Appeals correctly concluded

21   that willfulness in the civil context, as is used here,

22   includes a reckless disregard component or a

23   recklessness component.         That is what this Court has

24   held in a number of cases that have similar uses of

25   willfulness focused on a departure from the law, have

 1   held.    Thurston, Richland Shoe and Hazen Paper are the

 2   three that have been most discussed in the case, in the

 3   papers here.

 4                But where the Ninth Circuit misstepped here

 5   was in the application of that standard.                      And in

 6   particular, we agreed with Petitioners that when it

 7   concluded that a creative but unlikely position

 8   constitutes recklessness, it erred.                      Recklessness speaks

 9   an extreme deviation from an ordinary standard of care.

10   It requires that the defendant act in the face of or

11   fail to act --

12                JUSTICE STEVENS:            It is a subjective

13   standard or an objective standard?

14                MS. MILLETT:         It has both in this context.

15   It is, I think, first and foremost, an objective

16   component, because there is -- this is a civil case.

17   It's not purely subjective.             And that objective

18   component is very important because that is what makes

19   the act or inaction reckless, and that is the risk.

20   There has to be an objectively high and obvious risk.

21                JUSTICE STEVENS:            So if the potential

22   liability, as in these cases, is huge, then you have to

23   be even more careful because there is liability so

24   great.   So is it the greater the liability -- the

25   greater chance of recklessness, the greater the


                                        19

 1   potential liability?

 2                MS. MILLETT:         No, to the extent you're

 3   talking about dollar liability, I don't think that's

 4   true.    I do think it's fair to say that in recklessness

 5   generally in the tort law, the more serious an injury

 6   that could result, can -- we'll tolerate less risk.                      If

 7   the risk is causing serious bodily injury or death to

 8   somebody, we'll -- the law will tolerate a lesser degree

 9   of risk than it will if, if it's simply causing, you

10   know, a delay in something or a sort of paper injury or

11   maybe even a dollar injury.

12                And it's not set.             It's a variable

13   calculation.    So in that sense, it is.                 I don't think

14   that when we talk about a high and objective risk in

15   this context, we are talking about the dollars that a,

16   that a company would have to pay, although I'm sure they

17   are interested in hearing about that from their lawyers.

18                What we are talking about here -- and this

19   is a very unusual statute the way it's written -- the

20   liability itself, not just the damages, but the

21   liability itself turns upon the extent of departure from

22   law.    You have to -- there is no recovery here like

23   there is in almost -- or commonly in Federal statutes

24   for just a violation.       That isn't it.

25                You have to show either a willful violation


                                        20

 1   or a negligent violation, and that requires a

 2   determination not only that the defendants violated the

 3   law, but a determination as to how much, how far, how

 4   many standard deviations from correct their position was

 5   and that is an objective determination.

 6                Once an objectively high risk has been found

 7   by a court, then -- then the case can shift to looking

 8   into subjective things.         I think a plaintiff would be

 9   entitled, once an objectively high and obvious risk has

10   been found by the court, to rely on that, and allow a

11   jury to, or a judge, whoever is deciding the case, to

12   infer the existence of willfulness from that.                  And

13   that's often when defendants -- I'm sorry.

14                JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I also ask, do you

15   agree with the Petitioner on the meaning of adverse

16   action?

17                MS. MILLETT:         No, we agree with Respondents

18   on the meaning of adverse action.

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Correct me if I'm

20   wrong.    You think if I have an insurance policy, I'm

21   paying a certain rate, they look at my credit report and

22   they say, you know, good news, we're going to lower your

23   rates, that's an adverse action because they might have

24   lowered the rates even further if they had notified me

25   about the credit report and there were some errors in


                                        21
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   it?

 2                 MS. MILLETT:         Right.        It's a complicated

 3   answer, in part because that assumes that you have an

 4   existing account and you're not an initial account here.

 5   And when you have an existing account, there's a

 6   definition of adverse action for insurance provisions,

 7   but in iv there is a separate, there's another

 8   definition, and this is on, on page -- sorry.                 Excuse

 9   me.     On page 3A of the appendix to our brief, iv under

10   big I -- I'm sorry, there's a lot of provisions -- talks

11   about reviewing an existing account, and it

12   cross-referenced another provision which talks about

13   reviewing an account for purposes of termination.                And

14   that would include, in our view, not only completely

15   canceling it, but terminating the existing and charging

16   you more for allowing you now to pay a new rate.                So

17   which would govern in that particular context is a

18   little bit harder.

19                 But it could, and here's logically why,

20   because I think the understanding of "increase" that's

21   at issue here is one that's very basic to the operation

22   of this statute, and that is, did the content of your

23   information in your credit report, if it had been

24   better, could you have had a better rate or a better

25   deal.

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Right.

 2                 MS. MILLETT:         So have you been hit in the

 3   pocketbook.

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So if they lower, if

 5   they lower the rates, you still say that that fits the

 6   meaning of adverse action because they might have

 7   lowered them further if the information hadn't been

 8   erroneous?

 9                 MS. MILLETT:         It could have, and here -- in

10   this sense, it could be:           In the same way that I, sort

11   of the flip side, but in my office, if everybody in the

12   hallway gets a 5 percent salary increase and I only get

13   a 1 percent salary increase, I am certainly better off,

14   but if the reason I got a lesser increase is because of

15   my gender or because of my credit report, it's an

16   adverse action.    So the fact that you're doing somewhat

17   better doesn't mean --

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:            That isn't how the statute

19   defines it.

20                 MS. MILLETT:         Excuse me?

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:            The statute says an adverse

22   action is an increase in a charge for -- in connection

23   with underwriting.

24                 MS. MILLETT:         But it also --

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:            That's what it says.      And


                                         23

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   then it says an increase is -- and if you take an

 2   adverse action, i.e., if you increase it, and your

 3   increase is based in whole or in part on information

 4   contained in a consumer report, you have to send the

 5   thing.    How did you get -- in your example, there was no

 6   increase.    I mean, in a charge.             In your salary, it's a

 7   decrease in the salary.         Same thing.

 8                MS. MILLETT:         The definition again on 3A

 9   includes not just increase, but includes an unfavorable

10   change in the terms.       And so it's not settled whether --

11                JUSTICE BREYER:            You mean unfavorable change

12   in terms, unfavorable change in terms.

13                MS. MILLETT:         Exactly.

14                JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, suppose you don't

15   have, you don't have any terms because you never did it

16   before.   There's no change in terms.

17                MS. MILLETT:         If you're a new customer --

18   and again, I want to reiterate that, how this applies to

19   existing accounts is complicated --

20                JUSTICE BREYER:            You mean those words

21   "change in terms" refer to rates, in other words?

22   That's a rather odd way to refer to it.                      In one place,

23   you refer to an "increase"; in the other place, you'd

24   refer to it as a "change in terms."                      That's sort of an

25   odd way to write a statute.

 1                 MS. MILLETT:         Well, you can have a change in

 2   terms that is not necessarily an increase.                It could be

 3   you will no longer be entitled to a free rental car when

 4   your car is in for repair for some reason.                That's not

 5   an increase.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:            No, no, I understand that.

 7   But what we're after is this.               Everybody has a credit

 8   report, just about.       You put it in and you give people

 9   the best possible rate conceivable, and now, how do you

10   know that maybe there could have still been a better

11   rate?     And it can't be that the statute intends you to

12   send out notices in such circumstances or you'd have to

13   send notices whenever you read a credit report.               Now, I

14   think that's, I've overstated slightly, but that's

15   basically the argument.          So what's your response?

16                 MS. MILLETT:         And Justice Breyer, my

17   response is that if the content of the information in

18   your credit report would have made you -- had it been

19   better information you'd have gotten a better rate, a

20   better result, your pocketbook wouldn't have been hit as

21   hard, you have a dollars and cents injury because of the

22   content of the information, then you had an adverse

23   action.

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay, so your response is

25   just to repeat my question and say that's right?

 1                MS. MILLETT:         No.      If I could continue on

 2   that, if I could add on, if I could add on, the way

 3   insurance companies work is they don't have 3 million

 4   customers and 3 million rates.               They have ranges and

 5   most of them will have a top tier.                  They may have

 6   specialized things for employees, but putting aside a

 7   specialized category, there's a top range and they will

 8   tell you, as they say in the briefs, that 10 to 15

 9   percent of people fit in there.               So they know what the

10   best rate is.    They know what the next, above average

11   rate, the standard rate.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:            How do you fit, how do you

13   fit that within the language of the statute?                    Is it, I

14   fail -- you're a first- time customer and I fail to give

15   you a, you know, a break that maybe you could have had.

16   Is it a denial or cancellation of insurance?                    No.   Is it

17   an increase in, an increase in any charge for insurance?

18   Is it a reduction or other adverse or unfavorable change

19   in the terms of coverage or in the amount of any

20   insurance?   I find it hard to shoehorn your case into

21   that language.

22                MS. MILLETT:         Well, to begin with, that may

23   be why Petitioners' position here certainly was not

24   reckless and the Ninth Circuit erred.                    But we do think

25   that the statutory language read as a whole supports


                                        26
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   this.   It could be a denial of a particular term in an

 2   insurance contract.     But you have to look at -- it's

 3   important to understand you look --

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I read the term as, as one

 5   of the Justices here does, not referring to the rate.

 6   The earlier part refers to the rate.                    An increase in any

 7   charge for, that's the rate.            And then it speaks of

 8   change in the terms of coverage.               I mean, that is, you

 9   know, whether it covers hurricanes, or in the amount of

10   the insurance, whether you're insured for --

11                MS. MILLETT:        Or it could be a reduction in

12   the terms.   I mean, these things are statutory

13   construction issues to be litigated, and the important

14   issue here -- and they are presented in this case.

15   They're to be litigated and the important issue is that

16   when there is fair debate about these issues insurance

17   companies will not be held to be willfully violating the

18   statute if they got the answer wrong.

19                But I think on the, on the substantive

20   question, it's important to read "adverse action" in

21   light of, if I could just finish the sentence, in light

22   of the definition of when a notice is required to be

23   issued, which turns upon the content of the information

24   in the report.

25                Thank you.

 7                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. SHORR

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 9                MR. SHORR:       Mr. Chief Justice and may it

10   please the Court:

11                When Congress intended to require a knowing

12   violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it expressly

13   said so.    It did not do so in connection with the claims

14   here under Section 1681n(a)(1)(A).                  In each instance

15   where Congress wanted to allow -- to require a higher

16   mens rea, it said so and did so in connection with

17   liability that was greater.             They required knowing mens

18   rea for the criminal provision.               They required knowing

19   mens rea to obtain the even higher statutory damages

20   that are available under the act.

21                JUSTICE SOUTER:            What do you say to the

22   argument from drafting history that looks at the history

23   both of little n and little o and it points out that as

24   originally, in the original bill, little o providing for

25   the actual damages required a finding of gross


                                        28
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   negligence?    Little n used the word "willful" just as it

 2   does now, suggesting that willful would not include

 3   gross negligence or something close to gross negligence

 4   like recklessness.      Then in, then in o, they changed the

 5   standard from gross negligence to mere negligence, but

 6   they made no change in n, which suggests that n stayed

 7   whatever it always was, and if the argument from

 8   contrast was that n probably meant knowing rather than

 9   reckless, it stayed knowing even when the standard was

10   changed to negligence in o.              What do you say to that

11   argument?

12                 MR. SHORR:       Justice Souther, I think the

13   only thing we can say about that is Congress reduced the

14   culpability for the actual damages from gross negligence

15   to negligence.    I don't think that tells us much about

16   willful means, what willful means as a separate matter.

17                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            But the fact that they had

18   originally drafted n as it is, in contrast to the

19   original o, does tell us, doesn't it, something about

20   what they had in mind in n.              And they must have had

21   something in mind, probably had in mind, something in n

22   which was a standard higher than gross negligence.

23                 MR. SHORR:       No, Justice Souter, I suggest

24   that what you can infer from that is that, if anything,

25   is perhaps Congress wanted to move, make clear that


                                         29
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   under o the actual damages aren't close to willful or

 2   reckless, so they reduced gross negligence to negligence

 3   in that circumstance.      But that still doesn't tell us

 4   separately what "willful" meant, and of course "willful"

 5   had been interpreted by this Court in similar cases

 6   involving similar statutes to mean a knowing or reckless

 7   disregard.   And I respectfully disagree with --

 8                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, I mean, there's no

 9   question it has been and that is sort of the usual

10   reading in the civil context.             But we also keep

11   repeating, you know, "willful" is a word of many

12   meanings and you always look to the context.             And here

13   the argument is that if you look to the context of the,

14   of the two statutory sections right up next to each

15   other, you can draw a, an inference about what "willful"

16   means.

17                MR. SHORR:      I think if anything, Justice

18   Souter, here the context should be the actual statutory

19   terms used, and in Section 1681n(b) they expressly

20   required the knowing standard and that's a knowing

21   violation of the law, as Justice Alito's question seemed

22   to draw out, a knowing impermissible purpose.                And the

23   statute directly defines what a permissible purpose is

24   under this law.

25                So that reference to knowing could not refer


                                       30
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to a knowing, knowing the facts.                 And of course, willful

 2   in some sense always includes some knowledge of the

 3   factual circumstances.

 4                 In addition, the logical structure of the

 5   act -- as I mentioned, we had negligence and actual

 6   damages.     We have a reckless standard, a knowing or

 7   reckless standard for certain statutory damages, but

 8   then an even higher level for the criminal and higher

 9   statutory penalty provisions.               And as I started to say,

10   a willful, knowing, reckless standard is entirely

11   consistent with how this Court has interpreted the term

12   in similar civil statutes that were in fact passed about

13   the same time the Hazen Paper case and Thurston and

14   McLaughlin cases interpreting the ADA and the FLSA and

15   other similar cases.

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel, even if

17   you're right about the standard, how can you suggest

18   that it's willful here when you have no judicial

19   construction, you have no administrative construction,

20   you have the statutory language that at least the

21   questions this morning have suggested is not perfectly

22   clear?     How can you suggest that the action of the

23   companies on this case even under your standard was

24   willful?

25                 MR. SHORR:       Mr. Chief Justice, of course we


                                         31

 1   believe and the statute is in fact clear, you do not

 2   need further interpretation by the Court.

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So if we don't agree

 4   with you on that, you would lose on the application of

 5   the willfulness standard?

 6               MR. SHORR:       If you don't agree with us --

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 In other words,

 8   your, your, your conclusion that this was a willful

 9   violation depends upon your assertion that the statute

10   is perfectly clear?

11               MR. SHORR:       I think that there is a level of

12   objective component that the statute at least has to be

13   understood by a reasonable person at some level using

14   standard statutory construction.               But that isn't to

15   suggest that the statute needs to be interpreted by a

16   higher court or even a district court for counsel to get

17   guidance.   And of course, in this case, there was no

18   guidance supporting Respondents --                 excuse me -- no

19   guidance supporting Petitioners', defendants', position.

20   In fact, the only guidance supported our position,

21   including guidance from the FTC.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You're talking about

23   the Ball letter?

24               MR. SHORR:       I am talking about the Ball

25   letter.

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  That wasn't even

 2   binding on the commission, so why would that be regarded

 3   as authoritative?

 4                MR. SHORR:        It was not, and we are not

 5   suggesting it is, although it's entitled to Chevron

 6   deference.   But if you get past the minimal level of

 7   objective standard, the question becomes what indicia

 8   and markers were out there that would have guided this

 9   company as to whether there was a high risk that they

10   were violating the act.          And certainly the Ball letter,

11   which was sent by the staff specifically to address this

12   exact question and to guide insurance companies, gave

13   notice and it said charging anyone a higher amount than

14   the best available rate based on their credit score was

15   an adverse action.      And in addition, there was --

16                JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, how could that be?       I

17   mean I agree that the statute is clear, but I think it's

18   clear the other way.        That is, if you look at the

19   language, as you've just heard, if you look at the

20   purpose it's very hard to reconcile with the purpose an

21   instance where a person has continuous accidents.                  He's

22   a reckless driver.      His insurance company puts him in

23   just a category below the bottom and they read his

24   credit report and they discover, despite his faults, he

25   always pays his bills on time.                So they increase it, not


                                         33

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to the top category, but they give him a much better

 2   deal.     And you're saying this statute means that what I

 3   just described is an adverse action based on a credit

 4   report?

 5                 MR. SHORR:       Yes.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.      Okay.   And then if

 7   you're going to say yes, I want to hear why yes, and

 8   then in light of the following:                 The little boy who says

 9   wolf.     You're probably puzzled what I mean by that.                   I

10   mean that if you're right in that interpretation, there

11   will be tens of millions of notices going out and

12   they'll have the same effect on the public that these

13   privacy notices have today.              We get them every day,

14   dozens of them, and they go right in the wastebasket,

15   because they will become meaningless because to an

16   average person that notice will not mean that he better

17   look at his credit report.            It will mean throw it in the

18   wastebasket.

19                 All right, now I've got the purpose, I've

20   got the language, and I have what I think of as common

21   sense.    Now, you explain why it's obvious the opposite.

22                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             This is a different

23   question.    We've been talking about willful up to now.

24                 MR. SHORR:       Yes, and this is the adverse

25   action question.

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            You haven't addressed

 2   adverse action at all.

 3                 MR. SHORR:      And I'm happy to do so now.

 4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Yes.          But, was there

 5   anything further on willful?             You said that the statute

 6   was clear enough and you had the FTC informal advice,

 7   but now we know that courts have divided on this

 8   question, right?    On --

 9                 MR. SHORR:      Divided in the sense -- well,

10   the Ninth Circuit of course overturned the district

11   court's ruling so there's no current division, but if

12   that's what you mean, yes, Your Honor.

13                 In a -- I guess I'll address quickly your

14   question.   There's additional guidance provided by the

15   FTC that was subject to formal rulemaking and that was

16   16 CFR, I believe it's Part 601 Appendix C, and in that

17   instance the FTC, again subject to formal notice and

18   comment of rulemaking, said that the statute is defined

19   very broadly and it includes any action that can even be

20   considered to have a negative impact.                     And that plays in

21   the subjective aspect as well, but addressing your

22   question, Justice Breyer, first on the statutory

23   language --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It's pretty sloppy

25   lawyering, don't you think, any action that even be

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   considered to have -- wow.          This is a standard?

 2               MR. SHORR:       That was --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Any action that can even be

 4   considered to have a negative impact.

 5               MR. SHORR:       That was guidance, Your Honor.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:            This is guidance?

 7               MR. SHORR:       That was guidance.            That was

 8   guidance to provide in the context of reading this

 9   statute, it should be read broadly.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:            But you know, I would tell

11   my CEO ignore that, that it's meaningless.

12               MR. SHORR:       In addition, the CEO would have

13   the guidance provided by the Ball letter.

14               But again addressing your question, Justice

15   Breyer, an increase based on credit, if we had let's say

16   an increase based on race, someone goes in and has a

17   product to buy and there's the best rate, and they

18   charge someone else based on their race a higher rate,

19   certainly that's an increase based on credit.                 There's

20   only one best rate.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But this is not an

22   antidiscrimination provision.             It doesn't say anyone who

23   discriminates in the setting of race has to send out

24   letters.   It requires an adverse action.                It requires an

25   increase in the charge.

 1               MR. SHORR:       And Your Honor, I was only using

 2   that example to try and explain the statutory language.

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:            It doesn't explain it

 4   because if you have an increase in the charge based on

 5   race, of course that's an increase based on race.

 6               MR. SHORR:       Well, here we have --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:            And if you refuse to give a

 8   person the best rate, and lower his rate but not the

 9   best rate, based on race, that is not an increase based

10   on race.   That is discrimination based on race.

11               MR. SHORR:       You're charging someone more

12   based on credit.

13               JUSTICE BREYER:            That's true, and it's a

14   discrimination, but you didn't increase the rate.                 You

15   decreased it.

16               MR. SHORR:       I think --

17               JUSTICE BREYER:            It's still a

18   discrimination, it's still unlawful.

19               MR. SHORR:       Applying it to credit, a natural

20   definition that is charging someone more than you charge

21   others is an increase.

22               JUSTICE ALITO:          When you say more, in order

23   for there to be an adverse action there has to be an

24   increase or an unfavorable change.                 And when you have an

25   initial application you have to figure out what is the


                                       37

 1   baseline in order to determine whether there has been an

 2   increase or an adverse action.              And you and the

 3   Solicitor General just assert that the baseline in that

 4   situation is the best possible rate that you can get,

 5   but I don't understand where that comes from.

 6               MR. SHORR:       Because charging someone more

 7   than someone else who qualifies for that better rate

 8   based on their credit, is increasing them, charging them

 9   more, but it's also evident from the statutory purpose,

10   which I think was a question you asked --

11               JUSTICE BREYER:            Let me look at the

12   language.   Go back to give me -- because in ordinary

13   English, which I hope I speak, it is not an increase,

14   but maybe there is a technical term in the technical

15   language of commercial law or in FTC law where the word

16   increase means decrease.         And if you -- is there

17   anything you want -- no.         It's a serious question, at

18   least if you want to cite me to some authority that uses

19   this word increase in the way you just suggested.

20               MR. SHORR:       We believe that it's a standard

21   dictionary definition, to charge someone more for

22   insurance than they would otherwise qualify for is

23   increasing their charge.

24               JUSTICE BREYER:            Which dictionary shall I

25   look at?

 1                 MR. SHORR:      I think we can look at any

 2   dictionary.    I don't have a cite, Your Honor, but --

 3                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           They're making this

 4   argument, and I think you got close to it a minute ago

 5   when you alluded to statutory purpose.                   I think this is

 6   what's behind, and you tell me if I'm wrong.                   One

 7   purpose of the statute is to alert a consumer that the

 8   consumer's credit report may contain errors which are

 9   doing the consumer some kind of damage.

10                 MR. SHORR:      Yes, Your Honor.

11                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           And you want this consumer

12   alerted so the consumer can ask to see the report and

13   correct it if possible.

14                 MR. SHORR:      That's exactly right.

15                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Reading the adverse action

16   the way you read it, it would give the consumer or

17   consumers a tip-off in the maximum number of cases.                  In

18   every case in which the consumer might have done better

19   if the credit report had assumed different facts, on

20   your reading theoretically, the consumer is going to say

21   I want to look at that report and correct it if it's

22   wrong.   But isn't the fallacy of that argument the

23   fallacy of saying because that is one object of the

24   statute, every term within the statute has got to be

25   read in a way that maximizes the effectuation of that


                                        39

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   object?     And the trouble that we're having on the bench

 2   is that discrimination and increase are different terms.

 3   Increase says the rate actually goes up from a baseline

 4   that the consumer previously had, whereas discrimination

 5   does not.     And your reading in effect, increase to mean

 6   discrimination in order to maximize the likelihood that

 7   the consumer will look at the report, isn't that the

 8   basis of your argument?

 9                 MR. SHORR:       I think it has to be an increase

10   based on some aspect, but the only way to give effect to

11   that statutory purpose is an increase above what you

12   would otherwise qualify for had you had better credit

13   and of course --

14                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, that's a way to give

15   every conceivable effect to that policy.                  But the

16   statute in drafting adverse, or drafting the terms of

17   adverse action, may very well have said we don't want to

18   give every conceivable effect to this purpose because if

19   we do, we'll get into the situation that Justice Breyer

20   described.    Everybody will be getting notices and the

21   notices will be meaningless.

22                 MR. SHORR:       I don't think the notice is

23   problematic because you're alerting the consumer to

24   check that the information that the insurance company

25   expressly relied on to increase your charge --


                                         40

 1                JUSTICE SOUTER:            To set the charge.          I mean,

 2   that's circular.    To set the charge that it gives you.

 3                MR. SHORR:       I don't think you need a prior

 4   charge to suffer an increase.              If I walk into a candy

 5   store and I've never purchased that candy before but the

 6   best price that day is 5 cents but they say we're going

 7   to charge you 10 cents, I've certainly suffered an

 8   increase.

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:            By that you're talking

10   linguistically, but I am interested in the purpose.                     So

11   I looked up on the Internet approximately what percent

12   of the people have the best credit score and that's

13   about 1 percent.    So 99 percent of the public doesn't

14   have the best possible credit score.                     Now I take it that

15   means that you could in fact, if it's even roughly

16   right, have 99 percent or a little less or even perhaps

17   a little more when they look at that report that, since

18   it's not perfect in 99 percent of the cases, it's quite

19   possible that they won't get the best conceivable rate

20   which might be reserved for just perfect people.                     And if

21   that's so, in 99 percent of the cases they'll send out

22   notices.    And that's why I asked my question about the

23   boy who calls wolf.      What will happen if 99 percent of

24   the people who apply for insurance or any other thing

25   get notices?    I suspect that this is only intuitive,


                                        41

 1   that the notices are more likely to go into the

 2   wastebasket than they are if there was really a

 3   decrease.    Now, do you have any light you can shed on

 4   that?

 5                MR. SHORR:       Sure.        The -- as an initial

 6   matter, it's not the perfect credit that is the

 7   standard, it's whatever would qualify you for GEICO's

 8   best rate.    And that's a much broader standard.                We

 9   don't know the exact amounts but if you look at GEICO JA

10   6768, they have fairly broad tiers, maybe five or six.

11   And of course not everyone is going to get the notice.

12   If your driving record totally eliminates -- if you have

13   great credit but your driving record eliminates the

14   possibility that you qualify for the better rate, you

15   wouldn't get notice in that circumstance either.                  But

16   the key to the notice is, if I have very good credit but

17   the information that the insurance company looks at is

18   incorrect, I will be charged more based on incorrect

19   information without ever having the opportunity to tell

20   the insurance company or whoever is collecting that

21   information for them, you've charged me the wrong amount

22   and I in fact qualify for that better rate.

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Don't you have that

24   right independently, though, every year to look at a

25   copy of your credit report?

 1               MR. SHORR:         Well, what's significant here,

 2   that has been added to the statute in the last two

 3   years.   But since 1970, Congress's concern is giving

 4   notice at a critical time, when the insurance company

 5   tells you we are relying on it and we may have taken an

 6   adverse action.

 7               I wanted to also mention, here it's not just

 8   an increase.   There's also been a denial, and that

 9   Mr. Edo applied for insurance from GEICO, and was denied

10   insurance with the stand-alone company GEICO General, so

11   that is also an adverse action under the act.

12               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   When you say you

13   look at the increase with respect to the best credit

14   rate, why is that?      Why wouldn't you look at it relative

15   to say the average insured who walks in the door?

16               MR. SHORR:         Because that -- GEICO's

17   argument, and I think that's what they want, presumes

18   they're looking at accurate credit information.                    And the

19   problem is, Congress has always told that there is

20   significant inadequacy in the credit information.                    I

21   think it's cited in the National Consumer Law Center

22   brief.   In 1996, Congress was told that the error rate

23   in consumer information was 50 percent and there was a

24   20 percent serious error in the rates.                    Under GEICO's

25   interpretation --

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I don't understand

 2   what pertinence that has to my question which is, why do

 3   you get to pick the best credit report as the baseline

 4   from which you would measure your hypothetical increase?

 5              MR. SHORR:       Because under GEICO's theory of

 6   the statute you may never get notice, even though you're

 7   being charged more for insurance based on inaccurate

 8   information, as long as you're not charge -- your charge

 9   doesn't move below average.           So a lot of people who are

10   in fact intended to be protected under this act will not

11   be protected until their charge goes below average, even

12   though the insurance company is continuing to charge

13   them more based on inaccurate information.

14              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Why do we -- how do we know

15   that they were intended to be protected in this way by

16   getting this notice?     That's the issue in the case.

17              MR. SHORR:       Because going through the

18   statute and the increase based on credit, and then the

19   notice will give them the opportunity to check.               Since

20   the consumer here is the -- it's a system of checks and

21   balances, and unless you give this consumer the

22   opportunity to check that they are in fact using the

23   correct information, it wasn't mistaken, it wasn't

24   driven down by identity theft, you can continue to

25   charge people more --

 1                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Okay.       So that's --

 2                MR. SHORR:      -- based on inaccurate

 3   information.

 4                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Your basic argument is the

 5   statute, the definitions of adverse action have got to

 6   be read in a way that maximizes the occasion upon which

 7   a consumer will get a notice that may lead that consumer

 8   to ask to see his credit report.               That's your basic

 9   premise?

10                MR. SHORR:      Both based on the premise and

11   purpose of statute, yes.

12                JUSTICE SOUTER:           All right.

13                MR. SHORR:      Briefly addressing the

14   application of the standard to the facts in this case,

15   we do think it's appropriate to remand for further

16   consideration in light of some new developments.                  GEICO

17   has just recently produced documents to us that

18   addressly -- directly address the question of scienter

19   here, so if there's -- if you go past a minimum

20   threshold --

21                JUSTICE STEVENS:           I've read your reference

22   to those documents.     Explain why you think that's so

23   important.

24                MR. SHORR:      Because those documents directly

25   address the subject of standard here, that GEICO was

 1   reckless or understood their --

 2                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           How do those documents

 3   shed any light on recklessness?               I didn't see that.

 4                 MR. SHORR:      I'm sorry, Your Honor?

 5                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           How do the documents that

 6   you describe shed any light on the extent of their

 7   recklessness, if any?

 8                 MR. SHORR:      I want to be careful, because I

 9   had presented -- I asked to lodge them with the Court

10   and I can quote them if necessary, but within those

11   documents there is direct evidence that GEICO

12   interpreted the statute exactly how we do, that not

13   putting someone in the best tier based on credit --

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Who's GEICO?   I

15   mean, you're talking about particular lawyers at a

16   particular level, an ongoing debate about what this law

17   means.   If you get one lawyer who says, you know, I

18   think you could read it this way, does that mean that

19   GEICO reads it that way?

20                 MR. SHORR:      No, Your Honor.            In this

21   instance, this document involves top level GEICO

22   executives.    And with respect to the advice of counsel

23   issue, frankly it's a red herring.                  We have never asked

24   to compel the Defendants in either of these cases or any

25   of the cases we're involved in, to waive their

 1   privilege.    They've got the right, of course, to offer

 2   advice of counsel as an affirmative -- as a defense in

 3   this case, but we don't believe it's necessary to prove

 4   our case to even reach what the counsel said.                We

 5   believe we can prove our case based on the documents and

 6   subjective intent alone.

 7                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           I still don't really

 8   understand this part of the case very much.                Assume that

 9   a lawyer writes a letter saying you read it two or three

10   different ways, read the statute, it's very ambiguous,

11   and we think the government's reading is the better

12   reading.   And the executives think about it and they say

13   no, we don't think that's right.                Has that proved

14   reckless disregard?

15                 MR. SHORR:      If the statute was clear and the

16   guidance --

17                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           If the statute's clear.

18   And of course, Miss Mahoney said the district judge

19   thought it was clear, but the other way.

20                 MR. SHORR:      And with respect to the district

21   court, we believe the district court here clearly erred,

22   as the Ninth Circuit found.             And the guidance -- that

23   opinion certainly didn't precede the conduct that's at

24   issue here.    The only guidance, again, available at the

25   time supported our reading of the statute.                There was no

 1   guidance from and court or from the FTC, or from

 2   anywhere that would have supported Defendants'

 3   interpretation at that time.             So that's another aspect

 4   of inquiry, the subjective intent of the Defendants.

 5                 If there are no other questions?

10                 MS. MAHONEY:        If I could start by just

11   responding to the issue of the new document, I just want

12   to emphasize that this document was created by people

13   who weren't lawyers.       It was done before GEICO even

14   started using credit to price insurance.                 They were --

15   said they were brainstorming about what the statute

16   might mean.    And I would point the Court to the

17   supplemental excerpt of records at 504 where when GEICO

18   implemented the policy that we're talking about here,

19   the -- they said that the intent was that we would send

20   to the people who were supposed to get the adverse

21   action notice.    With the early systems development we

22   didn't have the ability to identify whether they were

23   supposed to receive the notice or not; that was because

24   they had not yet developed the way to do with what they

25   call the neutral, where they compare how the applicant


                                        48

 1   would have done if they hadn't taken credit, hadn't

 2   taken credit into account at all.               And this is a

 3   procedure that's required actually in most States in

 4   order to ensure that those who don't want to allow

 5   access to credit reports or who don't have a sufficient

 6   credit history are not treated adversely in the meaning

 7   of those State laws, and that means worse than the

 8   average loss ratio.     So there's nothing in this record,

 9   even if you take into account the documents they're

10   talking about, to suggest that there was somehow a

11   knowing or deliberate intent to try to violate the law.

12              With respect to a few of the factual or --

13   issues that came up, Safeco estimates that approximately

14   80 percent of all consumers that they are selling new

15   insurance to now have to get notice under the standards

16   established by the Ninth Circuit.

17              With respect to who can qualify for the top

18   tier of credit, it's only, at least at GEICO,

19   approximately 10 percent.         So 90 percent of the

20   consumers would not qualify for that.

21              And the statute very plainly does not

22   prohibit differential treatment based on persons with

23   better credit, nor do State laws.               And so the analogy as

24   to race discrimination simply don't hold water, because

25   there Congress has told you what the baseline is, you


                                      49

 1   can't treat any person of a different race in a

 2   different way, and that's not true under this statute.

 3   And instead, it's quite reasonable, as GEICO has

 4   concluded, to simply say look, if we wouldn't -- if

 5   we're treating you worse than we would have treated you

 6   if we ever looked at your credit report, worse than if

 7   you had an average loss ratio for this criteria, we'll

 8   send you the notice.

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Why did they use credit

10   reports?     Is it just a hedge against late premiums and

11   the cost of late premiums, or does it bear on risk

12   factors generally?

13                 MS. MAHONEY:         Well, generally there are

14   about 15 factors that they look at to try to come up

15   with a prediction of loss ratio, and someone who has a

16   good credit history is generally regarded as

17   responsible, and responsible people tend to make less

18   claims.     And so, again, it's just one factor of 15

19   though.

20                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Yeah.           May I ask this

21   question?     The reading of the statute in subsection i

22   about, in the charges for insurance advice, seems to

23   favor your view.     But subsection ii about denial of

24   employment really seems to read in favor of the

25   government's reading.

 1               MS. MAHONEY:           Well actually, I think that

 2   when you factor in employment, it has -- it has the

 3   opposite effect.     Because what happens here is if you're

 4   using employment verification reports, consumer reports

 5   about employment, there are all kinds of consumer

 6   reports.   How do you tell who had the optimal employment

 7   history?   How could the baseline be the best employment

 8   history possible?

 9               JUSTICE STEVENS:              No.      But my point is, it

10   seems to me that getting a lesser salary, it just seems

11   like the first applicant would be an adverse employment

12   action under subparagraph ii, just -- do you see what

13   I'm trying to say?

14               MS. MAHONEY:           That if you -- that in other

15   words, if you gave someone a lower salary --

16               JUSTICE STEVENS:              It adversely affects any

17   current or prospective employee.                 Now the language in i

18   isn't, it doesn't read that way.                 But the thing that's

19   troubling me is whether you should interpret i in the

20   light of what ii seems to say.

21               MS. MAHONEY:           Your Honor, I think that if

22   GEICO in this example, if you actually pay them less

23   because you looked at their credit report, then GEICO

24   would concede that that is in fact an adverse action.

25   So I don't think it's inconsistent at all.
