 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9               MR. COLEMAN:         Good morning, Mr. Chief

10   Justice, and may it please the Court:

11               Racial classifications are inherently

12   pernicious and, if not checked, lead as they did in New

13   Haven to regrettable and socially destructive racial

14   politics.

15               Neither equal protection nor Title VII

16   justified New Haven's race-based scuttling of the

17   promotions Petitioners earned through the civil service

18   process mandated by Connecticut law.                    The lower court

19   required no strong evidentiary basis that the City was

20   acting to remedy or avoid any actual discrimination, but

21   strong safeguards are needed to smoke out illegitimate

22   uses of race and to extinguish the racial favoritism

23   that civil service laws -- excuse me -- are intended to

24   prevent.

25               Governmental employment actions grounded in

 1   race must be strictly scrutinized because they engender

 2   divisiveness and cause race-grounded harm that the

 3   Constitution seeks to avert.            That standard does not

 4   change with the race of those the government seeks to --

 5               JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I just ask this

 6   question?   Is it undisputed that it was a race-based

 7   decision?

 8               MR. COLEMAN:         No, Justice Stevens.              I think

 9   the city makes the argument that it was not a race-based

10   decision simply because the effect of the scuttling

11   resulted in no promotions being given at all.                     We

12   believe that that is not a basis for distinguishing

13   this.   That it still remains a race-based decision.

14               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Are you contending that

15   that's an issue of fact that has to be tried out or that

16   we should accept your version of that -- of that issue?

17               MR. COLEMAN:         I believe that that's an issue

18   of law, Your Honor.      It is no different ultimately than

19   what the Court concluded in Croson.                     This type of an

20   argument that a do-over is not a racial classification

21   is exactly what happened in Croson.                     There was a do-over

22   declared, a -- a rebidding; and yet the Court said,

23   because that rebidding was declared for racial reasons,

24   it would nevertheless be subjected to --

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That was pursuant to --

 1   to an affirmative action plan, and here we're dealing

 2   with this concept under Title VII of disparate impact.

 3   And let's take for one example a test that's given by a

 4   police department, a fire department, and it -- it's a

 5   physical fitness test, and it disproportionately

 6   excludes female applicants.             And when the results come

 7   in and there are no women on the eligibility list, the

 8   department reconsiders.        It thinks there is something

 9   wrong with this test.       It can probably test for the

10   necessary skills in a way that will not achieve those

11   results.

12              Would it be similarly impermissible,

13   similarly based on an impermissible criterion, if the

14   department said:   We're not going to -- we have got the

15   results of that test.       We're going to throw it out and

16   substitute another that will not have those skewed

17   results.

18              MR. COLEMAN:          If that decision was grounded

19   in a determination that we simply need to ensure that

20   there are more women on the force, then, yes, it would

21   be subjected to heightened scrutiny, maybe not strict

22   scrutiny under that --

23              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Not more women on the

24   force, but this test that we're giving has the effect of

25   excluding most women, just as the high school diploma


                                        6

 1   had the effect, a disproportionate effect, on one race.

 2                 MR. COLEMAN:        I think your question gets to

 3   part of the heart of this case, and that is, ultimately:

 4   Is the decision that's being made one that is -- is

 5   based in race or is -- is based on a determination that

 6   there is an improper test?            But this decision is

 7   grounded in race if -- if the police department in your

 8   case had clear evidence that the test was simply

 9   unnecessary, that it was not job-related and could be

10   clearly done by an identifiable alternative, I think at

11   the end of the day there might be some basis.                     But if it

12   is grounded in --

13                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So they would have to go

14   -- I take it from what you said they would have to go as

15   far as proving a Title VII disparate impact case against

16   themselves.    They couldn't do anything short of that to

17   prevail when it is the majority race that is complaining

18   about discrimination.

19                 MR. COLEMAN:        To use the constitutional

20   analogy, Your Honor, I think Wygant, Croson, Adarand,

21   other cases, make clear that you do not have to prove

22   the violation against yourself, but you do have to

23   demonstrate that you have a strong basis in evidence for

24   believing you are violating the law.                     In Wygant the

25   plurality set that out citing convincing evidence.

 1              JUSTICE SOUTER:              The problem, Mr. Coleman,

 2   is that -- that the cases you are relying on, it seems

 3   to me, are cases in which ultimately what is being

 4   judged is a different result in the -- at the end point

 5   of the process which was starting.                 And the problem that

 6   I have with -- with using cases like that and -- and

 7   essentially the problem I -- I have with your argument

 8   is that it leaves a -- a municipality or a governmental

 9   body like New Haven in a -- in a damned if you do,

10   damned if you don't situation.              Because on -- on the

11   very assumptions that you are making, if they go forward

12   with -- with their -- their hiring plan, they certify

13   the results and go forward with it, they are inevitably

14   facing a disparate impact lawsuit.

15              If they stop and say, wait a minute, we're

16   starting down the road toward a disparate impact lawsuit

17   and, indeed, there may be something wrong here, they are

18   inevitably facing a disparate treatment suit.                And

19   whatever Congress wanted to attain, it couldn't have

20   wanted to attain that kind of a situation.

21              Why isn't the most reasonable reading of

22   this set of facts a reading which is consistent with

23   giving the city an opportunity, assuming good faith, to

24   start again?   And I -- I recognize there's got to be a

25   good faith condition, and the -- the good faith can

 1   always be attacked.      But isn't that the only way to

 2   avoid the damned if you do, damned if you don't

 3   situation?

 4                MR. COLEMAN:         No, I completely disagree with

 5   that, Justice Souter.        It not simply a matter of good

 6   faith.   The use of race in government is so -- the Court

 7   has been so --

 8                JUSTICE SOUTER:             But you make no distinction

 9   between race as an animating discriminating object on

10   the one hand and race consciousness on the other.              There

11   is no way to deal with a situation like this any more

12   than there is a way to deal with -- with setting lines

13   in voting districts --

14                MR. COLEMAN:         I also --

15                JUSTICE SOUTER:             -- without pervasive race

16   consciousness.    That is not unconstitutional, and it

17   seems to me that you are not observing that distinction

18   in -- in your reply.

19                MR. COLEMAN:         I disagree with that as well,

20   Justice Souter.    There is a strong difference in what

21   happened in this case.        In partial answer to Justice

22   Ginsburg's question, et al., this is not an issue where

23   the -- where the city had before it and was making a

24   determination that our examination is not job related.

25   In fact, it is clear on the record that what the city


                                         9

 1   said is, this comes to the wrong racial result, and,

 2   therefore, there must be something wrong with the test.

 3   When pressed --

 4                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, let me ask you this

 5   -- this question, and I don't mean to interrupt your

 6   answer, but it is based on what Justice Souter and

 7   Justice Ginsburg have both been asking.                   Hypothetical

 8   case:     The city says, our test is not very good.                 We

 9   need a new test.

10                 The expert says, don't pay us to have a new

11   one.     There are two great ones out there.               One is in

12   City A.     The other is in City B.              Use either one of

13   those.     They are great.

14                 They check.        They find out that City A has a

15   disparate impact in the statistical sense, not in the

16   legal sense; that it disadvantages minorities, at least

17   if you look at the passage rates.                  The other test

18   doesn't.     Are they permitted to take the test that

19   doesn't have that differential?

20                 MR. COLEMAN:         Under our alternative

21   argument, Your Honor, assuming that -- that fixing

22   disparate impact can be a compelling interest, we

23   believe that you would at least have to demonstrate a

24   strong basis in evidence to show that there is liability

25   under (k)(2) -- your -- your example --

 1              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              My -- my question is --

 2   and you can answer, I guess, both under Title VII and --

 3   and under the Fourteenth Amendment.                      The city says, the

 4   only reason -- the only reason for our selecting the

 5   test from City B -- and both tests are very good tests

 6   -- is because minorities are better represented on the

 7   passing rate.   Is that permissible?

 8              MR. COLEMAN:           Under the Armstrong basis of

 9   evidence test, it might very well be because it meets

10   the second qualification of the disparate impact

11   statute, in which there is a specific alternative that

12   is equally valid.    If you are -- if you are going to

13   assume that it can be shown to be equally valid and that

14   it has less disparate impact --

15              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              And do you find -- and do

16   you find any constitutional deficiency in the city's

17   choice in that hypothetical case?                 Is there any

18   Fourteenth Amendment problem?

19              MR. COLEMAN:           Well, we are certainly quite

20   troubled that the Court would say, as it has not said,

21   that the idea of -- of overcoming purely unintentional

22   discrimination can be a compelling interest for cutting

23   off what we believe is intentional discrimination.                     But

24   barring that, our test, our backup test, is then that

25   the strong basis in evidence test that exists from

 1   Wygant and Croson would at least in its -- require that

 2   you have a strong basis in evidence for demonstrating

 3   liability under this --

 4                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, what -- what if

 5   you've got -- what if you've got the basis of Justice

 6   Kennedy's hypothetical?         You've -- you've got a

 7   municipality.    It's a racially mixed municipality.                 It's

 8   got two tests.    That's his hypothetical.               One of them

 9   seems to suggest that there is going to be a significant

10   racial disparity in the results if they use it.                The

11   other one from the other city or the other State

12   suggests not.    That's all they've got to go on.

13                 Is that a strong basis in evidence, or did

14   they walk their way into a lawsuit by you if they adopt

15   the -- the test that doesn't -- that at least in the

16   other place hasn't produced the disparity?

17                 MR. COLEMAN:        Under that argument, as long

18   as it can be demonstrated to be equally content valid,

19   equally or better content valid and to have a lesser

20   impact, then it would show -- it would establish a

21   stronger --

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           They would not have

23   discriminated against any particular --

 7   two systems should be adopted.

 8                MR. COLEMAN:        Well, I understood Justice

14                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It was designed to show,

15   and maybe it's theoretical, but I want to know the

16   answer so that I can understand this case.                  It's

17   designed to ask you the question whether or not race

18   consciousness is ever permissible.

19                MR. COLEMAN:        If -- if in your situation is

20   simply in your situation the initial giving of the test,

21   can you choose between those two tests, then we believe

22   based upon what the Court has said in the past that a

23   city could do that.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:           A city can in fact choose a

25   test simply because there will be more minority people

 1   who will in fact end up in the positions, that's your

 2   view?

 3               MR. COLEMAN:         Well --

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:            You needn't do anything

 5   else?   I mean, that is your answer to Justice Kennedy?

 6               MR. COLEMAN:         Nobody can know in fact --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:            I want to know is that your

 8   answer to Justice Kennedy or not?

 9               MR. COLEMAN:         Under that hypothetical, we

10   believe they can choose that test.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Are you assuming --

12               JUSTICE BREYER:            The answer is yes.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Are you --

14               JUSTICE BREYER:            If that's so, what's the

15   difference here?   The most that you're saying is the

16   worst that could have happened here; the worst that

17   could have happened is that some experts told them, this

18   test -- by the way, test one is -- is even worse than in

19   Justice Kennedy's hypothetical.               It's a test that

20   probably discriminates negatively against minorities.

21   So if you admit he could do it even if the test didn't

22   discriminate negatively against minorities, namely

23   test -- in his case, why can't you do it triply, in the

24   case where there's evidence that they did discriminate,

25   the test does discriminate against minorities?

 1              MR. COLEMAN:          Two very strong differences,

 2   Justice Breyer.   First of all, our -- our firefighters

 3   had already taken the test; they had earned their

 4   promotions under state law.            There was nothing left to

 5   do but to ministerially certify the lists, all right?

 6   The second difference is this.              The only --

 7              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Well, that can't be right

 8   if they -- if what you just answered to Justice Kennedy

 9   is -- is right.

10              Suppose they had very strong evidence that

11   the test that they had given that had these results,

12   just as my physical fitness test that excluded all

13   women -- that had it those results, it wasn't

14   job-related, and there was a better test available, they

15   wouldn't have any vested right in getting the promotions

16   under those circumstances, would they?

17              MR. COLEMAN:          We're not claiming that it's a

18   vested right.   What we're claiming is that sometimes the

19   Court has permitted governments to use race to remedy

20   discrimination, and what would be needed in that

21   hypothetical, Your Honor, is -- is the discrimination;

22   and under your hypothetical there might very well be a

23   strong case of discrimination, but under these facts

24   there is no evidence in this record, and the city

25   conceded below and never asserted in its bio in this

 1   case that it had any basis to contest the

 2   job-relatedness of this examination or these

 3   examinations that were given.              That is not part of the

 4   record in this case.       The --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           What -- one of the briefs

 6   said that, and maybe it wasn't done below, but one of

 7   the briefs said part of the claim is that some of the

 8   things that this test tested for were not -- were not

 9   qualities or abilities that were needed in New Haven,

10   although they might be needed in other fire departments.

11   The test had not been localized.                Wasn't that part of

12   the -- part of the objection?

13                 MR. COLEMAN:        No, Your Honor, not in the

14   district court.    If you look at 1024a of the Pet. App.,

15   the city's lawyer in front of the district court and in

16   its pleadings on summary judgment very clearly states

17   that they didn't believe the job relatedness is even

18   relevant to the case.        All that they needed was good

19   faith.   They didn't need job relatedness, they didn't

20   need an actual alternative, which is the basis of some

21   of the hypotheticals you're giving.                      All they need is

22   good faith.

23                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Then why did they have

24   the testimony before the Civil Service Board, about --

25   somebody from another testing company said this is a

 1   multiple choice test; it tests rote memory; we could

 2   have come up with a test that would better test the

 3   skills needed to be -- nothing about the localization,

 4   but something about command presence.                    There was a term

 5   used, assessment centers; that this test didn't

 6   effectively test the skills that you needed on the job,

 7   and others did.

 8              MR. COLEMAN:           Justice Ginsburg, that's not

 9   at all what Mr. Hornick said in front of the Civil

10   Service Board.    What he said is first, I didn't look at

11   the test; two, I looked at the results and I see

12   disparate impact; three, I'm not going to tell you what

13   exams we gave, but I'm mentioning this thing called an

14   assessment center, but I could design a better test, not

15   having even looked at this test.

16              But at the end of the day he also said, I

17   think you should go ahead and give these promotions and

18   in the future maybe you could fix your test.                   He didn't

19   say here's an alternative; here's why this would be

20   equally valid, here's why -- excuse me -- here's why

21   this would have lesser impact.               He simply said there is

22   a concept called an assessment center, and I think that

23   that might help you in the future, but you should go

24   ahead and give the promotions on this test.                   Same --

 1   ago you said you had two answers to Justice Breyer's

 2   question.   I would like to hear the second one.

 3               MR. COLEMAN:         Well, I actually think I got

 4   to the -- the first.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:            If you got to that, then I

 6   have -- I'd like one follow-up, and that's it.

 7               (Laughter.)

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Maybe if you don't

 9   mind, you could remind me what the second answer was.

10               MR. COLEMAN:         Again -- again, getting to the

11   -- the fundamental point is, the use of race is so, so

12   very important that the Court has always expressed

13   skepticism and hostility to it, and what we're saying

14   under this argument regarding a strong basis in

15   evidence, and I think this answers both your

16   hypothetical and Justice Souter's, is that what the city

17   is saying, we don't have to demonstrate a strong basis

18   in evidence for liability, we concede that we don't have

19   that; all we have is good faith.               And that's not enough.

20   That leads --

21               JUSTICE SOUTER:            But you are -- as I

22   understand it, you are imposing your strong basis in

23   evidence test on what you referred to a second ago as

24   the use of race, and that cannot be correct, because the

25   use of race includes race-conscious decisions which are


                                       18
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   not discriminatory decisions, and they certainly do not

 2   implicate the -- the obligation that you want to impose.

 3              You -- if -- if your argument is going to be

 4   coherent with what we start with, it can't be based

 5   merely on the use of race because if it does, then you

 6   are, in effect, turning any race-conscious decision into

 7   a discrimination decision, and that equation we

 8   certainly haven't made and we're never going to make.

 9              MR. COLEMAN:            That's not our intention,

10   Justice Souter.

11              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Then --

12              MR. COLEMAN:            Our argument is clearly that

13   this is not race-conscious, that it is race-based.                         The

14   only determination that the city made is we don't like

15   the results of this test; there must be something

16   different that we can do; and we don't need to

17   demonstrate --

18              JUSTICE SOUTER:               But even --

19              MR. COLEMAN:            -- viability or strong basis

20   in evidence.     We can simply fix it.

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:               I don't want to turn this

22   into just a rhetoric exercise, but I think the rhetoric

23   is important.     You say the city took the position, we

24   don't like the results of this test.                      That kind of a

25   statement is consistent with saying, look, we don't like

 1   the race of the people who are going to benefit from

 2   this.   It's also consistent with the city's taking the

 3   position that there is such a racial disparity here that

 4   we are either asking for trouble or walking blindly or

 5   perhaps foolishly into a -- a racial disparity lawsuit

 6   based on disparate impact.

 7                Those are two very, very different

 8   attitudes.   The first one is discriminatory.           I don't

 9   see how the second one is discriminatory.

10                MR. COLEMAN:        But it -- it clearly is,

11   Justice Souter.   I think the distinction we're making in

12   part is this principle of individual dignity that the

13   Court has recognized is so strong distinguishes the

14   hypothetical that Justice Kennedy gave me from -- form

15   the example that we have in this case where they had

16   already taken the test; identifiable individuals had

17   earned their promotions; and then the city says too many

18   non-minorities passed this test, and we are going to

19   scuttle these results based on identifiable individuals

20   who have passed and not based on any -- anything

21   approaching a demonstration that there is actually any

22   disparate impact liability.

23                JUSTICE SOUTER:           But the cost of drawing the

24   distinction between this case and Justice Kennedy's

25   hypothetical example is that if we draw that


                                       20
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   distinction, the only way the city can get itself out of

 2   not only a certain lawsuit, but quite probably a

 3   successful lawsuit, is to make, in practical terms, a

 4   preliminary case against itself.

 5              MR. COLEMAN:         I --

 6              JUSTICE SOUTER:            And it -- I cannot conceive

 7   that Congress intended to put a city into that situation

 8   saying you've either got to blunder ahead into a losing

 9   lawsuit in court, or you have got to stop and expose

10   yourself to another lawsuit which you can only win by

11   proving that you at least had taken some steps in

12   violating the law the first time.               That is

13   inconceivable.

14              MR. COLEMAN:         Justice Souter, I understand

15   the concern about the employer's point of view, which we

16   don't think stands here just because of the blatant way

17   the City went about this.         But in general terms we're

18   not asking, contrary to Wygant, contrary to Croson, that

19   you prove up a claim against yourself.

20              But what we are saying is that the standard

21   cannot be so light that the City very lightly and

22   without any demonstration whatsoever that there might

23   actually be liability here, based simply on the numbers,

24   can say well, we're going to avoid liability and we're

25   going to favor the minority group over the non-minority


                                      21

 1   group.

 2               All we're asking for is that the City

 3   undertake an honest and -- and open assessment of are we

 4   really likely to be liable here under the disparate

 5   impact provision of Title VII.

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:            What do you do if there is

 7   not a liability in question?            Suppose a school district

 8   deliberately, to obtain greater racial diversities in

 9   the schools draws district boundaries in a particular

10   way among neighborhoods or plans a construction program.

11   Then suppose having done that, indeed having once drawn

12   the boundaries, a group comes to the school district and

13   says you can achieve greater diversity if you redraw the

14   boundary.   You can achieve greater diversity if instead

15   of building this school where the -- where the

16   foundations are laid already, you build the school over

17   here instead.

18               Is that, in your view, different from your

19   case?

20               MR. COLEMAN:         I think --

21               JUSTICE BREYER:            It is?           How?

22               MR. COLEMAN:         I think it is.                I think you're

23   giving examples from Justice Kennedy's --

24               JUSTICE BREYER:            That's just what I'm doing

25   exactly.

 1               MR. COLEMAN:          It's -- it's really isn't

 2   different from Justice Thomas also had an example in

 3   Grutter.   These are --

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:             But I'm interested in the

 5   distinctions, not whether it's similar to Justice

 6   Thomas's or not.    I'm interested in the distinctions

 7   between this program -- I'll add one more if you want

 8   just this program, an employer --

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Can I hear his answer to

10   this one first?    I'm getting confused.

11               (Laughter.)

12               MR. COLEMAN:          I think the Court is certainly

13   not fully in agreement on these questions, but the Court

14   has at least an opinion suggested that those types of

15   examples really are more of -- as Justice Souter, you

16   were saying, the race-conscious type determination, and

17   they don't violate this principle of individual dignity.

18   You're not taking individuals one by one who have

19   already earned promotions, and you're taking away

20   benefits from them clearly on the --

21               JUSTICE BREYER:             And the difference between

22   that and drawing the school district boundary, which

23   takes from the individual children who live in that

24   neighborhood the right to go to this school, which they

25   think is a better one, and sends them to that school,

 1   which they think is a worse one, the difference between

 2   changing that boundary and changing the exam is what?

 3                 MR. COLEMAN:         The difference that the Court,

 4   I believe, has suggested is that that type of a

 5   redrawing is likely to include a number of traditional

 6   redistricting factors and that race in that instance,

 7   unless it was shown to ultimately predominate, would not

 8   make it a race -- or, excuse me, a race-based effort

 9   that would violate equal protection.                      I believe

10   that's --

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask you one

12   question --

13                 MR. COLEMAN:         Of course.

14                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            -- because I'm not sure I

15   understood your answer to Justice Kennedy?

16                 What is your answer to Justice Kennedy's

17   question about the two alternatives, one of which would

18   fit exactly into the concluding clause of the first

19   question presented to achieve racial proportionality in

20   candidates selected?        He says there are two alternatives

21   before the school board, one would achieve the

22   proportionality, the other would not.                     Are they free to

23   choose the former?

24                 MR. COLEMAN:         Again, assuming that no test

25   has previously been given, if there are two tests, they


                                         24

 1   are equally valid, one can be demonstrated to have

 2   lesser disparate impact, if there are no other

 3   circumstances, then we think they could likely under

 4   that test --

 5              JUSTICE STEVENS:            They could take that test,

 6   even though its sole purpose was to achieve racial

 7   proportionality in candidates selected?

 8              MR. COLEMAN:         I disagree that its sole

 9   purpose would be for that reason, Justice Stevens.                   As

10   long as it meets the other criteria for job relatedness,

11   it would still be fulfilling the City's necessary needs

12   for -- for identifying quality candidates for making

13   sure --

14              JUSTICE STEVENS:            This is the -- putting to

15   one side liability in the lawsuit, is the interest in

16   avoiding disparate impact a valid State interest?

17              MR. COLEMAN:         We certainly have taken the

18   position if disparate impact is identified purely as

19   unintentional discrimination, then we don't believe it's

20   a compelling State interest to overcome --

21              JUSTICE STEVENS:            I didn't say compelling.

22   I said is it a valid State interest.                   Just the interest

23   in avoiding the kind of results you got here.

24              MR. COLEMAN:         I'm not sure that we are

25   questioning whether there's a State interest in --

 1              JUSTICE STEVENS:               The City is not merely

 2   trying to avoid liability, they are trying to avoid a

 3   disparate impact.     Is that a valid interest?

 4              MR. COLEMAN:            If the disparate impact is

 5   caused by something that could be demonstrated to equate

 6   to discrimination on behalf of the entity, which is what

 7   the elements of --

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                But I thought the whole

 9   idea of disparate impact is it's unintentional, that's

10   the assumption, disparate treatment, intentional

11   discrimination, disparate impact, unintentional, but it

12   has askewed racial results.

13              MR. COLEMAN:            There are two aspects to that,

14   Justice Ginsburg.     The first is that you may have

15   disparate impact if it is caused by unintentional

16   discrimination.     But you may have disparate impact that

17   occurs through no discrimination, intended or otherwise.

18   And Watson clearly recognized that.                       And when Watson

19   said we need to have strong evidentiary standards in

20   evaluating disparate impact liability, it was

21   recognizing that employers can't act simply to fix

22   numerical disparities, because otherwise that leads to

23   soft quotas.

24              What we need is some demonstration that

25   there is at least discrimination on behalf of the

 1   entity, and perhaps that's unintentional, perhaps it's

 2   not.

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            How do we know whether

 4   something is discriminatory or just that it will have a

 5   certain effect?    Because it's in spite of.                For example,

 6   the Greek standard, the employer wants everybody to have

 7   a high school diploma, he wants an upgraded working

 8   staff, was told by this Court you can't do that because

 9   you would disproportionately exclude one race.

10                 MR. COLEMAN:        Congress has spoken on this

11   issue, has identified job relatedness and lack -- and

12   the refusal of an alternative in K itself.                  We believe

13   this is with the provisions we have cited, H, J and L,

14   all in which Congress expressed a strong intent to favor

15   tests.

 1   please the Court:

 2              This Court has long recognized that Title

 3   VII prohibits not only intentional discrimination but

 4   acts that are discriminatory in their operation.

 5              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   With respect to both

 6   blacks and whites, correct?

 7              MR. KNEEDLER:            Yes.

 8              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   So, can you assure

 9   me that the government's position would be the same if

10   this test -- black applicants -- firefighters scored

11   highest on this test in disproportionate numbers, and

12   the City said we don't like that result, we think there

13   should be more whites on the fire department, and so

14   we're going to throw the test out?                  The government of

15   United States would adopt the same position?

16              MR. KNEEDLER:            Yes, and let me -- your

17   question had two parts of it.              You said there are too

18   many blacks or too many whites.                That is not a

19   permissible objective under our view.                    The employer's

20   action has to be tied to a concern about a violation of

21   the disparate impact of --

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Yeah.

23              MR. KNEEDLER:            -- under -- under Title VII.

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   That's the part I

25   don't understand.    What you're saying is that the

 1   department can engage in intentional discrimination to

 2   avoid concern that they will be sued under disparate

 3   impact.     Why doesn't it work the other way around as

 4   well?     Why don't they say, well, we've got to tolerate

 5   the disparate impact because otherwise, if we took steps

 6   to avoid it, we would be sued for intentional

 7   discrimination?     This idea that there is this great

 8   dilemma -- I mean, it cuts both ways.

 9                 MR. KNEEDLER:          Well, to -- to say that an

10   employer violates the disparate treatment provision of

11   Title VII when it seeks to -- when it acts for the

12   purpose of complying with the disparate impact

13   provisions of Title VII would be to set those two

14   mutually reinforcing provisions of Title VII at war with

15   one another, contrary to --

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            They are at war with one

17   another.

18                 MR. KNEEDLER:          No, I don't think so.

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            How can one avoid --

20                 MR. KNEEDLER:          One of the purposes of -- of

21   the disparate impact test, as this Court has recognized,

22   is -- is as a prophylactic against intentional

23   discrimination, to root it out; also, as this Court said

24   in Watson, to identify possible instances of subjective

25   or -- excuse me, subconscious discrimination, and in

 1   some cases, to break down barriers that have existed in

 2   the past, for example, possibly the 60/40 weighting

 3   requirement that was under longstanding collective

 4   bargaining agreement.

 5                The disparate impact test has been

 6   recognized since Griggs as fundamental to fulfilling the

 7   purposes of Title VII.

 8                Title VII also has another important

 9   objective, as this Court has repeatedly recognized,

10   which is that the voluntary compliance is the preferred

11   objective -- excuse me -- preferred means of achieving

12   the objectives of Title VII.            Employers therefore

13   require considerable flexibility in assessing their

14   practices and deciding on appropriate action if it looks

15   like one of their actions -- their practices would

16   violate --

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:           If it looks like or if the

18   employer just in good faith believes?

19                MR. KNEEDLER:         We think -- we think --

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:           When I say they're at war

21   with one another, I mean they become at war with one

22   another when you say that all that is necessary to

23   permit intentional discrimination is the employer's good

24   faith belief that if he didn't intentionally

25   discriminate, he'd be caught in a situation of disparate

 1   impact.

 2              MR. KNEEDLER:          Well, this --

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:            At that point, they're at

 4   war with each other.

 5              MR. KNEEDLER:          Well, in -- in our view, the

 6   -- in -- in the situation here where the -- where the

 7   test has been given, and there is a list produced, we

 8   believe that the -- in order to avoid summary judgment

 9   and a disparate treatment case on a claim of intentional

10   discrimination, the employer would have to show that his

11   concerns were reasonable ones.             It has to be --

12              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How does that --

13              MR. KNEEDLER:          -- more than simply a

14   disparate --

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I know you said that in

16   your brief when you made a distinction between mere good

17   faith and reasonable belief.           So how does one determine

18   whether the concern that the employer is expressing is

19   really in good faith or is reasonable?                 What are the

20   indicia of reasonableness?

21              MR. KNEEDLER:          I -- for example, a -- a

22   gross statistical disparity.           A statistical disparity

23   makes out a prima facie case under Title VII.                 We're not

24   saying that in all cases simply a statistical disparity

25   would be sufficient.     A gross statistical disparity

 1   could lead the -- the employer to believe that something

 2   was wrong with the test.         So I think -- but in addition

 3   if the employer has concerns about the validity of the

 4   test -- as you pointed out, concerns were expressed to

 5   the Civil Service Board in this case.

 6               JUSTICE ALITO:           Mr. Kneedler, could you

 7   explain how summary judgment in favor of the defendants

 8   on the Title VII disparate treatment claim can possibly

 9   be affirmed, even if the employer had reason to believe

10   that the test that was given would expose itself to

11   liability under a disparate impact theory?              If that's

12   not the employer's real reason for refusing to go ahead

13   with the promotions, then isn't there liability under a

14   disparate treatment -- under a disparate treatment

15   theory, and that's a question for the jury?              So how can

16   we possibly affirm summary judgment here?

17               MR. KNEEDLER:          Well, we're -- we're not

18   suggesting that the Court should affirm summary

19   judgment.   We're -- we're suggesting remand.             The

20   District Court identified reasons other than complying

21   with Title VII's disparate impact standard for the

22   employer's action here, diversity and role model,

23   promotion of role models which we do not see as falling

24   within this framework.       But if the only evidence that

25   the plaintiff has that the employer took race into


                                       32

 1   account was that the employer was aware, as obviously

 2   the disparate impact provisions require him to be, of

 3   the racially disparate impact of the test, and the

 4   employer acts in response to that, if that is the only

 5   evidence the -- the plaintiffs had, then the employer

 6   would be entitled to summary judgment.                 We think that

 7   the evidence --

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:            I'm sorry.

 9              MR. KNEEDLER:          We think that evidence of

10   pretext or evidence that there is something else has to

11   be external or something other than --

12              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Can you be --

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:            And a reasonable response

14   to that, is your position?

15              MR. KNEEDLER:          Yes --

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Not just in response to

17   that.

18              MR. KNEELDER:          If it's --

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:            A reasonable --

20              MR. KNEEDLER:          If it's not reasonable, then

21   we think that that would be evidence of -- of pretext --

22   and --

23              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Can you be specific about

24   what facts you think should be tried on remand?                Because

25   you do distance yourself from the Respondents.                You are

 1   not urging affirmance of the summary judgment.                  You say

 2   there are or may be genuine issues of fact.                  So what are

 3   they?

 4              MR. KNEEDLER:           Well, I think they go

 5   primarily to the district court's identification of

 6   diversity and -- and role models as possible motivations

 7   for what the -- what the employer was doing.                  The

 8   plaintiffs have also alleged that the -- that there was

 9   influence on the Civil Service Board external to the --

10   to the board's own decision.            By the way, I should point

11   out in this regard, at pages 166 and 167 of the Joint

12   Appendix, the two board members who voted not to certify

13   expressed concerns about the validity of the test based

14   on what they had heard at the hearing.

15              We don't think realistically a board in this

16   situation should be required to do more, because it's

17   important to recognize that the -- what the employer did

18   here was not what concerned the Court in Wygant and

19   cases like this.   The Court -- the employer did not

20   adopt racial classifications with all the potential for

21   adverse consequences for individuals who are labeled by

22   race and promote on the basis of race.                  That's not what

23   the employer did here.       The employer paused and decided

24   that there might be another nondiscriminatory or less

25   discriminatory means.       In other words --

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, counsel, you know,

 2   I've given law school examinations, looked at them, and

 3   bar examinations for years.             There's never been one,

 4   when I don't look at it after the fact and say, you

 5   know, this could be better, this -- this was not quite

 6   right.

 7                 So shouldn't there be some standard that

 8   there has to be a significant, a strong showing after

 9   the test has been taken that it's deficient?                Before it

10   can be set aside?

11                 MR. KNEEDLER:         We -- we don't think so, and

12   for several reasons.       First of all, the action that the

13   employer has taken in response, as I just said, is not a

14   racial classification response.                It is a facially

15   neutral response where the -- where the employer has

16   decided the test will -- perhaps we'll look for another

17   standard which would be given and applied equally to all

18   applicants.

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           And you would say that --

20   and I'm asking the same question the Chief Justice asked

21   earlier -- you would say that if it had come out the

22   other way --

23                 MR. KNEEDLER:         Yes.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           And if there had been a

25   disproportionate number of minorities who -- who passed

 1   the test --

 2                 MR. KNEEDLER:         And --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           You would say that it's

 4   neutral to set that test aside?

 5                 MR. KNEEDLER:         And we -- and we --

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't think you'd say

 7   that.

 8                 MR. KNEEDLER:         Well, we -- there also has to

 9   be some concern that the test may not be job-related and

10   -- and that there may not be other alternatives.                And

11   we've been talking just about the prima facie case, but

12   those are important elements as to whether the test is

13   job-related.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It's whether it is -- it is

15   neutral to set aside a test simply because one race

16   predominates.

17                 MR. KNEEDLER:         No, but the -- but the --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           How you can call that

19   race-neutral I -- I do not know.

20                 MR. KNEEDLER:         It's facially neutral.       I

21   wanted to make the point that this is not the sort of

22   intentional discrimination favoring one individual

23   because of his race or disfavoring another.              What the

24   employer has done here is -- is responded to the impact

25   of the test in general terms, not on specific --

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:            What do you think of an

 2   employer who does the following?                 He advertises a job.

 3   Everyone comes in and applies.                He says May 1 is the

 4   deadline.     When he sees the applicants, he thinks, I'd

 5   prefer more diversity.         And solely because he lacks

 6   diversity among women, minorities, and whatever, he

 7   says, you know, I'm going to extend the deadline 2

 8   months, and I hope I'll get a few more minority or

 9   female applicants.

10                 Now, what's his reason?                     He wants more

11   diversity in the workforce.              Now, in your opinion, does

12   the Constitution permit that extension?

13                 MR. KNEEDLER:          I -- I think that's a more

14   difficult question, but there may -- there may be a

15   situation where the employer is concerned that his

16   recruitment or his job announcement has had a disparate

17   impact in terms of the -- of the applications that he

18   has gotten.    In -- in that situation, the employees who

19   have responded and may be advantaged, like the people

20   promoted here may actually be taking advantage of a test

21   that imposes barriers and disadvantages other people.

22                 So when -- when we consider the impact in a

23   situation like this on somebody who has passed the

24   promotion test, it's important to consider that the

25   people who have passed it may have benefited from a test

 1   that is discriminatory.

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Counsel, this may be

 3   the same question Justice Breyer asked, but I'd like

 4   something closer to a yes or no answer.                  Does the

 5   government consider promotion of diversity by itself a

 6   compelling state interest in the employment context as

 7   opposed to the school context?

 8              MR. KNEEDLER:            We think -- we think it

 9   probably is a compelling state interest, but it is not

10   one that -- that can be advanced by race -- by racial

11   classifications.    And that -- and that is our basic

12   submission here.    This was not a --

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Can it be --

14              MR. KNEEDLER:            This was not a --

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Can it be advanced

16   by taking actions to avoid what is perceived as a

17   disparate impact?

18              MR. KNEEDLER:            Yes.

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   In other words, the

20   disparate impact is regarded as something you can

21   intentionally respond to by drawing racial distinctions

22   solely because you would like a more diverse workforce?

23              MR. KNEEDLER:            No, not drawing racial

24   distinctions.   That's our -- this -- the employer's

25   response here did not draw racial distinctions.                    It did

 1   not say so many black firefighters would be promoted --

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  It didn't care --

 3              MR. KNEEDLER:           -- and so many white --

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  It didn't care -- it

 5   had to draw racial distinctions because it looked at the

 6   test and said, we think there's a problem because of the

 7   racial makeup of who's going to get the promotions.

 8              MR. KNEEDLER:           The employer was responding

 9   to the discriminatory test or what -- what it was

10   reasonably concerned was a discriminatory test --

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But it looked at the --

12              MR. KNEEDLER:           -- not the individual --

13              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Counsel, it looked at the

14   results, and it classified the successful and

15   unsuccessful applicants by race.

16              MR. KNEEDLER:           It -- it --

17              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And then -- and you want

18   us to say this isn't race?           I have -- I have trouble

19   with this argument.

20              MR. KNEEDLER:           No, with respect, it did not

21   classify according to race; it looked in general terms.

22   It did not have the names of individual people.                 It

23   looked in general terms at what the racial disparity of

24   the test was.   It just --

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  It didn't look at

 1   names; it just looked at the label of what their race

 2   was.   That's all they were concerned about.

 3                 MR. KNEEDLER:          Title VII's disparate impact

 4   test requires -- requires an employer to be aware of and

 5   respond --

 6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But that's inconsistent

 7   with your answer to the Chief Justice who was exploring

 8   whether or not what we have here is a -- is a racial

 9   criteria, pure and simple, and you say, well, it's

10   general.    And then we point out that each applicant

11   didn't have his name, but they had his or her race.

12                 MR. KNEEDLER:          But the employer -- the

13   employer was not making a decision to go forward and

14   appoint individuals or promote individuals because of

15   their race.     The employer stopped there and said we're

16   going to start over.        That new test would be given

17   equally to all employees, not any one particular

18   employee.

19                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Kneedler, can I ask

20   you this?     You -- you've recommended that we set aside

21   the summary judgment and send the case back for a

22   hearing.

23                 MR. KNEEDLER:          Yes.

 1                 MR. KNEEDLER:          As I've mentioned to Justice

 2   Ginsburg, I think it would go -- there are several

 3   things.     One, it would go to the justifications that

 4   were advanced by, that identified by the district court

 5   here that do not fit into this framework, do not fit

 6   into complying with the Title VII disparate impact test,

 7   and those are promotion of diversity and -- and role

 8   models.

 9                 That is -- that is one.                     Also the district

10   court did not apply what we believe is the right test,

11   whether the employer had a reasonable basis for

12   believing that what it was doing was necessary or a

13   reasonable basis to believe it might be violating the

14   disparate impact test.         If it did not have a reasonable

15   basis then we believe there would be a triable issue for

16   the jury.

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             When -- when I asked that

18   you question, you said that one issue of fact was

19   whether the board was acting in response to improper

20   influence, to racial politics.

21                 MR. KNEEDLER:          Yes.       That -- the district

22   court rejected that argument and whether or not that

23   should be revisited on remand is -- is another matter.

24   We're --

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Isn't that a controverted

 1   issue of fact?    How can you possibly get around that?

 2               MR. KNEEDLER:           Well --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I mean, one side says what

 4   you say is just pretext; the real reason was just

 5   politics.   Isn't that an issue of fact that has to be

 6   tried?

 7               MR. KNEEDLER:           Well, under this -- under

 8   this Court's decisions dealing -- dealing with summary

 9   judgment, even on questions of intent, the -- the

10   plaintiff ordinarily has to come up with some

11   affirmative evidence that there was -- that there was in

12   this case an impermissible racial motive to do that.

13   And the -- the district court looked at what the civil

14   service commissioners said and concluded that -- that

15   they did not have an impermissible racial motive, that

16   they were responding to concerns about the validity of

17   -- of the test.

18               JUSTICE ALITO:            But does the government

19   think that you can just -- in a case like this you can

20   just look at what -- what is said by the ultimate

21   decision-maker and ignore the input from other people

22   who may have influenced the process?

23               MR. KNEEDLER:           No, no, we do not.   There may

24   be other people who had input into the process, and

25   whether the -- the district court evaluated that and


                                        42
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   concluded that the -- that the input, that there was not

 2   a triable issue for summary judgment -- to avoid summary

 3   judgment on that question.            That would be open to the

 4   district court to reconsider on remand.                  We don't deny

 5   that -- that it could go beyond that, but our principal

 6   concern here is the analytical framework that an

 7   employer who seeks to comply with the disparate impact

 8   requirements of Title VII which have been longstanding

 9   should not be teamed to have engaged in the sort of

10   intentional discrimination that either the Equal

11   Protection Clause or Title VII prohibits.

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

13              Mr. Meade.

14            ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE

15                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

16              MR. MEADE:         Mr. Chief Justice, and maybe it

17   please the Court:

18              Employers, both private and public, are

19   required to comply with Title VII's disparate impact

20   provisions, which seek to root out barriers to equal

21   opportunity.   When an employer learns that a practice

22   has a severe adverse impact such that it creates an

23   inference of discrimination, and evidence further

24   supports that inference, the employer should be granted

25   some limited degree of flexibility to act.                  An employer


                                        43

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   certainly should not be encouraged or forced to make a

 2   promotion on the basis of the questionable practice.

 3               Title VII's disparate impact provisions are

 4   designed to remove structural barriers to

 5   discrimination, and when an employment practice has an

 6   adverse impact such that it substantiates an inference

 7   of discrimination, an employer should look beyond that

 8   adverse impact.

 9               JUSTICE ALITO:           If all the employer --

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Can I ask you --

11               JUSTICE ALITO:           If all the employer has is

12   evidence that the test results violate the four-fifths

13   rule, is that sufficient?

14               MR. MEADE:       In our view it is not

15   sufficient, and that is not what was at issue here.

16   First of all, there was a severe adverse impact, much

17   lower than the four-fifths rule, much lower than what

18   this Court found in Connecticut v Teal, and in addition,

19   not just on the pass/fail ratio --

20               JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, if I could modify the

21   question.   Is there some statistical point at which

22   that's sufficient, if it's not four-fifths, if it's

23   nine-tenths --

24               MR. MEADE:       Our view --

25               JUSTICE ALITO:           -- that alone would be


                                       44
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   sufficient?

 2                 MR. MEADE:      Our view is that it might be

 3   conceivable under Title VII in some cases for the

 4   statistical disparity to be so severe such that it would

 5   give an employer a reasonable basis under Title VII.

 6   However, that's not what we argue here.

 7                 We argue here that an employer should be

 8   able to act when it has a severe adverse impact which

 9   creates an inference of discrimination, coupled with

10   evidence that creates doubts about the flaws in the test

11   or the possibility of alternatives.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Can I ask you to

13   touch on the distinction between racial discrimination

14   and race-conscious action?            The actions that were taken

15   in many of our cases, in Croson and Adarand, Parents

16   Involved, Wygant, were obviously race-conscious actions;

17   there was a reason that the governments in those cases

18   were taking the action.         It was because of what they saw

19   as the impact on race.        Yet we concluded that was racial

20   discrimination.    So what's the -- how do you draw the

21   line between race-conscious that's permitted and racial

22   discrimination that's not?

23                 MR. MEADE:      Well, two answers, Mr. Chief

24   Justice.   First of all, this race consciousness is race

25   consciousness that's mandated by Federal law.                  This is


                                        45

 1   not a discretionary decision by an employer.

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, but if we --

 3   if we agree with your -- I mean, you're assuming, it

 4   seems to me in your argument, that the actions that

 5   they've taken here are not intentional racial

 6   discrimination; and of course if they're not, then you

 7   don't have much to worry about.                 But let's assume that

 8   they are, as we found they were in Croson and Wygant and

 9   Adarand and Parents Involved.

10               MR. MEADE:         Well, the difference in those

11   cases that you talk about, Croson, Adarand, Parents

12   Involved, they involve express racial quotas -- excuse

13   me, express racial classifications, where the government

14   is making a decision based on a particular individual on

15   the basis of race.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   And the only reason

17   you say that isn't by an individual is that you have

18   blacked out the names?

19               MR. MEADE:         No, because it's a facially

20   neutral action which applies to all test takers the

21   same.   That doesn't mean --

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   So your position is

23   what?   They threw out the test, so you would have no

24   problem at all if they looked at those results and they

25   were predominantly black rather than white; you would


                                         46

 1   say the city can throw out the test and there's no

 2   racial discrimination there at all?

 3              MR. MEADE:          No, I would say that there's no

 4   classification.   However, there's another way to trigger

 5   strict scrutiny and that comes under cases like

 6   Arlington Heights and Feeney, and the action that the --

 7   the facially neutral action that the city took here

 8   falls under that line of cases.                 And then --

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:               I don't see how you can

10   call it facially neutral.            It's neutral because you

11   throw it out for the losers as well as for the winners?

12   That's neutrality?

13              MR. MEADE:          There is no classification,

14   because each individual, and -- when a particular

15   individual is looked at and a decision is made on the

16   basis of race, that is a racial classification.                   If --

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So this case would

18   come out differently, if the list was there with then

19   names and they go down and instead of saying throw out

20   the test, they said Jones, you don't get the promotion

21   because you're white; Johnson, you don't get it because

22   you're white.   And they go down the list and throw out

23   everybody who took the test; then that would be all

24   right?

25              MR. MEADE:          Well, the point is, if all the


                                         47

 1   tests are being thrown out and different decisions are

 2   not being made on the basis of different individuals on

 3   the basis of race, then --

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   So they can keep --

 5   they get do-overs until it comes out right?                   Or throw

 6   out this test; they do another test; oh, it's just as

 7   bad, throw that one out; get another one that's a little

 8   better, but not so -- throw that one out?

 9               MR. MEADE:         Well, two responses.            The first

10   response is a legal one, the second one is a practical

11   one.   As to the legal answer, if a city were to do that

12   or an employer were to do that again and again, first of

13   all, that would go to intent, whether the intent of the

14   employer were actually to comply with Title VII or for

15   some other intent.

16               Second of all, it would speak to whether

17   there are actually equally valid less discriminatory

18   alternatives.   Second, the practical --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well if -- how many

20   times before it's a problem?

21               MR. MEADE:         Well --

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   You say if they did

23   it over and over again.          What if they did it twice here?

24               MR. MEADE:         Well, that would be a question

25   about whether they had a reasonable basis to do it.                   And

 1   I would say if they did it a second time, that could

 2   create an inference of discrimination.

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What -- what has New

 4   Haven done in fact?      This certification was requested in

 5   March of 2004; we're now 2009.               What has New Haven done

 6   in order to get lieutenants and captains in the fire

 7   department?

 8                 MR. MEADE:      Justice Ginsburg, this is

 9   information outside the record, of course.               The -- the

10   city has held tests for other positions, both written

11   and oral, in assessment centers that have not had a

12   severe disparate impact -- actually, that have not had

13   an adverse impact at all under the four-fifths rule.

14                 And specifically for the lieutenants and

15   captains, what the city has been forced to do is have

16   temporary acting promotions on a rotating basis based on

17   seniority.    But the city has not gone forward with any

18   promotions yet, and, in fact, the Petitioners in this

19   case may in the end receive some or all of the

20   promotions.    But the city has a duty to make sure that

21   its process is fair for all applicants, both black and

22   white.

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I have purposely gone, of

24   course, to the concurring opinion because I believe it's

25   the controlling opinion in Parents Involved, and there


                                        49

 1   are two examples in that opinion.               One is strategic site

 2   selection of new schools, i.e., a planned building, and

 3   the second is drawing attendance zones with a general

 4   recognition of the demographics.              Those are given as

 5   examples of instances where there is race consciousness,

 6   but it does not trigger strict scrutiny.

 7              Now, why is your case like that rather than

 8   being like those examples where an employer or a

 9   government official picks particular people or uses

10   quotas in order to get a certain quota or pay attention

11   to race in an individual selection, both based on race,

12   which clearly does require strict scrutiny?              And if

13   there is a difference, even then why is yours justified?

14              MR. MEADE:       Justice Breyer, there are two

15   ways to enter strict scrutiny.             One is a racial

16   classification which makes different decisions based on

17   different individuals on the basis of race.              Cases like

18   Croson or Wygant or even affirmative action plans are

19   examples of making different distinctions based on

20   different individuals on the basis of race.

21              There is another line of cases about --

22   where there's a discriminatory purpose plus adverse

23   impact on a certain group under the Arlington Heights

24   line of cases.

25              Here the Petitioners argue that there is an


                                      50
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   adverse impact on them.          Of course, that depends on the

 2   assumption that there was, in fact, a valid test.                         But

 3   here, then, under that line of cases the question is:

 4   What is the discriminatory purpose?                       And this Court's

 5   cases are not clear about what a discriminatory purpose

 6   is under the Arlington Heights line of cases.                       However,

 7   the answer to your question is:                 Compliance with a

 8   Federal statute, even a race conscious Federal statute,

 9   cannot be deemed a discriminatory purpose under the

10   Arlington -- Arlington Heights inquiry.                      It is very

11   different.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Is that -- I am

13   sorry.   Is that correct if we -- we conclude strict

14   scrutiny does apply under the Constitution?                      Compliance

15   with a statute, looking at impact, is a compelling

16   interest trumping strict scrutiny under the Equal

17   Protection Clause?

18                MR. MEADE:        No, Your Honor.               If strict

19   scrutiny applies, then the question is:                      Is there a

20   compelling interest?        And complying -- complying with a

21   Federal statute needs to be a compelling interest under

22   the Equal Protection Clause.              The reason is, otherwise,

23   State and local governments would be in an impossible

24   position of trying to determine whether they should --

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I guess it would go

 1   to how you construe the statute.                It seems to me an odd

 2   argument to say that you can violate the Constitution

 3   because you have to comply with the statute.

 4                 MR. MEADE:      Well -- well, I would disagree.

 5   That would only be true if there were some doubt as to

 6   the constitutionality of the disparate impact

 7   provisions.    But here that -- this Court first

 8   articulated "disparate impact."                Congress has reaffirmed

 9   that.

10                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well -- well, but you are

11   loading the -- the equation.             The Chief Justice's

12   question I don't think has been -- been fully answered.

13   You are -- you are saying that you can eliminate

14   constitutional concerns because the statute is enacted,

15   which just repeats those same constitutional concerns.

16   It's -- it's like having two tracks on the audio that

17   don't quite fit.

18                 MR. MEADE:      Well, I -- I may have

19   misunderstood the question, but compliance with Federal

20   statutes have to be a compelling interest as long as

21   that -- that statute is constitutional.                  Now --

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Of course you're not saying

23   that -- that the test is -- is compliance.                  You're --

24   you're saying the belief that it's necessary for

25   compliance is a compelling State interest.

 1                MR. MEADE:      Or --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I mean everybody would

 3   probably concede that if -- if continuing would clearly

 4   be in violation, of course, it's a compelling interest.

 5   But the issue here is:       Is it enough if the employer

 6   simply worries that if he doesn't make the change, he

 7   may be in violation?

 8                MR. MEADE:      Well --

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:           What -- what's the line

10   there?

11                MR. MEADE:      Well, the line is set out by

12   this Court's cases.      So assuming strict scrutiny applies

13   and assuming that compliance with Title VII is a

14   compelling interest, then the question is whether an

15   employer has a sufficient basis.               And this Court's

16   cases, both in the intentional and unintentional

17   context, say that that's a strong basis in evidence, and

18   so that would be the relevant test.                     This Court has

19   applied --

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:           You acknowledge strong

21   basis in evidence is -- is what -- what the city has to

22   have?

23                MR. MEADE:      Assuming that strict scrutiny

24   applies --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Right.

 1              MR. MEADE:          -- then, yes, then the city

 2   needs to have a strong basis.

 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Can I get back just

 4   -- just -- since I don't understand it yet, the

 5   distinction between intentional racial discrimination

 6   and race conscious action.             I thought both the plurality

 7   and the concurrence in Parents Involved accepted the

 8   fact that race conscious action such as school siting or

 9   drawing district lines is -- is okay, but discriminating

10   in particular assignments is not.

11              Now, why is this not intentional

12   discrimination?     I understood you to say it was because

13   you don't have particular individuals being treated on

14   the basis of their race.           You are going to have to

15   explain that to me again, because there are particular

16   individuals here.     They are the plaintiffs, and they say

17   they didn't get their jobs because of intentional racial

18   action by the -- the city.             Why is that not on the

19   racial -- intentionally racial discrimination side

20   rather than the permissible race consciousness side?

21              MR. MEADE:          Well, again, this is a question

22   about what triggers strict scrutiny, and compliance with

23   the Title -- compliance with the Federal statute should

24   not be deemed a -- a discriminatory purpose.                  However,

25   if strict scrutiny applies, then this Court's

 1   traditional strict scrutiny analysis is a way to test

 2   the decision.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, that -- you

 4   may be right that that's what the question is about.                    I

 5   still don't have in my mind from you a line about how we

 6   decide.   Because there are many cases, Croson, Adarand,

 7   Wygant, Parents Involved, where we said action taken

 8   obviously because of race is nonetheless discrimination.

 9   So -- and then there are cases where we have recognized

10   that race conscious action is permissible.                  Again, what

11   -- when I look at something like this, how I do decide

12   which side of the line that's on -- this is on?

13                 MR. MEADE:      Well, again, all of those other

14   cases involved discretionary actions by State actors,

15   and those are -- were making decisions, trying to

16   comply, trying to further various goals, and in those

17   cases making a very express use of race that a

18   particular individual -- when that person was looked at,

19   whether in Croson, whether in Wygant, whether in Parents

20   Involved, a particular decision was made as to that

21   individual.

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But just to take

23   Parents Involved, it wasn't a necessary -- the driving

24   factor was not a specific decision with respect to

25   specific individuals.        They didn't care whether it was


                                        55
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Jones or Smith that they were citing.                       All they cared

 2   about was the race.       And it seems the -- the same here.

 3   You maybe don't care whether it's Jones or Smith who is

 4   not getting the promotion.             All you care about is who is

 5   getting the promotion.         All you care about is his race.

 6              MR. MEADE:          Well, the -- the difference

 7   there is that in that case, Jones and Smith, different

 8   decisions were being made on the basis of race such that

 9   there was a labeling on the basis of race.                       And here

10   there is no such labeling because here there is a

11   question about whether this process is in fact picking

12   the most qualified individuals for the job.                       And that's

13   what Title VII is designed to do.

14              It is, yes, certainly a race conscious

15   decision, a race conscious statute.                       But what Title VII

16   is trying to do is to make sure that we don't perpetuate

17   discrimination, albeit unintentional, and, therefore, to

18   take away barriers that have existed over time and that

19   continue to exist.

20              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                When you say "take away

21   barriers," one thing is not a hundred percent clear.

22   Your position is we have to do this in order to avoid

23   Title VII disparate impact liability.                       Are you not

24   reciting as a justification either the diversity in

25   police -- policing firefighting or still overcoming a

 1   legacy of the past where fire departments were among the

 2   most notorious excluders on the basis of race?                  You are

 3   not -- you are not saying rectification of past

 4   discrimination?   You are not saying diversity?

 5              MR. MEADE:        We're not saying that.             We did

 6   not say that below.      And, in fact, the board members who

 7   voted against certification cited flaws with the test

 8   and flaws with the process, and that was the basis for

 9   their failure to certify.

10              And the problem with a discriminatory test

11   is that it does not set a level playing field.                  It may

12   create an illusion of meritocracy, but the problem is it

13   not only disfavors certain individuals, but on the flip

14   side, it also necessarily advantages others --

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  You just referred --

16              MR. MEADE:        -- and therefore --

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I'm sorry.   You just

18   referred to a discriminatory test.                 What you said in the

19   district court, and I quote, the issue is not whether

20   the tests were valid.

21              Are you just changing positions on that?

22              MR. MEADE:        No, not at all.            The ultimate

23   validity of the test, our position below, was not

24   relevant; the question is what was before the board.

25   And the board heard 5 days of testimony over 2 months.

 1   And as I mentioned, the two individuals who voted

 2   against certification cited concerns with the test and

 3   concerns with the process, and that was the basis for

 4   their decision.

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             What do you mean by --

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I'd like to talk just

 7   briefly --

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Justice Kennedy.

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I would like to talk just

10   briefly about this point that the -- some of our

11   hypotheticals where the test hadn't been given yet.

12   Here the test has been given.              And I had some concerns

13   along the line of Justice Ginsburg's question.                 She

14   said, well, it's not a vested interest.

15                On the other hand, 2000e-(l)(2) says that

16   test results can't be altered.               There's a statutory

17   interpretation question of whether that means they can't

18   be used altogether.      Two points about the statute.

19                Number one, doesn't that diminish at least

20   the force of the argument that this is a vested

21   interest?    It means the tests are -- have a -- have a

22   certain presumption in -- in their favor.

23                Secondly, on -- and maybe this is a question

24   for the -- for the Petitioners rather than you.                 If we

25   -- let's assume that we relied on that statute and said

 1   that there's a Title VII violation here because the

 2   statute was violated.        I know you have an

 3   interpretational argument there.                Would that give the

 4   Petitioners all the relief they need here, or is there

 5   still additional relief under their 1983 cause of

 6   action?

 7               MR. MEADE:        To answer your first question,

 8   the question of statutory interpretation, I would

 9   disagree with the suggestion that that gives support to

10   the Petitioners' side, and for the following reason:

11   Congress made a careful judgment about what can and

12   can't be done once tests have been administered, and it

13   told employers it -- it can't alter the scores when

14   those scores are being used.             And in -- what that --

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             It can't alter the

16   results.   But let's not get into the statutory

17   interpretation --

18               MR. MEADE:        But the -- but the point is that

19   that ties the hands of employers so that the employer,

20   in fact, is limited in what it can do.                   Just because a

21   test has been administered doesn't mean that Title VII's

22   disparate impact provisions suddenly disappear.                   And as

23   a number of lower courts have stated, there's no

24   entitlement to be promoted on the basis of a flawed or

25   discriminatory test.

 1              The problem is, the alternative is to force

 2   employers to go forward and to use a discriminatory or a

 3   potentially discriminatory test.              That has two problems.

 4              First, it's inconsistent with the goal of

 5   merit-based selection; and second of all, if it turns

 6   out that there is, in fact, discrimination, a court then

 7   needs to undo that discrimination.                A court will often

 8   need to use racial quotas or set-asides to try to undo

 9   or to remedy the discrimination that has happened.

10              So it's much better for an employer to stop,

11   to not go forward with discrimination, even after the

12   test has been used, rather than to rush forward and to

13   create potentially further discrimination and a more

14   aggressive use of race down the road.

15              Another problem with creating a high

16   standard is it will discourage employers from removing

17   barriers to equal opportunity.             For example, with

18   respect to an ongoing practice, if an employer learns

19   that that practice has a disparate impact, but is not

20   sure one way or another, and gets rid of that provision,

21   under Petitioners' theory that employer will necessarily

22   be liable to either blacks or whites.                  The only way that

23   it can defend against a lawsuit by whites would be to

24   argue that it was, in fact, violating the disparate

25   impact rights of black Americans.

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  What type of -- what

 2   type of other things are you talking about there?

 3              MR. MEADE:        I mean, it could -- could be,

 4   for example, if there were a five-part training program

 5   that the City or an employer set up, and individuals may

 6   have completed some portion of the training program such

 7   that there would be similar reliance interests like

 8   the --

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, the question,

10   I guess, would be whether the program was valid or not

11   under the traditional approaches you take under Title

12   VII.

13              MR. MEADE:        Exactly.         But then the question

14   is whether you're forced --

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So does your

16   position here depend on a conclusion that this test is

17   invalid?

18              MR. MEADE:        No, it doesn't.            The question is

19   whether the employer had a sufficient basis at the time

20   of its action to make a determination that the test

21   should not be used.

22              JUSTICE ALITO:           And why didn't it have a

23   sufficient basis here?       It -- it chose the company that

24   framed the test, and then as soon as it saw the results,

25   it decided it wasn't going to go forward with the


                                      61

 1   promotions.    The company offered to validate the test.

 2   The City refused to pay for that, even though that was

 3   part of its contract with the company.                   And all it has

 4   is this testimony by a competitor, Mr. Hornick, who

 5   said -- who hadn't seen the test, and he said, I could

 6   do a better test -- you should make the promotions based

 7   on this, but I could give you -- I could draw up a

 8   better test, and by the way, here's my business card if

 9   you want to hire me in the future.

10                 How's that a strong basis in the evidence?

11                 MR. MEADE:      Well, first of all, the City did

12   not act on the basis of numbers alone.                   It had 5 days of

13   hearings where it heard from stakeholders on all sides.

14   And it heard numerous flaws in the test at those

15   hearings.

16                 For example, there were arbitrary weightings

17   of the scores which had no scientific basis; the company

18   skipped critical design steps in the process; and

19   although this was not before the board, it later turned

20   out that there was no calibration in either the cut-off

21   score or how the test was ultimately going to be used.

22   Previous tests had a much less severe adverse impact.

23   This test was an outlier.

24                 JUSTICE ALITO:          What difference does the

25   cut-off score make?


                                        62

 1               MR. MEADE:       The difference of a cut-off

 2   score is a determination, a scientifically based

 3   determination to determine who is qualified and who is

 4   not qualified for --

 5               JUSTICE ALITO:           Well, I understand that, but

 6   the people at the top would -- the problem here was not

 7   the composition of the people who scored above the

 8   cut-off, was it?   It was the composition of the -- of

 9   the people who would be eligible for promotion under the

10   "rule of three"?

11               MR. MEADE:       Well, two responses, Justice

12   Alito.   First of all, as to the pass-fail rate, that

13   could create a separate disparate impact violation under

14   Federal law.   So that was relevant for separate

15   purposes.

16               But in addition, it's also true that the

17   test was not calibrated for use for rank ordering, to

18   ensure that a 93 was better than a 91.                  And this was a

19   special problem because of an intervening decision by a

20   court that was -- that was rendered after the tests were

21   designed, after the tests were taken, after the tests

22   were scored.

23               There was -- there's no evidence that the

24   tests were precise enough to be able to determine who --

25   who should rank higher versus lower based on those


                                       63

 1   scores.    And the amicus brief of the human resources --

 2   human resources professionals points out this point.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So your response to

 4   me that you don't have to show that the test is invalid,

 5   your argument is you just have to show that there's a

 6   basis for being worried that it might be invalid.                  And

 7   then it seems to me the only distinction is how high a

 8   showing you require.       And you reject the idea that you

 9   have to show a strong basis in the evidence?

10                MR. MEADE:       Yes and no --

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I thought you just said

12   that.   I just thought you just -- I was -- almost wrote

13   it down.

14                (Laughter.)

15                JUSTICE SOUTER:            I think your phrase was --

16   I think --

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I understand from --

18   I guess I should say I understand from your brief if not

19   from your argument that --

20                MR. MEADE:       No, no.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You agree with the

22   strong basis in fact standard?

23                MR. MEADE:       To answer in a way that's

24   consistent to -- to both of you, the answer is if the

25   test is under Title VII, strong basis should not be the


                                        64

 1   standard.     This Court has never indicated that it should

 2   be.   And that would be much too high of a standard to

 3   place on private employers.

 4                 However, if this Court concludes that strict

 5   scrutiny applies, which we think it should not, but if

 6   this Court concludes that strict scrutiny does apply,

 7   then, yes, we agree --

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So I guess, my -- so

 9   my -- your position is that you should never have a

10   strong basis in fact standard, because you don't think

11   strict scrutiny should apply, and you think if it's

12   under Title VII, it's only reasonableness?

13                 MR. MEADE:       That's correct.

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So your position is

15   that the city -- the -- the government can take action

16   without -- only if it's reasonable.                       It's a reasonable

17   view of whether or not they might or might not be

18   liable.   That's the standard.              And then they can engage

19   in race-based action?

20                 MR. MEADE:       We agree with the government's

21   articulation of the standard of reasonable basis.

22   Again, I would --

23                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            But does it have to be

24   reasonable basis to believe they would be liable if they

25   went ahead?    Or can reasonableness refer to something


                                         65

 1   other than the probability of or the -- the likelihood

 2   of liability?

 3               MR. MEADE:       I agree that it could be

 4   something less than that.          And if --

 5               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, what is

 7   something less than that, that they might be sued?

 8               MR. MEADE:       No, not that they might -- might

 9   be sued.   Again, this is, just in the Title VII context,

10   so this will affect all private employers, some of which

11   will be small employers where a single human resource

12   professional will be trying to make the determination.

13   There won't be hearings as there were in this case.                 And

14   the question is sometimes a severe prima facie case

15   could be sufficient under Title VII, not under the

16   strong basis standard, but potentially under Title VII.

17   And if a human resource professional or if an employer

18   had a belief that further investigation could yield

19   evidence of a Title VII violation, that would be

20   sufficient under the reasonable basis standard.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Isn't that -- isn't

22   that kind of a blank check to discriminate, if all they

23   need is a reasonable basis to think that further

24   investigation might be useful?

25               MR. MEADE:       No, it's not because this is a

 1   way to reconcile, under Title VII, the two provisions of

 2   this statute.    However, in this case --

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No, I'm sorry --

 4   that's an answer about why it would be okay.                       I'm just

 5   saying, isn't it in fact a blank check?

 6                 MR. MEADE:       Well, I would disagree.                No, it

 7   is not a blank check.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But --

 9                 MR. MEADE:       Here, however, we had much more.

10   There was a strong basis in evidence here.                       This Court,

11   under the strong basis standard, has suggested that a

12   strong basis is met when the threshold conditions for

13   liability are met.      That's what this Court said in Bush

14   v. Vera, a plurality in Bush v. Vera, as well as Abrams

15   v. Johnson.

16                 The question is how to apply that standard

17   to this case.    That standard would suggest that a prima

18   facie case, which, again, is not just adverse impact

19   alone, but it's adverse impact that creates an inference

20   of discrimination could be enough.                   Here we have not

21   just that, not just --

22                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Meade, let me -- let

23   me go back to one earlier question.                       Suppose everybody

24   agrees that you're right on the -- on the record here

25   now, and the City goes ahead and does another test, with

 1   all the advantages and studies they've made and so forth

 2   and so on, and it turns out you just had an unfortunate

 3   selection of candidates, and they come out exactly the

 4   same way.   Would you agree that at that time the City

 5   would have to certify the results?

 6               MR. MEADE:       Assuming that it was a test that

 7   was valid --

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:            It's a test they made

 9   after talking to everybody who testified in this case

10   and filed amicus briefs and everything else --

11               (Laughter.)

12               JUSTICE STEVENS:            And they came out, and it

13   turned out exactly the same results.

14               MR. MEADE:       Absolutely.                If the Petitioners

15   --

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I'm sorry --

17               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Absolutely what?

 3   certify the -- the results.

 4               JUSTICE STEVENS:              They would have to certify

 5   it.

 7   results.   Sorry I was unclear.               They would have to

 8   certify the -- the results.              The question here is

 9   whether there is in fact a fair process.                   It's --

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Well, just to get

11   back to your answer to Justice Stevens, you say they'd

12   have to certify it.       You say that, in that situation,

13   the decisionmaker could not have a reasonable basis for

14   thinking further investigation is required.                   Why?   Just

15   because the second test came out the same way?                   It's not

16   at all reasonable to think they ought to look at it

17   further?

18               MR. MEADE:         Well, not on the basis of -- of

19   the investigation that Justice Stevens, I understood,

20   hypothesized, as part of the example.

21               JUSTICE ALITO:             And that would be so, even

25   could make a test?      And here are some problems with this

 3   the different examples that Justice Stevens said, at

 4   that point then -- then it would be -- the City would

 5   need to go forward with the test.

10           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN

11                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12              MR. COLEMAN:         There's another statute that

13   the Court ought to consider in the Title VII context,

14   and that's section 2000e-7, which says that Title VII

15   will not overrule and pre-empt State law unless there is

16   a violation of Title VII.

17              In asserting that, under any reasonable

18   basis, as long as they have a reasonable basis, they can

19   dispense with all the provisions of Connecticut civil

20   service law, all these provisions that were put in place

21   to get rid of cronyism, to get rid of discrimination can

22   be set aside based on nothing more than a numerical

23   disparity or perhaps a concern about the test we think

24   cuts against Congress's intent in Title VII in

25   respecting these State and local laws that are intended

 1   to ensure that employment practices are fair and that

 2   they choose and select those who are best qualified to

 3   put into these very important first-responder

 4   organizations.

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:              Do you -- I'm still back on

 6   -- a university decides that tenure requirements lead to

 7   fewer women professors, so they say as an experiment

 8   what we would like to do is not have them for a couple

 9   of years; see what happens.             On your view is that

10   unconstitutional?    Because, after all, it will certainly

11   mean that certain majority race assistant professors

12   have now lost the promotion they otherwise would have.

13              MR. COLEMAN:           I think consistent with the

14   answer I gave you before, Justice Breyer, that based on

15   --

16              JUSTICE BREYER:              That it's unconstitutional?

21   unconstitutional?

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.       Oh, oh.

 2                 MR. COLEMAN:        You're just saying we want to

 3   change the tenure process.

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:           But what we are doing is

 5   not giving the promotions to the assistant professors

 6   who otherwise would have job security.

 7                 MR. COLEMAN:        The analogy to your analogy is

 8   that if we have a series of people who go through the

 9   tenure process that exists and it turns out, you know,

10   we -- we don't like the results, and --

11                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Oh, so.

12                 MR. COLEMAN:        -- therefore we want to change

13   it.

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:           It's the result -- it's

15   that you identify the person that makes your -- so in

16   Texas, for example, they take the top 10 percent of all

17   the high school graduates and put them in the

18   university.    Now, suppose they just decided, you know

19   what we want to do?      The top 5 percent.              We want to see

20   how that works.    And, of course, then there are people

21   who in fact would have gotten into the university -- and

22   perhaps we can imagine a majority of the majority race

23   -- and now they don't.        Can Texas do that?

24                 MR. COLEMAN:        Well, you've chosen a very

25   controversial subject.

 1              JUSTICE BREYER:            I know that, but I -- I --

 2              (Laughter.)

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:            That was not my objective.

 4              MR. COLEMAN:         If --

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:            I want to test out just

 6   what it is about this case.

 7              MR. COLEMAN:         If -- if that is not done on

 8   the -- on the basis of race, then, no.                 The institution

 9   of the 10 percent rule itself, most people believe --

10              JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, you said no.        Can

11   Texas do that or not?

12              MR. COLEMAN:         Likely, yes.           The answer is --

13              JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.

14              MR. COLEMAN:         -- it can do it.

15              JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay.       And the difference

16   here precisely is what?

17              MR. COLEMAN:         Is that, under State law,

18   these individuals had gone through an existing process

19   and had -- under State law, had been determined to be

20   the most qualified candidates and, barring anything

21   else, would have been promoted.              So the classification

22   that is made clearly does distinguish between those who

23   are qualified for promotion and those who are not

24   qualified for promotion and would not receive.

25              It violates that -- that singular principle

 1   of individual dignity to have these individuals be told,

 2   on the basis of race, you're not --

 3              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But if it were shown

 4   that, in fact, this test was not job-related and, in

 5   fact, the majority of fire departments scotched this

 6   test years ago and substituted what most agree is a

 7   better test, even so you would say it would violate the

 8   rights of the plaintiffs you represent, even --

 9              MR. COLEMAN:           If --

10              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Even if there's strong

11   evidence that it's not job-related and that there's a

12   better test that doesn't produce these skewed results?

13              MR. COLEMAN:           I don't think that's what

14   we've said, Justice Ginsburg.              Under our alternative

15   formulation in which the Court recognizes --

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But what -- what would

17   that do to the civil service merit system that says if

18   you pass the test you should be certified?

19              MR. COLEMAN:           The difference is this,

20   Justice Ginsburg:    The example you have given would

21   clearly satisfy or likely satisfy a strong basis in

22   evidence that you are actually in violation of the

23   disparate impact provision of Title VII.                 There are

24   three prongs.   The first is adverse impact; the second

25   is that your test is not related; and the third is the


                                        74
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   existence of this alternative that is equally valid and

 2   that results in lower disparate impact.

 3              The City has never asserted -- and I hear it

 4   today continue to say, we don't have to show those other

 5   two prongs, that a numerical disparity enough may allow

 6   the City to conclude that there must be something wrong

 7   with the test.   This kind of res ipsa loquitur theory of

 8   disparate impact is one that the courts have not

 9   recognized and that Watson said we cannot allow because

10   it results in racial balancing and soft quotas based on

11   disparate impact --

12              JUSTICE BREYER:             But in your -- in my

13   example, to go back, the thing you've identified, it

14   seems to me, is Texas couldn't do this.                 It couldn't

15   look at the class that they're going to choose with the

16   10 percent and say, you know, there are not enough

17   minorities, I think we'll go to 15 percent this year.

18              MR. COLEMAN:          That I agree with, Justice

19   Breyer.

20              JUSTICE BREYER:             It could not.       And

21   moreover, in the case of the tenure, what the school

22   couldn't do is it couldn't say, looking over at the

23   present tenured faculty and those who were just ready

24   for promotion and who in all probability will be, we're

25   going to go to the non-tenure system this year.                  We're

 1   going to go to the non-tenure system this year.

 2                MR. COLEMAN:         I also agree with that.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:            That they couldn't do that.

 4   And again you that say the ordinary employer across

 5   America who announces a deadline for getting in

 6   applications cannot, once it sees those applications,

 7   say, you know, there are not enough minorities.                  I want

 8   to extend the deadline.

 9                MR. COLEMAN:         That's also correct, Justice

10   Breyer.

11                JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.       And therefore

12   this is a very far-reaching decision.

13                MR. COLEMAN:         No, not necessarily, Your

14   Honor.    Okay, what --

15                JUSTICE SOUTER:            You are -- you are saying,

16   as I understand it, that if the -- if the city in a case

17   like this, prior to giving a test, looked at the test

18   and says, wait a minute, this is going to produce really

19   disparate results, they can stop, regroup, and think it

20   through again and maybe come up with a different test.

21                MR. COLEMAN:         If --

22                JUSTICE SOUTER:            But if they don't realize

23   that and they go ahead with the test, and they then see

24   the -- the disparate results, it's too late.                  And it

25   seems to me that the trouble with drawing that


                                        76
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   distinction is that the city is not in the testing

 2   business.   They are unlikely to know what the results

 3   are going to be.   So you're saying that the city that is

 4   -- that is prescient can adjust, the city that doesn't

 5   find out there's something wrong or at least undesirable

 6   from their standpoint until after the test results

 7   cannot readjust?

 8               MR. COLEMAN:         I don't think that's our

 9   position, Justice Souter.          The first case I think is the

10   hypothetical Justice Kennedy posed to me.               The second

11   case, as we've been talking about, is that you identify

12   the disparate impact after the test has been given.

13   Under this alternative theory that would allow a -- an

14   employer to respond, all we are asking under the strong

15   basis in evidence test is that you not react out of a

16   concern, or out of this mere reaction to the numbers,

17   but that you then look, is the test valid?               Do you have

18   convincing evidence, in the words of Wygant, to form a

19   strong basis in evidence that if you did go forward --

20               JUSTICE SOUTER:            But if they see it coming,

21   they don't have to show a strong basis in evidence for

22   changing the test prior to the time they give it?

23               MR. COLEMAN:         Consistent with what -- my

24   conversation with Justice Breyer, if they see it coming

25   and do it ahead of time, it doesn't violate that

 1   principle of individual dignity and that -- and doesn't

 2   discriminate against particularized and identifiable

 3   individuals.
