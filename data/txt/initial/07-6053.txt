 6                    ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARILYN G. BURKHARDT

 7                         ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                  MS. BURKHARDT:         Thank you, Mr. Chief

 9   Justice, and may it please the Court:

10               In Crawford this Court made clear that in

11   order to determine the scope of the Confrontation Clause

12   we look to the common law and particularly as it existed

13   at the time of the framing.              And, as we have shown in

14   our briefs, the -- California's forfeiture rule did not

15   exist in common law.        It did not exist at the time of

16   the framing.    And the common-law concept that is

17   embodied in the Confrontation Clause has grave,

18   practical importance to defendants, and particularly to

19   the defendant in this case, because the application of

20   this new forfeiture rule that California created

21   deprived the Petitioner of his right to present a fair

22   claim of self-defense.

23               Basically, the statement that was admitted

24   accused the Petitioner of having viciously attacked

25   Miss Avie and having threatened her at knifepoint and


                                          3

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   having threatened to kill her.              And the admission of

 2   this statement, which he never had a chance to

 3   cross-examine or attempt a cross-examination, obviously

 4   was highly prejudicial because it indicated to the jury

 5   that he was planning to kill her.

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But he got -- he got on

 7   the stand, and he said some very nasty things about her.

 8   I mean he painted her as aggressive, vengeful.              Isn't

 9   there a legitimate rebuttal when he is painting her as

10   the aggressor, and she has given a statement that

11   suggests that he is the one who was aggressive?

12                MS. BURKHARDT:         Well, Justice Ginsburg, the

13   -- her statement came in, in the prosecution's

14   case-in-chief.

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But could it have come in

16   as rebuttal of his testimony, the same testimony by the

17   police?   Was it the police officer that --

18                MS. BURKHARDT:         Yes.

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- took her statement?

20   Okay.   He gets on the stand, and he says all of these

21   unpleasant things about her.            And then the State says,

22   okay, now we have our chance, and we are going to put in

23   her statement through the testimony of the police

24   officer to rebut what he has just said.

25                MS. BURKHARDT:         Well, the difference is that


                                        4

 1   his statements about her went solely to his state of

 2   mind.   They did not come in for their truth, but her

 3   statements came in for their truth.                     So it really isn't

 4   an apples-and-oranges comparison.

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I would think that the

 6   difference is that his statements about her were subject

 7   to cross-examination.

 8                MS. BURKHARDT:         Indeed, of course.

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:           And her statements about

10   him were not.

11               MS. BURKHARDT:          Exactly.

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But we are not -- well,

13   but we are talking about the door -- the door opening

14   here at trial.   Did he give notice that he was going to

15   testify in California?       Do they have some rule that if

16   you're going to testify, you have to give notice?

17               MS. BURKHARDT:          He did indicate that he was

18   going to present a claim of self-defense, and I believe

19   he indicated that he was going to testify.

20               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            That tends to diminish

21   somewhat, but not entirely, your, I think, quite proper

22   response that this came in on direct not -- not cross.

23               MS. BURKHARDT:          Well, Justice Kennedy, the

24   fact that it was a self-defense claim is irrelevant.

25   This testimony would have come in -- her testimony or


                                        5
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   hearsay statements would have come in even if he hadn't

 2   presented a self-defense claim.                It just was a

 3   coincidence in this case.

 4                  And California claims that they have a right

 5   to introduce such testimonial statements in any case in

 6   which they can show that the defendant was the cause of

 7   the witness's absence.         I mean the case --

 8                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Maybe they would be wrong

 9   -- maybe they would be wrong in another case, but we

10   have this case, and Justice Scalia has suggested, I take

11   it, that this testimony could not come in even by way of

12   rebuttal.

13               MS. BURKHARDT:            Right.

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Even by way of

15   cross-examination.      Do you -- do you share that view?

16               MS. BURKHARDT:            I do.        It -- it doesn't

17   really go to any of the claims --

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               It may go to his

19   credibility.    He has just painted a picture of this

20   woman which is quite different from what her statement

21   to the police officer would portray.

22               MS. BURKHARDT:            Well, the injustice here,

23   Justice Ginsburg, is that he doesn't have a -- any

24   meaningful opportunity to contest what the police

25   officer says she said because he never had an


                                          6

 1   opportunity to cross-examine her.

 2                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, of course -- of

 3   course, that's true.      That is the reason for the

 4   confrontation -- confrontation rule.                    But it does seem

 5   to me that this is responsive to his defense; and you

 6   say, well, it's his state of mind, and her testimony was

 7   general.   I think it does go to his state of mind.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I'm not following you.            Is

 9   there -- is there an exception to the hearsay rule so

10   long as the hearsay is brought in, in rebuttal?                    Is

11   there a rebuttal exception to the hearsay rule?

12               MS. BURKHARDT:          Not to my knowledge.

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But we are talking here

14   about the definition or the contours of the equitable

15   rule, the forfeiture rule, for confrontation.                    And I

16   think perhaps what Justice Ginsburg was suggesting, and

17   certainly what I was suggesting, is that when we are

18   looking at whether or not there is a forfeiture, we are

19   talking about equitable considerations.

20               Now, it's true in this case we are presented

21   with an instance that I've never seen, which is that the

22   murder itself makes the declarant unavailable for

23   purposes of the equitable exception.                    And it is true

24   that that goes much further than the common law did.

25               MS. BURKHARDT:          It goes much further; and,


                                        7

 1   indeed, the State has not cited one single case at

 2   common law or after that supports its view that this

 3   rule is proper.

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:           How much are we supposed to

 5   follow the common law, in your opinion, as it was in the

 6   18th century or 12th century, or something?                    I mean

 7   suppose, to take a fanciful example -- I mean -- but

 8   suppose there was a common-law rule.                    And I know there

 9   wasn't, but suppose there was a common-law rule that

10   said in cases involving witches you cannot admit any

11   evidence because either the witch, the accused witch,

12   came up out of the water when they were dunking her,

13   and, therefore, she is guilty, so there is no need; or

14   she is under water, which shows she is, you know,

15   guilty, but you can't cross-examine a person under

16   water.

17                Now if there were a rule like that, would we

18   now incorporate it into the Constitution of the United

19   States?   The answer is meant to be no.

20                (Laughter.)

21                MS. BURKHARDT:         Yes.

22                JUSTICE BREYER:           Now, let's get more

23   realistic.   There are all kinds of rules --

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:           He is thinking about

25   Cambridge and not England.

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 (Laughter.)

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay.       So there are all

 3   kinds of rules of disqualification of witnesses in the

 4   17th and 18th century.        You couldn't testify.            In this

 5   case there would have been no admission if she had been

 6   married to the man instead of being his girlfriend.                    You

 7   couldn't have a spouse; you couldn't have an interested

 8   party; you couldn't have a child who didn't understand

 9   the oath; you couldn't have a person who was an atheist;

10   you couldn't have somebody who was a convicted felon.

11                 So now are we supposed to incorporate all of

12   these things into the Confrontation Clause?

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Do any of them have

14   anything to do with the Confrontation Clause?

15                 MS. BURKHARDT:         No.

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:           It doesn't have to do with

17   the Confrontation Clause that you couldn't cross-examine

18   person who didn't understand the meaning of the oath?

19                 MS. BURKHARDT:         Justice Breyer, the

20   Confrontation Clause sets forth a basic policy, which is

21   that we are to have live testimony in court.                 We have to

22   have witnesses available in court.

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So what about a person who

24   -- the same facts that he could not -- wasn't eligible

25   to testify?   At common law you never could have gotten


                                         9
                          Alderson Reporting Company

1    that person to testify in court, no matter what.                 And,

2    therefore, what?    That's what I'm asking, if we are

3    supposed to follow all of the contours of that rule.

4                MS. BURKHARDT:           Well, in Crawford this Court

5    said we do look to --

6                JUSTICE BREYER:             All right.       But, now, does

7    that make sense?    For example, if this woman had been

8    married, she could not.         She -- her testimony -- whether

9    your client deliberately procured her absence,

10   accidentally procured her absence, whatever he did, that

11   testimony could not have come in, is that right, if she

12   was married to him?

13               MS. BURKHARDT:           Well, that's sort of -- that

14   sounds like, say, the situation in Crawford that --

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, but I think what

16   Justice Breyer is saying --

17               JUSTICE BREYER:             I'm trying to drive at what

18   the contours are.    Which ones do we ignore, and which

19   don't --

20               MS. BURKHARDT:           -- sets forth the proper

21   contours, which is that any exception to the

22   Confrontation Clause must be very, very narrow.                 And

23   they approved an exception for witness tampering which

24   is deeply embedded in the common law.

25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But I think what Justice


                                        10
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


1    Breyer's line of questioning points out is that there

2    were other provisions of the evidence rule followed in

3    England which would not allow the testimony to come in,

4    in the first place.       In this case, we wouldn't even have

5    the issue before us if the testimony were not admissible

6    as an exception to the hearsay rule.                      It is admissible.

7                 Then we have to ask if it conforms with the

8    Confrontation Clause, which is the issue we have.                     But

9    because of the restrictions he points to, there was

10   never the occasion for the common law to explore the

11   boundaries of the forfeiture exception in the

12   confrontation context.

13                MS. BURKHARDT:           Well, Your Honor --

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:             And besides which, the

15   question that Justice Breyer was asking was already

16   answered in Crawford; wasn't it?

17                MS. BURKHARDT:           Yes, it was.

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:             A case from which he

19   dissented.   But we did say that the meaning of the

20   Confrontation Clause is the meaning it bore when the

21   people adopted it.

22                MS. BURKHARDT:           That is right.

23                JUSTICE BREYER:             I don't think I did --

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  There was a dying

25   declaration rule at the common law; wasn't there?

1                 MS. BURKHARDT:         Yes, there was.

2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, that didn't

3    require any inquiry into the intent of the person

4    responsible for the death, or the imminent death, right?

5                 MS. BURKHARDT:         That's correct.         But the

6    dying declaration -- the fact that the dying declaration

7    rule existed with its very specific elements shows

8    powerfully that no general rule existed such as the

9    California rule, because if the California rule had

10   existed --

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, if the dying

12   declaration rule didn't require intent, why should

13   yours?

14                MS. BURKHARDT:         Because the forfeiture rule

15   at -- which is a separate -- entirely a separate rule of

16   common law, did require intent to prevent testimony.                   It

17   has always been viewed that way from its inception in

18   Lord Morley's Case --

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Instead of intent, the

20   dying declaration rule required knowledge by the

21   declarant that the declarant was about to die.

22                MS. BURKHARDT:         Correct.

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Right?

24                MS. BURKHARDT:         That's right.

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:           And the evidence of

1    truthfulness was apparently that the person was about to

2    enter the next world.

3                 MS. BURKHARDT:          That's right.

4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            And most of us don't lie at

5    that particular moment.         Whereas, in the Confrontation

6    Clause situation you have a totally different situation.

7                 MS. BURKHARDT:          Correct.

8                 JUSTICE BREYER:            I joined Crawford, and

9    Justice Scalia would like to kick me off the boat, which

10   I'm rapidly leaving in any event, but the --

11                (Laughter.)

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:            You jumped off in Crawford,

13   I thought.

14                JUSTICE BREYER:            Right.           But my question --

15   I want to go back because what I'm finding difficult

16   is -- well, let's take the specific case.                     Suppose they

17   had been married.    If they had been married in 1789, I

18   guess, or 1750, or 1400, or whenever, her testimony

19   would not have come in regardless.                  I think I'm right on

20   that.

21                MS. BURKHARDT:          Yes, as a spouse.

22                JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes, as a spouse.          And,

23   therefore, whether he procured her absence or not is

24   beside the point.    Now, do we follow that rule under the

25   Confrontation Clause today?

1                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I think your answer was

2    that in Crawford that was the situation.                       It was a

3    spouse; wasn't it?

4                  MS. BURKHARDT:          I'm sorry?

5                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:             In Crawford.

6                  MS. BURKHARDT:          In Crawford it was a spouse.

7                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And it was the defendant

8    who said he didn't want her to testify.

9                  MS. BURKHARDT:          That's right.

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Under the -- the

11   testimony of someone who heard her say something, was

12   that admissible?

13                 MS. BURKHARDT:          Under -- under Crawford?

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No.      No.   Under the

15   common law.

16                 MS. BURKHARDT:          I don't think it was.

17   Hearsay was absolutely inadmissible.                       And there were

18   just very, very narrow exceptions under the common law.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Like in the case of

20   an unavailable witness?

21                 MS. BURKHARDT:          Of course.             Especially in

22   the case of an unavailable witness.                       In Lord Morley's

23   case they set forth rules.

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             There are some things

25   that are not just testimonial.                For example, suppose she


                                         14
                           Alderson Reporting Company

1    left a sealed letter.        She has been murdered, and the

2    letter is to be opened only upon her death, and the

3    letter says:    If I was done in, go after him.              Could

4    that come into evidence?

5                   MS. BURKHARDT:         Well, Justice Ginsburg, it

6    depends on whether it was deemed to be testimonial or

7    not.

8                   JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, is it?   I'm just

9    giving you --

10                MS. BURKHARDT:           It's not an issue in our

11   case.    I mean perhaps.       I mean obviously, as you point

12   out, if she had made a statement to a -- not a police

13   officer -- to a friend, family member, or whatever, a

14   nontestimonial statement, then that probably could come

15   in.    But what is at issue here --

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              So what's the line

17   between what -- I understand that she is accusing him to

18   a police officer.

19                MS. BURKHARDT:           Yes.

20                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              So you say that's

21   testimonial.

22                MS. BURKHARDT:           The courts --

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              If she is talking to a

24   friend and saying that she is scared to death of this

25   man --

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


1                   MS. BURKHARDT:         That is --

2                   JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- the friend could

3    testify?

4                   MS. BURKHARDT:         That's perhaps

5    nontestimonial.

6                   JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Why?

7                   MS. BURKHARDT:         Well --

8                   JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What's the difference?

9    If this rule is going to separate the testimonial from

10   the nontestimonial, you have to be able to tell when

11   it's one and when it's the other.

12               MS. BURKHARDT:            Well, the Court hasn't fully

13   described all of the parameters of "testimonial."                 But

14   our case does not involve that issue, because this

15   statement is clearly testimonial.

16               JUSTICE ALITO:            Could I ask you whether

17   there is really anything involved in this case?              Both

18   the California Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals

19   said it is inconceivable that any rational trier of fact

20   would have concluded that the shooting was excusable or

21   justifiable.

22               Doesn't that virtually guarantee that if

23   there was an error here, it was harmless error?

24               MS. BURKHARDT:            Well, no, not necessarily.

25   I think it's very significant that the court of


                                         16
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


1    appeals -- neither the California Supreme Court nor the

2    Court of Appeals engaged in a harmless-error analysis.

3    And that statement that you quote presupposed that the

4    testimonial hearsay statement at issue was a large

5    factor in coming to that conclusion.                   So, you know, no,

6    I don't think it's necessary.            That really went --

7                JUSTICE ALITO:         No.      No.        Is that correct?

8    Weren't they concluding that, based on the independent

9    evidence, it was virtually inconceivable --

10               MS. BURKHARDT:         No.

11               JUSTICE ALITO:         No?

12               MS. BURKHARDT:         No.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                How do we know in

14   this case that part of his intent was not to prevent her

15   from testifying at trial?         I mean, it's obvious that he

16   was upset about something else, but maybe in his mind he

17   is saying, oh, boy, if she has talked to people about

18   how I'm going to kill her, I'd better do it so that she

19   can't testify.

20               MS. BURKHARDT:         There was a specific finding

21   of fact by the court of appeals that he did not intend

22   to kill her -- he did not kill her to prevent testimony.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                How are we ever

24   going to know that in a typical case?

25               MS. BURKHARDT:         Well, by, you know,


                                      17

1    analyzing the evidence.          I mean, obviously, there are

2    many ways, and perhaps he made a statement.

3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, take a case

4    like this, I don't understand how that finding could

5    have been made.     He knew that she had reported -- that

6    she had said to her friends he is going to kill me; he

7    is going to kill me.        And then he figures he'd better do

8    it or it's going to -- his self-defense claim is going

9    to look a lot weaker.

10                MS. BURKHARDT:           Well, that -- I think, Mr.

11   Chief Justice, that doesn't make an awful lot of sense

12   because that indicates that he killed her in order to

13   prevent her from --

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  No, I'm sorry it

15   doesn't.   It means that that may have been part of his

16   motive, to kill her.        Because I'm not just going to beat

17   her up this time; I'm actually going to kill her because

18   otherwise I'm going up the river.                  Here he gets a great

19   benefit from murdering her which is that her testimony

20   is not available.     We usually under our system don't try

21   to give benefits to murderers.

22                MS. BURKHARDT:           Well, first of all, the

23   court of appeals specifically found that he did not kill

24   her to prevent testimony.            The California Supreme Court

25   basically adopted that finding --

1                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I understand that,

2    and you've said --

3                   MS. BURKHARDT:         -- and the State never

4    challenged it.

5                   CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Excuse me, Counsel.

6    You've said that already.            And what I'm saying is that I

7    don't understand under the legal standard we might

8    adopt, how that sort of finding makes sense.                     I mean,

9    you don't ask him why did you kill her; was it to

10   prevent her testimony or not?               That's not available in

11   the inquiry.    So how can that sort of factual finding be

12   made?

13               MS. BURKHARDT:            Well, the courts have

14   been -- Federal and State courts have been making that

15   factual finding for -- for decades under the Federal

16   rule, and under the Carlson line of cases.

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But the -- here it's his

18   own murder trial.     So he didn't murder her so that she

19   couldn't be a witness at the trial for her murder.

20               MS. BURKHARDT:            Correct.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But he might have

22   murdered her because she had good grounds to get him

23   indicted on criminal assault charges.                     Maybe he murdered

24   her so that she would not be available to testify at

25   such a trial.

1                  MS. BURKHARDT:          Well, that's highly

2    speculative.    There was no proceeding.                  There was no

3    indication in the record that -- that her assault claim

4    was ever going to ripen into any kind of criminal

5    proceeding at all.

6                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            I had thought that the

7    common law rule is that you have to have rendered the --

8    intentionally rendered the witness unavailable with

9    regard to the particular trial that's before the court.

10   Not rendering the witness unavailable for some other

11   litigation.

12                 MS. BURKHARDT:          That was --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Do you know of any case

14   where it was some other litigation that --

15                 MS. BURKHARDT:          No.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I didn't think so.

17                 MS. BURKHARDT:          No.      That is the common law.

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Let's -- let's assume that

19   the only case on the books pre-1789 was Morley, in which

20   the defendant did specifically intend to keep the

21   witness away from the trial.              But let's assume, contrary

22   to fact, that the Morley case gave a -- a very sweeping,

23   expansive definition of the equitable forfeiture rule

24   and said the defendant cannot profit by his own wrong.

25                 Could we take that general language pre-1789

1    and say that it supports the rule today, assuming we

2    could find that in the Morley case or other aspects of

3    the common law?    Or would we be just confined, as you

4    understand Crawford, to the specific holding of Morton

5    that there has to be a specific intent?

6                   MS. BURKHARDT:         Well, the hypothetical

7    assumes something which is -- which Your Honor admits is

8    -- is simply not the case.            I'm going to suppose

9    assuming --

10                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Please -- please make the

11   supposition.

12                 MS. BURKHARDT:          -- that it was there, I

13   suppose the Court could -- could rule on the basis of

14   that, but that it's definitely not the case and has

15   never been the case.

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            All right.      Well, suppose

17   we read the English authorities that it does not

18   foreclose the expansion of the equitable forfeiture

19   rule.

20                 MS. BURKHARDT:          Well, I -- I think the

21   English authorities do foreclose it, because the dying

22   declaration cases, and there are dozens of them, would

23   not have come out as they did if this expansive

24   forfeiture rule had existed.              It would make no sense.

25                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I -- I find that difficult

1    to understand because the dying declaration rule came up

2    in many instances when the confrontation rule was not

3    involved at all.

4                MS. BURKHARDT:          That's right.           But with

5    this -- but the point I'm making is this:                   that under

6    California's theory, if the defendant is -- causes the

7    absence of the witness, and all you need to show is

8    causation, then the witness's testimonial statement will

9    come in; but under the dying declaration rule mere

10   causation is not sufficient.            You have to also show

11   other factors in very -- particularly that the -- that

12   the witness was aware of impending death.

13               That requirement is totally superfluous

14   under the California theory; and yet it -- the fact that

15   no lawyer or no judge for hundreds of years ever

16   suggested that in those cases --

17               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Your dying declaration

18   cases are not just murders, though.

19               MS. BURKHARDT:          They are just murders.

20               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Pardon me?

21               MS. BURKHARDT:          They are just murders, Your

22   Honor.

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Really?         I thought they

24   came in, in civil cases all the time.

1    and they are murder cases in criminal cases.

2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, but I -- I agree --

3    I'll check the, -- check --

4                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           But the rationale for the

5    dying declaration rule has nothing to do with who caused

6    the death.

7                 MS. BURKHARDT:         Well, you know, it

8    specifically goes to -- the element of the dying

9    declaration is that the statement has to relate to the

10   specific cause of the death.            So it really does.

11                JUSTICE STEVENS:           But it has to be imminent,

12   too.

13                MS. BURKHARDT:         Well, the death doesn't have

14   to be imminent specifically.

15                JUSTICE STEVENS:           He has to think it's

16   imminent.

17                MS. BURKHARDT:         But the perception is -- the

18   declarant has to believe --

19                JUSTICE STEVENS:           But that's an entirely

20   different rationale from the issue we have here, because

21   it applies across the board to civil cases and all sorts

22   of litigation.

23                MS. BURKHARDT:         It applies powerfully in

24   many, many instances to criminal cases; and that fact --

25   and that has existed for -- for centuries -- shows that

1    there was no general rule that all, you know, needed to

2    do was to be accused of murdering the victim; because

3    otherwise if California rule had existed, there would be

4    no need to make this other showing in the dying

5    declaration cases.

6                  And in many cases, as we have cited in our

7    brief and as the NACDL has cited, evidence -- important

8    evidence was kept out.         Testimonial hearsay accusations

9    were kept out -- from the victim accusing the defendant

10   were kept out because they didn't meet the specific

11   requirements, specifically the sense of impending death.

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But the forfeiture rule is

13   designed to suspend the operation of the confrontation

14   rule.   That doesn't mean that it comes in.                     You still

15   need another hearsay exception which will allow it in.

16                MS. BURKHARDT:           Well, not under the common

17   law.    It was -- it was one rule under the common law.

18   It was only later that it operated as two separate rules

19   of confrontation and a hearsay rule.                      Under the common

20   law all you needed to show was the dying declaration,

21   then it was admissible for all purposes.                      There was no

22   distinction between confrontation and hearsay at that

23   time.

24                And so therefore, again -- it just -- if all

25   you needed to show was that the defendant caused or

1    likely caused the absence or killed the victim, then all

2    of those cases went the wrong way; all of that evidence,

3    the victim's accusations, would have come in --

4    automatically.   And they did not come in; in case after

5    case we have showed that.          We have cited some dozens of

6    cases that show that.      And the State has not cited even

7    one single case, not one, which shows at common law that

8    this evidence here would have come in.

9                 I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time

10   if there are no more questions.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

12   Ms. Burkhardt.

14               ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD E. DE NICOLA

15                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

16               MR. De NICOLA:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may

17   it please the Court:

18               I think I want to start off by correcting, I

19   think, the impression that the common law ever stated a

20   rule that intent to tamper was a prerequisite for

21   keeping out the evidence of a -- of a victim of a

22   murderer.   And I don't think this Court, in the Reynolds

23   case, has ever -- or in the subsequent cases, has ever

24   stated such a rule.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, it didn't put it in


                                       25

1    those very words, but I think a lot of -- of the

2    quotations from opinions cited by your friend seemed to

3    me to say that.

4                 But why don't you start off by telling -- by

5    explaining to us why these many cases excluded the dying

6    declaration of the murdered person when -- if it could

7    not be shown that the murdered person knew when the

8    declaration was made that he or she was dying?                    If the

9    rule that you're announcing was the rule at common law,

10   all of those would have come in because that declaration

11   said this Defendant killed me.               And, therefore, it would

12   have been true in all of those cases that this defendant

13   procured the absence of the witness from the trial.                    How

14   do you explain that.

15                And there are many cases.                   It's not just a

16   few.   The requirement in the dying declaration cases

17   that the -- that the declarant be aware of impending

18   death is uniform.    Why even bother with that requirement

19   if it could all come in under -- under this procurement

20   of the absence-of-the-witness rule?

21                MR. De NICOLA:          Well, I think, as Justice

22   Kennedy's question suggested, that there are different

23   elements to -- that need to be surpassed before the

24   dying declaration would come in.

25                What happens in the dying declaration

1    situation, Your Honor, is that there is no validation or

2    vindication of the defendant's cross-examination rights;

3    and that's what we are interested in here today:             How

4    the common law would have treated the cross-examination

5    right of a defendant who killed a witness.               The dying

6    declaration rule certainly cabins the admissibility of

7    dying declarations for reliability reasons, but it did

8    not detract from the fact that the evidence of the dying

9    declaration came in peculiarly when the defendant killed

10   the victim of the crime, the witness whose testimony was

11   coming in.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I'm not sure you've

13   answered my question.      Why wasn't it enough for the

14   prosecution to say:     This dying person said that this

15   defendant killed her; therefore, this declaration can

16   come in because this defendant procured the absence of

17   this declarant by killing her?

18                MR. De NICOLA:         It wouldn't --

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Nobody even ever makes

20   those arguments.   They fight it out on whether the

21   declarant was aware of impending death or not, but that

22   would have been totally irrelevant if it all comes in

23   under -- under the rule that you're arguing for here.

24                MR. De NICOLA:         No, because under the rule

25   I'm arguing for, and why the prosecutor wouldn't have


                                       27

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


1    succeeded in making that argument, the rule I'm arguing

2    for is simply that in the situation where the defendant

3    kills the witness the common law did not recognize, or

4    there is no strong case authority that would indicate

5    that the common law would recognize, a confrontation

6    right with respect to that defendant against his

7    witness's statement.

8                  Nevertheless, the common law puts some other

9    nonconfrontation restrictions on the admissibility of

10   the dying declaration.        Those were reliability-based

11   restrictions.   Reliability-based restrictions can't

12   determine the scope of the confrontation right.

13                 Under Crawford, the confrontation right is a

14   separate process that has to be adhered to and can't be

15   substituted with another reliability-assessment machine

16   unless there is a rule that would have let that

17   statement in that doesn't depend on a reliability

18   assessment.

19                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           I understand the

20   distinction you're drawing at the present time or at

21   least since the Bill of Rights was adopted.              We have two

22   regimes.   We have the constitutional condition and we

23   have hearsay rules.

24                 MR. De NICOLA:         Yes.

25                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           But with respect to the

1    common law as it stood at the time that the Bill of

2    Rights was adopted, there wasn't such a distinction; was

3    there?    In other words, to the extent that the

4    confrontation right is informed by the common- law

5    antecedent, the common-law antecedents were not drawing

6    the line that you are drawing; were they?

7                  MR. De NICOLA:          I think that's right, Your

8    Honor.

9                  JUSTICE SOUTER:            And if that is the case,

10   then it seems to me you haven't answered Justice

11   Scalia's question.      Because Justice Scalia's question

12   says:    Let's just talk about common-law antecedents for

13   a moment; and, given common-law antecedents, why were

14   people worried about the consciousness of death under

15   the dying declaration rule if there was this broader

16   rule which is supposed to inform our understanding of

17   the confrontation right, which would have let it in

18   simply because the crime had forfeited the right to

19   object.   And it seems to me that you still have not

20   answered his question.

21                MR. De NICOLA:           Well, let me -- let me take

22   a different tack.     Under the common-law rule, if the

23   defendant killed the witness and the witness's statement

24   met the dying declaration criteria, that statement would

25   come in against the defendant.                But if the defendant


                                         29

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1    killed the same victim and you had another witness who

2    witnessed the crime and made a dying declaration that

3    qualified under the rule, that dying declaration

4    describing the defendant's infliction of the mortal

5    blow, that dying declaration would not have come in.

6                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           If it was -- if it was

7    testimony.   There are a lot of declarations that are not

8    testimonial, and the rule is very important for those.

9                 MR. De NICOLA:         Yes.

10                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           There are also

11   declarations that are testimonial, in which case we look

12   to the confrontation concept.

13                MR. De NICOLA:         Yes, but I think -- but I

14   think, with respect to testimonial statements, it -- I

15   think it gives you an insight into what the common law

16   would have done with respect to the alleged

17   confrontation rights of the murderer against the victim

18   to know that when the defendant murdered the victim, the

19   victim's dying declaration came in without regard to

20   confrontation.

21                It might not have been excluded because it

22   might not have met other criteria, but it would have

23   come in without confrontation.              And it would have come

24   in without confrontation in a way that the -- the mere

25   witness who makes a dying declaration and witnesses the


                                       30
                         Alderson Reporting Company

1    same crime would not have come in.

2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I would suppose that

3    there are a lot, a lot of situations in which a dead

4    victim has made statements pertinent to the murder.                    So

5    wouldn't your rule drive a pretty big hole through

6    Crawford?

7                This is not an isolated instance where the

8    victim said something about the murderer.                    That would

9    seem to be a fairly common situation, because most

10   murders involve people who know each other.

11               MR. De NICOLA:         Well, I think it would -- it

12   -- I think it would, it would apply in murder cases with

13   respect to the statements of the victim.                   So I think the

14   -- I think the application of the forfeiture rule on a

15   murder basis as we are suggesting here, yes, I think it

16   would --

17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But to the extent that

18   Crawford is confined simply to testimonial statements,

19   any number of statements --

20               MR. De NICOLA:         Right.

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           -- that will come in under

22   the California evidence rule are simply not controlled

23   by the Confrontation Clause anyway.                    It's just -- it's a

24   standard hearsay problem.

25               MR. De NICOLA:         Yes.       Like the California


                                      31
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


1    Supreme Court recognized, and it was buttressed, I

2    think, by this Court's decision in Davis, simply because

3    the defendant might forfeit his confrontation rights

4    because he murders the victim, that doesn't necessarily

5    mean that he forfeits his other hearsay- rule

6    protections or his other constitutional-reliability

7    protections or his right to impeach the hearsay

8    declarations of the unavailable witness or his right to

9    contradict them or his right --

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Does that mean, what you

11   just said, that this is not a problem in States that

12   have adopted the Federal Rules of Evidence?                 Because, as

13   I understand it, there is an exception, the standard

14   exception, for when the defendant procures the witness's

15   absence for the very purpose of preventing the witness

16   from testifying at a particular trial.                 That's the

17   exception that's in the Federal Rules of Evidence.                  You

18   don't have an exception, a hearsay exception, for just

19   being responsible for the witness's unavailability.

20               So practically, this couldn't come in under

21   a hearsay objection in places that have the Federal

22   Rules of Evidence; is that right?

23               MR. De NICOLA:         Yes.       If the Federal rule

24   were interpreted to require the intent to tamper, in any

25   jurisdiction that decided as a matter of their own


                                      32
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1    hearsay policy that they wanted to govern the

2    admissibility of evidence along those lines, then, yes.

3                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Doesn't it have to be

4    interpreted that way?      You don't contend it could be

5    interpreted differently?

6                MR. De NICOLA:          Well, I don't know exactly

7    whether the Federal rule has uniformly been -- been

8    interpreted to require a specific intent.

9                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Just because it says so, I

10   mean.

11               MR. De NICOLA:          Well, there is -- I don't

12   think -- for example, I don't think there is a Federal

13   case that's been cited where the forfeiture has been

14   denied in a situation where the defendant murdered the

15   witness.

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Can you give us one case

17   from the common law, just one, in which the procurement

18   of a witness's absence exception to the Confrontation

19   Clause was applied where there was no intent to prevent

20   the witness from testifying?

21               MR. De NICOLA:          I don't -- I don't think I

22   have the case --

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't think you do

24   either.

25               MR. De NICOLA:          -- that -- that applied the


                                       33
                         Alderson Reporting Company

1    rule.   But I don't think there is a case that

2    articulated the rule in a way that would have limited

3    its application.

4                  JUSTICE BREYER:           The reason, I think, is --

5    I think, if I understand Justice Scalia's question, take

6    ordinary hearsay?

7                  MR. De NICOLA:         Yes.

8                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Okay.       There's a reason for

9    keeping it out, though there are many exceptions.                 Now

10   take that subset of ordinary hearsay where it was a

11   statement made purposefully to go to trial.                 Now there

12   is especially good reason for keeping it out, so like a

13   double reason.    And I think he finds it odd that we,

14   under the common law, putting us back then, would say

15   there's an exception where there's especially good

16   reason for keeping it out, see, in the testimonial case,

17   an exception where you go get the person murdered, but

18   you didn't do it purposefully.               But -- but there is no

19   exception in just where there's only the ordinary reason

20   for keeping it out.      It should seem to work the other

21   way around.

22                 Now, to me that suggests that maybe we

23   shouldn't follow completely the common law as it evolved

24   in evidentiary principles.           Maybe we have to assume an

25   intent to allow the contours of the Confrontation Clause

1    to evolve as the law of evidence itself evolves.

2    Otherwise, we get caught up in these logical

3    contradictions.    What do you think of that?

4                  MR. De NICOLA:         Well, I think that -- I

5    think that we can certainly take account, for example,

6    of situations that the common law might not have faced

7    or might not have recognized as representing a problem

8    of relevant evidence to a crime.

9                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           You wouldn't want us to get

10   caught up in the limitations of the Confrontation

11   Clause?

12                 MR. De NICOLA:         No, I'm not saying that,

13   Your Honor.   What I'm saying is that I think that,

14   although the Confrontation Clause under Crawford would

15   be accepted under the governing common-law rule at the

16   time, the governing common-law rule at the time included

17   this forfeiture doctrine, and the forfeiture doctrine I

18   think has been recognized -- has been based on the maxim

19   and the principle that no one may profit from

20   wrongdoing.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Do you see what my question

22   was?   My question is the same question I asked your

23   fellow counsel.   My question is, since I led you to the

24   point where you were willing to say maybe there is some

25   flexibility here, what?         That's where I'm having the

1    trouble.   What precisely are the principles I should

2    follow to prevent my going back to look at they dunked

3    witches, but allowing the heart of Crawford to be

4    maintained.    How do I do it?

5                  I don't know if you can answer that

6    question, but that's the problem that I'm having.

7                  MR. De NICOLA:         Well, again, I think -- I

8    think the resort to the -- to the maxim and the

9    equitable principles that we know that common law

10   subscribed to and that common law subscribed to those

11   principles in this precise -- as a rule to decide how to

12   resolve this particular kind of issue where the

13   defendant's wrongdoing makes the witness unavailable,

14   that the -- that because the common law accepted this

15   maxim, that we can -- we can look and apply those

16   principles to the situation even though there might not

17   have been the precise common-law case an all fours.

18                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Does the record show what

19   happened after the police went and received the

20   statements by Ms. Avie?         Did she ask -- did she ask to

21   have charges brought?       Did the police file a complaint?

22                 MR. De NICOLA:         The record doesn't show,

23   Your Honor.   The record doesn't show.

24                 JUSTICE ALITO:         As far as the record shows,

25   nothing happened?    They took this statement and that was

1    it?

2                MR. De NICOLA:           Yes, yes, in terms of --

3    because that was a description of the event that led to

4    the admissibility of the statement.

5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Does the record show or

6    did the trial indicate anything that he told the police

7    on the prior occasion?        They went into different rooms

8    and they each gave statements?

9                MR. De NICOLA:           No.      No.        No.   But -- but to

10   the extent that this is a case where the -- the crime

11   occurs after there had been this prior report to an

12   official, this case is somewhat closer to the witness

13   tampering scenario that my opponent says characterized

14   the admissibility of these cases at common law.                     So it's

15   not -- it wouldn't be a -- a departure from the theory

16   that they are proposing to recognize that in this

17   situation it's -- it's essentially similar.

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, I think it's an

19   astonishingly broad exception you're asking for.                     On the

20   other hand, testimonial statements are all that's

21   involved, and so that's a narrow class, and maybe that

22   balances out.    I'm not sure.

23               But may I just ask and you can comment on it

24   if you -- may I ask:       The defendant gave notice that he

25   would testify?

1                MR. De NICOLA:           Prior to trial, there was a

2    discussion about what sort of defense he was going to be

3    putting on, and he clearly indicated --

4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             California law requires

5    that?

6                MR. De NICOLA:           No.      No.        It just --

7                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Or it does not require it?

8                MR. De NICOLA:           It doesn't require that.         It

9    just -- it happened that, in discussing the

10   admissibility of all this other evidence he wanted to

11   bring in to put words in the mouth of the victim, the

12   court inquired about how that would be linked up to the

13   defense of self-defense.

14               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             All right.

15               MR. De NICOLA:           And that's why the

16   defendant's lawyer indicated that the client would be

17   testifying and putting on -- putting on a defense of

18   self-defense.

19               Now, I think if you look at the -- if you

20   look at the maxim, the logic or the rational of the

21   forfeiture rule, it doesn't admit of any exception for

22   motive to tamper.    The motive-to-tamper rule that my

23   opponent is proffering here I think is alien to the

24   rationale of the maxim.         The maxim is that no one shall

25   profit from wrongdoing.         The superimposition of an

1    intent requirement or a motive requirement wouldn't

2    change the fact that, with that intent or without the

3    intent, there would be the same profit from the

4    wrongdoing.    There would be the same damage to the

5    integrity of the criminal trial because the

6    truth-finding function of the criminal trial would be

7    damaged by allowing the wrongdoing to be used as the

8    basis for keeping out the statement of the -- of the

9    witness, of the victim of the crime, and allowing the

10   defendant to substitute in its stead his own one-sided

11   or half-true version of the --

12                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Suppose the unavailability

13   is caused by the defendant's negligence.                 Defendant

14   negligently runs over the victim.

15                 MR. De NICOLA:         I think if that were --

16                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I mean over the declarant.

17                 MR. De NICOLA:         Yes.       I think if that were a

18   crime, certainly, I think it would clearly satisfy --

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Suppose it's negligence.

20                 MR. De NICOLA:         If it's mere negligence?        If

21   it's mere negligence, certainly that's a -- that's a

22   tougher call, and it might be that in a situation of

23   noncriminal conduct the intent to tamper conceivably

24   could play a role in elevating that conduct to the kind

25   of wrongdoing that would trigger the rule.                 But I think


                                        39
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


1    as long as you have criminal conduct and certainly where

2    you have a murder, the rule would be triggered and the

3    -- the inquiry would then be whether or not there was

4    causation and whether or not there would be this profit.

5    And the intent to tamper doesn't really relate to the

6    purpose of the rule to prevent the profiting.

7                So you have the same profit, the same damage

8    to the criminal justice system, and the same prejudice

9    to the State, which is denied the live testimony of the

10   victim.

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Isn't there a problem

12   that was brought out in the briefs with -- this man is

13   standing trial before a jury that's going to determine

14   guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but if this testimony

15   is going to come in, the judge has to make some kind of

16   a preliminary finding that he killed her in advance of

17   the jury making that determination.

18               MR. De NICOLA:          Yes, Your Honor.     And that

19   happened -- that didn't happen in this case, so that

20   would be, I think, the template for what would happen in

21   future cases.   One I think preliminary point is that in

22   the California Supreme Court, Giles essentially conceded

23   that the forfeiture rule, when it was otherwise

24   applicable, does apply in the case where you have the

25   wrongdoing being the same crime that's charged.

1                  JUSTICE SCALIA:           If that's a fault, it's a

2    fault that also exists with the rule being argued by

3    your opponent, isn't it?

4                  MR. De NICOLA:         I think that's true, Your

5    Honor.    And it's also -- it's not -- it's not unlike the

6    way a Federal court would have a foundational hearing to

7    make a preliminary determination about the admissibility

8    of a co-conspirator's hearsay statement in a case where

9    the crime charged is conspiracy.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Maybe I have to take that

11   back.    Maybe it -- it's very -- it would be very unusual

12   that someone would kill a victim in order to prevent her

13   testifying at a murder trial which is not yet in

14   prospect because you haven't murdered her.               So these

15   cases may be very rare.         So maybe that is an advantage

16   of her rule over yours, that you would very rarely have

17   to find the defendant guilty of the very crime for which

18   he's being prosecuted in order to apply the -- the

19   exception to the Confrontation Clause.

20                MR. De NICOLA:          I think it -- I think it

21   would be rare.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay.

23                MR. De NICOLA:          But -- but it's not -- but

24   it's not unheard of, and there is -- there is a pedigree

25   for it, and --

1                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            It would be rare on her

2    theory; it wouldn't be rare on yours.                     It happens all

3    the time on yours, I would think.

4                  MR. De NICOLA:          But nevertheless I think the

5    -- the idea that you could have the hearing even though

6    it's the same issue that goes before the jury, I think

7    is not an obstacle to applying the rule in this case.

8                  JUSTICE BREYER:            I would think these cases

9    come in -- this problem comes in with spousal abuse.

10   Now, I don't know what the numbers are, but I bet you

11   could find numbers.       I suspect, but I don't know, that

12   in many cases where there's a death in that kind of

13   situation, maybe it is accidental.                   Maybe the -- maybe

14   the man who is beating up his wife didn't really want

15   her to die.

16                 MR. De NICOLA:          Yes.

17                 JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.        So that to me,

18   I guess, suggests that that's in favor of your rule, I

19   think.   Isn't it?

20                 MR. De NICOLA:          Yes, I think it -- I think,

21   again, regardless of what defendant's intent is, the

22   rule and the logic of the rule applies.

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:            And so that would be true,

24   whether it was intended or whether it isn't intended.

25                 MR. De NICOLA:          Yes.

1                JUSTICE BREYER:           Whether it's -- I mean, I'm

2    not sure how to even administer even a criminal/civil

3    distinction.

4                MR. De NICOLA:         But I think the same, you

5    know, as was said before, the argument that what came

6    in, in this case, was this damaging evidence that --

7    that undermined the defendant's self-defense claim.

8    Well, that evidence would come in even under the theory

9    that intent to tamper were required for -- for the

10   forfeiture, as well as under our theory.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I think you're --

12   it's certainly true that this issue would come up in

16   that it would be at all limited.              I assume you have, you

17   know, gang cases --

20   have you familiarity between the victim and the

22   typical case, but it's not simply in any way limited to

1    domestic abuse cases, Mr. Chief Justice.

2                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, I know your rule

3    wouldn't --

4                  MR. De NICOLA:         Yes.

5                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                --   but the

6    situation in which the case arises --

7                  MR. De NICOLA:         Okay. --

8                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- also would --

9                  MR. De NICOLA:         No.      No.

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- certainly not.

11   It comes up quite frequently, I would assume --

12                 MR. De NICOLA:         In gang cases, yes.

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                -- because you often

14   have an association with --

15                 MR. De NICOLA:         Yes.       And I think it can

16   come up in cases of -- of abuse of children, as another

17   example.

18                 So I think because there's no equitable

19   argument on the part of the defendant about why this

20   rule, this no-profit rule, would depend on an intent to

21   tamper, I think if you transport that back into the

22   common law, the same rule and the same principles of

23   applying, and you would -- you would have I think the

24   same results.

25                 Excuse me.      I think -- again, well, I don't

1    want to repeat myself, but I guess I just want to again

2    emphasize that the -- that the logic of the rule really

3    doesn't admit of an intent requirement.                   Nothing in this

4    Court's cases has ever dictated an intent requirement.

5    Nothing in the common-law cases has ever articulated an

6    intent requirement, and in the common-law cases the rule

7    that we are advancing is justified by the maxim that

8    applied at the common law, and it was also justified --

9    well, at least I think an insight into how common law

10   would have devalued the confrontation rights of the

11   killer against the witness can be seen in the dying

12   declarations case.      Because even though they might

13   ultimately have proved inadmissible on another ground,

14   where the special criteria for the dying declaration

15   cases was not met, those cases nevertheless are

16   instances where the evidence comes in against the

17   defendant where he kills the victim.

18               The slayer's cases that were recognized at

19   common law where no intent was required before somebody

20   would be barred from receiving an inequitable

21   distribution from an insurance policy, or from a

22   testator, those cases were also decided at common law

23   under this maxim.

24               And the ultimate -- I think the ultimate

25   element to the analysis that proves dispositive is

1    whether or not the defendant is benefitting from the

2    wrongdoing.    My opponent says that there's no benefit

3    from the wrongdoing unless there is an intent to commit

4    the wrongdoing in the first place, but that's palpably

5    not so because you -- because you have the benefit if

6    you have the benefit.        And to the extent that there

7    is -- an intent requirement might be perceived as

8    necessary to provide some level of moral blameworthiness

9    in terms of exploiting the wrongdoing, that exploitation

10   occurs in any event when the defendant seeks to take

11   advantage of the wrongdoing by making the objection and,

12   as in this case, exploiting it even further at trial.

13                 So the equities of the situation -- there's

14   no, I think, personal equity that weighs in the balance

15   on the basis of --      in -- on the side of keeping --

16   keeping the evidence out.            Where there is the wrongdoing

17   and the causation and the profit from the wrongdoing,

18   the statement should come out -- should be admitted

19   without regard to the mental state of the defendant.

20                 And on that I'll submit.

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, Counsel.

22                 Ms. Burkhardt, you have four minutes

23   remaining.

24                 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARILYN G. BURKHARDT

25                       ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


                                         46
                           Alderson Reporting Company

1                MS. BURKHARDT:         It State said that there is

2    no equity on the side -- on Petitioner's side, and

3    that's simply not true.       The statement is a testimony

4    statement; under Crawford, it clearly must be excluded;

5    and for the reason that it is -- you know, he has been

6    deprived of his right to test the accuracy of that

7    statement and to expose its falsity.

8                He claims the statement isn't true; and

9    under Crawford, the -- the Framers have prescribed a

10   categorical procedural rule for testing whether a

11   statement is reliable, and that's the right to

12   confrontation; and he was deprived of that right and

13   this in turn derived him of fair -- of a fair trial.

14               Now, the Framers in adopting the

15   Confrontation Clause understood its parameters to

16   include certain narrow exceptions.                And the exception --

17   one of the exceptions was a witness tampering exception;

18   and that had a very rational basis, because what it

19   meant, in essence, is if the defendant is going to act

20   against the criminal trial system from which he demands

21   and requires justice, he cannot at the same time

22   intentionally, deliberately manipulate and thwart the

23   criminal justice system by preventing the appearance of

24   -- of necessary witnesses.         So in that case, when he

25   does something of -- to that effect, then it's fair,


                                      47

1    it's equitable and reasonable; he cannot profit from his

2    own wrong.

3                 And that maxim that a person cannot profit

4    from his own wrong was meant to apply to that situation.

5    It wasn't meant to apply in the broad, generalized,

6    amorphous sense that the State suggests, because that

7    would effectively substitute in some sort of amorphous

8    notions for reliability of -- I'm sorry, fairness -- for

9    the amorphous notions of reliability standard that this

10   Court just rejected by overruling Roberts.

11                In fact, what's happened here is the State

12   is attempting to resuscitate Roberts and to eviscerate

13   Crawford; and it is no accident that this whole issue

14   arose after Crawford.      This is a post-Crawford

15   invention.   It did not even exist before.              And it's not

16   -- the ink on Crawford was barely dry before the Supreme

17   Court of Kansas, like six weeks later, enacted this --

18   this first forfeiture-by-causation rule; and then a

19   number of States such as California followed, and they

20   all cite each other as authority.

21                But nothing before, because nothing before

22   existed.   And when this Court in Crawford said we accept

23   the rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing, we submit that the

24   Court couldn't possibly have meant this broad standard

25   that California created, because it did not exist at


                                       48

1    that time.

2                 We suggest that what this Court meant, as it

3    indicated in Davis, is the -- essentially the Federal

4    rule entitled forfeiture by wrongdoing, which is

5    specifically directed to witness tampering.               And that

6    said -- and codifies, as this Court said in Davis, the

7    doctrine of forfeiture that has existed at the common

8    law; that was -- that has been understood for hundreds

9    of years, that was carried forward and preserved in

10   Reynolds, and then it was further carried forward to the

11   Federal rule.

12                That's all we want.             We want the rule as it

13   has always existed, not some new expanded rule that

14   the -- California has just created to undermine and

15   eviscerate my client's rights to confrontation.               We are

16   just asking for a fair trial, which he did not get.               And

17   the notion that he is profiting.               Well, in that sense,

18   everyone profits from the Confrontation Clause.               It was

19   designed to protect defendants from encroachment on the

20   State.   It was designed to provide defendants a fair

21   trial.

22                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            If you're right, it would

23   go back on the harmless error question, right?

24                MS. BURKHARDT:         Yes.       It could go back to a

25   harmless error question or perhaps a new trial.

1                They can retrial -- retry him.               They have

2    plenty of evidence on which to retry him in this case.

3    This is why -- that's all we are asking for, a fair

4    trial, not a trial under a brand-new standard which they

5    concocted for the purpose of eviscerating Crawford,

6    which is exactly what happened.

7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, Counsel.

8    The case is submitted.
