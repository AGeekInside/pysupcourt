 5   Northern and Santa Fe Railway Company et al. v. United

 6   States.

 8             ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN

 9                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10                          IN NO. 07-1607

11               MS. SULLIVAN:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

12   please the Court:

13               The court of appeals in this case untethered

14   CERCLA liability for response costs from the plain

15   statutory language of CERCLA section 107(a)(3), and in

16   so doing also imposed potentially crippling liability on

17   entities with only the most attenuated connection to any

18   harm.   107(a)(3), which is reprinted in the petition

19   appendix in 1607 on page 266a, provides that among the

20   potentially responsible parties under CERCLA are

21   so-called arrangers; that is, those persons who by

22   contract, agreement, or otherwise arranged for disposal

23   of hazardous substances.

24               The paradigmatic case, of course, would be a

25   generator of hazardous waste calls up "Waste Co." and


                                         4

                            Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   asks Waste Co. to take those substances to a landfill or

 2   to otherwise dispose of them.                 Where CERCLA does not

 3   define a statutory term -- and there's no definition of

 4   "arrange" -- this Court has long said, for example in

 5   United States against Bestfoods, that we look to the

 6   ordinary meaning of the language, and the plain meaning,

 7   the ordinary meaning, of "arrange for" is to make plans

 8   or preparations to do something.                   The ordinary meaning

 9   of the word "for" is to refer to a purpose or goal.                            And

10   the ordinary meaning of "to dispose" is to discard or to

11   throw away.    So --

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   What if your shipper

13   here knew that every time he delivered one of these

14   truckloads of the chemical, one-third of it would end up

15   on the ground and seeping through the ground, and no

16   doubt about it, he knew that, and yet they kept sending

17   it?   Wouldn't that be arranging for the disposal of at

18   least a third of the shipment?

19                 MS. SULLIVAN:            No, Your Honor.             That's not

20   our facts, of course, but even if there -- there had

21   been knowledge here, knowledge is not sufficient to give

22   rise to the specific intent required by the statute.

23   Just as in the criminal law, we wouldn't infer in a

24   specific intent case that one is presumed to know the

25   natural consequences of one's acts.                         What is required

 1   here is an actual plan to dispose.                 And --

 2                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, suppose that it's

 3   Shell's truck -- that isn't this case, but suppose it's

 4   Shell's truck, and every time they make a delivery the

 5   driver catches the waste in a can, four or five gallons,

 6   and dumps it in the creek.          Is Shell liable there under

 7   the statute?

 8                MS. SULLIVAN:         Justice Kennedy, Shell might

 9   well be liable there, but not under 107(a)(3), rather

10   under 107(a)(2).

11                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I mean, hasn't it arranged

12   for the disposal of the --

13                MS. SULLIVAN:         You wouldn't reach arranger

14   liability there, Your Honor, because as in the Amcast

15   case, when Judge Posner said the truck is a facility,

16   the truck would be a facility that Shell owns or

17   operates in that instance.          But in this case, of course,

18   Shell was hiring independent contractor truckers to ship

19   the waste.

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, I'm -- I'm not sure

21   that I agree with your answer.              Can you give me an

22   example under this statute where Shell might be an

23   arranger -- give me some hypothetical in which Shell

24   would be an arranger?

25                MS. SULLIVAN:         Well, Your Honor, we believe


                                        6

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   under arranger liability shell would never be an

 2   arranger here.   The only thing --

 3              JUSTICE SOUTER:              What if Shell went out of

 4   business and it had some stuff left in the tanks?             At

 5   that point, they might very well hire somebody to do

 6   exactly what you're saying.

 7              MS. SULLIVAN:           That's correct, Your Honor.

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:              That would be an eccentric

 9   situation, but it could happen.

10              MS. SULLIVAN:           Justice Souter, if Shell had

11   residual waste product that it was seeking to dispose,

12   then the natural reading of 107(a)(3) would apply

13   because that would be waste product.

14              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Why isn't that the case in

15   my hypothetical -- it's just a hypothetical -- where the

16   driver catches the five gallons that spills out of the

17   hose every week and dumps it in the creek?

18              MS. SULLIVAN:           Your Honor --

19              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             That's really the same as

20   the question you answered Justice Souter, and that's an

21   arranger under (3).

22              MS. SULLIVAN:           Your Honor, the key

23   difference in the two hypotheticals that you've posed is

24   that Shell is the owner and operator of the disposal of

25   waste there, and therefore it would be a 107(a)(2) case,

 1   not an arranger case.      The arranger liability is

 2   designed for --

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Ms. Sullivan, would it be

 4   altogether different if, instead of the FOB destination

 5   term, Shell continued as owner of the product until it

 6   had gone from the hose or whatever delivers it, so that

 7   there is no transfer of ownership until the delivery is

 8   complete?

 9               MS. SULLIVAN:          Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that

10   would be a different case.          That would be a case like

11   the so-called formulator cases, of which United States

12   against Aceto from the 8th Circuit is paradigmatic.             And

13   in that case the key is that the company arranging --

14   the company was held liable for arranging to dispose of

15   waste where it owned the product throughout a

16   manufacturing process, sent it out to a formulator, but

17   got it back as its own product, knowing that inherent in

18   the formulation process was the creation of waste

19   material.   So Shell would have been the owner of the

20   waste.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The problem I have with

22   that line you're pursuing is the FOB destination term is

23   an eminently fixable connection, and CERCLA is -- can be

24   a punishing statute, but the one thing that was not

25   intended was for the parties to arrange themselves out

 1   of arranger liability by providing neatly that the

 2   moment the product reaches a destination there's no

 3   continuing responsibility on the part of the seller.

 4                 MS. SULLIVAN:          Justice Ginsburg, that is

 5   correct with respect to arranging for the disposal of

 6   waste.     One couldn't evade one's responsibility for

 7   arranging for the disposal of waste products.                 If you're

 8   shipping sludge or discarded materials or spent battery

 9   casings or waste oil, if you're shipping waste then you

10   can't get out of your obligations by simply arranging

11   for someone else to collect the waste FOB destination.

12   But the difference here is that this is not a waste

13   case.     This is a --

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Isn't it waste when it

15   spills?    You deliver -- you're supposed to deliver 100

16   gallons, 5 gallons spills; isn't that waste?

17                 MS. SULLIVAN:          Justice Kennedy, it only

18   matters for 107(a)(3) if we arrange for it to spill.

19   And as Judge Posner said in Amcast, no one arranges for

20   an accident except in the --

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            They know that --

22   hypothetical.     They know that in the course of delivery

23   you're always going to spill about five gallons.                That's

24   waste.

25                 MS. SULLIVAN:          Well, Justice Kennedy, the


                                          9

 1   district court found in this case that Shell had

 2   knowledge of spills at the site of the bulk unloading.

 3   These were minute spills, only 80 gallons, 80 gallons a

 4   year out of 123,000, or .07 percent.

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            All I'm talking about is

 6   just a hypothetical definition of waste.

 7                MS. SULLIVAN:          Your Honor, even if the

 8   spills are waste, the key for arranger liability, the

 9   key for arranger liability is that you arrange for

10   spills.

11                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But we were talking about

12   waste, and I just wanted to get your agreement -- maybe

13   you won't agree -- that when the product is delivered

14   and 5 percent of it spills, that is waste, and we can

15   talk about the other parts of it later.

16                MS. SULLIVAN:          Your Honor, the statute

17   CERCLA, by cross-reference to the Solid Waste Disposal

18   Act, does include spills and leaks as possible waste,

19   and the natural application of that definition would be

20   to spills or leaks in a waste disposal.                  If a landfill

21   operator spills or leaks waste, then obviously that's

22   waste.    But even if you treat drips of a useful product

23   -- and there's no dispute here that the D-D shipped to

24   the agricultural facility was a useful product, shipped

25   for commercial use for application in the fields.                  Even

 1   if you view it as a spill of that product if a little

 2   bit falls out of the hose upon delivery at the bulk

 3   storage tank, it does not entail that Shell was an

 4   arranger for the disposal of hazardous waste.

 5               JUSTICE ALITO:            What if Shell had a choice

 6   between two companies to do the delivery.                  One would

 7   deliver it with no spillage whatsoever, but the other

 8   would deliver it with a certain amount, a small amount

 9   of spillage.     And Shell chose the latter because it was

10   cheaper.   Would it not be arranging under those

11   circumstances?

12               MS. SULLIVAN:            It might well be because

13   there would be an economic benefit to Shell from the

14   arrangement for shipment in the leaky truck.                  That would

15   be quite a different case from this one.                  There was no

16   economic benefit to Shell from the leaks here.                  In fact,

17   Shell did everything possible, so far as the record

18   shows, to prevent spills.

19               JUSTICE SOUTER:              But I thought your

20   definition of -- of disposal implied the disposition of

21   something whose use had, in effect, been exhausted, so

22   that I would have thought your answer to Justice Alito's

23   question would have been different because even in the

24   case in which they hired a sloppy delivery, they're not

25   getting rid or the deliverer is not necessarily getting


                                         11

 1   rid of a product whose use has been exhausted.

 2               MS. SULLIVAN:           That is correct, Your Honor.

 3   We believe the --

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:             I would have thought you

 5   would have similarly answered Justice Kennedy's question

 6   differently and would have said that just because

 7   something's wasted doesn't mean that it is waste.                     I

 8   mean, you may waste part of what is delivered, but what

 9   is spilled is -- it doesn't seem to me to be waste.

10               MS. SULLIVAN:           Justice Kennedy and Justice

11   Souter an easy way to hold this case and to reverse the

12   court of appeals would be simply to hold that when a

13   useful product is spilled it is not waste.                  And the

14   cross-reference to the Solid Waste Disposal Act would

15   support that interpretation because in 42 U.S.C. Section

16   6903(3) Congress defined "hazardous waste" as that

17   material which is discarded.             It analogize it to sludge.

18   This is not a case about sludge or waste material.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But your argument

20   assumes a sharp distinction between useful product and

21   waste.   Yet it's quite common to talk about there being

22   waste associated with a useful product.                  When you use up

23   so much of this, there's going to be a certain

24   percentage of waste.

25               MS. SULLIVAN:           Correct, Your Honor.         But the


                                        12

 1   -- so even if you don't draw the line simply at the

 2   useful product-waste distinction, we still do not

 3   qualify as an arranger under 1007(a)(3) because we did

 4   not arrange for the spill, we did not arrange for the

 5   waste.

 6                The government relies on facts in the record

 7   to suggest that we had some special knowledge or special

 8   responsibility, and of course the government's argument

 9   that mere knowledge of a third-party's spills would

10   create arranger liability would disrupt commerce across

11   a range of industries.        It would mean that the chlorine

12   company is liable when the pool supply store spills a

13   few drops of chlorine and the place becomes a facility.

14   It would mean that the maker of perchloroethylene is

15   liable when the dry cleaning establishment spills dry

16   cleaning fluid near the dry cleaning machine, even if

17   they had nothing to do with it.

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 That's making it too

19   easy for you.    It would mean all of those people would

20   be liable when in the course of delivering stuff they

21   know there's going to be a certain amount that's going

22   to spill, and even, perhaps the Justice Alito

23   hypothetical, they could have easily chose the truck

24   that causes more spill rather than the one that causes

25   less.    It's not simply here's the product, we're gone,

 1   see you later, and all of a sudden there's a spill.

 2              MS. SULLIVAN:           Your Honor, there's no

 3   suggestion in the record here that we're in Justice

 4   Alito's example.   The district court found that spills

 5   --

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  No, no, i know.   But

 7   I'm trying to reach the extent of your argument.                 So in

 8   that type of a case would there be arranger liability?

 9              MS. SULLIVAN:           There -- we believe there

10   would not be because spilling a useful product while

11   it's being delivered should not count as waste.                But

12   even if you treated that as waste within the meaning of

13   the statute or even if you treated that as a discard of

14   a hazardous substance, there still should not be

15   arranger liability based on mere knowledge.                There has

16   to be knowledge of a third party's spills.

17              The difference from Justice Alito's example

18   is that Shell there would be invested in the spillage as

19   part of its own economic transaction, as in formulator

20   cases, where you send a material out to a manufacturer

21   intending for it, expecting for it to spill in the

22   process, you know you're going to get 98 percent back.

23   That's not this case.      Shell sought here, as most

24   routine commercial sellers and shippers do, to get a

25   third-party truck to take all of the stuff to B&B and


                                       14

 1   have it used for its commercial application as pesticide

 2   in the field.   There was no built-in here, no effort to

 3   build in here any benefit for Shell in the leaky truck,

 4   Quite distinguishing Justice Alito's example.                     The

 5   government --

 6              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Well, one benefit would

 7   be avoiding CERCLA liability through a means other than

 8   what I call the fixable connection.                     Is this the first

 9   occasion on which Shell because of its sales of D-D has

10   been charged with CERCLA liability?                     Is this a case of

11   first impression, or have there been other instances in

12   which Shell did very much the same thing, delivered the

13   D-D FOB destination?

14              MS. SULLIVAN:           Your Honor, this is the first

15   and only case in the nation that has held that arranger

16   liability applies to a mere sale of a useful product

17   because a third-party purchaser after acquiring

18   possession and control spilled the product.                     So there's

19   no other case I am aware of in which it's been

20   adjudicated that there is any liability under these

21   facts.

22              But the key distinction here is that even if

23   you don't distinguish between the useful product and

24   waste and even if you go with Justice Kennedy's idea

25   that spilling a useful product could be waste, it still

 1   is not arranging for the disposal of that substance

 2   unless there's an intent to dispose.                       Here Shell wanted

 3   every drop of D-D to be safely placed in the bulk

 4   storage tank.

 5              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Ms. Sullivan, can I

 6   interrupt you?   Because I'm still puzzled by your answer

 7   to Justice Alito.     Are you conceding that if in this

 8   case Shell had an alternative carrier who would not have

 9   spilled a bit, that then there would be liability?

10              MS. SULLIVAN:             No, we are not, Justice

11   Stevens.

12              JUSTICE STEVENS:               I thought you did in your

13   answer to Justice Alito.           Why wouldn't that be?              Explain

14   your answer a little more fully?

15              MS. SULLIVAN:             Justice Stevens, we concede

16   that if there is a waste product that leaves Shell and

17   Shell deliberately arranges for a leaky carrier, there

18   would be no issue.      That would be 107(a)(3).                   Even if --

19   and we concede there might be a possible case in which

20   Shell deliberately chooses to send a useful product in a

21   way that it leaks.      It puts the product into leaky

22   containers when it leaves the shop.                       Then there might be

23   some case in which you might attribute knowledge, infer

24   intent from knowledge.

25              But this is not that case because here the

 1   transfer to the third party -- the transfer to the third

 2   party occurs at tender of delivery under ordinary UCC

 3   principles.    The -- the transfer to the third-party

 4   purchaser occurs, and that's when the spillage occurs.

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I thought there was as

 6   part of this picture that Shell had a manual which told

 7   its purchasers how to handle this material, and that

 8   Shell was well aware that B&B was not following the

 9   precautions laid out in the manual.

10                 MS. SULLIVAN:         Justice Ginsburg, two points:

11   The manual comes out only in 1978, and a Shell

12   representative visits the site only in 1979.             That

13   leaves 19 years of liability unaccounted for on that

14   period.

15                 But, more important, it would be terribly

16   impractical and terribly perverse in relation to the

17   purposes of the environmental laws that Congress passed

18   to penalize a manufacturer for telling a third-party

19   purchaser how to handle a product more safely.             So to

20   use the manual issued in 1978 or the inspection in 1979

21   as evidence that Shell knew there were spills and,

22   therefore, was an arranger would be perverse in relation

23   to the environmental statutes.

24                 If there are no further questions, I would

25   like to reserve the balance of my time.

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, counsel.

 3             ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

 4                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 5                            IN NO. 07-1601

 6              MS. MAHONEY:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 7   please the Court:

 8              I would like to start with section 912 of

 9   the Restatement because I think it really helps to

10   demonstrate that the trial court fully understood and

11   properly applied the common law standards that govern

12   the determination of apportionment in a pollution case.

13   That section provides that when a party bears the burden

14   of proof, they have to establish the extent of harm and

15   the amount of money with, quote, "as much certainty as

16   the nature of the tort and circumstances permit," end

17   quote.

18              At the time that CERCLA was adopted in 1980,

19   common law courts for more than a century had been using

20   that standard to apportion damages and harm in pollution

21   cases based on essentially rough estimates because the

22   nature of the tort, pollution, and the circumstances

23   don't allow for the kind of precision that we might

24   require in some other settings such as proof of -- of

25   fault, for instance.


                                        18
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              And the United States, they say that the

 2   district court departed from those common-law standards,

 3   but it's telling:    They don't cite a single common-law

 4   case decided before CERCLA in their entire brief.                     If

 5   you were to look at section 840(e) of the Restatement,

 6   which governs nuisance cases and apportionment -- it's

 7   an application of the section 433(a) standards -- they

 8   cite -- the Restatement cites approximately 50 cases.                      I

 9   don't think there's a single one where a court denied

10   apportionment for a nuisance for a harm such as this one

11   that is theoretically capable of apportionment.

12              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               This court -- - this

13   court, Ms. Mahoney, didn't deny apportionment.

14   Apportionment was never requested.                  The court said:

15   "I'm going to have to figure this out on my own."                     In

16   fact, the court deplored the parties for following what

17   he called a "scorched-earth tactic."

18              So the apportionment is not something that

19   has been denied to the PRPs in this case.                  It's

20   something that the court thought was proper and fair,

21   but it didn't deny any request made by parties, isn't

22   that so?

23              MS. MAHONEY:           Your Honor, in note 16 of the

24   Ninth Circuit's opinion it actually rejects that

25   argument by the government and says that apportionment


                                        19

 1   was pled throughout the case; that the government was on

 2   notice.    That's note 16.        The trial court very

 3   specifically rejected the government's claims of waiver

 4   saying, yes, apportionment was at issue here throughout

 5   the case, both in terms of --

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Can you point to me the

 7   part of the district court opinion that conflicts with

 8   the part that I remember so well?                 He is saying, this is

 9   a really tough assignment; I have to figure it out.

10                MS. MAHONEY:         Oh, he does say that, Your

11   Honor.    But what he says is that the theory of

12   apportionment that was offered by the railroad, the

13   argument that it made -- they offered an expert -- that

14   gave substantial precision about how to allocate harm

15   among the different chemicals on the site -- he doesn't

16   accept that approach.       He accepts a different approach.

17                But at 252(a) he says -- he confirms --

18   there is, quote, "considerable evidence of the relative

19   levels of activities and number of releases on the two

20   parcels" that allow him to find a basis of -- for making

21   a reasonable estimate of the apportionment, which was

22   his responsibility as the factfinder.                    In addition, Your

23   Honor --

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Is it -- is it a judge's

25   responsibility, no matter what evidence may be in the

 1   record from which one could make a finding, when a

 2   finding hasn't been sought?

 3              MS. MAHONEY:          Well, Your Honor, the finding

 4   of apportionment was sought.            The trial court -- and,

 5   again, note 16 of the -- of the Ninth Circuit's opinion

 6   makes clear -- and the government doesn't say otherwise

 7   -- that the railroads had requested apportionment.            The

 8   issue was whether or not they had argued the precise

 9   theory, and the factfinder certainly has the authority

10   to choose the theory that it thinks best approximates

11   what is a reasonable estimate.

12              And in fact, Your Honor, the theory that the

13   trial court seized upon was actually suggested by the

14   government's own expert on cross-examination in the

15   transcript at -- at 4077 to '78.

16              And in addition, Your Honor, when it was

17   time for closing argument, which was September 28th,

18   1999, at the very beginning of the transcript, page 4,

19   the trial court said to the government -- it said to the

20   parties at the beginning of the closing argument, here's

21   what I want to know about.          I want you to address

22   yourselves to whether or not I can apportion this harm

23   based upon the relative area on the site and the

24   relative time.   He put the government on notice.

25              When the findings of fact came out, Your


                                       21

 1   Honor, the government could have filed a motion to amend

 2   under Rule 52.    They in fact filed a motion.                 They could

 3   have asked to submit additional evidence if they somehow

 4   thought that this had been unfair.                   They didn't do that.

 5   Shell did it for other reasons, but the government

 6   elected not to.

 7              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               And I suppose the district

 8   court, if it wanted additional evidence, could have

 9   said, I want additional evidence on this point.

10              MS. MAHONEY:            It absolutely could have.          And

11   so that argument of waiver was rejected by two courts

12   below, both by the district court in denying the motion

13   to amend -- it granted it in certain respects, but

14   rejected waiver, and then by the Ninth Circuit --

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    What if -- what if

16   you have a situation where it's clear under

17   apportionment one party is liable for one-tenth and the

18   other is liable for nine-tenths, but one-tenth is enough

19   to pollute the -- the water.              Do you have apportionment

20   in that situation?

21              MS. MAHONEY:            It depends, but generally yes.

22   And the reason, if it, as here -- the cost of the remedy

23   is driven by the mass of the contamination -- and it was

24   undisputed that that was the case here -- then the costs

25   have gone up based upon the aggregate harm.

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, I assume it's

 2   not a linear, if that's the right word, progression,

 3   because once you've got to start a clean-up, you've got

 4   to start a clean-up, whether it's, you know, caused by

 5   one-tenth or -- or nine-tenths.

 6                MS. MAHONEY:          But it's that the whole cost

 7   -- the question under apportionment is:                   Are all of the

 8   damages attributable to the harm that was caused by the

 9   defendant?     And if they're not, then apportionment is

10   appropriate.    And here --

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But that hasn't been --

12   that hasn't been the position of most courts under

13   CERCLA.   I thought they -- I thought that there had been

14   relatively few cases where apportionment, when

15   requested, was even allowed because the theory is the

16   act provides for contribution.                One PRP can go after

17   another, but the party who shouldn't be left holding the

18   bag is the public, the innocent victims of the

19   pollution.

20                MS. MAHONEY:          Well, Your Honor, under -- the

21   government has acknowledged that the apportionment

22   standards from the Restatement apply under the -- under

23   CERCLA.   And cases, as I indicated, the cases under

24   840(e) almost always allowed apportionment for

25   pollution, even though it meant that a farmer or a


                                         23
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   rancher or a grower was left holding with harm that was

 2   caused by another defendant.           But the law has always

 3   said you can't impose damages on a defendant that had no

 4   causal responsibility.

 5              Here what we're talking about, under the

 6   Ninth Circuit's holding, that they -- they didn't

 7   question the district court's factfinding at 248a that

 8   it is indisputable that the overwhelming majority of

 9   hazardous substances were released by B&B on its own

10   parcel, on its own land, not on the railroad's land.

11   Its own operations on its own --

12              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought -- I thought --

13   and tell me if my recollection of the facts is

14   incorrect, that the -- the newer parcel that enabled B&B

15   to expand its operation, the waste went into a pond,

16   what was called South, that was on the other side, that

17   was on the original B&B parcel.             So you had the waste

18   flowing from one part to the other.

19              MS. MAHONEY:         The trial court found that it

20   was plausible that some leakage, some spills on the

21   railroad parcel, during the 13 years of the lease made

22   it into the groundwater by traveling nearly two football

23   fields in an area that hardly has any rain, but said

24   that 9 percent was the maximum of damages that could

25   possibly be attributable to this.

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              What the Ninth Circuit really says is that,

 2   even though B&B began dumping thousands of gallons of

 3   chemical rinsate in 1960, which was 36 years before this

 4   case was filed, 15 years before the lease was ever

 5   entered into, that all of that harm that was caused by

 6   B&B has to be paid by the railroads, because they can't

 7   -- that's almost $40 million now -- because they can't

 8   prove with precision whether their share of the damages

 9   might be zero or one million or nine million.

10              And so what, in essence, the Ninth Circuit

11   did was said that because there weren't adequate records

12   to prove what amount of dumping was going on in 1960

13   when there wouldn't have been any reason to keep those

14   records, that as a default matter 100 percent of the

15   harm has to be allocated by the railroads, even though

16   it's not -- they didn't question the district court's

17   finding that it's indisputable that the overwhelming

18   majority was by B&B on its own land.                    And the court has

19   to --

20              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  What about the issue

21   of insolvency?   You have talked about the Restatements.

22   There's the comment H to one of the Restatement

23   provisions that says you don't apportion if one of the

24   other parties is insolvent.

25              MS. MAHONEY:          Actually, that's -- Your

 1   Honor, what it actually says is that the district court

 2   in exceptional cases may deny apportionment due to

 3   insolvency.    And here the district court at 248a found

 4   this was not such a case, exercised its discretion to

 5   say no.

 6                 And in addition, Your Honor, there are no

 7   cases cited in that section of the Restatement where

 8   this was actually done.         And the Third Restatement in

 9   section 28, comment C, says that that comment was

10   actually inconsistent with section 433(a) principles.

11                 Thank you.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, counsel.

14             ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

15                 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

16                 MR. STEWART:        Mr. Chief Justice, may it

17   please the Court:

18                 If I could begin with the issue of arranger

19   liability.    The Ninth Circuit distinguished what it

20   referred to as the useful product cases and made it

21   clear that it would not impose arranger liability on

22   Shell simply under the theory that Shell had sold a

23   useful product that was later disposed of in a way that

24   contaminated the environment.

25                 Rather, the Court of Appeals and the

 1   district court emphasized both that Shell had control

 2   over the delivery process and that Shell knew that, as

 3   the district court put it, leaks and spills were

 4   inherent in the chosen method.

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:             How does that differ from

 6   you using your printer, there's an ink cartridge and you

 7   replace them after a while, and mine has a little thing

 8   attached that says don't put it in your ordinary garbage

 9   bin because it's dangerous or whatever it is, put it in

10   this envelope and do something?

11                Now, I'm sure that HP makes those and knows

12   that several million people won't do it.                    They will

13   throw it in the garbage bin, and they ship to it me.

14   All right.    Are they now arrangers?

15                MR. STEWART:          No, I don't think they

16   would -- they -- I don't think they would be arrangers

17   for the disposal.

18                JUSTICE BREYER:             Because?

19                MR. STEWART:          Because even though they might

20   foresee that in some --

21                JUSTICE BREYER:             Oh, some?        No, probably

22   millions.    I don't know anybody who does put it in the

23   right garbage can.

25                MR. STEWART:          But -- first, I think under

 1   ordinary tort law principles a seller's knowledge that a

 2   certain percentage of its product would be misused would

 3   not be sufficient to give rise to liability --

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:            Then how is that then

 5   different from Shell?      Shell here knows that to some

 6   degree their people are going to spill this.                   And, of

 7   course, shell arranged the transport.                   And in my

 8   imaginary hypothetical -- I don't really know -- so does

 9   HP.

10               MR. STEWART:         There are two differences.

11   The first is that while HP might know that some

12   percentage of its customers would dispose of the

13   material improperly, here the district court found that

14   Shell knew that spills and leaks occurred with every

15   delivery.   And the second --

16               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, now maybe HP knows

17   that there is a particularly bad customer like Breyer

18   who --

19               (Laughter.)

20                -- because I foolishly admitted at dinner

21   that I dispose of them all improperly.                  Now are they

22   Shell?

23               MR. STEWART:         The second difference here is

24   that Shell arranged for the delivery and controlled the

25   circumstances under which the delivery would be made.

 1   That is, Shell hired the common carrier and Shell

 2   required that B&B have bulk storage facilities so that

 3   the D-D would have to be pumped from the delivery truck

 4   into the bulk storage.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:            So then, suddenly if HP, in

 6   fact, uses -- I guess they lease -- you know, they have

 7   a common carrier, imagine -- or suppose it's car

 8   batteries, same problem.         They have their own trucks,

 9   and they -- or they use Fed Ex; I don't know.             And they,

10   in fact, put in an instruction, which says:             Really do

11   it; really put it in the special now.

12               MR. STEWART:         Again, at a certain point,

13   once the product has been used by the customer --

14               JUSTICE BREYER:            I'm trying to find that

15   point.   And what I have found you so far to say from the

16   briefs is that what Shell here did -- I'm not saying it

17   easy -- but what they did was they arranged the

18   transport, that seems to me to be common, and they put

19   some instructions in which said the right way to dispose

20   of it.   Well, doesn't everybody do that?

21               MR. STEWART:         No, because the fact

22   circumstance here was not that Shell or the common

23   carrier transferred control of the D-D to B&B with

24   instructions as to how it was to be used at a later

25   date, and the customer then violated those instructions.

 1   The fact pattern here is that the spills occurred during

 2   the process of delivery.

 3              And to return to Justice Alito's

 4   hypothetical, you asked what if Shell deliberately chose

 5   a particular delivery company that it knew would result

 6   in spills, but did so for economic advantage, that's

 7   exactly the case here.       That is, at a prior time the D-D

 8   had been shipped to B&B's facility in sealed drums, so

 9   whatever the possibility that it might be misused later,

10   it wouldn't be spilled or leaked during the process of

11   delivery and transfer.       But Shell decided that it was to

12   its economic advantage to require bulk storage of D-D.

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Excuse me.       You say in the

14   process of delivery.      I thought that this material

15   became the property of the buyer when the truck arrived.

16   Are you saying it only -- it only became the property of

17   the buyer when it was unloaded from the truck?

18              MR. STEWART:          The district court

19   specifically declined to make a finding there.                 That

20   is --

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:             What does "FOB" normally

22   mean?

23              MR. STEWART:          It says "FOB delivery or place

24   of delivery."   And the district court found that B&B

25   acquired what it called stewardship over the property at

 1   the time that the truck entered the premises, but that

 2   it --

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:               I think -- I think it's

 4   something of a misdescription to say that this spillage

 5   is occurring in the course of delivery.

 6              MR. STEWART:            But the district court --

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:               I think as far as Shell was

 8   concerned, delivery had been made when the truck pulled

 9   up.

10              MR. STEWART:            Well, the district court

11   specifically declined to find -- to make a finding as to

12   who owned the D-D at the time it was spilled.

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:               You're making it.

14              MR. STEWART:            We don't think that our

15   argument is dependent upon the question of ownership,

16   because Shell undeniably had ownership and possession of

17   the D-D at the time the arrangement was made, and --

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Independent of the time of

19   control.

20              JUSTICE BREYER:               Independent but not at the

21   time of the spill.

22              MR. STEWART:            That's correct.        But that

23   would be true in the paradigmatic arranger case, where

24   one company has generated waste and hires a hauler to

25   pick it up and take it away.              Those parties could easily

 1   provide by contract that title would pass to the hauler

 2   at the time the garbage --

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:             Then in your view what it

 4   is is a company arranges with a transporter for disposal

 5   when the company knows that the transporter on arrival

 6   may spill some of the product?

 7              MR. STEWART:          It's more than --

 8              JUSTICE BREYER:             I guess then every oil

 9   company -- well, I mean, every liquid product company in

10   the United States is going to be -- fall within that

11   because a lot of people do spill things.

12              MR. STEWART:          Knowledge might well be

13   sufficient, but here we have more than knowledge, we

14   have control.

15              JUSTICE SOUTER:             But why do we -- I mean, do

16   we have control?   Shell says to its buyer, see that the

17   delivery is made in the following way, so it doesn't

18   spill all over the place.          If Shell did control, it

19   wouldn't have to say that to the buyer.                 In effect it

20   could either order the buyer, as a condition of receipt

21   of the product, or it could require that as part of the

22   -- its terms with the - with the deliverer.                 It seems to

23   me that the way Shell has set it up indicates that

24   control has passed to somebody else at the time that the

25   spigot starts going in the tank.

 1                 MR. STEWART:         Well, as Ms. Sullivan said,

 2   the instructions were given in 1978, fairly far into the

 3   period of contamination.           But Even before that date

 4   Shell had control in the sense that it required bulk

 5   storage on the B&B facility.

 6                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            He says, we won't sell you

 7   to unless you -- you -- you have these tanks, correct?

 8                 MR. STEWART:         And its contract with the

 9   common carrier required that the common carrier have

10   particular equipment for pumping the D-D out of the

11   truck and into the bulk storage facility.

12                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay, so what is your -- no

13   question, those are -- those are terms of their

14   willingness to deal.        But what is your basis for saying

15   that when the truck pulls up and they -- the hose is

16   turned on to deliver, that at that point Shell is

17   controlling the process?

18                 MR. STEWART:         They have -- they have control

19   of the process in the sense of defining the way it is to

20   be done.     You're correct that the actual process of

21   unloading is being done by employees of the common

22   carrier and employees of B&B rather than employees of

23   Shell.     But again, the whole point of arranger liability

24   is to not allow the people who set in motion the process

25   that culminates in disposal to get off the hook.

 1              JUSTICE SOUTER:            So you don't -- but maybe

 2   you do claim, I'm not sure -- that Shell actually could,

 3   in effect get damages from its deliverer as a result of

 4   the -- the deliverer's incidental spillage.            Is that

 5   your position?

 6              MR. STEWART:         That is --

 7              JUSTICE SOUTER:            That is, that the spillage

 8   is a breach of the contract between the transporter and

 9   Shell?

10              MR. STEWART:         Well, I think if -- if Shell

11   had pursued such a cause of action, then the delivery

12   company might well have argued that these -- this was

13   foreseeable and that there was --

14              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But do you have any basis

15   for saying that if it had pursued that course of action,

16   Shell would have succeeded?

17              MR. STEWART:         No.      And --

18              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Then why is Shell in

19   control?

20              MR. STEWART:         I mean, that's my point.

21   Shell would not have succeeded in such a suit, because

22   the delivery company would have argued successfully this

23   was known to be an inherent consequence of the delivery

24   process that Shell has chosen.

25              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, yes, but you're

 1   saying that the delivery company would have had a

 2   defense, but you are -- are saying that Shell would have

 3   had at least a theoretical right under its actual

 4   contract with the deliverer to assert the -- the control

 5   over the manner of delivery that would have prevented

 6   the spill; is that what you're saying?

 7                 MR. STEWART:         Well, it certainly insisted by

 8   contract on the use of the pumping equipment of -- to

 9   pump the D-D from the truck into the bulk storage

10   facility.     And that was --

11                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            That's the only way they

12   could do it if the buyer did have bulk storage, isn't

13   that correct?

14                 MR. STEWART:         That's correct.

15                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.

16                 MR. STEWART:         So -- and to use an analogy --

17                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask, is it essential

18   to your theory that Shell had title to the material

19   until delivery?

20                 MR. STEWART:         It's not essential to our

21   theory.     That is, the point of the arranger liability

22   provision is to get at situations in which one person

23   sets in motion a --

24                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            What if it were a fungible

25   product and the purchaser just agreed to take either

 1   some product of this -- this quantity and quality and so

 2   forth, but they could substitute other -- other goods

 3   from another source?     Would Shell still be liable?

 4              MR. STEWART:         I mean, I guess I would have

 5   to know more about the hypothetical in -- as to the

 6   circumstances in which the disposal occurred.

 7              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Well, Shell gave all the

 8   same instructions they gave here, but they just didn't

 9   insist that it be their product rather than somebody

10   else's, another oil company's product.

11              MR. STEWART:         I guess I just -- I don't

12   really understand the hypothetical, because I don't

13   understand the situation in which Shell would be

14   indifferent as to whether its product was being bought

15   or the product of a competitor was being bought.

16              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Mr. Stewart, could I go

17   back to a -- we have been arguing about details.             Can I

18   go back to the -- to the broader question?             What is your

19   best response to the argument that Ms. Sullivan makes

20   that "arrange for disposal" implies something

21   significantly different from "arrange for transfer,"

22   "arrange for release," "arrange for delivery" -- that

23   the -- that the combination of arrangement as an

24   intentional act and disposal, as opposed to one of these

25   -- these other processes, implies that the, in effect,

 1   the use of the product intended has become exhausted and

 2   that one in getting rid of waste as distinct from merely

 3   wasting something.      What is -- what is your best answer

 4   to that?

 5              MR. STEWART:            We agree that the term

 6   "arrange for" connotes intentionality, and we think it's

 7   satisfied here because Shell intentionally set in motion

 8   the process of delivery.           It insisted upon the delivery

 9   being done in a particular fashion, and it knew that

10   spills and leaks were inherent in that process.              To use

11   an analogy --

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Excuse me.

13              JUSTICE SOUTER:               But if we're not arguing

14   about that, what you are arguing about, then, is the --

15   is the implication of disposal, as opposed to a more

16   neutral term like transfer or delivery or what-not.

17   What's your answer to that?

18              MR. STEWART:            The further point I would make

19   is that the term "disposal" is specifically defined to

20   include spilling and leaking.

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Oh, but those are certainly

22   ways in which disposal can occur, as I -- I think came

23   out in the argument.        If the -- if Waste Management

24   spills things along the highway on the way to the dump,

25   it may be leakage, but a disposal is going on because in

 1   fact it is a way of getting rid of something that no

 2   longer has any use.

 3               So I -- I can -- I don't think the -- the

 4   inclusion of leakage within the definition answers the

 5   question whether disposal is something different from

 6   transfer.

 7               MR. STEWART:          To use a couple of analogies,

 8   I think if I know that my car leaks oil whenever it's

 9   operated and I choose to drive it on the public highway,

10   I think I could naturally be said to have intentionally

11   discharged oil onto the highway.                It may be --

12               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well you have discharged,

13   but you -- the question is whether it's disposal.

14               MR. STEWART:          Well --

15               JUSTICE SOUTER:             "Discharge" is a more

16   neutral term.

17               MR. STEWART:          Well again, the term

18   "disposal" is specifically defined to include spilling

19   and leaking.    You're right that one --

20               JUSTICE SOUTER:             No, but I mean, that --

21   that -- that begs the question.               Because in the course

22   of disposing, in the sense that she argues for, there

23   can be leakage.

24               MR. STEWART:          That's true, but --

25               JUSTICE SOUTER:             The question is disposal

 1   versus transfer or some more neutral term.

 2              MR. STEWART:         If you had a situation, for

 3   instance, where the trash company was hauling waste and

 4   intended to dispose of it in a more classic sense by

 5   dumping it at a landfill, but along the way the truck

 6   leaked, and some of the items spilled out --

 7              JUSTICE SOUTER:            When?

 8              MR. STEWART:         -- I think everybody

 9   acknowledges that there is disposal there, and I think

10   we would also say that a company that contracted with

11   that trash hauler, knowing that the vehicle tended to

12   leak trash on -- on every delivery, could be said to

13   have arranged for not only the ultimate disposal, but --

14              JUSTICE BREYER:            No that's at that point,

15   because I think you're focusing on the word.               You don't

16   use the word "for" disposal, and I think that is the key

17   word, and the question is intention versus purpose.

18              So that in your trash hauler case, it seems

19   to work pretty well for me that when we say that that

20   trash truck of course intended in the sense that it was

21   its purpose to dispose of the trash when it got to the

22   dump, but the leakage along the way, it was not its

23   purpose.

24              So how do we deal with that?                The statute

25   tells us that they are an owner of a facility or a


                                      39

 1   vessel that leaks, and therefore they are liable that

 2   way.    Now, that seems to work.

 3                So we get your example.                      What doesn't seem

 4   to work is when you import the notion of intention in

 5   the sense of knowing that to the arranger provision,

 6   because at that point I don't see how -- and I have to

 7   buy that to get your argument.                At that point I do not

 8   see how you get every thing of Clorox on the shelf on

 9   the shelf in the supermarket and don't put Clorox right

10   in the arranger provision and lots of other companies

11   that shouldn't be held as arrangers.                      That's my problem.

12   Are you following that?

13                MR. STEWART:          I am following that, but I

14   think that the court of appeals dealt with this and

15   said:   Our holding does not suggest that every

16   manufacturer of a useful product is liable down the road

17   if the customer ultimately disposes of it --

18                JUSTICE BREYER:             It does say that, but my

19   problem is I can't find in the distinctions that they

20   made useful distinctions that will do that.                      It will say

21   "many," but it won't say, for example, the car battery

22   manufacturer who sends his car batteries out in his own

23   trucks to places where people will get them, and he

24   knows that they're not going to do it properly no matter

25   how hard he tries.

 1                Well, he's not an arranger.                He didn't

 2   arrange the transport for disposal; he arranged the

 3   transport for sale.

 4                MR. STEWART:        I mean, I think in a sense the

 5   argument for liability there would depend in part on an

 6   assumption that people will systematically violate the

 7   law, like it would be an easy thing for the Court to say

 8   we will not assume and we will not impose liability on

 9   the basis of the assumption that battery customers will

10   systematically violate the law.

11                But the second thing that would be missing

12   in that hypothetical, even if the battery manufacturer

13   were assumed to know that every one of his customers

14   would dispose of them ultimately in an improper way, is

15   that the battery manufacturer would not be in control of

16   that process.

17                The manufacturer's control over the use of

18   the batteries and their ultimate disposal would be

19   severed once he turned them over, and that was not the

20   case here.   And again I think to return to the purposes

21   of the arranger liability provision, the operator

22   liability provision deals very well with the people who

23   undertake the actual disposal, but Congress evidently

24   thought that that was not enough.

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, is Shell liable

 1   because it -- it knew of the transportation

 2   arrangements?

 3              MR. STEWART:         I think it is a combination of

 4   knowledge and control.       Knowledge might be sufficient,

 5   but knowledge and control together form a basis for

 6   arranger liability.     Again, if I know that the

 7   particular common carrier uses a truck, to use a variant

 8   of my earlier hypothetical, if I know that a particular

 9   common carrier uses a truck that leaks oil whenever it's

10   operated on the highway and I contract with that carrier

11   and ask it to haul goods, I think I can naturally be

12   said to have arranged for the discharge of oil on --

13              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes, but you -- in that

14   case, you have knowledge but you don't have control

15   because you're using a common carrier.

16              MR. STEWART:         I have -- I have control in

17   the sense that I have deliberately selected a mode of

18   delivery, a particular common --

19              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Then you mean simply

20   control over your own choice process?

21              MR. STEWART:         Well --

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Not control over the

23   behavior of your hauler?

24              MR. STEWART:         Not -- not control in the

25   sense of using my own personnel to drive the truck.

 1              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Whether you have -- you

 2   might have knowledge that one chemical broker is more

 3   careless than another in the way the product was

 4   ultimately sold, I don't see why your theory doesn't

 5   make the seller liable as an arranger if it knows or

 6   ought to know that at some point in the distribution

 7   process there is likely to be spillage which will enter

 8   the waters of the United States.              I think that's what

 9   your argument implies.       I just don't see that in the

10   statute.

11              MR. STEWART:         Again, because here Shell had

12   control over the very aspect of the process that

13   resulted in spills and leaks.

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:            You mean it could have --

15   could have adopted some other means?

16              MR. STEWART:         Not only --

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's all you mean by

18   having control over it.

19              MR. STEWART:         Not only that it could have

20   adopted some other means, but that it insisted upon the

21   particular means --

22              JUSTICE SCALIA:            All right.       So all you're

23   requiring is knowledge that using this means will --

24   will result in a spill.        I don't think knowledge alone

25   is enough for -- I think you need purpose.                If you

 1   arrange for disposal, I think you have to have a

 2   purpose.   It -- it has to be your object to have the oil

 3   leaking along the highway as you go.                    Merely knowing

 4   that it's going to be leaking, I mean, there may be some

 5   other way under the statute that you can find liability

 6   on the part of the shipper, but not, it seems to me, on

 7   the -- on the ground that the shipper arranged for this

 8   leak.   He didn't want the leak.             He knew it was

 9   happening, but that was not the object of the transport.

10               MR. STEWART:         Clearly, if the Court reads

11   the term "arrange for" to require purpose, we lose in

12   this case --

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:            All right.

14               MR. STEWART:         -- because that was not the

15   purpose of the transaction.            But here there was both

16   knowledge and control.

17               And in terms of fairness to Shell, I think

18   it is worth noting that in the typical arranger setting,

19   where a person asks a trash hauler to come pick up my

20   trash and deposit it in an appropriate place, that the

21   arranger's ultimate liability may be determined very

22   substantially by steps that the hauler takes afterwards;

23   that is, if the arranger believes that the trash is

24   going to be disposed of safely, but in fact the hauler

25   dumps it in a way that will contaminate the environment.

 2              JUSTICE ALITO:           Can I ask you a question

 3   about your argument that the Petitioners waived their

 4   apportionment argument?        Aren't there many pages of the

 5   district court record in which the parties address

 6   apportionment?   For example, in the government's

 7   response to the Petitioners' apportionment argument,

 8   don't you have more than 20 pages of findings of fact

 9   and conclusions of law on the issue of apportionment?

10              MR. STEWART:          We haven't used the word

11   "waiver" in our brief and -- but we concede that the

12   railroads and Shell, at least in a cursory way, raised

13   the issue of apportionment at trial, and the Ninth

14   Circuit found that was sufficient to preserve it.                 In

15   our view, this is like any case in which a party with

16   the burden of proof on a particular issue asserts that a

17   particular proposition is true but fails to introduce

18   sufficient evidence to carry its burden.                 You wouldn't

19   speak of that as waiver, but it's still a failure of the

20   party to come forward with enough to carry the day.                 And

21   you --

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  On the question of

23   apportionment, is it really your position that because

24   of the precision you would require, that if there's a

25   big fight over whether it's 10 percent responsibility or

 1   30 percent and there's no way to tell, that if the

 2   parties said, look, we'll take 40 percent, that that's

 3   no good?

 4              MR. STEWART:          No, I think that would be an

 5   acceptable approach.      I think that --

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Isn't that what

 7   happened here?   I mean, whatever -- I guess the

 8   railroads said 6 percent, and the district court said,

 9   well, just to be on the safe side, we'll give them 9

10   percent.

11              MR. STEWART:          Well, I guess we would have

12   two responses.   The first is, although the district

13   court certainly believed that he was -- the district

14   judge believed he was building in a margin of safety, in

15   our view it's still speculative as to whether the

16   railroad's share of the contamination exceeded or was

17   less than 9 percent.

18              But the more fundamental point is the one

19   that you raised in one of your questions; that is, the

20   ultimate harm to the government in a practical sense is

21   the incurrence of response costs, and in general that's

22   the way that damages are measured in a CERCLA case.                  You

23   don't ask, what threat -- what was the degree of public

24   -- of threat to the public safety that was posed by the

25   contamination?   You ask, how much did it cost to clean

 1   it up?   And it --

 2               JUSTICE ALITO:            Do you dispute what Ms.

 3   Mahoney said, that it costs a great deal more to clean

 4   up some of the other chemicals than the ones that the

 5   railroad was responsible for?

 6               MR. STEWART:           Well, I think -- I don't think

 7   that the record kind of establishes the relative costs

 8   of different contaminants.            What I understood Ms.

 9   Mahoney to say --

10               JUSTICE ALITO:            The volume, the volume.

11               MR. STEWART:           What I understood her to say

12   was that the cost of the remedial action is proportional

13   to the mass of chemicals to be removed, and we do

14   dispute that proposition.            The railroad's expert, Dr.

15   Kalinowski testified about the remedial action that the

16   government at that time was contemplating, and it was

17   what was referred to as "a pump-and-treat system," where

18   water would be pumped out of the aquifer and it would be

19   treated with granular-activated carbon, or GAC, and that

20   was a method of removing the contaminants so that the

21   water could be pumped back in.                And Dr. Kalinowski said

22   the amount of GAC that would be needed to implement that

23   remedy would be proportional to the mass of the

24   chemicals involved, but that the crucial point for these

25   purposes is the treatment with GAC is only a small


                                         47
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   portion of the pump-and-treat remedy; that is, it's

 2   essential to drill wells, pump the water out, then treat

 3   it, and then under the prior remedial approach, pump it

 4   back in.   And then --

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But that still

 6   doesn't address the question, if you have varying

 7   degrees of whatever you want to call it -- fault or

 8   causal relationship -- that that's a sensible way to

 9   apportion the liability.

10               MR. STEWART:         I think the first preliminary

11   point is there's no reason to think that the cost of the

12   remedy as a whole would be proportional to the mass of

13   the contaminants because you have very substantial fixed

14   costs, but the other point I would make is this is where

15   the insolvency of B&B really seems to us to become

16   crucial because, if you had all solvent defendants and

17   the evidence showed that the remedy the government

18   implemented would have been more or less the same if it

19   had only been 10 percent of the contamination, 30

20   percent of the contamination, or 100 percent of the

21   contamination, that so much of the costs were fixed

22   costs that reducing the volume was really not going to

23   affect the cost in any meaningful way -- if you had all

24   solvent defendants, it might still be the case that

25   dividing the costs up in proportion to the contamination


                                       48

 1   they caused would do rough justice.

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, what -- what

 3   about Ms. Mahoney's three answers, when I asked that

 4   question of her?

 5              MR. STEWART:          Well, I believe her first

 6   answer was the cost of the remedy would be proportional

 7   to the amount of contamination, which we disagree with,

 8   and we don't think Dr. Kalinowski's testimony bears that

 9   out, because all he said was the amount of

10   granular-activated carbon that would be necessary is

11   proportional to the mass of contaminants.                 And that --

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  She also said that

13   the Restatement comment h that you rely on cites no

14   cases, and the Third Restatement backs away from that

15   comment.

16              MR. STEWART:          Well, as to the first point,

17   the comment h, you're right, doesn't cite cases, and it

18   does say that this -- the insolvency of the defendant

19   need not prevent apportionment, only that it would

20   provide a basis for doing so in exceptional cases.                 But

21   in our view, the exceptional case would be one in which

22   the ultimate determination was that the cost of the

23   remedy, the amount of the relevant harm, would be more

24   or less the same even if only one defendants's

25   contamination were at issue, that it --

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So you don't think

 2   that the insolvency should prevent apportionment if you

 3   have a situation where a party is 1 percent responsible

 4   and the 99 percent responsible party is insolvent?

 5               MR. STEWART:         Well, we would say even as to

 6   10 or 20 percent, if it were established that the remedy

 7   the government would have been required to implement,

 8   had the only source of contamination been leakage on the

 9   railroad parcel -- if it were established that the

10   government could have cleaned that up at 10 percent or

11   20 percent of the cost of the remedy that was actually

12   chosen, then there might be a sound basis for

13   apportionment despite the insolvency of B&B.

14               But our big point is, at the very least, the

15   government should not be left holding the bag for costs

16   that it would have been required to incur if the

17   railroad parcel had been the only source of

18   contamination, because --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And what do we have

20   in the way of findings on that question?

21               MR. STEWART:         We don't have findings either

22   way.   That is, the district court framed the relevant

23   inquiry as what percentage of the contamination was

24   attributable to the railroad parcel, to the

25   Shell-controlled deliveries, and to the B&B parcel.                 But


                                       50

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   it made no finding one way or the other as to what the

 2   cost of the remedy would have been if only the -- the

 3   only source of contamination had been the railroad

 4   parcel.

 5               And certainly the -- the primary equitable

 6   thrust of the argument on the other side is it's unfair

 7   to make us pay for somebody else's contamination.                 But

 8   to the extent that the government would have been

 9   required to implement a remedy this costly or even 60

10   percent this costly had the railroads or Shell been the

11   only source of contamination, by imposing at least that

12   amount of liability, we're not asking for them to pay

13   for B&B's contamination.         We're simply asking for them

14   to pay for the response costs that their own --

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But is that right?

16   I mean doesn't it -- aren't you challenging the whole

17   basis for apportionment?         I mean there is -- I don't

18   think when you're apportioning responsibility, you

19   allocate whether or not the actors independently caused

20   the harm.   I thought the assumption was, yes,

21   everybody's -- all of this group has contributed to the

22   harm, but now we're going to apportion their

23   responsibility.

24               MR. STEWART:         Well, indeed, the second

25   restatement says as a categorical matter that if either


                                       51
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   of two causes would have been independently sufficient

 2   to bring about the result, then there's joint and

 3   several liability.      The example that the restatement

 4   gives is two merging fires that destroyed a building.

 5              And so I think it is established in -- in

 6   the second restatement that the -- there is no

 7   apportionment if either of two causes would have brought

 8   about the -- the feared harm.

 9              With -- with respect to the third

10   restatement, I would say that at least in the case of --

11   you're -- you're right.          There is no exact counterpart

12   to comment (h) in the third restatement.                  But at least

13   as to indivisible harms -- and I think this is

14   potentially an indivisible harm that the government

15   would have been required to undertake more or less the

16   same response action regardless of the source of

17   contamination.

18              At least as to individual harms, the third

19   restatement gives a variety of approaches that a local

20   jurisdiction could take.           There's joint and several

21   liability, pure several liability, and then there are

22   several permutations.        And the third restatement is --

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Is that a finding?      Do we

24   have to take it as a given that this was an indivisible

25   harm?

 1              MR. STEWART:         I don't know that -- I think

 2   you should take it as a given because it was the

 3   defendant's burden to prove different divisibility.             But

 4   I think if you don't regard the defendants as having the

 5   burden, I don't think there is an evidentiary basis for

 6   feeling confident one way or the other as to whether the

 7   harm was indivisible.     But with respect to --

 8              JUSTICE ALITO:          What is the basis for

 9   thinking that every little detail in the latest

10   restatement, including comments, is binding in a CERCLA

11   case?

12              MR. STEWART:         I don't think so, and this

13   Court in Norfolk and Western -- it was dealing with a

14   different statute, but it said when you're looking at

15   the restatement, it's more important what the state of

16   the law was when Congress enacted the statute rather

17   than what the common-law principles are now.           And as

18   we've said in our brief, we think for that reason the

19   second restatement is the more crucial document.

20              But if you were to look at the third

21   restatement, one of the things you would find is that

22   the drafters, as to indivisible harms, identified a

23   variety of approaches that a local jurisdiction could

24   take -- expressly decline to choose a preferred one

25   among them, but said the most important determinant in


                                      53
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   choosing between them is how will the risk that a

 2   particular defendant be insolvent will be allocated.

 3              So the drafters of the third restatement

 4   certainly didn't treat insolvency as a factor that

 5   should be ignored in citing questions of an

 6   apportionability.

 7              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               May I -- may I just ask

 8   one question about the -- the situation of -- of these

 9   two potentially responsible parties?                     They are the only

10   ones left, right?    Because B&B is bankrupt, and there's

11   nobody else that has been identified.

12              MR. STEWART:           That's correct.

13              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               So it's only those two.

14   And one question about the arranger liability -- well,

15   first on the apportionment.             Assuming we don't accept

16   your entire position, would a remand so that proof could

17   be put in by both sides focusing on the issue of

18   apportionment be appropriate?              You questioned the

19   district, even -- even if apportionment were possible,

20   you questioned how he arrived at it.

21              MR. STEWART:           I guess that's true.            To the

22   argument that I've just been sketching out, that -- that

23   the crucial question is what response costs the

24   government would have been required to bear if -- if

25   only the railroad parcel's contamination had been at

 1   issue, our argument is that the -- the railroads failed

 2   to prove divisibility.       But another option would be to

 3   remand for factual proceedings to address that question.

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And is it true, as Ms.

 5   Sullivan said, that there is no other arranger case like

 6   this one where the, quote, "arranger" is the seller of a

 7   product?

 8               MR. STEWART:         I think there is no "arranger"

 9   case going in either direction that is on all fours with

10   this one where there is the sale of a useful product

11   during the course of a delivery that the seller arranged

12   -- that the seller controlled.

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, counsel.

14   Ms. Sullivan, we will give you five minutes.

16                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

17                             IN NO. 07-1607

18              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Ms. Sullivan, just on the

19   apportionment point, do you agree that it is your burden

20   to show that this is a divisible harm, and can you tell

21   me how you showed that?

22              MS. SULLIVAN:           Yes, Justice Kennedy.         The --

23   there is no dispute in this case that this was a

24   divisible harm.   Mr. Stewart answered Justice Scalia's

25   question incorrectly.

 1               The district court found and the circuit

 2   court also found -- the circuit court's finding is on

 3   page 36-A of the Petitioner's appendix -- that there is

 4   no dispute that the harm here is divisible; that is,

 5   there -- the -- the harm here is capable of

 6   apportionment.   That is not disputed before this Court.

 7               What is disputed is whether at the second

 8   stage of analysis the railroads and Shell met our burden

 9   -- and we agree it is our burden under restatement

10   principles -- of showing the -- the quantum of division,

11   the reasonable basis for how the shares were allocated

12   by the District Court.       And Justice Alito is correct.

13   There are meticulous findings, 20 pages of findings,

14   based on record evidence from the government's witnesses

15   and from the extensive expert testimony that both Shell

16   and the railroads put in that went to the apportionment

17   issue.   Shell argued --

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I'm not sure I know

19   what it means to say it's a divisible harm.

20               MS. SULLIVAN:          It's capable of

21   apportionment.   The restatement suggests in the cases

22   applying this -- it says you ask at the first stage:                    Is

23   the harm capable of apportionment as a matter of law?

24   And then as a matter of --

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So that means that

 1   whatever percentage of responsibility the parties have,

 2   that's the percentage of cost that they --

 3              MS. SULLIVAN:            They should bear.           But then

 4   they -- it's up to the parties to prove a reasonable

 5   basis for apportionment.          But both Shell and the

 6   railroads did argue, Justice Ginsburg -- put into

 7   evidence and argued at the district court that there

 8   should be apportionment --

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   So does that mean

10   that, let's say, the -- how does that work when it costs

11   $2 million to sort of start a clean-up, no matter who,

12   and then, you know, the more stuff there is, the extra

13   million it is?    Is that -- is -- is the initial cost a

14   divisible harm?

15              MS. SULLIVAN:            Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the

16   district court here was conservative.                    It allocated all

17   of the costs, fixed and specific, to the parties.                    So

18   the conservative estimate of six percent for Shell, nine

19   percent for the railroads, was based on the heroic

20   assumption that a few drops spilled two football fields

21   away of a volatile substance that evaporates twice as

22   fast as water would be picked up by a rainfall that

23   could happen at the relevant quantities only once every

24   ten years according to our expert, once every seven

25   years according to the government's expert -- on the


                                        57

 1   heroic assumption that all of those drips reached the

 2   pond which created a single plume of contamination.

 3   Assuming that, then we award six percent or nine percent

 4   of liability.

 5               But the point is there was record evidence,

 6   Justice Ginsburg -- and there is no need for a remand on

 7   this.   There was ample evidence for which the six

 8   percent and the nine percent could be -- we -- and we

 9   didn't object and say we --

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That's not normally how

11   -- when -- when someone has a burden of proof, it's a

12   burden of coming forward.          And the one thing that we do

13   know from this district judge is he's saying, I was left

14   largely to make it up.       What he -- the components of his

15   allocation did not come from -- yes, there is some

16   evidence in the record.        But ordinarily when you talk

17   about a party who has a burden of proof, we don't mean

18   they put in a piece here and a piece there and left it

19   to the district judge to figure out.

20               MS. SULLIVAN:          Justice Ginsburg, there is no

21   question that both the railroads and Shell argued for

22   zero percent liability.        But the same evidence that we

23   put in and the proposed findings of fact -- for example,

24   if you want to look at Docket Nos. 1317 and 1318,

25   Shell's proposed findings of fact did suggest a basis

 1   for apportionment.      So we met our burden of production

 2   as well as proof.     But the -- to return to the question

 3   --

 4              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               I'm really concerned about

 5   the time and the white light, but I'm -- I'm not sure

 6   you answered the Chief Justice's hypothetical about $2

 7   million, which is an initial clean-up that has to be

 8   expended no matter how large the -- the spill was.                   How

 9   did you discharge your burden of proof to show that that

10   is not the case here or that that is divisible?

11              MS. SULLIVAN:             Justice Kennedy, here -- and

12   I refer you to the Petitioner's appendix at page -- I'm

13   sorry, to the joint appendix at page 288, to the expert

14   Kalinouski who described it as a single mass removal

15   scheme.

16              This is not a case like a toxic soup case in

17   a landfill with 238 different chemicals that require

18   different extraction procedures.                 This is a case in

19   which two chemicals reached the ground water and were to

20   be removed by a single mass extraction scheme, a single

21   -- what the expert called at joint appendix 288 a mass

22   removal scheme.   It was not disputed or argued on appeal

23   that there was a single remediation process.                 So this is

24   a simple case in which we are relying --

25              JUSTICE BREYER:               Well, we don't suppose that

 1   that cost -- that single thing cost $2 million, and you

 2   will have to hire that $2 million machine even if there

 3   is one drop.     So for the cost of that machine it

 4   couldn't matter if your client put in one drop and

 5   nobody else put in any, or the others put in 40 billion

 6   drops.   Can you allocate it?             It would seem fair to

 7   allocate it, but I guess maybe in the restatement there

 8   is some law somewhere saying you can't, because it's

 9   just one single cost that takes place regardless.

10   What's the state of the law on that?                      How do you --

11               MS. SULLIVAN:            May I answer?            A reasonable

12   basis is all that's required.               A practical approximation

13   is appropriate here.        Here the court did not distinguish

14   between fixed capital costs and operating costs that

15   might matter in a different case.                  But the key point

16   here is that you should affirm as a matter of Federal

17   common law that restatement 433(a) provides only a

18   demand for a reasonable basis and not exactitude.                         Thank

19   you very much.
