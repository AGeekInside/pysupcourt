 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  We'll hear arguments

 5               Ms. Bonner.

 6                       ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY C. BONNER

 7                          ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 8               MS. BONNER:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10               Mr. Lawrence in this case made an

11   application for relief in the state courts of Florida,

12   that unfortunately was denied to him, the relief that he

13   sought.   Consequently, he came here to the United States

14   Supreme Court on a certiorari review and the certiorari,

15   although it was denied, he did present to this Court an

16   issue on which it could have acted had it chosen to act.

17   It is well within the power under 28 U.S.C. 2104 for

18   this Court to modify, vacate, remand.                    In other words,

19   this Court can and could have affected that judgment.

20               Our position is that this -- there is a

21   distinction between the, quote, "appellate jurisdiction"

22   under 2104 and the original writ of certiorari which

23   would lie in this Court in some instances.                    When one

24   uses the appeal, one is not making a new application.

25   We respectfully suggest that the utilization of the


                                         3

 1   emphasis in 2244 should be on application and what was

 2   before this Court on petition for certiorari was the

 3   application, the document, the issues, which had been

 4   presented below in the Florida courts and this Court was

 5   sitting to determine whether it would --

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It would presumably,

 7   though, be limited in some ways.              For example, if the

 8   application for state post-conviction relief raised

 9   arguments under state law, those would not be a proper

10   subject of a petition for certiorari.

11              MS. BONNER:        Absolutely not, Your Honor.

12   And the issues which were raised were the same ones that

13   were raised in the state court and were of

14   constitutional dimension that Mr. Lawrence raised here.

15   But our point is if the emphasis is on the application,

16   then until the finality of action on the application --

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:             You're saying the

18   application is the application -- the petition for

19   certiorari is the application?

20              MR. PECK:      No, sir.          I'm saying the

21   application under 3850 in Florida state trial courts,

22   which then goes to the Florida State Supreme Court, is

23   the application upon which this Court would be acting.

24   If it were not acting on that, what would it be acting

25   on?

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, we can't act on it

 2   unless, unless it's final.          We, we need final action by

 3   the state court, don't we?

 4               MS. BONNER:        Well, except --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:             How can it be final action

 6   and yet still be pending?

 7               MS. BONNER:        To utilize the word "final"

 8   there would be -- we can use the word "final" after a

 9   jury determination and that in one effect, in one sense,

10   is final.   And when Florida is done it's final in some

11   sense.   But it's not final under 2104 because this Court

12   can modify it, can remand it.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:             It's final as far as the

14   application for state review is concerned.

15               MS. BONNER:        There -- it is the --

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Which is the text that

17   we're dealing with here.

18               MS. BONNER:        Yes.       It is the application for

19   state review which comes before this Court.             We're

20   asking you to review the lower court's rulings on the

21   application.

22               JUSTICE BREYER:             I take it you're talking

23   about language, if I followed it, in 2244(d)(2).

24               MS. BONNER:        Yes, sir.

25               JUSTICE BREYER:             And it tolled the statute

 1   while the "properly filed application for state

 2   post-conviction or other collateral review is pending."

 3   So the question is during the 90 days after they said no

 4   to you in the state court and you had a chance to file

 5   the writ, is that application pending?                 And you say yes,

 6   that application is pending, that application is pending

 7   and subject to various motions, such as a motion or a

 8   petition for certiorari.

 9               MS. BONNER:       Yes, sir.

10               JUSTICE BREYER:            But it is pending.

11               MS. BONNER:       Yes, sir that is --

12               JUSTICE BREYER:            That's where we are in this

13   argument.

14               MS. BONNER:       That is exactly our position.

15               JUSTICE BREYER:            Thank you.

16               MS. BONNER:       That this application is

17   pending.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Of course, the other

19   way to read the language is that the state application

20   is final -- otherwise you couldn't file the Federal

21   petition for certiorari, and that petition may affect

22   what happens with your application for state relief, but

23   the state application itself is final and over.

24               MS. BONNER:       In that sense it is not final

25   in that it can be altered and that this Court can


                                       6

 1   order --

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, it has to be

 3   final before you can file a petition for cert.

 4              MS. BONNER:           Yes, sir.           It's the vagaries of

 5   the use of the language --

 6              JUSTICE BREYER:                Does it say that?      I would

 7   have thought it said that there has to be a final

 8   judgment of the lower court, and the final judgment of

 9   the state court concerns that application which is still

10   pending and will continue to be pending at least for 90

11   days in your view.

12              MS. BONNER:           Yes.

13              JUSTICE BREYER:                So it doesn't require a

14   final state application.           It requires a final judgment

15   about the state application.

16              MS. BONNER:           Yes, that's exactly true, sir.

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So what about the

18   argument raised by your friend that exhaustion doesn't

19   require filing a petition for certiorari, that the state

20   procedures are considered fully exhausted upon the final

21   decision in the state court and that it makes sense to

22   treat this, this 2244, in a parallel way with respect to

23   the exhaustion requirement?

24              MS. BONNER:           Well, Your Honor, first of all,

25   it would require this Court to substitute the word


                                          7

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   "exhaustion" for the word "pending" in the statute.

 2   There is no reason to believe and there is much reason

 3   not to believe that Congress intended exhaustion has a

 4   concept which should be read into this particular

 5   context in which we're dealing.             In point of fact, in

 6   the 1995 proposal for habeas reform the word

 7   "exhaustion" was in there.         It was taken out in 1996.

 8   Unfortunately, the Congressional history and the

 9   speeches on the floor, etcetera, are not really

10   illuminating, except the concept of exhaustion

11   apparently the legislature, the Congress, felt would be

12   subject to interpretation differently in different

13   states.

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 How do you know what

15   is pending with respect to when the state defendant,

16   movant, doesn't file a petition for certiorari?                  Is

17   that --

18              MS. BONNER:        Well, I believe.

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Is the state

20   post-conviction application still pending on the 90th

21   day?

22              MS. BONNER:        I believe it is, Your Honor,

23   and I think the logic that this Court has used in the

24   context of 2255's obtains as well, and it -- it is

25   pending because the reason that we have 90 days -- it's


                                       8

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   an unusual amount of time that we have to come to ask

 2   this Court for relief.      And I believe that part of that

 3   time and part of the reason for the existence of that is

 4   that we can contemplate whether we should be filing a

 5   petition for certiorari.

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, anybody who

 7   wants the additional time -- this law was passed to

 8   prevent people from delaying.            But anybody who wanted to

 9   delay would then have to file a cert petition, I assume?

10              MS. BONNER:        I would suggest to you, Your

11   Honor, that it should be -- this should be construed the

12   same way that the finality of a state conviction, the

13   finality of a Federal conviction, and the finality of a

14   2255 are determined, and that is at the time that either

15   this Court has dealt with certiorari by denying or

16   granting it or that 90 days has, has been --

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But if you filed --

18   so you say you get 90 days whether you file or not?

19              MS. BONNER:        Yes, I do, sir.

20              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But if you want the

21   additional time that it takes for an opposition, for

22   waiver of response, for this court to dispose of it,

23   then you have to file a petition for cert?

24              MS. BONNER:        I don't -- that is not my

25   position, Your Honor.     I believe that the 90 days should

 1   obtain no matter what so that we'll have a universal

 2   rule.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Right.

 4                MS. BONNER:       -- that practitioners will not

 5   be making this error because they will be acting in

 6   concert --

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But the Chief's point is

 8   that if a petition is in fact found it will end up being

 9   more than 90 days because then you would have, in

10   addition to the 90 days you'd have to file the cert

11   petition, the time it takes for this Court to dispose of

12   the petition, and the statute of limitations would be

13   tolled throughout that entire period, not just a fixed

14   90 days.

15                MS. BONNER:       That is true, ma'am.

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Do you -- does your

17   argument mean that a defendant who wanted to file within

18   the 90 days, wanted to file in the district court,

19   wanted to file the habeas application in the district

20   court within the 90 days, couldn't do so because it

21   would be premature because the, the state application is

22   still pending?

23                MS. BONNER:       I believe that the way that we

24   have been seeing the opinions come from this Court and

25   from the various courts around the country are that

 1   there seems to be a favorable disposition to protective

 2   2254, 2255 petitions.        I agree with the premise of Your

 3   Honor's question that it would be pending and it would

 4   be pending here and therefore, you should not go to

 5   district court and file a 2254.                Now whether you can and

 6   you can do it in a protective fashion is another entire

 7   issue which isn't really raised here because he did seek

 8   certiorari review.

 9              JUSTICE ALITO:              Do you read the tolling

10   provision in 2263(B) the same way as you read the

11   tolling provision that's before us?

12              MS. BONNER:           No.      Certainly I do not.       And

13   the state really did not analogize to 2263 as I believe

14   perhaps they should have analogized to it.                2263 of

15   course is the opt-in provision which moves things along

16   on an even quicker track than a one year, and you have

17   180 days to file, and the Congress was absolutely clear

18   and this was enacted at the same time that the

19   provisions at issue were enacted, that it was 180 days

20   after final state court affirmance and you had to, you

21   had to file.   That's it.

22              JUSTICE ALITO:              Do you think Congress really

23   wanted to have two different, entirely different tolling

24   concepts in these provisions?

25              MS. BONNER:           I think they did, and one of


                                         11
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the reasons that I believe that they did, number one was

 2   to achieve their goal of moving things faster if the

 3   states were able to guarantee counsel, and the second is

 4   that they told, as well, in 2263(B) the main difference

 5   between 2263(A) and (B)(1) is that the time when you're

 6   getting your certiorari petition ready for this Court

 7   under the opt-in provision is not tolled.                 But the time

 8   when this Court is considering the post-conviction

 9   certiorari request is tolled.             It's tolled clearly by

10   statute.   I cannot presume and would not presume that

11   what Congress did was write these in numerical order and

12   when it got to 2263 come up with a new and exciting

13   idea, and then not go back to 2254 and 2244 to change

14   the language there.

15               I think Congress meant something different.

16   And what it meant was the trigger time, the time that

17   was going to be elapsing between the petition, between

18   your final decision and when you could go to certiorari.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You know, what about

20   2244(D)(1)(a) where Congress referred expressly to the

21   time for seeking direct review or the expiration of the

22   time for seeking such review?             Your reading of D(2) is

23   that that's what they meant when they said the state

24   application was pending.         The state application or the

25   time for seeking review of the state application, and in

 1   -- just in just a few sections above that they expressly

 2   said that shouldn't we read pending in a different,

 3   different direction?

 4                MS. BONNER:         Well, the distinction, I have

 5   at least two things to say about that.                    The distinction

 6   between the two sections, that would be (D)(1)(a) and

 7   (D)(2), one is dealing with one thing, a judgment which

 8   has reached finality and it is determining when that

 9   judgment is final.      They would have had to rewrite the

10   tolling provision because it is not speaking about a

11   judgment.    It is speaking about an application which is

12   a process.    And the second thing is that --

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, they would

14   have just said during the time of the application for

15   state post-conviction, or the expiration of the time for

16   seeking review of it.

17                MS. BONNER:         I believe that Congress is

18   presumed to have read, written its laws knowing the

19   history of interpretation of this Court.                   And pending

20   has a very long tradition and this Court's role in the

21   state-Federal continuum obviously is of well defined 200

22   plus-year-old role, and the part of that role is that

23   you as this Court are the final arbiters and the only

24   true people who can make the decision about what the

25   Federal Constitution says.

 1                 The state would have you read this as if it

 2   says application for state post-conviction relief is

 3   pending in the state court.              I would be hesitant to

 4   rewrite the statute since Congress did not invite me to

 5   do so as the state has actually done by saying, pending

 6   in the, in the state court.              And that is not the concept

 7   that we have lived with for 200 years or 200- plus

 8   years.     Pending means until it is, cannot be any longer

 9   acted upon, and it is clear here, you as this Court can

10   upon it.

11                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Do you think the final, the

12   judgment in the criminal case is still pending because

13   it can be acted upon?

14                 MS. BONNER:        Not the judgment in the

15   criminal case, but I would suggest that the judgment in

16   the 22 -- I mean the 385.1 procedures in Florida which

17   would be that post-conviction application because that's

18   where we are.    We have reached finality on the, after

19   this Court has had, after we have either come to this

20   Court for certiorari or the 90 days is exhausted.

21                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Are you saying, are you

22   arguing that there, during this period, there is an

23   application for state relief pending in the state courts

24   or that there is an application for state relief pending

25   in this Court?

 1              MS. BONNER:           I am saying that the

 2   application in state court is yet pending when it is

 3   here, because that court can be ordered by --

 4              JUSTICE ALITO:             Where is it pending?

 5              MS. BONNER:           -- this Court to act upon it.

 6              JUSTICE ALITO:             Where is it pending?

 7              MS. BONNER:           It is pending still in state

 8   court because this Court can order that court.

 9              JUSTICE GINSBERG:                I thought your argument

10   on brief was that it is pending here and the statute

11   says pending.     It doesn't say pending, as your statute,

12   you compared it with says.            That pending, the

13   application is pending someplace.                  Where is it pending?

14   Not in the state court anymore.                They have reached their

15   final judgment, but it's still pending in your case here

16   because you filed a petition for cert.

17              MS. BONNER:           Yes, ma'am.              It just is, also,

18   I -- there is some case law which speaks to the fact

19   that it remains pending or unsettled or unsure or

20   unfinal when a court can order another court to act on

21   it.

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:               In the same sense that it

23   is pending after the trial court has acted but before

24   the defendant or the petitioner decides whether he wants

25   a state appeal.

 1               MS. BONNER:          Yes, sir.

 2               JUSTICE SOUTER:              I don't know where it's

 3   pending.   Whether it's still pending in the state trial

 4   court or in the state appeals court.                      But nobody denies

 5   that it's pending.      And I understood your argument to

 6   be, whatever mending means there, pending means here

 7   because there is no modifier that would limit the same

 8   -- the same construction.

 9               MS. BONNER:          Yes.       That is -- that is so,

10   sir.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   But in what sense is

12   it an application for state post-conviction review when

13   it's pending before us?          We are considering a claim that

14   the state erroneously decided a Federal question --

15               MR. BONNER:          You are --

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   -- but it's not an

17   application, it's an application for our review, not

18   state post-conviction review.

19               MS. BONNER:          It began as a complaint.             This

20   is, analytically, everyone seems to have a little bit of

21   pause because of exactly the context of your, of your

22   comment, of your question.            But there is only one

23   lawsuit, complaint, whatever you wish to call it, which

24   we are dealing with, and that is the one that seeks

25   post-conviction relief in Florida.                   If you're

 1   unsuccessful there, you go to the Florida Supreme Court

 2   and that same application is what we come to this Court

 3   on.   There is nothing else out there.                  The state seems

 4   to tell us, or suggest to us that it's some kind of an

 5   independent state -- uh, Federal action.

 6               JUSTICE ALITO:          It's a Federal writ, isn't

 7   it?   It's an application for a Federal writ.                  It's not

 8   an appeal in state criminal -- state case.

 9               MS. BONNER:        But it comes under this Court's

10   appellate jurisdiction versus its original jurisdiction

11   for writs of certiorari.

12               JUSTICE SOUTER:            If you succeed you're going

13   to get an order from this Court to the state court say,

14   saying, go back in this state proceeding that has been

15   begun, and do it right.        So the focus of it is still the

16   state proceeding even though we may correct it under

17   appellate jurisdiction.

18               MS. BONNER:        Yes, sir.           The state brings

19   forward an argument that this certiorari before this

20   Court is not a part of, not an integral part of and in

21   fact not any part of the state process.                  I believe they

22   come to that conclusion because they insert what they

23   wish the statute said, rather than what the statute

24   actually says, and we are attempting as best we can to

25   interpret what Congress did not, what you wish it did.

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Do you have any, I

 2   suppose this, we ought to know better, but how long the

 3   average disposition time is for a petition for

 4   certiorari in a case like this?

 5              MS. BONNER:         I believe it's like 44 days if

 6   you don't --

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  No.   From the time

 8   of, I suppose the pertinent question would be from the

 9   time of final state, final state judgment, eventual

10   filing for petition for cert, opposition, waiver, our

11   disposition?   Presumably, probably five or six months?

12              MS. BONNER:         It's not usually that long.

13   This Court is very efficient with that.                  And that's one

14   of the points --

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, why don't you

16   take, let's just if say you take 90 days, and you get --

17              MS. BONNER:         You get 42 or so.

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  And you get a two

19   month extension.

20              MS. BONNER:         Yes.

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Then you get another

22   month for the opposition depending on what circuit

23   you're from for the extension.              Get another month for

24   the opposition, at least two months, month and a half,

25   for us to dispose of it.         It probably comes out to about

 1   six months.

 2                 MS. BONNER:        It could, Your Honor.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Now I guess -- my

 4   question is, in a law that imposed a one-year statute of

 5   limitation, is this an implicit additional, I realize

 6   it's a question begging to some extent, but implicitly

 7   an additional six-month period would strike me as odd.

 8                 MS. BONNER:        Well, Your Honor, it is not a

 9   one-year statute of limitations per se.                       That may be

10   what looks good on paper with the writing of the statute

11   and the expressing of the statute to the public, that

12   one year is what's going to happen.                       But when one takes

13   into account the exhaustion requirement and takes that

14   time out, we are still not talking about a 365-day

15   process.

16                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Let me ask on that,

17   Ms. Bonner, what typically in Florida is the time

18   elapsed between the conclusion of the criminal

19   proceeding and the conclusion of the state collateral

20   relief?

21                 MS. BONNER:        It's quite a while.               Your

22   Honor.     I wouldn't know the average.

23                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            But it's more than six

24   months, I assume.

25                 MS. BONNER:        It's a long time, Your Honor.

 1   And --

 2               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Two, three, four, five

 3   years.

 4               MS. BONNER:        Yes, sir.

 5               JUSTICE STEVENS:            And all that time, the

 6   statute has been tolled?

 7               MS. BONNER:        Exactly, till it's -- that's

 8   why I don't look at exactly --

 9               JUSTICE STEVENS:            The question is whether

10   there may be another six months added on to that five or

11   six-year period.

12               MS. BONNER:        Yes, sir.           And one of the

13   important things here is --

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, the reason

15   that's tolled is because it's designed to encourage the

16   exhaustion of the state procedures.                     This additional

17   period is when it's pending, not before the state but

18   before a Federal court.

19               MS. BONNER:        But it's the state petition

20   which is pending for your review.                And one of the things

21   I want to point out is that the 90 days, when they

22   passed habeas reform, they were not speaking about 30

23   days, 20 days, 60 days, 90 days or even the six months

24   that Your Honor posits.        It was 10 years, 12 years, 14

25   years.   And that was I think the major impetus to


                                       20

 1   encourage the Congress to put the 365 day on there.

 2              This Court has complete control over the

 3   certiorari process.     You know, being lawyers we always

 4   do file at the last minute, but of course it's this

 5   Court's rules which gives us the 90 days versus another

 6   period of time.   It is, the petition for certiorari is

 7   not like a notice of appeal, because it's not just a

 8   one-page document that's laid out in the Federal

 9   statutes for us to do.       It's an application to, it's an

10   application for review and it is, it takes some time to

11   fashion.

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Any -- any

13   statistics on how many petitions for cert from state

14   post-conviction collateral review are granted?                  In other

15   words, if we are talking about an additional six months

16   in every case, how many of those are actually granted?

17              MS. BONNER:         I don't know how many are

18   granted, Your Honor, but one thing that struck me as I

19   was reading through these cases is that many are granted

20   to the state.   And of course, when the state goes to

21   certiorari from post-conviction, from a post-conviction

22   loss on its side, then the whole process is turned on

23   its head, and many, many times this Court has granted

24   certiorari to the state.         And that is another problem

25   that happens with this tolling if you read pending the


                                       21

 1   way the state wants you to read pending, because what do

 2   we do then?    What do people do?

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, but if the state

 4   is petitioning for cert it means you've won.

 5                 MS. BONNER:       It means you've won.

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So presumably you're

 7   not looking forward to further --

 8                 MS. BONNER:       No.      But what happens to the

 9   time?   How do you count that time if you lose here?

10                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I suppose you'd have to

11   file a protective petition with the district court

12   saying we won but we might still lose.

13                 MS. BONNER:       I guess.          And - you know, a

14   protective -- to litigants, protective and to district

15   court judges, I believe and state court judges,

16   protective petitions are kind of anathema, because since

17   you don't know what you're going to raise -- and in the

18   2254 you have more of an idea, certainly, because you're

19   limited in many instances if not all instances to those

20   things which were exhausted -- but obviously there are

21   new claims that are brought up because there would not

22   be a stay and abey.      There would not even be a request

23   for stay and abey if there were things that the Federal

24   courts find.

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Assuming you make

 1   the same argument you make on questions 2 and 3 about

 2   the availability of equitable tolling.

 3                 MS. BONNER:       I'm sorry.               I didn't --

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I would be very

 5   surprised if the court found you were out of time

 6   because the state had filed a petition for certiorari.

 7                 MS. BONNER:       I'd be surprised --

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And have it granted.

 9                 MS. BONNER:       I'd be surprised too, but I've

10   practiced a long time and I've seen some very odd things

11   happen in courts and, both a stay and abey, and the

12   other procedures that have been discussed by this Court

13   have not been handed down as mandates to the lower court

14   to require the lower court to rule in a certain way, or

15   to absolutely stay, or to entertain protective motions

16   and then permit those protective motions to be

17   supplemented at a time later.              If Your Honors do not

18   mind, I will reserve some time.

 5   extend to the post-conviction certiorari process.

 6   Additionally, ignorance of settled law whether by an

 7   incarcerated pro se petitioner, by private counsel, or

 8   by appointed counsel is not an extraordinary

 9   circumstance and does not excuse prompt filing.

10                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Kise, can I ask you

11   what your view in this matter would be if the Court

12   grants certiorari, would the application be pending

13   during the period that the case is under advisement in

14   this Court?

15                 MR. KISE:      No, Your Honor.              And I'm assuming

16   your question is asking me, grant certiorari based on an

17   application filed by the petitioner.

18                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Either way.

19                 MR. KISE:      Well, in both circumstances the

20   answer would be no, and in both circumstances I think

21   the relief that would be accorded --

22                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Let me ask a second

23   question.     Suppose it were reversed, we send it back for

24   further proceedings in the state trial court, would you

25   say that it's still not pending during the further

 1   proceedings?

 2              MR. KISE:       It may be pending in state court

 3   during the further proceedings, but it's not pending

 4   during the time that it is at this Court, because this

 5   Court has not --

 6              JUSTICE STEVENS:             So it started pending

 7   again after an interruption, is that the way it would

 8   be?

 9              MR. KISE:       Based on equitable principles, I

10   think that would be the interpretation, yes, Your Honor.

11              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Forget about equitable

12   principles, statutory principles.                Is there a lack of

13   continuity, where you could have it pending for a period

14   of a couple years and then an interruption, and then it

15   can resume pending after the interruption?

16              MR. KISE:       You're using the phraseology

17   interruption, and I would, would --

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Well, period when it's not

19   pending followed by a period when it begins to pend.

20              MR. KISE:       In that unusual circumstance,

21   Your Honor, I think principles of equitable tolling

22   would apply to keep the petitioner's ability to file.

23              JUSTICE STEVENS:             But there would be no

24   statutory right in your view, it would depend on the

25   equitable considerations?

 1              MR. KISE:         I believe that's correct, Your

 2   Honor, because statutory pending contemplates a

 3   finality, it contemplates -- and I think that this is,

 4   it is one of the fundamental problems, I believe, with

 5   petitioner's construction, is this ignoring of not only

 6   the plain language of the statute but what this Court

 7   has said about this statute, about 2244(d)(2).                    In

 8   Duncan this Court said that state, the word state

 9   modifies both post-conviction and other collateral

10   review, and established that we are talking about a

11   state application.

12              JUSTICE SOUTER:               But it doesn't say state

13   pending or pending in state court, and                    what I want to

14   do is go back and ask a question somewhat along the

15   lines that Justice Stevens asked.                  Is the application

16   pending in the period between the disposition of the

17   petition by the state trial court and the determination

18   by the petitioner whether or not to go forward for state

19   appellate relief?

20              MR. KISE:         Yes, Your Honor, I believe it is,

21   and I believe that's what this Court said --

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:               By the same token, why

23   isn't it pending between the final disposition by the

24   state appellate court and the determination to seek cert

25   here?

 1                 MR. KISE:     Well, I have two answers to that,

 2   Your Honor.    First would be, that's inconsistent with

 3   the language utilized by this Court in Carey where the

 4   Court defined pending as until final resolution through

 5   the state's post-conviction --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:           That was the issue in that

 7   case.    This issue wasn't in that case.

 8                 MR. KISE:     Correct, Your Honor, but the

 9   language utilized nevertheless --

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I can't when I write

11   something, I don't think I or anyone else can, if it

12   happens to be a state case, refrain from using the word

13   state.   I wouldn't say there is an implication in

14   writing an opinion that it doesn't mean Federal as well.

15   As least I can't find that written in the opinion

16   anywhere.

17                 MR. KISE:     Fair enough, Your Honor.           Then

18   with respect to the second part of my answer to your

19   question, Justice Souter, that it cannot be both final

20   for 1257 purposes and pending --

21                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           But why isn't your sister's

22   answer to that adequate?          It is the state judgment that

23   is final, but action on the petition is not yet final

24   until it has gone through the period allowed for final

25   review by this Court.

 1               MR. KISE:       I would, I would respectfully

 2   disagree with that, with that nondistinction, if you

 3   will, Your Honor, in the sense that the application --

 4               JUSTICE SOUTER:             So you're distinguishing

 5   between a state judgment and an application upon which

 6   further, further proceedings can be had.                 Why is that a

 7   nondistinction?

 8               MR. KISE:       Because I would, I would disagree

 9   with the notion that further proceedings could be had on

10   that application.    The basis for this Court's certiorari

11   of jurisdiction is that it is subject to no further

12   review or correction in any state.

13               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Let's assume that the, the

14   petition for cert is granted and this Court grants

15   relief.   The relief as I understand it is going to

16   consist of a remand to the state court saying you did

17   something wrong on this application before, go back and

18   do it over again and do it right.                 It's the -- it is the

19   state application which is going to be the subject of it

20   and that therefore, it is the state application that

21   necessarily is the subject of the cert petition.

22               MR. KISE:       I would say, Your Honor, that the

23   state application may be the subject matter of what you

24   are looking at from a subject matter standpoint, but

25   what the Court is ruling on is the petition for


                                        28
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   certiorari, which was a Federal court ruling on --

 2              JUSTICE SOUTER:             It's a petition for

 3   certiorari to review action taken on a state petition,

 4   just as at the state level, whatever may be the, the

 5   nomenclature for filing an appeal from the state trial

 6   court to the state appellate court, is an application

 7   which relates entirely to the original application for

 8   relief that was filed in the state trial court.                 It

 9   seems to me the two situations are exactly parallel.

10              MR. KISE:       And I would respectfully

11   disagree, Your Honor, because I don't see how it can be

12   final for 1257 purposes and still pending for purposes

13   of the statute.

14              JUSTICE GINSBERG:              But that -- that --

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  It's the application

16   that is not subject to review.              We review the state

17   court judgment, not the state application, correct?

18              MR. KISE:       In this case, Your Honor, the

19   application is the state court.              I mean, the judgment is

20   what is being reviewed, and it is a final judgment in

21   the application.   The Florida Supreme Court in this case

22   has no power at all once they have issued the mandate to

23   go back and modify, to correct it six months later.                  If

24   the Florida Supreme Court decided, you know, we made a

25   mistake in that application, they don't have the power

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   sua sponte to correct it.          It is final.          It is over.

 2   The state's province has been completed.

 3              JUSTICE STEVENS:             But they would correct it

 4   if we told them to.

 5              MR. KISE:       In that circumstance, yes, Your

 6   Honor, certainly they would in a circumstance, in the

 7   very unusual circumstance where this Court were to

 8   accept certiorari and then subsequent to the acceptance

 9   of certiorari, then reverse the ruling.

10              JUSTICE STEVENS:             And when it got back in

11   the state supreme court, they would still be working on

12   the application that had been pending until the end of

13   the proceedings down there, and then suddenly came back

14   to life after we sent it back.

15              MR. PECK:       Yes, Your Honor, but that is,

16   again, the extraordinary circumstance.                  And that I think

17   points out the, one of the flaws in petitioner's

18   argument, and that is that that's making the exception

19   the rule, that clearly Congress did not intend to add

20   what I believe Chief Justice Roberts alluded to earlier,

21   an extra three months, an extra six months.

22              JUSTICE SCALIA:             I think what you're saying,

23   though, is when you have ambiguous language, a sensible

24   rule is not a rule, it has to have a lot of exceptions

25   to make sense.   Surely that's a sound principle, isn't

 1   it?

 2                 MR. KISE:     Yes, Your Honor.             And I don't

 3   think that this would be a lot of exceptions.                  I think

 4   this would be, the only exception would be, to the rule

 5   that we are advocating would be in the unusual

 6   circumstance, the one in 5,000 cases, the one in 1,000

 7   cases, the exceptional case where this Court actually

 8   grants certiorari, those cases are exceptional in and of

 9   themselves.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Those are the most likely

11   where people are going to get mixed up.                  I mean, I'm not

12   following -- I think I think this argument about the

13   word is metaphysical, you know, and I can make wonderful

14   arguments, and you have made wonderful arguments on both

15   sides of this.    I just can't get a clear answer.               So if

16   I were right about that and there is no clear answer

17   from the language, then the thing, I'd like to go back

18   to Justice Stevens' question, because it seems to me

19   that that puts my greatest concern, my greatest concerns

20   are practical.    If we take your position, we have words

21   right next to each other, near each other in the same

22   statutory provision, meaning different things.                  And I've

23   learned out of my own experience perhaps, judges and

24   lawyers are not always geniuses and they get mixed up.

25   And they will get mixed up all the time, and when they


                                        31
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   get mixed up, people will lose rights that they have.

 2               The second concern of Justice Stevens, which

 3   is what happens in the case, and those are the ones who

 4   intuitively are going to cause the problem.                    Because on

 5   a rare occasion, the state or the prisoner has a very

 6   good Supreme Court case.         And that's going to be the

 7   case where he forgets to file in the Federal court

 8   because he thinks this thing isn't over, and lo and

 9   behold, the Court grants it.            And now what happens?           On

10   your interpretation, I just see a mess, and on the other

11   interpretation, it seems to work out fine.                    So those, I

12   would say are the two practical problems, and anything

13   you would like to say about that, I'd like to listen to.

14               MR. KISE:      Thank you, Justice Breyer, and I

15   would respectfully answer your question I think in three

16   ways.   First, drawing a distinction between when the

17   state petitions for certiorari and when the habeas

18   petitioner petitions for certiorari.                    Under both

19   circumstances, equitable principles would apply, but

20   they would apply in I think different ways.                    But in

21   either circumstance, the ability of the petitioner to

22   subsequently seek habeas review would be protected.                     And

23   so what we are advocating is not making those

24   exceptional cases the rule.            In a case where the state

25   petitions for certiorari there isn't an ability, there


                                       32
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   is no way to even file a protective habeas because there

 2   is nothing to file.       You've won, the habeas petitioner

 3   has won in the court below.              There is no cause of

 4   action.   There isn't a basis upon which to file a

 5   Federal habeas claim, so even a protective one would be,

 6   it wouldn't be premature, it would be effectively

 7   nonexistent.     So from an equitable standpoint, the

 8   extraordinary circumstance which the courts have

 9   recognized, the circuits have recognized that the test

10   for equitable circumstance is, the extraordinary

11   circumstance would be this Court accepting certiorari.

12               And then the exercise of diligence on the

13   part of the petitioner is if the petitioner did

14   everything he or she could under that circumstance,

15   because there would be no way for that petitioner to

16   file for a Federal habeas review because there would be

17   no basis for it.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Can I ask -- it seems very

19   strange to me.     I can understand protective filings when

20   you've lost, but it seems to me a very strange

21   protective filing.      When you've won in state court and

22   the government has taken certiorari, can you file, file

23   in Federal district court?            What do you say?    What are

24   you complaining about?

25               MR. KISE:        Exactly my point, Your Honor.

 1   You cannot.

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            No.     It's their point.       I

 3   don't see how it's your point.                 How can you cover

 4   yourself?     I mean, if we come out your way, how -- how

 5   --

 6                 MR. KISE:      There isn't a need to cover us

 7   up, Your Honor, because you've won in state court.

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Provided equitable --

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You're worried about

10   winning in the Supreme Court.

11                 MR. KISE:      In the one in 1,000 or one in

12   5,000 cases, equitable principles would then apply.                      The

13   distinction may not be clear between statutory tolling,

14   what the statute actually provides for, and equitable

15   tolling, equitable principles that have been applied by

16   the court.

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But you're asking us to

18   say that the Congress has written a statute which

19   doesn't take account that the state might sometimes file

20   a petition for certiorari that would be granted.                   And

21   you say oh, that's so rare, that's so extraordinary.                     It

22   happens.     It's part of the system.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Would you advise a client

24   that way?    Would you advise a client that way?

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           You've won here and the

 2   state is taking certiorari to the Supreme Court.                  Don't

 3   worry about making a protective filing in the district

 4   court because, you know, if by chance the Supreme Court

 5   reverses, equitable tolling will apply.                  You know, you

 6   roll the dice with equity.

 7                 MR. KISE:     I don't think there would be -- I

 8   think it would be ill advised to, to direct a petitioner

 9   to file in Federal court under those circumstances

10   because there would be nothing to file.                  What would be

11   the complaint?

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I agree.

13                 MR. KISE:     There would be absolutely nothing

14   to file.

15                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           The irony of your position

16   is that it has those harshest consequences in those rare

17   cases where there was a denial of constitutional right.

18                 MR. KISE:     Your Honor, I would respectfully

19   disagree that it has its harshest consequences, because

20   that's where the equitable tolling principles would in

21   fact apply.

22                 JUSTICE GINSBERG:            Why do you need equitable

24   to use the model when -- for the time clock on direct

25   appeal, say there has been a conviction affirmed by the

 1   highest court of the state, when does the time, when

 2   does that judgment -- it's a final judgment if you seek

 3   cert, right?    But the time clock, the one year doesn't

 4   begin to run until after the 90 days has elapsed; isn't

 5   that right?

 6                 MR. KISE:     Yes, Your Honor.

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So why shouldn't it be

 8   the same way for collateral review as it is for direct

 9   review?   Direct review, everyone agrees that you get the

10   state final judgment.       But then you have 90 days and

11   nothing starts until that 90 days is up or, if cert is

12   granted, until the cert process is done.                    Why shouldn't

13   it be just the same for collateral review?

14                 MR. KISE:     I would say it's different, Your

15   Honor, respectfully, for two reasons:                    One, because this

16   Court has said that direct review is different in

17   numerous cases.    And two, because the statute makes that

18   distinction.    Congress in (d)(1)(A) utilized that very

19   specific language that included the, the certiorari

20   period and in (d)(2) did not use that language, and it

21   is the absence of that language that indicates that

22   tolling is only to apply while a petitioner is

23   exhausting relief, state relief.

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well that means, that

25   means that if a petitioner who has had his state

 1   application for collateral relief denied wants to

 2   petition this Court, but doesn't want to lose out on the

 3   possibility of seeking Federal habeas, that prisoner has

 4   to do two things at the same time:                One, prepare a

 5   petition for cert; and the other is to prepare, prepare

 6   a complaint to file in a Federal district court.                   That's

 7   a lot to put on a person, particularly the one who isn't

 8   represented.

 9              MR. KISE:      Well, Your Honor, I would say

10   that in many circumstances that would be the case, but

11   not always the case.     It depends on how much time is

12   left on the Federal statute of limitations, how much

13   time is remaining, how long did it take to get through

14   the state post-conviction process.                How timely was the

15   filing in the state post conviction process.                And how

16   much time is remaining, assuming for what was

17   discussed --

18              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Here there were 31 days,

19   right?

20              MR. KISE:      Then they would need to file --

21   yes, Your Honor, and they would need to --

22              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             They'd have to file a

23   Federal court complaint and a cert petition within the

24   31 days.

25              MR. KISE:      Yes, Your Honor.             Yes, Your


                                      37

 1   Honor, because the amount of time that would elapse

 2   before this Court were to rule on the cert petition

 3   would consume that 31 days.             And I don't think that's

 4   inconsistent with what Congress intended here because

 5   what Congress intended by this provision was to provide

 6   petitioner -- well, what this Court said in Duncan, what

 7   this Court has recognized, is that the scheme that has

 8   been put together here by Congress is one which

 9   encourages petitioners first to file and exhaust their

10   state remedies, recognizing and giving deference to the

11   principles of comity, and then second to file, once

12   they're done with their state process, once they've

13   completed the state process and exhausted their state

14   remedies, to file their Federal habeas, in the words of

15   this Court in Duncan, "as soon as possible."

16                 And the anomaly that would be created by

17   petitioner's construction would be it would be the only

18   time under all of AEDPA where a petitioner could file in

19   Federal district court but isn't required to file.                  And

20   so I would submit to this Court that it cannot be both

21   exhausted and pending at the same time.                  It would not

22   fit within the scheme that this Court has already

23   determined the structure of (d)(2) is designed to

24   accomplish.

25                 The principle is that you are to, as a

 1   habeas petitioner, go quickly to state court, and we're

 2   going to give state courts the first opportunity at

 3   these Federal constitutional questions.                     And yes,

 4   Justice Stevens, it may take some time.                   It may take

 5   several years in Federal -- in state court, before they

 6   accomplish that purpose.           But that's the state's issue

 7   because it's the state's judgment and the state is

 8   taking its time and it shouldn't be -- and this is what

 9   Congress recognized I think in (d)(2) -- that, that,

10   that the petitioner should not be penalized for that

11   time.    That's why it was tolled.

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is it, is it clear that he

13   can go to district -- I mean, I'm not familiar with how

14   these things work.      Is it possible that when there is an

15   appeal or certiorari pending here there can be

16   proceeding in district court a habeas action on the

17   same, on the same matter that we are considering on

18   certiorari?

19                 MR. KISE:      Yes, Your Honor, I believe there

20   can.    I believe, there is, in fact --

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            District courts do that?       I

22   mean, they would be considering the same, the same

23   issues we are, I suppose?

24                 MR. KISE:      Well, I don't know that they

25   would be considering the exact same issues, Your Honor.

 1   And there are many things that can be done -- petitioner

 2   --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           You're sure that happens,

 4   that while cert is pending here there is a habeas

 5   proceeding ongoing in district court?

 6                 MR. KISE:     Well, I certainly hope that in

 7   the 10 of the 11 circuits that have agreed with

 8   Florida's position here that that is happening, because

 9   if not then they are at risk, depending on how --

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Wouldn't a district judge

11   who knows that there's a cert petition pending just say:

12   Well, I'll wait; this petition will be held pending the

13   Supreme Court's disposition of cert.

14                 MR. KISE:     I would respectfully say to Your

15   Honor that it's not an automatic stay.                     I mean, perhaps

16   there would be a stay at some point.                     But there are

17   things that can be accomplished in Federal court before

18   the undertaking of the review.               There is the Rule 4

19   screening process in habeas.             There is the initial

20   review by the district court to see if the filing itself

21   meets the procedural requirements.                  There is the asking

22   for an answer by the state.             There is discovery that can

23   take place.

24                 All of this can take place while the cert

25   petition is pending before the Federal district


                                        40

 1   undertakes any review of the merits.                      Now, if there gets

 2   to be this juxtaposition where it looks like there is

 3   going to be a conflict between the Federal district's

 4   court's review of the substantive merits and that is

 5   going to conflict with this Court's certiorari review,

 6   well, then I think a stay would be implemented.

 7                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, I'll accept your

 8   view as being the personal experience.                      I'm rather

 9   surprised that district courts would go through all of

10   these preliminary steps when the case is on cert and

11   they may not have to.

12                 MR. KISE:     Well, they may not have to --

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           I'm not sure if I would

14   tell the district courts that's what they ought to do,

15   is a wise expenditure of resources.                      I'll think about

16   that.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, I mean, it sort of

18   depends on how often cert is going to be granted,

19   doesn't it?    If you're a district court and you have

20   hundreds of these habeas petitions being filed, you can

21   either hold of them whenever a cert petition is filed,

22   one in one thousand or whatever the number is, because

23   they might be granted.        I think you'd probably take your

24   chances depending on the petition.                  If it looks serious

25   and there's a petition pending you don't have to

 1   proceed.    If it's frivolous perhaps you can proceed.

 2                 MR. KISE:     I think that's exactly right,

 3   Your Honor.    I think that's really the point, and you've

 4   obviously articulated it better than I did in my

 5   previous answer.    But that's exactly right, that --

 6                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           But isn't it true the real

 7   problem with the capital cases?               The state's interest in

 8   getting things moving is the strongest in the capital

 9   cases, I think.

10                 MR. KISE:     Absolutely, Your Honor.

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           In the non-capital cases

12   there is an interest in promptness, but the longer the

13   guy stays in jail is not going to prejudice the state.

14   But you do want to get your death cases terminated as

15   soon as you can.    And what we're really talking about as

16   I understand it is whether in most death cases we'll add

17   on a period of six, eight, nine months to the total

18   period.    And in most of those death cases, which is a

19   limited number -- I don't know, you have a couple

20   hundred people I suppose in death row -- in those cases

21   it's going to be seven, eight, nine years anyway.

22                 MR. KISE:     Well, it may be that long.         It

23   may be a shorter period.          But I think what we need to

24   look at is not what we would think would be the

25   preferred time frame, but what Congress said was the


                                        42
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   preferred time frame.        And Congress is saying that it's

 2   one year, and the only time it's tolled is when the

 3   petitioner is doing what it should be doing to exhaust

 4   state remedies.     That's again what this Court said in

 5   Duncan about describing this entire structure.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:            That's if you're formally

 7   right on the metaphysical question.                       But if you're not,

 8   now thinking you just gave a response to the Chief

 9   Justice that said, well, really the Federal district

10   judge when he gets these things just has to look at them

11   and then he figures out whether he is going to stay it

12   or whether he's going to proceed on some issues or

13   whether he is going to do something else.

14                 And that's what you thought was fairly easy.

15   You have the experience there and I just wonder how easy

16   it is.     I mean, why wouldn't it be easy?                   Because I

17   guess before doing anything the judge has to know what

18   this thing is about.        And that's where it seems to me to

19   take the time of a district judge.                   They have many, many

20   petitions.     Sometimes they are well organized, sometimes

21   not.     He sends them to a magistrate possibly.                   The

22   magistrate has a lot to do, and the time consumed is the

23   time finding out what is this case about.                      Is that fair

24   characterization or not?           How easy is it?

25                 MR. KISE:      I think it's partly fair, Your


                                         43

 1   Honor.   What I would say is the time -- certain time is

 2   consumed just determining whether or not under the Rule

 3   4 screening process, whether or not the petition meets

 4   the formal requirements, whether they've articulated the

 5   claim in the correct way and whether it's worthy of the

 6   state response, if there's discovery that needs to be

 7   had.

 8               I mean, all of these things can be taking

 9   place and in the one in one thousand or perhaps more

10   than that -- and I don't pretend to have the exact

11   number or the statistics -- but in the very, very usual

12   circumstance where cert is actually granted, I think

13   then a stay could be put in place.                 And I don't think

14   it's fair to say, respectfully, that Congress intended

15   to forestall this entire process while this Court

16   undertakes certiorari review.

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Kise, there are two

18   applications.   Your answer to the petitioner is you have

19   to file in the Federal court within that 31 days.                 If a

20   prisoner says, I can't manage a cert petition and a

21   Federal habeas corpus, it's hard enough for me to get

22   any assistance, so I'll have to pick one or the other,

23   isn't the, the reading of an ambiguous statute that

24   you're proposing going to be an incentive or a

25   disincentive to filing both, which the prisoner has a


                                       44
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   right to do?   He is going to have to pick one or the

 2   other if he is in this timeline.

 3              MR. KISE:       Well, respectfully, Your Honor --

 4   and I know that that is the petitioner's argument and I

 5   see that you have given me that question, but I don't

 6   know that it is that much of a choice.                  I mean, I think

 7   that they can file, they can file both in those

 8   circumstances and, and depending on the particular

 9   circumstances -- and this is back to the equitable

10   tolling principles -- for statutory tolling purposes, I

11   think the answer is they must file both or they forfeit

12   the right to one or the other.              If they choose not to

13   file for cert, then they voluntarily if they pass the 90

14   days forfeited that right; and if they don't file within

15   the statutory period then they have under AEDPA missed

16   the statute of limitations deadline.

17              But I would, I submit to you that it is

18   possible to do both, and in circumstances where there is

19   some impediment to them doing just that, if they

20   exercise diligence, if they are doing everything they

21   possibly can and it is not possible to file both at the

22   same time, well, then I think under the facts of the

23   proper scenario that equitable principles might apply.

24   But again, to say that Congress built into the system

25   this automatic time period that's going to be tacked on


                                       45
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   to a very short one-year statute of limitations, a

 2   statute of limitations that is designed to really move

 3   things through the system rapidly, is, respectfully, I

 4   don't think the correct interpretation of the language,

 5   and I don't think it is consistent with what this Court

 6   said in Duncan or, with respect to Justice Breyer, what

 7   this Court said in Carey.

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Let me be clear on your

 9   answer to Justice Stevens' earlier question.                Where

10   there is a reversal of the state judgment by, by this

11   Court, and the case is remanded to the state, you don't

12   argue that what occurs then is equitable tolling?                But

13   you say that the case is again pending once it goes back

14   to the state, is that right?

15              MR. KISE:      I think once it's back in the

16   state system then it would have to be considered

17   pending, because the statute contemplates that while

18   it's part of the state process it would be pending.

19              If the Court has no further questions, thank

20   you.

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, Mr. Kise.

 1                I've heard the state over these many years

 2   say that a simple exception will help the defendant and

 3   don't worry, we will not proceed, we'll ask for -- don't

 4   worry, we won't object.        Kind of what we're getting here

 5   is, we won't be objecting to a stay if there is a stay

 6   requested.   However, they objected to the stay here that

 7   the United States district court entered.                    In an

 8   exercise of honesty, he said:             I'm going to wait for the

 9   Supreme Court to decide what happens in Artuz, whether

10   they accept cert or not.         And they vigorously.

11                Objected and utilized a good little built of

12   time litigating it on an interlocutory type appeal.

13                One of the practical problems is if this

14   case is in both courts, this one and the United States

15   district court, where is the record?                    Is -- It's just

16   the most practical of things.             And also, where is the

17   lawyer, who is the lawyer?

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Records don't have

19   to -- typically are not filed with the petition for

20   cert.   So the record would be back in the lower court.

21                MS. BONNER:       So that solves that.              The --

22                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Just to be clear, it

23   is your position that to get -- you think everyone's

24   entitled to the additional 90 days whether they file or

25   not.

 1                MS. BONNER:       Yes, I do.

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                To get the

 3   additional time for an opposition that would be

 4   considered here, you have to file the petition for cert.

 5   In other words, if you don't file after the 90th day

 6   it's no longer pending.

 7                MS. BONNER:       Absolutely.

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Okay.   So then why

 9   wouldn't the result of your position be that every

10   person who is denied state post-conviction relief is

11   going to file a cert position to get the additional

12   time?

13                MS. BONNER:       Why is my position that they

14   would not?

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Wouldn't that lead

16   to that result?   If Congress was concerned that people

17   were stringing out the time before they seek habeas, one

18   way to string it out under your reading, but not under

19   the state's reading, would be to file a petition for

20   cert.

21                MS. BONNER:       Well, Congress couldn't have

22   been too concerned about that 90 days because it

23   certainly permitted the trigger to have the 90 days

24   included within it, and this Court has allowed the 90

25   days --

 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm sorry.   What's

 2   the trigger?

 3                MS. BONNER:       A, 2242(b)(A).

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Yes.   When they

 5   wanted to include the 90 days, they said the expiration

 6   of the time for seeking review.              They did not say that

 7   in (d)(2).

 8                MS. BONNER:       They did not say that, but they

 9   said while the application is pending.                  And the state

10   did not address for this Court what is pending here if

11   it's not that application from state court.

12                JUSTICE ALITO:         Does your argument --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I guess you could also say

14   that except in capital cases the defendant will not have

15   an incentive to delay.       He wants to get out, right?

16                MS. BONNER:       Of course, of course.            And you

17   know, frankly, I think all of the defendants on death

18   row --

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I mean, if the

20   defendant had no incentive to delay, why did Congress

21   think it necessary to impose the statue of limitations?

22   They did that because they thought people were stringing

23   out their -- and they were applying for Federal habeas

24   after too long of a delay.

25                MS. BONNER:       Well strangely enough in this

 1   case I was looking at statistics as to the average

 2   length of time that a case was pending before, between

 3   conviction and the filing of the 2254, and

 4   Mr. Lawrence's petition was filed within days of what

 5   the average was before the AEDPA.                That comes up in a

 6   statistical analysis I believe by the Department of

 7   Justice cited to by the state.

 8              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Doesn't the title of a

 9   statute indicate the category of cases that Congress was

10   primarily interested in?

11              MS. BONNER:         Oh yes.

12              JUSTICE STEVENS:             The death penalty.

13              MS. BONNER:         Oh yes.         When they joined

14   together in anti-terrorism, effective -- the -- just the

15   word effective was plenty to convey to us what they

16   actually mean.   The other big problem that's not been

17   addressed is these people in a practical sense do not

18   have the same lawyer for both proceedings.               Many people

19   who were more than willing to practice in state court

20   are not willing to practice in Federal court.               It's a

21   more formalized, rigorous endeavor.

22              And in this case what happened was

23   Mr. Lawrence had a lawyer who practiced in the state and

24   obviously must have prepared for him that initial place

25   holder, if you want to call it, 2254, because it's

 1   typewritten.   They cite to a Westlaw site.                 I don't

 2   think there is any way that anyone can contemplate that

 3   that would be Mr. Lawrence's doing in his own right.

 4                Also, whether it's 90 days or six months as

 5   Your Honor has said, it's always in the control of this

 6   Court.   Once the 90 -- this is not a frolic of

 7   unnumbered years.    When someone files a petition he

 8   either files it by the time 90 days is over or he is out

 9   of court, or he files it and this Court is quickly

10   reviewing it after some input from the other side.

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

12   Miss Bonner.

13                MS. BONNER:        Thank you.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 The case is
