 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    We'll hear argument

 6                   ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH

 7                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                  MR. BURSCH:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 9   and may it please the Court:

10                  This is a Sixth Circuit habeas appeal

11   involving AEDPA deference.

12                  Harrington v. Richter holds that a Federal

13   court may only overturn a State court conviction that is

14   such an erroneous misapplication of this Court's clearly

15   established precedent as to be beyond any possibility of

16   fair-minded disagreement.             That is, an extreme

17   malfunction.

18                  Here, a fair-minded jurist could conclude

19   that the Michigan Supreme Court's Carpenter decision was

20   neither indefensible nor unexpected when it simply

21   applied plain statutory language in accord with

22   well-established Michigan interpretive principles.

23                  Accordingly, the Michigan Court of Appeals

24   application of Carpenter was not error, and the Sixth

25   Circuit should be reversed.

 1                I'd like to begin with the statutory text.

 2   In 1975, the Michigan legislature passed a comprehensive

 3   mental capacity affirmative defense statute.                 In it, the

 4   defenses are defined for mental illness and mental

 5   retardation, but it says nothing about diminished

 6   capacity.   And that silence is crucial here, because in

 7   Michigan, for over 200 years, it has been a code

 8   jurisdiction, which means that if the statutes address a

 9   particular area of criminal law, only that statute

10   applies, and the Michigan courts are not allowed to

11   either add to or subtract from that statutory text.

12                So only the Michigan legislature had the

13   power to add a diminished capacity defense.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:              200 years -- 200 years?

15   Did you say that?

16                MR. BURSCH:          Yes.        Actually, even before

17   Michigan was a territory -- I'm -- before it was a State

18   in 1810, it passed a law that abolished common law

19   criminal principles when there was a statute that

20   addressed the -- the subject matter.

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:                There was some law in

22   effect in Michigan on this subject from the year 1973

23   till the year 2001.       There was no statute and there was

24   no ancient common law.          But what -- what was it?         If I

25   asked you the question, what was the law in Michigan on

                                         4

 1   diminished capacity from 1973 to 2001, what would you

 2   respond?

 3               MR. BURSCH:        It -- it changed one time.         In

 4   1973, there was a Michigan Court of Appeals decision

 5   that recognized as a matter of common law the diminished

 6   capacity defense, but that was set aside by the 1975

 7   statute which established all the comprehensive

 8   diminished capacity defenses available, and left out

 9   diminished capacity.

10               So in 1975, 1976, you know, 1978 -

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              How -- how was the

12   Michigan Court of Appeals construing the defense?               Did

13   it say -- it didn't say anything about the 1975 statute.

14               MR. BURSCH:        Well, what the Michigan Court

15   of Appeals did beginning in 1978 in the Mangiapane case

16   was to ask, is diminished capacity part of the statutory

17   code, and it never held expressly that it was.              What it

18   did in Mangiapane and in subsequent cases, it assumed

19   that the defense existed, but it never held that.               And

20   that dicta could not override the plain language of the

21   statute.

22               And, in fact, counsel on the other side has

23   not pointed to a single Michigan decision where a

24   conviction or an exoneration on acquittal, or even a

25   finding of ineffective assistance was ever based on the

                                      5

 1   diminished capacity defense.

 2                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Was the 1973 case that you

 3   mentioned based on a statute or was it based on

 4   allegedly a vacuum that the statutory structure allowed

 5   the court to fill?      I mean, is that the way the 1973

 6   case came about?     And was the 1973 case followed by

 7   other courts, or was it just an isolated precedent?

 8                  MR. BURSCH:        The 1973 case was a common law

 9   vacuum, Justice Kennedy, where the Michigan legislature

10   had not yet spoken about mental incapacity defenses, and

11   so it stood alone, as the court was able to do, as a

12   common law decision.        There were no other cases that

13   relied on it before the '75 statute was enacted.                           And

14   after that point, the Michigan appellate courts did not

15   look to the '72 decision as the source of the doctrine.

16   They assumed that if it existed, it must be somewhere

17   within the statute.

18                  And then in Carpenter, in 2001, the Michigan

19   Supreme Court, when finally the very first Michigan

20   court to look at the question explicitly says, well,

21   it's not in the statute, diminished capacity isn't

22   there.     We've got mental retardation, we've got mental

23   illness.     No diminished capacity.                     As the Michigan

24   judiciary, we lack the power to add the diminished

25   capacity defense.

 1                JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, we don't -- well, we

 2   don't really have to reach this issue in this case,

 3   according to your submission, but what would happen if a

 4   State -- an intermediate State appellate court said the

 5   law is such-and-such, and then a -- a person is tried in

 6   the interim, is tried and subsequently, the State

 7   supreme court says that intermediate State court

 8   decision was incorrect, that never was the law of this

 9   State; the law was exactly the opposite.

10                MR. BURSCH:        I think you would apply the

11   same principles to that hypothetical as you did in

12   Rogers.   And -- and in Rogers, you had a nearly 100-year

13   common law history of the year and a day rule in the

14   Tennessee Supreme Court that the defense was available

15   to use that term for nearly 100 years, and yet it didn't

16   violate due process in Rogers for the Tennessee Supreme

17   Court to abolish the rule because it was neither

18   indefensible nor unexpected.

19                Now, this case is much easier than Rogers or

20   your hypothetical for several reasons.                 First, as I

21   mentioned, it's a habeas case and so we've got the layer

22   of AEDPA deference that wasn't there.

23                Second, we're not talking about the

24   evolution of the common law like we were in Rogers.

25   We're talking about a statute and the statute meant what

                                       7

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   it said in '75, just like it did in '01, just like it

 2   does today.

 3                 And the last thing is that in the Rogers

 4   case even the Tennessee Supreme Court acknowledged there

 5   was a change.    And here the Michigan Supreme Court said

 6   there was no change because the statute said what it

 7   said in 1975 and that meant no diminished capacity.

 8                 JUSTICE ALITO:             Well, what I'm wondering is

 9   how we even get beyond the statement, the holding by a

10   State supreme court regarding the -- the law of the

11   State.    Don't we have to accept that as the -- as the

12   law of the State?     Isn't that what our decision in Fiore

13   says?    If the State supreme court says this is the law

14   and it's always been the law, then how can we

15   second-guess that?

16                 MR. BURSCH:         Justice Alito, I would think

17   about it in -- in two pieces.                 And the first piece is

18   can you second-guess the Michigan Supreme Court's

19   interpretation of the statute, and I think the answer

20   there everybody has to agree is no.                      The State's

21   interpretation of its own statute binds this Court,

22   binds all Federal courts, just like the South Carolina

23   Supreme Court decision in -- in Bouie did.

24                 With respect to the Michigan Supreme Court's

25   analysis of the retroactive effect, I agree that Fiore

                                         8

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   stands for that very proposition, and I think Indiana

 2   makes that case very forcefully in the -- the

 3   multi-State amici brief.         You don't have to reach that

 4   question here, however, because given the AEDPA standard

 5   and the fact that the Michigan Supreme Court decision

 6   was so clearly not a misapplication of Rogers and Bouie,

 7   it makes this a relatively easy case.                 But I think you'd

 8   be fully within your right to follow the Fiore holding.

 9               JUSTICE KAGAN:            You -- you suggested,

10   General, that the -- the fact that this is statutory

11   makes your position easier.

12               MR. BURSCH:        Yes.

13               JUSTICE KAGAN:            And I wonder if that's true.

14   I mean, you could see an -- an argument the exact other

15   way, which suggests that we all understand that common

16   law changes and evolves over time, but that it's rare

17   for a court to reverse a decision on what a statute

18   means, and that that's not foreseeable in the same way.

19   So -- now, especially if it were a single court saying

20   the statute means A today, and then tomorrow it comes

21   back and it says, no, it means B, whether that isn't

22   actually -- whether that wouldn't cut against your

23   position.

24               MR. BURSCH:        Justice Kagan, I think this is

25   the easiest case, because it's not just statutory

                                      9

                       Alderson Reporting Company

 1   interpretation; it's statutory interpretation of a

 2   statute that is just plain on its face.                  If you had an

 3   ambiguous statute, yes, then maybe there would be some

 4   more uncertainty.     But where you've got a statute that

 5   enumerates several defenses, does not include diminished

 6   capacity, and under Michigan law it's not enumerated,

 7   it's not there, and the courts can't add it, that does

 8   make this easier.

 9                 I think it was probably a -- a bigger

10   challenge in Rogers, for example, to acknowledge that,

11   one, Tennessee law had changed right out from underneath

12   the defendant; and yet, even given that change, this

13   Court was comfortable that it was not indefensible or

14   unexpected.    I think when -

15                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Counsel, what about the

16   Michigan Court of Appeals?               There's only one court of

17   appeals, right?

18                 MR. BURSCH:         Correct, Justice Ginsburg.

19                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:               And so that court several

20   times recognized diminished capacity as a defense.

21                 MR. BURSCH:         Well, it -- it didn't recognize

22   it as a defense in the sense that it analyzed the

23   statute and said yes, the defense is available.                  It in

24   many instances assumed that it might exist and if it did

25   then this is the result.            The closest it comes is this

                                        10

 1   Mangiapane decision in 1978, and the court says very

 2   specifically there that the definition of mental illness

 3   in the statute, it's similar to diminished capacity, but

 4   the court says at page 247 of the North West Second

 5   Report the court was not prepared to say they are

 6   identical.

 7                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              The -

 8                  MR. BURSCH:        So -

 9                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Your colleague said that

10   there were 130 appellate decisions -- I take it that's

11   the court of appeals decisions -- recognizing diminished

12   capacity as a defense.

13                  MR. BURSCH:        Recognizing it as a possible

14   defense.     Again, in every single one of those cases, all

15   of which would be contrary to the statutory language,

16   incidentally, in not a single one of them did a

17   conviction or an acquittal or a finding of ineffective

18   assistance ever turn on that point.                      And so in that

19   sense, it's also again very much like Rogers, where this

20   Court said that the year and a day rule had never been

21   used for an acquittal or a conviction in any Tennessee

22   case.

23                  And so the question is, again through the

24   AEDPA deference lens, which is very high, was the

25   Carpenter decision defensible and expected?                      And we

                                        11

 1   would submit that any time that a State supreme court

 2   applies the plain language of the statute in accord with

 3   established principles of interpretation in that State,

 4   it could almost never be indefensible or unexpected.

 5               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               This -- that seems a

 6   little strange for the following reason, just as I think

 7   this case presents an example.               You're claiming it's

 8   clear because the supreme court said it was clear, but

 9   the court of appeals in Mangiapane, whether or not it

10   assumed it or not, did an analysis that clearly says

11   that it believes that the definition of legal insanity

12   includes diminished capacity.

13               Its holding didn't need that analysis,

14   because it could have assumed it and then just said:

15   But no notice was given, so the defense fails here.                 It

16   took the time to analyze just this question and came to

17   a contrary conclusion.        Its contrary conclusion was that

18   "legal insanity" was a broad enough term under Michigan

19   law to encompass this defense.

20               The court of -- the State supreme court has

21   now said no, it's not.        But I don't know that that makes

22   the statute any less ambiguous merely because a court

23   announces that it thin ks it's not.

24               MR. BURSCH:         Well, two responses to that,

25   Justice Sotomayor.     First, I want to be again very

                                     12

 1   careful about what Mangiapane actually held.                It did

 2   look at the statutory language and at page 247 said:

 3   "We are not prepared to say they are identical," meaning

 4   the definition of mental illness and the concept of

 5   diminished capacity.     There the question was procedural

 6   because the defendant had not given the prosecutor

 7   notice of any defense based on mental capacity in the

 8   trial court, and so the court said, well, you know,

 9   assuming that the -- the defense exists, we are not

10   prepared to decide that today -

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, I -

12               MR. BURSCH:        -- because you would have to

13   give statutory notice.

14               The second -

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I -- I would have thought

16   your -- you can get to your second one, but I would have

17   thought your first response to -- to the question would

18   have been to deny that you say it's clear because the

19   Supreme Court of Michigan has said so.                I thought your

20   argument is it's clear because it's clear.

21               MR. BURSCH:        Justice Scalia, that was my

22   second point.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Ah, okay.      It should have

24   been your first point.       The premise is simply wrong.

25   You're saying it was clear because the statute's clear.

 1                MR. BURSCH:          It was clear.          And if any

 2   Michigan court had had the opportunity to actually

 3   decide it on the merits in light of this 200-year

 4   history of Michigan being a criminal code State, it was

 5   clear.   And so this is the point when a State court

 6   decision is most defensible and most expected, applying

 7   the plain language of a clear statute in accord with

 8   State principles.

 9                JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Are there any States with

10   a statute identical or -- or close to the Michigan

11   statute that have interpreted the statute to say it does

12   include diminished capacity?

13                MR. BURSCH:          Justice Kennedy, I'm not aware

14   of -

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:               This statute is -- fairly

16   well tracks the common law tradition, which indicates

17   that diminished capacity is not a defense.

18                MR. BURSCH:          Right.

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:               I'm just curious to know

20   if any State courts have reached an opposite conclusion

21   under a statute like that.

22                MR. BURSCH:          I'm not aware of any other

23   States that have the same statute and have addressed the

24   question one way or the other.                  I do know that the

25   language of the Michigan statute is fairly unique.                    If

                                        14

 1   you look in the criminal law treatises, we're kind of in

 2   a category of only a very few States that, you know, on

 3   the one hand, define mental illness and mental

 4   retardation, do not define or mention diminished

 5   capacity, and yet still have this guilty but insane

 6   option, which is something that Michigan common law did

 7   not have, but then that was added in the '75 statute.

 8   So it's a little bit unique.

 9                I think it's also unique to Michigan that we

10   have this 200-year criminal code history, which if

11   you're interested you can read all about it in the In Re

12   Lamphere case that we cite on page 4 to 5 of our reply

13   brief.   But it's when you put those things together that

14   really make this such an easy case.

15                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Well, General, I guess I

16   wonder whether it's relevant what the statute really

17   says as opposed to what courts said it says.             I mean,

18   sometimes judges make errors and our law is dotted with

19   places where courts have made errors and said that

20   things mean what they don't mean or don't mean what they

21   do mean, and, you know, we expect people to follow what

22   the court says is the law even if there's really a

23   better reading out there.

24                And also, we think that people should rely

25   on what the court says is the law, even though there's

                                      15

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   really a better reading out there.

 2               And so, you know, what does it matter if we

 3   come out and said -- and say, you know, what were these

 4   crazy Michigan courts doing?               If that's what they were

 5   doing, it seems as though people had a right to rely on

 6   that.

 7               MR. BURSCH:          Well, the expectation certainly

 8   is that people would rely on Michigan statutory law.

 9   And I concede that this would be a more difficult case

10   if the Michigan Supreme Court in, say, 1990 had come out

11   in a published opinion and and said the exact opposite

12   of what it said in 2001.           Obviously, that's not what

13   happened here.

14               But -- but ultimately, you know, the

15   question that would have been on Mr. Lancaster's mind

16   back in 1993 when he shot and killed Toni King was, does

17   Michigan law prohibit me, will it punish me if I -- I

18   kill someone?    And -- and clearly, he had to know that.

19   And if he had looked at the 1975 statute, he would have

20   seen that diminished capacity was not mentioned there.

21   So to the extent that he -- he wanted to rely on that

22   defense, he wouldn't have found it in Michigan's

23   codified law.

24               Now, I know the argument on the other side

25   is, well, we have these other cases which, you know,

                                       16

 1   mention the doctrine, kind of assume without deciding

 2   that -- that it's out there.               And he wants to assume

 3   that he has all the knowledge of that, but not the

 4   knowledge of the background principle that Michigan

 5   won't add affirmative defenses to a statute through a

 6   judicial action.

 7               And if you're going to impute any knowledge

 8   to him, and -- and we submit that you probably

 9   shouldn't, then you've got to impute all the knowledge

10   of Michigan law, the plain language of the statute and

11   the interpretive principles that should guide what that

12   statute means.

13               He knew that killing someone was wrong.

14   Unquestionably, he was on fair notice of that.               And -

15   and just like in Rogers, this diminished capacity

16   defense after 1975 was never relied on by any Michigan

17   court to either hold someone guilty or to acquit them or

18   to find that there was ineffective assistance.               It just

19   was not the kind of well- established principle that

20   could possibly make the Carpenter decision either

21   indefensible or unexpected.

22               And then when you layer that on top with

23   AEDPA deference, you know, really, this is about as

24   simple as it gets.     There is no decision of -- of this

25   Court, not Rogers, not Bouie, not Fiore, not Bunkley,

 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH M. MOGILL

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 9               MR. MOGILL:        Mr. Chief Justice -- excuse

10   me -- and may it please the Court:

11               At the time of his offense in this matter,

12   Respondent had a well-established uncontested right to

13   present evidence of diminished capacity in order to

14   negate the elements of premeditation and deliberation in

15   the first-degree murder charge against him, and he did

16   assert that defense at his first trial.                    That trial was

17   rendered unfair by the prosecutor's Batson error.

18               Respondent was not allowed to present the

19   same defense at his retrial, however, because 8 years

20   after his offense, the Michigan Supreme Court

21   unexpectedly changed the rules in midstream, holding in

22   Carpenter that a statute that had been enacted 26 years

23   before and that did not use the words "diminished

24   capacity," did not express an intent to abolish any

25   defense of diminished capacity, but the Supreme Court

                                     18

 1   held that it had been abolished.

 2                 That was fundamentally unfair to Respondent,

 3   all the more so, because if the Michigan courts had

 4   ruled correctly on the Batson issue, retrial would have

 5   occurred before 2001, and there's no question but that

 6   Respondent would have been able to raise the diminished

 7   capacity as -

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            He would have been able to

 9   raise it.    There's a lot of question about whether it

10   would have been successful, because if it had gone up to

11   the Michigan Supreme Court -- the statute was in effect

12   during his first trial?

13                 MR. MOGILL:        That's correct.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            He could have raised it,

15   but if it went up to the Michigan Supreme Court, it

16   would have had the same result as here.

17                 MR. MOGILL:        With all due respect -

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            And your only -- your only

19   defense would have been, oh, it's a great surprise.                 But

20   I don't see how it's a surprise if the Michigan law has

21   been, as -- as the Solicitor General of Michigan has

22   described it, that -- that there's a clear tradition.

23   If -- if the statute addresses the area, the courts will

24   not -- will not supplement it by -- by common law

25   additions.    Did he not know that?

 1                MR. MOGILL:        With all due respect to

 2   opposing counsel, I -- the view -- our view of the law

 3   is -- is entirely different.              Michigan recognizes the

 4   common law in its Constitution.                 Michigan law has -- was

 5   firmly established that the diminished capacity defense

 6   existed.    By 1973 -

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why do you say it was

 8   firmly -- do you -- do you contest the -- the assertion

 9   by the solicitor general that there is no case which -

10   which acknowledged and held the defense of diminished

11   capacity?

12                MR. MOGILL:        I disagree.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is that wrong?

14                MR. MOGILL:        Yes.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:            What -- what case -

16                MR. MOGILL:        Well, first of all -- I'm

17   sorry, Justice Scalia.

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- lets the defendant off

19   on the basis of diminished capacity?

20                MR. MOGILL:        The -- let somebody off?             Well,

21   first of all, we're not talking about -

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:            What case has a holding, a

23   holding that diminished capacity excuses the crime or

24   mitigates the crime.

25                MR. MOGILL:        Mitigates.             Justice Scalia, in

 1   Lynch itself in 1973, Ms. Lynch was charged with

 2   first-degree murder for the starvation -- in relation to

 3   the starvation death of her infant.                    The trial judge

 4   declined to permit -- declined to permit her to offer

 5   psychiatric testimony to mitigate to second degree.                      The

 6   court of appeals reversed, indicating that evidence,

 7   mental health evidence of the kind she wanted to offer,

 8   was admissible to establish diminished capacity, that

 9   is, to negate the element of premeditation and

10   deliberation.

11                Once that case was decided, there is one

12   direction only in Michigan law from 1973 until Carpenter

13   by surprise in 2001.      Yes, the statute was passed in

14   1975, and just 3 years later in 1978, Mangiapane decided

15   that diminished capacity comes within the definition of

16   legal insanity.   The phrasing in the -- in the court's

17   opinion is very significant and it's much more than

18   opposing counsel suggests.             The court stated explicitly:

19   "We find that the -- the defense known as diminished

20   capacity is codified within the definition of legal

21   insanity."

22                Once that happened, then that required an

23   accused who wanted to raise a diminished capacity

24   partial defense to comply with the procedural

25   requirements of the new statute.                  From that point

 1   forward, it was clear that diminished capacity -- and -

 2   and these are published court of appeals decisions, so

 3   they are binding precedent statewide in Michigan unless

 4   or until reversed or modified by the State supreme

 5   court, the legislature, or a constitutional amendment.

 6                Once that happened, there is not a case,

 7   including in Carpenter itself, where the prosecution

 8   objected to the admissibility of diminished capacity

 9   evidence.   It was so well-established, it was beyond

10   question.   It was so well -

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              I think the question that

12   was asked was, as a bottom line at the end of the day -

13                MR. MOGILL:        Yes.

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              -- did anybody get

15   sentenced less?   Did it affect the outcome?                     You gave a

16   case where a defendant was allowed to raise diminished

17   capacity, but was -- are there cases where the defense

18   was successful on the merits?

19                MR. MOGILL:        Justice Ginsburg, I think

20   that's a very important question.                      The -- the closest I

21   can come, the first part of my answer is in the Griffin

22   case in 1989, in an order which was a dispositive order

23   and therefore was precedent, the Michigan Supreme Court

24   disposed of an application for leave to appeal by

25   vacating and remanding a case for an ineffective

 2   inter alia, to consider a diminished capacity defense.

 3                That order could not have occurred unless

 4   the supreme court had determined that diminished

 5   capacity was a valid defense.               The second part -

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Or -- is that correct?

 7   Wouldn't -- wouldn't the supreme court have done that if

 8   it -- if it thought that at least -- at least it was

 9   arguable?

10                MR. MOGILL:        I -- I respectfully submit that

11   under Strickland analysis, no.                If it -- if it's not an

12   established defense, if it's not something that would

13   arguably come within the Strickland framework, there

14   would not have been a remand.               That would have been a -

15   a question of a lawyer trying to be creative, but it

16   wouldn't implicate Strickland principles.

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, I'm -- I'm a little

18   surprised at your answer and Justice Scalia's question

19   indicates the same.     If the law was as well settled as

20   you say it was in the appellate courts, then it seems to

21   me certainly counsel should raise it and is arguably

22   deficient for not doing so.             Whether or not he'll

23   prevail at the end of the day is something quite

24   different.

17                MR. MOGILL:        What I have to establish is

18   that the decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals here

19   was objectively unreasonable.               And whether it's beyond

20   question, I think we certainly have objectively

22   without -- not only was it well-established -- and I

23   want to weave into this the second part of what I'd like

24   to answer of Justice Ginsburg's question.                     I think it's

 1   reversals or not what the lay of the land was, because

 2   where you have a framework that allows a defense to be

 3   raised and prosecutors aren't objecting, the -- the

 4   application's going to be a factual matter for a jury to

 5   decide.

 8   going to be successful sometimes, it's not going to be

 9   successful sometimes, and there are no statistics on

10   that.     But it doesn't -- it won't present a legal issue,

11   and that's in no small part why the question of, well,

12   what about a reversal -

13                  JUSTICE ALITO:            In Griffin -- you describe

14   Griffin in your brief as follows:                        "The court vacated,

15   reversed, and remanded the decision below based on,

16   quote, "defendant's claim that trial counsel was

17   ineffective for failing to explore defenses of

18   diminished capacity and insanity."

19                  MR. MOGILL:        Yes.

20                  JUSTICE ALITO:            "And insanity."           So it

21   wasn't specifically -- wasn't limited to diminished

22   capacity.

23                  MR. MOGILL:        And that's why in my -

24                  JUSTICE ALITO:            It was insanity in general.

25                  MR. MOGILL:        No, it was both.               The -- the

                                        25

 1   insanity defense is separate from diminished capacity,

 2   which is a partial defense; in fact, in Respondent's

 3   first trial, prior counsel had raised both.             At retrial

 4   I only wished to raise the diminished capacity defense.

 5                The law recognizes the difference between

 6   the two in Michigan.      Had diminished capacity not been a

 7   recognized defense, the court's order, I respectfully

 8   submit, would have been worded just with respect to

 9   insanity.   There would have been no legal basis for

10   arguing -- or, excuse me, for including the -- the

11   reference to diminished capacity.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Mogill, as -- as I

13   understand your burden here, it's -- it's not enough to

14   show that Michigan law seemed to be what you -- what you

15   say it was; but it has to have been -

16                MR. MOGILL:        Yes.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- what you say it was.

18                MR. MOGILL:        Yes.

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:            And it -- there was an

20   evulsive change by the supreme court.

21                MR. MOGILL:        I agree with that,

22   Justice Scalia.   And I think that's what we have.               We

23   have, from -

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:            It's -- it's hard to

25   believe that, given -- given the clear text of the

                                      26

 1   statute.

 2                  MR. MOGILL:        The problem, I -- I

 3   respectfully submit, is that nobody in Michigan until

 4   Carpenter -- and -- and I -- it -- that sounds like an

 5   extreme statement, but again the record is clear.

 6   Prosecutor's weren't objecting.                   There is a State bar

 7   committee on criminal jury instructions whose

 8   responsibility it is to come up with standard jury

 9   instructions on areas of law that are agreed upon and -

10   and routinely enough raised in court to warrant a

11   standard instruction.         That committee is comprised of

12   judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys.                   In 1989,

13   that committee promulgated a diminished capacity

14   instruction.     That's how well established it is.

15                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Now, if -- if a prosecutor

16   raised that objection knowing that the court of appeals

17   would -- would reverse the exclusion, right -- I mean,

18   it's clear what the court of appeals would have done,

19   right?

20                  MR. MOGILL:        Yes.

21                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            And once the court of

22   appeals reversed it and said the trial was infected with

23   that error, could -- could the defendant be retried?

24                  MR. MOGILL:        The -- what would happen -

25                  JUSTICE SCALIA:            Because he's -- he's

                                        27

 1   convicted and the -- I'm sorry -- he's -- he's -

 2               MR. MOGILL:          Convicted, convicted of second

 3   instead of first; could he be tried on first?

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:              That's right.

 5               MR. MOGILL:          No.       But that's the question.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Could he be retried?

 7               MR. MOGILL:          On first, no.          But -

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, then -- then you

 9   would be crazy to raise it as a prosecutor.

10               MR. MOGILL:          No.       What I -- but I --

11   Justice Scalia, the answer to your question is -- is

12   encompassed by the statutory scheme which requires

13   advanced notice.   The -- a defendant can't offer

14   diminished capacity evidence in the middle of trial.                     A

15   defendant has to give 30 days or whatever other time set

16   by the judge notice, or it had to at the time.                  If the

17   prosecutor, in any case, believed that such evidence

18   wasn't admissible, the prosecutor had plenty of time

19   prior to trial to seek an in limine ruling from the

20   trial court, to seek an interlocutory appeal from the

21   Michigan Court of Appeals.

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:              He could get an -- an

23   interlocutory appeal on that?

24               MR. MOGILL:          Absolutely.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Okay.

 1                  MR. MOGILL:        And -- and I will tell you the

 2   prosecutors in Michigan are aggressive in -- in seeking

 3   interlocutory appeals.

 4                  We have -- again, it is so well established,

 5   there is not a contrary decision, there is not a

 6   question raised in any opinion or any decision.

 7                  JUSTICE BREYER:            How many holdings are

 8   there?

 9                  MR. MOGILL:        There are many mentions with

10   the -- the holdings -

11                  JUSTICE BREYER:            I take it the answer is

12   zero, right?     I mean, I -

13                  MR. MOGILL:        No.

14                  JUSTICE BREYER:            -- I looked at your brief

15   and then I looked at their brief and they say the answer

16   is zero.

17                  MR. MOGILL:        Lynch is a holding.

18                  JUSTICE BREYER:            And the -- the holding is

19   that -- the pure holding would be if the trial court

20   judge says no, you cannot raise it.                      Okay?    The

21   defendant is convicted and appeals.

22                  MR. MOGILL:        Yes.

23                  JUSTICE BREYER:            And then he says to the

24   appellate court:     They wouldn't let me raise it.

25                  And the appellate court says:                     You have a

 1   right to raise it.

 2                  MR. MOGILL:        And that's exactly Lynch,

 3   Justice Breyer.

 4                  JUSTICE BREYER:            That is Lynch.            And Lynch

 5   is what year?

 6                  MR. MOGILL:        1973.

 7                  JUSTICE BREYER:            In 1973.          Okay.    So we have

 8   one.

 9                  MR. MOGILL:        And -- I'm sorry.

10                  JUSTICE BREYER:            And -- and was there any

11   other case in 1973 -- this is 10 years before.                         Was

12   there any other case in which the same pattern of facts

13   and they said the same thing as Lynch?

15                  JUSTICE BREYER:            No, but we -- we have Lynch

16   on one side.     Is there any case -- this is an

17   intermediate appeals court -- is there any case in which

18   the defendant says,       I would like to raise it,                    the

19   judge says no, convicted, appeal, and the intermediate

20   court of appeals says: Defendant, you are wrong?

21                  MR. MOGILL:        The answer to your question,

22   Justice Breyer, is there is no such case.                       And the

23   reason -

24                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay.          And so all this

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:            Carpenter.

 3               MR. MOGILL:        No, 2001 was Carpenter -

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:            There is exactly one case

 7   on point which does favor you, and there are zero cases

 8   that favor them; is that right?

 9               MR. MOGILL:        If you talk holding only and if

10   you discount Mangiapane.

11               JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, Mangiapane was a -- a

12   lot of words, but the holding was not notice; isn't that

13   right?

14               MR. MOGILL:        The holding was he didn't -

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.

 3                 MR. MOGILL:        One of the things -- one of the

 4   points this Court looked to in Rogers was how many times

 5   the year-and-a-day rule had been "mentioned," and

 6   that -- this is -- that's this Court's word -- in

 7   Tennessee decisions.       And so one of the things we did,

 8   and that's the addendum in our red brief, is look at how

 9   many times there are mentions -- all of which are

10   favorable, not one of which raises even a question, of

11   diminished capacity in Michigan.                   And that -

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Was that -- how often was

13   it mentioned in intermediate court opinions?

14                 MR. MOGILL:        We have 4 mentions in the

15   Michigan Supreme Court and 33 in the Michigan Court of

16   Appeals between 1975 and 1993, and we have over 100 -

17   about 100 -

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Four mentions in the

19   supreme court that say what?

20                 MR. MOGILL:        Well, Griffin is one of them.

21   And then you have -

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yes.

23                 MR. MOGILL:        Yes.

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Have we ever held that a

25   State law has been determined to be X simply because

                                       32

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   intermediate State courts have uniformly held it to be

 2   X?   Never mind assumed it to be X; have held it to be X?

 3                MR. MOGILL:           I don't know of a particular

 4   case.

 5                But to answer your question, Justice Scalia,

 6   the law in Michigan is clear, as stated by the Michigan

 7   Supreme Court, that a published court of appeals

 8   decision is precedentially binding statewide unless and

 9   until reversed by the Supreme Court.                        So the fact

10   that -

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:               It doesn't mean it's right.

12                MR. MOGILL:           No.       But in terms of it -

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:               You have to show it's

14   right.

15                MR. MOGILL:           No, I have to show that it is

16   the law of the -

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:               That it's the law.

18                MR. MOGILL:           I have to show that it is the

19   law of the State.      And it was the law of the State from

20   1973 forward.

21                And I would like to supplement that, if I

22   might.

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                       Could you -- I'm

 1   it wasn't acting on something new.                    The court of appeals

 2   opinion indicates that what we're doing is nothing novel

 3   because the diminished -- the right to present

 4   diminished capacity evidence to rebut an -- the elements

 5   of premeditation and deliberation, grows out of a

 6   100-year history in Michigan.

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, but the

 8   Lynch -- the Lynch case was 2 years before the Michigan

 9   legislature adopted -

10               MR. MOGILL:        Yes.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    -- the statute that

12   we are dealing with here, right?

14               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    And that's where you

15   are putting, if not all of your eggs, most of your eggs,

16   right?

17               MR. MOGILL:        No, I'm -- that -- that is -

18   that's an egg, and I think I've got a pretty full

19   basket.

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, that's the -

21   that's the whole case.       The whole -- the whole point is

22   that the law made that moot because the law under

23   Michigan did not specify diminished capacity and it's a

24   code State, so you only get what they specified.

25               MR. MOGILL:        I disagree with that statement

 1   by brother counsel.       The -- and that's why I quoted

 2   Article 3, Section 7.

 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, but you'll at

 4   least -- well, maybe not.             I mean, would -- would you

 5   acknowledge that the force of Lynch was arguably

 6   diminished by the fact that Michigan passed a statute

 7   that did not mention the diminished capacity defense 2

 8   years after it?

 9                  MR. MOGILL:        I would if the facts of the

10   subsequent litigation supported that interpretation of

11   the statute.     To the contrary, every case -- Mangiapane

12   wasn't -

13                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I'm talking about

14   Lynch.

15                  JUSTICE BREYER:            There were no others, and

16   now I've reduced your one to nothing to like .01 to

17   nothing, because it favors you, Lynch, yes, as the Chief

18   Justice just pointed out, and now you've already said

19   there were no other cases.

20                  MR. MOGILL:        No other holdings.              But we have

21   many, many mentions, we have on-the-ground consistent

22   reliance by prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges.

23                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               That's -- that's your

24   whole point, isn't it?

25                  MR. MOGILL:        Yes.

 1                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               You can't prove a

 2   negative, because if everybody accepts after Mangiapane

 3   that the defense exists then trial courts are not going

 4   to be excluding it on the basis that the statute

 5   excludes it.

 6                  MR. MOGILL:        Absolutely.

 7                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               That's the whole point

 8   you are making.

 9                  MR. MOGILL:        And which gets me to -- to

10   Rogers, and -- and we turn to the questions of

11   fundamental fairness.

12                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Do you have any -- is

13   there any evidence of a trial court holding an

14   exclusion?

15                  MR. MOGILL:        There is nothing.

16                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Or even suggesting one?

17                  MR. MOGILL:        It -- it is so extreme, Justice

18   Sotomayor, that even in Carpenter itself, the

19   prosecution did not contest the admissibility of

20   diminished capacity evidence as a trial court -

21                  JUSTICE BREYER:            But that's because -

22   everybody agrees with you, I think -- I agree with you

23   on this anyway.     I agree the bar puts it in the

24   instructions, and if the bar puts it in the

25   instructions, people tend to follow it.                  That's true.

                                        36

 1   So it's not surprising that a lot of people tend to

 2   follow it.

 3                  But as far as court decisions are concerned,

 4   we have no -- what I'm trying to think of is a

 5   pre-statute.     I give you a little credit on that.

 6   That's Lynch.     Pre-statute, and we have what I might

 7   sort of exaggeratedly refer to as the great mentioner.

 8   We've noticed the great mentioner is often wrong, and -

 9   and here, even though there are judicial mentioners,

10   they get something.       I don't know how much in the scale

11   to -- to give them.

12                  MR. MOGILL:        Well, with all due respect, the

13   standard that this Court set in Rogers is whether the -

14   the decision of Carpenter, in this case, would have been

15   unforeseeable and indefensible by reference to the law

16   as previously expressed so that it could be applied

17   retroactively.

18                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Can you think of a Federal

19   case where -- I see what we have.                        I'm now adding up the

20   something for Lynch, the something for the bar, which is

21   a -- which is a something, and -- and then the fact that

22   some courts have quite, not surprisingly, tended to

23   follow it and there were others that mentioned it

24   favorably, but not the Michigan Supreme Court.

25                  MR. MOGILL:        No, the Michigan Supreme Court

                                        37

 1   did mention it favorably as well.

 2                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay.          So -- so we've got

 3   that.     Now, actually, that Kentucky case, was it?

 4   Tennessee?

 5                  MR. MOGILL:        Rogers?

 6                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Yeah, Rogers.          That went

 7   against you.

 8                  MR. MOGILL:        I think the principle that the

 9   Court established there was very much -

10                  JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.          But can you

11   think of any Federal precedent on this issue that's come

12   even close to that being sufficient?                       What's your best?

13                  MR. MOGILL:        I think the closest point, and

14   it's important, and it goes, Justice Scalia, to respond

15   to your point about lower court -- reliance on lower

16   court opinions, is in Lanier, when the question

17   concerned what's the scope of the statute that's at

18   issue here.     And this Court very explicitly stated that

19   its permissible for the world outside of court to look

20   at lower court decisions, court of appeals decisions, in

21   terms of what had been reasonably expressed.                       That's

22   consistent -

23                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:             If you -- if you prevail

24   here, it may well change the dynamic for State supreme

25   courts.     State supreme courts, much like us, they wait

                                        38

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   until courts of appeals have issued their opinions.

 2   They wait to see how the practical application of those

 3   works insofar as of the fairness of the trial.               They

 4   wait to see about scholarly commentaries, and then

 5   they -- and then they take the case.

 6               If you prevail, State supreme courts are -

 7   are going to say, you know, if we don't take this case,

 8   even if though it's -- does not present the issue as

 9   clearly as some other case might, we don't rush in, then

10   we're going to be foreclosed.               I think you're proposing

11   a -- a dynamic which makes the Federal courts intrude on

12   the way in which State courts choose to develop their

13   law.

14               MR. MOGILL:         Justice Kennedy, thank you for

15   that question, but I respectfully disagree.               The relief

16   we are requesting here is simply that while the Michigan

17   Supreme Court was entirely free to interpret this

18   statute any way it wanted to prospectively, so long as

19   it didn't conflict with some other decision of this

20   Court, the question is:         What about applying it

21   retroactively?   And this Court in Bouie and Rogers has

22   set out clear principles for when a court that wants to

23   reverse ground can do that or not, consistent with

24   fundamental fairness, principles of notice,

25   foreseeability, et cetera, all of which go in our

                                      39

 1   direction here.

 2                An -- an interesting contrast, and I think a

 3   useful contrast -

 4                JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, what is the

 5   unfairness -

 6                MR. MOGILL:        I'm sorry?

 7                JUSTICE ALITO:            What is the unfairness here?

 8   Do you think there's a reliance?

 9                MR. MOGILL:        There's not a reliance, nor is

10   that an element -

11                JUSTICE ALITO:            What is the -- so what is

12   the unfairness here?

13                MR. MOGILL:        In both -- in both Bouie and

14   Rogers, this Court made it clear that reliance is not an

15   issue.   The unfairness, and that's a very important

16   point, Justice Alito, is that by eliminating the right

17   to present this category of evidence, the mental health

18   evidence that would show, if accepted by a jury, that

19   the Respondent was guilty of second-degree murder

20   instead of first-degree murder, what the court was doing

21   was expanding the -- the scope of premeditation and

22   deliberation; they were aggravating the offense.               That

23   is a fundamental unfairness.

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But this -- the case

25   is -- is very different from Bouie which you -- which

                                      40

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   you rely on.     In -- in Bouie, it was the question of a

 2   rule that is governing conduct.                   People come on to

 3   premises; they have no reason to think that they are

 4   committing an offense if they don't leave when somebody

 5   asks them to if they came onto the premise lawfully.                    So

 6   what the Court said in Bouie was that this is a

 7   regulation of primary conduct, and at the time these

 8   people acted, they had no reason to believe that what

 9   they did was unlawful.          That's quite a different -

10                  MR. MOGILL:        Yeah, I agree with that,

11   Justice Ginsburg, except that at footnote 5 in Bouie,

12   this Court explicitly rejected the notion that

13   subjective reliance by the accused is -- is even an

14   aspect of the test for determining -

15                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              It -- it isn't subjective

16   reliance, it's -- it's what was the law.

17                  MR. MOGILL:        And -

18                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              The Court said that the

19   State supreme court interpretation of the statute was

20   quite a surprise.

21                  MR. MOGILL:        Yes.        And what the Court did in

22   both Bouie and in Rogers was look at the underlying

23   State law.     In Bouie, the Court looked at the history of

24   South Carolina law regarding trespass and found that

25   until a year and a half later, it hadn't been construed

                                        41

 1   to apply to a failure to leave as opposed to an entry.

 2   In Rogers, the Court surveyed the very -- a very sparse

 3   Tennessee authority on the year and a day rule.

 4                 That same analysis here will -- must lead to

 5   a conclusion that all of the law in Michigan -- and

 6   again, there are minimal holdings for the reasons

 7   Justice Sotomayor indicated -- the minimal holdings, but

 8   all the mentions and the holding go in the direction of

 9   this existed.     It was relied on, it wasn't contested -

10                 JUSTICE ALITO:             I -- I don't see how the

11   question can be whether there was a change in Michigan

12   law, because we can't second-guess the Michigan Supreme

13   Court about what Michigan law was.                       Michigan law is

14   whatever the State supreme court says it was.                       We might

15   agree, we might disagree.             So I think we have to start

16   from the proposition that the law didn't change, because

17   that's what the Michigan Supreme Court said.

18                 So there must be some other ex post facto

19   principle that applies when there's a certain type of

20   unfairness.     And I wonder if you could articulate what

21   that principle is.

22                 MR. MOGILL:         I would be happy to,

23   Justice Alito, but first I want to address your point

24   about having to rely on Michigan Supreme Court's

25   determination of Michigan law, because this Court has

                                        42

 1   made it very clear that you can't let a State court

 2   relabel something in a way that avoids Federal

 3   constitutional review.         Chief Justice Rehnquist spoke to

 4   that point in Collins v. Youngblood.                      Justice Kennedy,

 5   you spoke to that in your dissent in Clark.

 6   Justice Scalia, in your dissent in Rogers, you spoke to

 7   the point, I think, in an apt phrasing, that this Court

 8   will rely on a State court's reasonable determination of

 9   State law.   I -

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                     So two -- two

11   dissents is what you're relying on?

12                MR. MOGILL:         I'm sorry?              No.   The majority

13   -- the opinion of the Court in Collins, but it's also a

14   well-established principle, and I also wanted to note

15   that the two other mentions, but it's not a principle

16   that's been in dispute.          The -- the Court's analysis in

17   both Bouie and Rogers also supports what I'm saying,

18   because the Court independently looked at South Carolina

19   law in Bouie.   The Court independently looked at

20   Tennessee law in Rogers and -

21                JUSTICE ALITO:             Well, I think you're -- what

22   you're arguing is that under certain -- in evaluating

23   certain constitutional claims, the -- the question of

24   what State law is is not dispositive.                      I don't think

25   you're arguing that a Federal court has a right to tell

                                       43

 1   a State court what State law is.

 2                MR. MOGILL:           This Court certainly does not

 3   have a right to tell the Michigan Supreme Court going

 4   forward what State law is with respect to diminished

 5   capacity.    But -

 6                JUSTICE ALITO:               Well, I mean, suppose this

 7   were a diversity case.           Can -- can a Federal court say,

 8   you know, we -- we think that the -- the decisions of

 9   the intermediate State supreme court were correct and

10   this new decision by the State supreme court is

11   incorrect, so we're not going to follow that?

12                MR. MOGILL:           No.       But this is not -- that's

13   not this case.    This case involves reliance -

14                JUSTICE ALITO:               It's not -- it's not this

15   case, because there, you're trying to figure out what

16   State law is.    Here you're applying a constitutional

17   principle.

18                MR. MOGILL:           We're trying -- we're applying

19   a constitutional principle -

20                JUSTICE ALITO:               So what is that -- that gets

21   me to the second part of my question.

22                MR. MOGILL:           Yes, exactly.

23                JUSTICE ALITO:               What is the -- the

24   constitutional principle that doesn't depend on what

25   State law was?

                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               MR. MOGILL:        The constitutional principle is

 2   that Respondent had a right to present a defense that

 3   existed at the time of his offense, unless it was

 4   clearly unforeseeable -- excuse me -- unless it was

 5   unforeseeable and -- and indefensible by reference to

 6   law that had been expressed prior to the time of the

 7   conduct, that that law might change, which we don't have

 8   here.

 9               And Justice Breyer, I think that the

10   phrasing also goes to respond to your question.                   The -

11   the formulation in -- in Rogers that confines looking to

12   the law as of the time that the conduct occurred, and -

13   and even if you go forward, there was nothing to suggest

14   an alternate interpretation of the statute, a

15   questioning opinion, nothing that would suggest that the

16   law in Michigan was about to change.

17               We also have the fact that, unlike the

18   year-and-a-day rule, diminished capacity as -- as a

19   doctrine is well-supported and increasingly supported by

20   medical and mental health evidence.                   It's the -- the

21   exact opposite of the year-and-a-day rule in that

22   regard.

23               It also furthers -

24               JUSTICE ALITO:            This is -- this is the due

25   process issue, right?

 1                 MR. MOGILL:        It's -- that's exactly -

 2                 JUSTICE ALITO:            So why is it unfair?    Why is

 3   there an entitlement under due process to assert what

 4   appears under the law of the State's intermediate court

 5   decisions to be a valid defense, but is later determined

 6   never to have been or not to have been at the time a

 7   valid defense?

 8                 What is the unfairness involved there?

 9                 MR. MOGILL:        The unfairness is because it

10   was sufficiently well-established, it was thoroughly

11   well-established as a matter of Michigan law, so

12   Respondent and everybody else in Michigan had a right to

13   rely on it.    In fact, if this Court were to reverse the

14   Sixth Circuit, Respondent would be the only person in

15   Michigan charged with a crime prior to Carpenter who

16   would not be allowed to present a diminished capacity

17   defense at a fair trial.           That's how extreme the

18   violation was.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:            The alternative is you are

20   going to allow the bar associations, helpful as they

21   are, by writing instructions to determine issues that

22   courts themselves have never determined, or at least not

23   authoritative supreme courts.                And that's a worrying

24   matter where you are trying to create coherent systems

25   of law.

 2   respond, Justice Breyer, the -- I disagree that we're -

 3   that I'm in any way suggesting turning anything over to

 4   the Bar Association.     The fact of that instruction is I

 5   think strong evidence of the reasonableness of reliance

 6   of the bench and bar in Michigan, but not looking to

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Thank you, counsel.

 9               MR. MOGILL:        Thank you very much.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Mr. Bursch, you have

11   13 minutes remaining.

12              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH

13                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14               MR. BURSCH:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

15               I -- I think we actually have a lot of areas

16   of agreement after 45 minutes of oral argument.

17               Number one, Justice Breyer, is that there

18   really is only one case in Michigan that reaches the

19   holding that Mr. Carpenter would like that you can

20   assert this defense, and that was the Lynch case in

21   1973, which preceded the 1975 statute.

22               So under well-established Michigan law,

23   again, you know, In re Lamphier, Reese, which was their

24   2012 decision reapplying In re Lamphier, that code

25   occupies the field, and at that point, the common law

                                     47

 1   decision no longer existed.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I think he contested that.

 3   I think he never went further into it, but he seemed to

 4   disagree with the proposition that where there is a

 5   Michigan statute it can't be supplemented by the common

 6   law.

 7                MR. BURSCH:        I did not hear him say that.

 8   And if you go back and you read Reese and In re

 9   Lamphier, I don't know how anyone could possibly

10   disagree with that.      There are certainly areas -

11                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    I hate just to

12   interrupt you.

13                MR. BURSCH:        Sure.

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    He did challenge my

15   premise when I presented that to him.

16                MR. BURSCH:        Okay.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So I do think he

18   disagrees with it.

19                MR. BURSCH:        Well, then I disagree with

20   that.   If you look at In re Lamphier and Reese, it's

21   well-settled in Michigan that when the Michigan

22   legislature speaks to a particular subject matter in

23   criminal law that the code controls and the common law

24   cannot supplement it.

25                The words of the Michigan Supreme Court in

                                      48

 1   Reese itself were:      "The courts have no power to add an

 2   affirmative defense that the legislature did not

 3   create."

 4               And -- and I really don't think there can be

 5   a dispute about that.

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:                 Is this -- is this a one

 7   of a kind, in that, whatever the law was, it's clear

 8   from 2001 on?   Are -- are there any other people who

 9   were similarly situated, who committed a crime before

10   2001 but were tried after?

11               MR. BURSCH:           I'm -- I'm not aware of any,

12   Justice Ginsburg, and -- and the reason for that -- that

13   quirk is because his habeas process by coincidence

14   happened to take such a long time.                        It's pretty rare

15   that we're up here on a case where the murder actually

16   took place 20 years ago and the trial is shortly after

17   that.

18               But -- but quirks in how long litigation

19   happens don't determine whether the people get the

20   benefit of changes in law or not.                        What matters is the

21   standard that this Court applied in Rogers and Bouie,

22   was the change -- if there was a change -- indefensible

23   and not expected.

24               JUSTICE KAGAN:               But was there anyone prior

25   to 2001 who couldn't raise a defense like this, who was

                                        49

 1   precluded from doing so because a court thought, oh, you

 2   know, the -- the statute really clears the field, and -

 3   and this defense is not available?

 4                  Was it -- can you point to anything?

 5                  MR. BURSCH:        We can't point to anything,

 6   just like they can't point to anything.

 7                  You've got a -- you know, in 1975 -

 8                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            I guess they can point to

 9   just a lot of people who were raising this defense.

10                  MR. BURSCH:        Right.          And they can point to

11   cases that assume without deciding that the defense

12   might exist.     And then it wasn't until 2001, when the

13   Michigan Supreme Court became the first Michigan court

14   to look at it -- and I forget now who mentioned this; I

15   think it was Justice Kennedy -- that the Michigan

16   Supreme Court did what this Court often does:                    It waited

17   for the right case to present itself.                    And when it did,

18   it applied the plain statutory language in accordance

19   with Michigan interpretive law.

20                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Why -- why was it -

21                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            This is -- I'm sorry.

22                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:              -- why was it the right

23   case?   The parties didn't even raise it, did they?

24                  MR. BURSCH:        Well, you know, it could be

25   because the Michigan Supreme Court thought, you know,

                                        50

 1   there's enough confusion, because of the mentions in the

 2   lower court, that it's time that -- that we address

 3   this.

 4                  I don't know why the Michigan Supreme Court

 5   took it up in Carpenter.            What I do know is that

 6   fair-minded jurists, which is the habeas standard, could

 7   agree that Carpenter was neither indefensible nor

 8   unexpected.     And, you know, it's not a head-counting

 9   business, but I would note that the Michigan Court of

10   Appeals here was unanimous.

11                  Previously, the Michigan Court of Appeals in

12   Talton, decided the year after Carpenter, reached the

13   exact same conclusion with respect to the due process

14   question.     So we've got six Michigan appellate judges

15   looking at this.

16                  You know, going back to -- to what the

17   Michigan law said, I -- I also heard my friend mention

18   the Griffin case.     This is the three-paragraph order

19   where they -- they remand for ineffective assistance.

20                  Well, Griffin is one of the cases that the

21   Michigan Supreme Court discusses in Carpenter, and in

22   the very next sentence, the Supreme Court says:

23   "However, we have never specifically authorized the

24   defense's use in Michigan courts."

25                  You know, it just wasn't there.

 1                  What you have are these mentions, and then,

 2   as Justice Breyer mentioned, he's got jury instructions

 3   which are promulgated by the State bar, not the State

 4   supreme court, or by any court for that matter.               And

 5   what you have to ask yourself, is it objectively

 6   unreasonable, is it beyond any possibility of

 7   fair-minded disagreement that a Michigan Court of

 8   Appeals panel could conclude that Carpenter was both

 9   indefensible and unexpected.

10                  And -

11                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Do you have any idea, a

12   rough estimate, how many cases there were between, say,

13   '75 and '93 where this defense was raised?

14                  MR. BURSCH:        Well, all we have are the

15   mentions in the appellate courts.

16                  JUSTICE BREYER:            You do know about how many?

17   About -

18                  MR. BURSCH:        About 37, I believe.      It was

19   four Michigan Supreme Court opinions and 33 Court of

20   Appeals.     So it was 37.

21                  Now, of those the Michigan Supreme Court

22   itself said their four decisions didn't say one way or

23   the other.     Of the other 33, 32 of them weren't even

24   binding in other Michigan Court of Appeals panels.                  As

25   we explained in our brief, the Michigan Court of Appeals

                                        52

 1   wasn't bound to follow any panel decision prior to

 2   November 1st, 1990.      So those weren't even binding on

 3   the court of appeals itself.

 4                 If you are thinking about what's firmly

 5   established, you know, there were no roots at all to

 6   these mentions.    It would be like walking past your

 7   neighbor's yard, and if there is an oak tree there, you

 8   expect it to be there the next day.                     You know, but if

 9   there is a small weed, you expect it to be pulled up and

10   rooted out.

11                 And that's exactly what happened here when

12   the Michigan Supreme Court finally addressed the

13   question.

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            You -- you rely on Reese as

15   establishing the principle that you cannot supplement

16   the defenses in a criminal statute, but Reese was a 2012

17   case.

18                 MR. BURSCH:        Right.          I mentioned Reese

19   because it's the most recent application.                     It cites In

20   re Lamphier, which is an 1886 decision, which itself

21   references the 1810 Territorial Act which abolished

22   common law criminal principles -- if you have the

23   statute -

24                 JUSTICE KAGAN:            Do you have something like

25   in the middle?

 1                (Laughter.)

 2                MR. BURSCH:         There are many cases in the

 3   middle.   There is at least a 1990 case, although I can't

 4   recall the name.   If you just key cite or shepherdize In

 5   re Lamphier, you -- you will find scores of cases that

 6   rely on this proposition.

 7                It's -- it's not in dispute.

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                I'm sorry.    Then you

 9   were arguing that Lynch was wrong to begin with, because

10   what you are arguing is that it created a common law

11   defense that the courts say you can't under Michigan

12   law.

13                MR. BURSCH:         Right.          Exactly.   You've got

14   Lynch, which was the common law.

15                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:                No, no, but you're

16   saying to me it was wrongly decided under this general

17   Michigan -

18                MR. BURSCH:         Oh, no, no, no.

19                To be perfectly clear, what In re Lamphier

20   and Reese and everything else say is that when the

21   legislature has spoken to a particular area, then the

22   courts cannot supplement.            They had never spoken about

23   mental capacity defenses prior to 1975, and so the slate

24   was free for the courts to do what they wanted.

25                So there's nothing wrong with Lynch in '73.

 1   The problem is continuing to assume that there was a

 2   defense that wasn't in the '75 statute.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    If you were

 4   representing a defendant in this position, you certainly

 5   would have raised the diminished capacity defense prior

 6   to Carpenter, wouldn't you?

 7                MR. BURSCH:        Undoubtedly.              But I don't think

 8   it means that fair-minded jurists could not possibly

 9   conclude that Carpenter was both indefensible and not

10   expected.

11                JUSTICE KAGAN:            And if you were a

12   prosecutor, you would not have objected to that defense,

13   would you have?

14                MR. BURSCH:        Well, I don't know.              If I was a

15   prosecutor, I would have looked at the plain language of

16   the statute -

17                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Do you have any -

18                MR. BURSCH: -- and I probably would have -

19                JUSTICE KAGAN: -- have any reason to think

20   that any prosecutor ever objected to such a defense?

21                MR. BURSCH:        I don't know one way or the

22   other.   We -- we just don't have the data for that.

23                So ultimately, what we are talking about

24   here -

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I assume you'd need a case

                                      55

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   in which the prosecutor was pretty, pretty clear that a

 2   diminished capacity defense would prevail.                   Otherwise,

 3   it wouldn't -- the game wouldn't be worth the camel,

 4   right?

 5                  MR. BURSCH:        That's exactly right.

 6                  JUSTICE BREYER:            But what's in the 37 cases

 7   then?    I -- they got up there.                I assume the defendant

 8   must have brought them.           They must have brought them.

 9   He must have wanted to -- to raise the defense and

10   somebody said no.

11                  MR. BURSCH:        No, I don't believe that there

12   was a single case in those 37 where someone tried to

13   raise the defense and the court said no.                   Nor was there

14   a case where the prosecutor said you can't raise the

15   defense and the court said yes.                   It was just a number of

16   cases.     And, you know, Mangiapane is really the paradigm

17   example.

18                  JUSTICE BREYER:            Yeah.

19                  MR. BURSCH:        But the question was, did they

20   give notice?     If the defense exists, is it part of the

21   statute?     And -- and all the Michigan courts agree that

22   that has to be the case.            But it's not till Carpenter

23   where the court finally says, is it part of the statute

24   and says no.

25                  JUSTICE KAGAN:            Just to go back to

 1   Justice Breyer's question.             I mean, there may be no way

 2   you can answer this, but are we talking about, you know,

 3   do five people a year -- did five people a year raise

 4   this or -- or 20 or 100?          I mean, what kind of numbers?

 5                MR. BURSCH:        You know, all we've got are the

 6   appellate decisions referencing it.

 7                JUSTICE KAGAN:            Right.

 8                MR. BURSCH:        So if we've got 37 cases -

 9                JUSTICE KAGAN:            You can't really tell

10   because nobody was objecting to anything -

11                MR. BURSCH:        Correct.

12                JUSTICE KAGAN:            -- right?

13                MR. BURSCH:        So you've got 37 cases over a

14   course of 18 years, '75 to -- to '93.                  Now, that -- that

15   tells us maybe two cases a year in a system that

16   processes thousands of criminal cases.

17                You know, there was nothing here that would

18   make the Supreme Court's application of the plain

19   language so indefensible, so unexpected that no

20   reasonable jurist could possibly have reached the same

21   conclusion as now two unanimous Michigan Court of

22   Appeals panels have.

23                I wanted to touch briefly on the unfairness

24   point.   And Justice Ginsburg, I -- I believe brought up

25   Bouie.   And Bouie is really the perfect analogy,

                                      57

 1   because, again, under the AEDPA standard, it's

 2   Lancaster's burden to show that the court of appeals

 3   decision here was contrary to our misapplication.             And,

 4   to the contrary, it was the exact application of Bouie.

 5               In Bouie, you had a clear statute that was

 6   very narrow, and the State court expanded it in a very

 7   unexpected way.   And this Court found that was

 8   indefensible and unexpected.

 9               The exact opposite happened here.             You had

10   the Michigan Supreme Court applying very narrow

11   statutory language exactly the way it was written in

12   accord with 200 years of interpretive principles.

13               So -- so really, the problem here is not any

14   unfairness, the problem is the Sixth Circuit yet again

15   not applying habeas deference under the statute or this

16   Court's precedent and disregarding another Michigan

17   State court decision where reasonable jurists could have

18   reached different conclusions on this.

19               It's not our burden to -- to demonstrate

20   what the law was or wasn't.             All we have to show is that

21   a reasonable jurist could have reached the conclusion

22   the Michigan Court of Appeals did here, and there

23   doesn't appear to be any question that's the case.

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:             You want us to say "yet

25   again" when we write our opinion?
