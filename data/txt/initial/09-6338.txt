 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA B. FREELAND

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MS. FREELAND:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10   and may it please the Court:

11               Believing its hands were tied by a policy

12   statement created to prevent application of this Court's

13   decision in Booker to section 3582(c) proceedings, the

14   district court imposed a mandatory guideline sentence

15   that exceeded the maximum authorized by the jury's

16   verdict by more than six years.            Sentencing Commission

17   policy cannot override this Court's clear and

18   unambiguous directive to courts to treat the guidelines

19   as advisory in all cases moving forward, and any

20   interpretation of section 3582(c) that permits the

21   Commission to mandate sentences must be rejected, not

22   only as a matter of statutory stare decisis, but because

23   it would violate the Sixth Amendment.

24               In an effort to avoid this result, the

25   government elevates form over substance, arguing that

                                      3

 1   section 3582(c) proceedings are not sentencings at

 2   the -- and that the sentence imposed is not a new

 3   sentence.     The government is wrong.

 4                 Section 3582(c) proceedings are sentencings

 5   at which Booker's constitutional and remedial holdings

 6   must apply.     The --

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Ms. Freeland --

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  What if the

 9   Sentencing Commission just issued a new guideline and

10   said anyone with a -- a crack sentence, their sentence

11   is going to be reduced by 10 percent?                   That wouldn't

12   present any problems, would it?

13                 MS. FREELAND:          Mr. Chief Justice, I think it

14   would present precisely the same problems here.                     By

15   indicating an amount of time that a sentence could be

16   reduced, the Sentencing Commission would be doing

17   precisely what it did here, which is setting a lower

18   level, mandatory lower level, on sentences --

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But there's no --

20                 MS. FREELAND:          -- that the district court

21   could impose.

22                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But 3553(a) doesn't

23   even come into play under my hypothetical.

24                 MS. FREELAND:          I'm sorry, Your Honor.

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  3553(a) doesn't even

                                          4

 1   come into play, so there's not a resentencing by a

 2   judge.    It is just an across-the-board policy, like

 3   increasing good time credits.

 4                  MS. FREELAND:      I disagree, Your Honor,

 5   because Congress in this case decided to enact a

 6   statute, 3582(c), that invokes the discretionary

 7   sentencing power of the court.

 8                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Right, in -- in this

 9   case, but in my hypothetical Congress hasn't done that.

10   It hasn't -- or the Sentencing Commission hasn't done

11   that.    They haven't invoked the discretionary

12   sentencing.    They just said:            Across the board, 10

13   percent off.

14                  MS. FREELAND:      And, Your Honor, perhaps I

15   misunderstood, but once the Sentencing Commission acts

16   to revise a guideline under its power under 994(u) and

17   opts to make that amendment retroactive under -- I mean,

18   994(o) -- and opts to make it retroactive under 994(u),

19   only the court has power to lower a sentence.                 Congress

20   enacted --

21                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, why is that?     It's

22   the same hypothetical of the Chief Justice.                 I'm not

23   interrupting your -- your discussion with him.                 Suppose,

24   pursuant to a permissible regulation, the BOP says:                   Just

25   file paperwork with us, and if -- and if you show that

                                       5

 1   you were under a crack cocaine sentence, you're going

 2   to be reduced by X number of months, period.             Just file

 3   it.   What --

 4                   MS. FREELAND:    And, Justice Kennedy --

 5                   JUSTICE KENNEDY:      Is there a problem with that?

 6                   MS. FREELAND:    Justice Kennedy, I think there

 7   would be.   And, again, I don't mean to be dodging the question.

 8   The problem is section 3582(c).              Congress clearly indicated

 9   that it wanted these types of reductions to be treated

10   differently than those under 3624(b), which are

11   delegated to the Bureau of Prisons.              And those types of

12   reductions --

13                   JUSTICE KENNEDY:      No, but the -- the

14   hypothetical is Congress doesn't do this.             The

15   hypothetical is that Congress just tells the BOP:             Find

16   out who's in on crack cocaine and release them --

17   whatever, 20 months early.

18                   MS. FREELAND:    Your Honor --

19                   JUSTICE KENNEDY:      What's wrong with that?

20                   MS. FREELAND:    Your Honor, if

21   Congress chose to draft a statute similar to 3624(b) to

22   empower the Bureau of Prisons to act whenever the

23   Commission lowered a guideline or -- or changed a

24   guideline under 994(o), I agree with Your Honor.             It

25   would not present the problems here.

 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Okay.    Then the Chief

 2   Justice's hypothetical, at least for me, meant:                   What --

 3   why should there be a difference?

 4                MS. FREELAND:        The difference, again -- and

 5   I don't mean to be dodging your questions.                The

 6   difference is that Congress acted in two very different

 7   ways here.   It enacted 3582(c) to deal with reductions

 8   in sentence that are -- that are prompted by revisions

 9   to the guidelines, and it enacted 3624(b) to deal with

10   revisions that are prompted by good behavior.                   And

11   it --

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             What is the

13   constitutional difference that would inure a Sixth

14   Amendment right in the resentencing by the court that

15   doesn't when it's a resentencing or a modification of a

16   sentence by the Bureau of Prisons?

17                MS. FREELAND:        Justice Sotomayor, I think

18   the difference would be that when it is delegated to the

19   courts under a statute like 3582(c), the court is then

20   dealing with a mandatory guideline range, and the Sixth

21   Amendment problem arises when the court sentences --

22                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But is this truly a new

23   sentence, meaning a person serving a sentence?                   This is

24   an act of clemency.     Whether the Bureau of Prisons does

25   it or the court does it, why should we introduce a

                                       7

 1   different binding or non-binding constitutional limit on

 2   one body rather than the other?

 3               MS. FREELAND:         Justice Sotomayor, I disagree

 4   with the premise of your question that this is an act of

 5   clemency similar to the reductions for good time

 6   behavior.

 7               The -- the term "clemency," "leniency,"

 8   "grace," connotes the idea that you deserve to be

 9   punished for this, but we're going to -- we're going

10   to exercise leniency --

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Ms. Freeland --

12               MS. FREELAND:         -- and give you a lesser

13   sentence.

14               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             May I take

15   you on another path, not the question of the difference

16   between the two -- two sections.              We have a large

17   prison population, and then Booker comes down, and then

18   the guidelines change only as to crack cocaine, nothing

19   else.   All of the others whose sentence has become final

20   cannot get into the court's door because they don't have

21   the entering wedge.

22               In what system -- what fair system would

23   say, aha, because the crack cocaine guideline was

24   reduced -- the disparity was reduced -- these people are

25   now going to overcome the finality bar, but all of the

                                       8

 1   others who are identically situated with respect to all

 2   other factors, they don't get their sentences revised?

 3               MS. FREELAND:      Justice Ginsburg, I have a

 4   couple of responses to your question.               The first is that

 5   I think that a decision by a district court judge to

 6   correct a sentence under 3582(c) should be analogous to

 7   a decision of a district court judge to correct a

 8   sentence under 2255.

 9               Once the decision is made that the sentence

10   should be corrected, finality is extinguished, and when

11   the court goes about imposing the new sentence, it must

12   comport with the law of the land at the time.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But why should, bearing

14   in mind that entire prison population similarly

15   situated, the courts say it's -- the finality bar is lifted

16   only to the extent that the crack cocaine guideline disparity

17   has been reduced?

18               MS. FREELAND:      And, Your Honor, once the

19   finality bar is lifted, the concerns about retroactivity

20   should slip away.   But with respect to fairness, which I

21   think is at the heart of your question, the fact that

22   this partial remedy for an urgent and compelling

23   problem, that is, the crack guideline, was afforded to

24   some should not prevent the court from seeing justice

25   for those like Mr. Dillon, even though there are some in

 1   prison that are serving unconstitutional sentences that

 2   will not be able to seek relief.

 3                 Mr. Dillon is properly compared to other

 4   defendants who were sentenced under the amended crack

 5   guideline, not the original crack guideline.             His

 6   sentence is an amended crack guideline sentence, and for

 7   purposes of avoiding unwarranted disparities, Mr. Dillon

 8   is most comparable to those other defendants that are

 9   sentenced after the crack guideline.

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           If you -- if you are

11   right that this benefit goes to -- only to the class

12   that can get in the door, wouldn't that be a powerful

13   motive to the Sentencing Commission not to make its

14   guidelines reductions retroactive?

15                 MS. FREELAND:       Your Honor, I would certainly

16   hope not.     994 clearly contemplates that the Commission

17   will undertake a constant review and revision of the

18   guidelines to make sure that they serve the purposes of

19   punishment.     And 994(u) clearly shows that Congress

20   contemplated that some of those decisions would warrant

21   retroactive application.

22                 If the Commission were to respond to a

23   decision by this Court in Mr. Dillon's favor by refusing

24   to revise the guidelines in the future or refusing to

25   make any of those revisions retroactive, I submit that

                                      10

 1   it would be abdicating its duty under 994.

 2                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        It wouldn't say that.           It

 3   just wouldn't do it.     That's all.

 4                  MS. FREELAND:      You're right, Your Honor.

 5   It just wouldn't do that, but history would speak for

 6   itself.     The Commission has constantly undertaken this

 7   duty under 994(o).

 8                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        But it's certainly a

 9   factor that if I were -- if I were on the Commission, I

10   would certainly take that factor into account.                    Every

11   time I make it retroactive, it's going to reopen --

12   going to reopen the whole sentencing and -- and allow

13   a Booker application where -- where it didn't apply

14   before.     How can I close my eyes to that if --

15                  MS. FREELAND:      Well, Your Honor --

16                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- if I'm making the

17   retroactivity determination?

18                  MS. FREELAND:      Your Honor, if I could, I'm

19   not suggesting that the Commission close its eyes to

20   anything.     However, what we're asking for in this case

21   is not a full resentencing where all sentencing

22   decisions would be reopened.              We're simply saying that

23   when a court imposes a new sentence, that new sentence

24   must comply with this Court's decision in Booker, and --

25                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Only Booker?

 1                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            But that means it --

 2                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Only Booker?

 3   What if there is another constitutional objection

 4   to the sentence, and he goes back under --

 5   under the crack cocaine?           Can you say, oh, and, you

 6   know, also, it violated my rights under equal

 7   protection?     You didn't notice that before, but here's

 8   the argument.     Is that before the sentencing court?

 9                  MS. FREELAND:         Your Honor, I would have to

10   say that it is.     The -- the new sentence --

11                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Yes, you would you

12   have to say.     So --

13                  MS. FREELAND:         The sentence imposed would

14   have to comply with the Constitution.

15                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So it's not only as

16   unfair as Justice Ginsburg hypothesized.                    It's even more

17   unfair than that, because just because of the crack

18   cocaine change, somebody with an equal protection

19   challenge gets to raise that.                While somebody in prison

22                  MS. FREELAND:         That's true,

23   Mr. Chief Justice, but that's the case in any situation

24   where a defendant has raised an issue on appeal or has

25   presented a claim in a 2255 petition, and just by

 1   happenstance the decision awarding them a new -- a new

 2   trial or a new sentence happens when a new

 3   constitutional rule is announced by this Court.

 4   Now, certain --

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, that's a new

 6   constitutional rule.    This is an old one.              This is one

 7   that was -- you know, the equal protection clause has

 8   been in the books for a while.           And -- and he -- he just

 9   gets the chance to raise it solely because of the fact

10   that his conviction involved crack cocaine.

11                 MS. FREELAND:      And, again, Your Honor, I

12   think that he would get to raise it, but I want to point

13   out that not every constitutional issue would be ripe

14   for the court's decision at that proceeding.                If there

15   were an opportunity to raise -- as you said, equal

16   protection isn't a new law like -- we're talking about

17   Booker being a new law for Mr. -- for Mr. Dillon.                   If

18   there were an equal protection challenge that had not

19   been lodged at the original sentencing, the district

20   court would apply the law of the case and then --

21                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Oh, no, no, no.     I

22   thought under your theory this is a whole new

23   sentencing.    So who cares whether he waived it at the

24   first one?    We're starting from -- from point zero.

25                 MS. FREELAND:      Mr. Chief Justice, I must

 1   have misspoken.   That is certainly not what I meant to

 2   indicate.   What I meant to say is, certainly, all

 3   sentences imposed ought to comply with the Constitution,

 4   but we live in a system that has waiver principles, law

 5   of the case, mandate rule.        These are all obstacles that

 6   a defendant seeking to overturn a sentencing or raise an

 7   issue on equal protection grounds that weren't presented

 8   before would serve as obstacles to their doing so.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               And my point is that

10   they shouldn't under your theory.            The fact that he

11   waived it at the earlier sentencing under your theory

12   should not matter at all, because your theory is that

13   this is a whole new sentencing, so who cares what went

14   on in the prior sentencing?

15               MS. FREELAND:       I disagree, Your Honor, that

16   my theory does not encompass that part of the rule.               And

17   I think with respect to our criminal history issue that

18   we've raised that's precisely what we've said, that

19   there are errors that a district court may not be able

20   to correct in a 3582(c) proceeding --

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, why do you -- why do

22   you pick on -- on Booker as -- as not carrying over?               I

23   mean, if you say that there carries over from the prior

24   sentencing his failure to raise the equal protection

25   claim, why can't you say it's also law of the case that

                                    14

 1   the Booker objection doesn't stand?                It's law of the case.

 2   It was decided before Booker, and that's the law of the

 3   case as far as that's concerned.

 4                 MS. FREELAND:       Well, Your Honor, if the law

 5   of the case were in place before Booker were decided, the

 6   new law would be an exception to the law of the case if

 7   Mr. Dillon were resentenced as he were after the Court's

 8   decision in Booker.

 9                 I'm not sure if that answers your question

10   precisely.    For Mr. Dillon, Booker is new law at his new

11   sentencing.   He did not have an opportunity to raise a

12   Booker objection or ask for a sentence below the

13   guideline range at his original sentencing.

14                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Under your theory,

15   there's no bar to an upward sentence by the -- by the

16   judge, because if it's a brand new hearing subject to

17   Booker, which mandates complete discretion under 3553,

18   the judges define the sentence that fits the crime and

19   the defendant.    So you don't mind an upward --

20                 MS. FREELAND:       Well, under 3582(c), Your

21   Honor, statute -- the statute provides that it --

 2   the whole statute, the statute that allows --

 3                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           If you want the whole

 4   statute, then it's a new sentence.            You can't beg and say

 5   the statute limits up and down, but I only want the

 6   down --

 7                 MS. FREELAND:    Your Honor --

 8                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           -- and I want a new sentence.

 9   It doesn't make sense.

10                 MS. FREELAND:    I think I understand your

11   point.    The -- the problem is with the statute.          3582(c)

12   does not authorize a court to increase the sentence.

13                 The fact that a sentence cannot be increased

14   does not divest the proceeding at which it's imposed --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:      So what's -- what's the --

16   the words in the statute is that it may reduce the term.

17   You can't change the term -- you cannot change a

18   sentence, except that you can reduce the term if such

19   reduction is consistent with applicable policy

20   statements.

21                 MS. FREELAND:    That's correct, Your Honor.

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:      Do you see anything --

23   what's -- what's unconstitutional about that?            Then they

24   issue a policy statement, and the policy statement says

 1   whatever the new thing is -- applies.

 2                If you're arguing that that violates the

 3   Constitution, what I'm missing is why?             What violates

 4   the Constitution in that?

 5                MS. FREELAND:      Your Honor, post-Booker, what

 6   violates the Constitution is the policy statement's use

 7   of the word "shall."    That's a -- that's a

 8   significant change --

 9                JUSTICE BREYER:        I don't remember --

10                MS. FREELAND:      -- in the wording of 1.10

11                JUSTICE BREYER:        I thought in Booker --

12   and I have to go back and look at it, but I thought in

13   Booker the Court held that certain specific -- like

14   certain specific words in certain specific provisions

15   of the -- the sentencing statutes were unconstitutional

16   because of Apprendi and because of the other part,

17   Booker itself.

18                Well, 3582 wasn't one of them.            So -- so

19   there must be something unconstitutional if you're

20   right.   I don't see how you get around this statute.

21                MS. FREELAND:      Your Honor, in our view

22   3582(c) is not unconstitutional.           It --

23                JUSTICE BREYER:        All right.      If it's not

24   unconstitutional, then why don't you have to follow it?

25   Because what it says is, you cannot get a reduction

                                    17

 1   except in respect to what the policy guideline says.

 2   And the policy guideline says you don't get a reduction,

 3   except insofar as we've reduced a sentence in a

 4   particular respect.

 5                 What's unconstitutional about that?         I'm --

 6   I'm not saying there isn't.           I want to know what your

 7   argument is that it is unconstitutional.

 8                 MS. FREELAND:       Justice Breyer, post-Booker,

 9   if 3582(c) is interpreted as you just said, that the

10   sentence -- the reduction in sentence must be consistent

11   with applicable policy statements absolutely --

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Well, that's what it says.

13   I don't know how you'd interpret it some other way --

14                 MS. FREELAND:       And that the --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:         -- if that's what it says.

16                 MS. FREELAND:       And that the policy statement

17   then requires the court to impose a mandatory guideline

18   sentence --

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:         No, it just says what we're

20   doing is we're reopening the sentencing in respect to

21   the particular way we reduce people's sentence, not in

22   respect to something else.          That's what I read the

23   policy statement to say.        That if there were 19 things

24   that were considered in the sentence and one of those 19

25   is changed in a downward direction, then it says we make

                                      18

 1   an exception, says the policy statement.               You can reopen

 2   number 19, but not the first 18.

 3                  Now, why is that unconstitutional?            What in

 4   the Constitution prohibits doing that?

 5                  MS. FREELAND:      The -- Your Honor, if I could,

 6   the constitutional problem with section 1B1.10(b)(2)(A)

 7   is that it requires the district court to impose a

 8   sentence within the guideline range.               Therein lies

 9   the problem.     The requirement, a mandatory guideline

10   sentence based on a judicially enhanced range --

11   therein lies the problem.

12                  Section 3582(c) does not mandate guideline

13   sentencing.    It's 1B1.10.

14                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Ms. Freeland, what would

15   happen if the -- the motion is made with respect to the

16   crack cocaine, and the judge said, I'm -- I'm not going

17   to -- I deny the motion?        Would the judge then have to

18   go on and consider Booker and say, now, on this piece,

19   I deny the motion, but now I can just do whatever I want

20   with the rest of it?

21                  MS. FREELAND:      Your Honor, if I could, if a

22   judge is presented with a 3582(c) motion and denies the

23   motion, all the court has done is enter an order denying

24   a motion.

25                  It's not until the district court decides to

                                      19

 1   grant the 3582(c) motion and reduce the defendant's

 2   sentence that 3553(a) factors come into play, the policy

 3   statements come into play, and a new sentence is

 4   thereafter imposed.

 5                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Well, if -- suppose

 6   Congress and the Sentencing Commission had made it

 7   crystal clear that they are authorizing a reopening but

 8   only with respect to one piece.             You say -- you say no

 9   matter how clear it is, as a matter of constitutional

10   law, because Booker has been decided, the whole sentence

11   is up for --

12                  MS. FREELAND:      Justice Ginsburg --

13                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          -- consideration?

14                  MS. FREELAND:      Justice Ginsburg, that's

15   correct.   And the reason is because 3582(c) is a

16   provision that is used by courts to correct sentences.

17   Once the court decides that the defendant is worthy of a

18   correction, that the sentence should be corrected, it

19   grants a motion extinguishing the old sentence and

20   imposes a new sentence.

21                  Our position is simply that when it imposes

22   the new sentence, it must comply with Booker's

23   constitutional and remedial holdings.

24                  JUSTICE SCALIA:        I have a better answer to

 3                (Laughter.)

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:        It's -- it's -- it's not --

 5   it's not section 3582 that's unconstitutional, and it

 6   isn't even the provision for being guided by a policy

 7   statement of the Sentencing Commission that's

 8   unconstitutional.   It is the nature of the Sentencing

 9   Commission's policy statement that is unconstitutional.

10                Surely, if the Sentencing Commission had a

11   policy statement which said you will reduce it for white

12   prisoners but not for black prisoners, that would surely

13   be unconstitutional, right?

14                MS. FREELAND:      Absolutely, Your Honor.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:        And your point here is that

16   the policy statement which says you effectively will

17   disregard Booker is unconstitutional?

18                MS. FREELAND:      I agree.

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:        That works, doesn't it?

21   Breyer --

22                JUSTICE BREYER:        You agree.       Now -- now,

23   what -- that's what I -- I could understand that if 3582

24   said to the judge you resentence him.              But it doesn't

25   say that.   So there's a sentence in effect, and what

 1   3582 says is a -- a sentence can be reduced just as if,

 2   to go back to the beginning, Congress passed a statute

 3   or the Commission said everybody's sentence will be

 4   reduced.     That doesn't change what the sentence was.               It

 5   says there's a reduction, like for good -- good time.

 6                  So it says a defendant, if he has been

 7   sentenced based on factor 19 in the case, the court may

 8   reduce the term of imprisonment, the term of

 9   imprisonment there under the sentence.               So I'm back to

10   my question.

11                  What's unconstitutional about that?

12                  MS. FREELAND:      Justice --

13                  JUSTICE BREYER:        And what the court just says

14   is the court -- the Commission says:               That's right.   You

15   may reduce it in respect to what we've considered; you

16   may not reduce it in respect to something which is

17   not considered.

18                So I'm still puzzled about the constitutional

19   problem.

21   apologize because I may not be --

 2   now.   And I didn't quite and now I do.            So there's nothing

 3   to apologize for.

 4                  MS. FREELAND:      Okay.      I'd like to --

 5                  JUSTICE BREYER:        You wanted to get the idea

 6   in my mind.     I'm not expressing that in my question, but

 7   I got your answer.

 8                  MS. FREELAND:      Okay, thank you.

 9                  (Laughter.)

10                  MS. FREELAND:      A couple of points, though,

11   that I -- that -- from reading the text of the statute

12   that I'd like to point out.           Justice Breyer, notice

13   it doesn't say "sentence."          It says "term of

14   imprisonment."     "Term of imprisonment" is -- is a term

15   of art in the Federal Code.           A "term of imprisonment"

16   is an authorized sentence under 3551 of the United

17   States Code.     And under 3621, the Bureau of Prisons

18   cannot hold someone in custody absent a sentence of

19   imprisonment.

20                  And in this case, there are two judgments,

21   two sentences of imprisonment.            The Bureau of Prisons

22   would not have been able to hold Mr. Dillon for

23   270 months under the 1993 judgment, and the Bureau of

24   Prisons certainly cannot hold Mr. Dillon for 322 months

25   under the --

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I'm sorry. Why --

 2                 MS. FREELAND:      -- the June 2008 judgment.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Why could they --

 4   the first part of that, why could they not hold him for

 5   the term under the 1993 sentence?

 6                 MS. FREELAND:      Under 3621, it's very clear

 7   that the -- the Bureau of Prisons, absent a reduction

 8   under 3624(b) for good time, is directed to hold the

 9   defendant in the custody of Bureau of Prisons for the

10   term of imprisonment on the judgment.

11                 In this case, following the --

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        What -- what if the

13   President reduces the sentence using his pardon

14   power?   He cuts it back; he cuts it in half.               The Bureau

15   of Prisons has to hold him for the full term of the

16   imprisonment?    No, that can't be true.

17                 MS. FREELAND:      Justice Scalia, I'm certain

18   that that's not true.     And I mean, there -- I'm not

19   familiar --

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        So why is this any

21   different?

22                 MS. FREELAND:      -- with those provisions.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:        Why is this any different?

24   I mean, there are obviously -- what it proves is that

25   there are exceptions to that requirement that they hold

                                     24

 1   him for the term of imprisonment.              They -- they have to

 2   hold him for the term of imprisonment unless it has been

 3   shortened, right, by -- by pardon or remission of part

 4   of the term by the President or what the argument for

 5   the government is, or by application of this retroactive

 6   rule by -- by the Commission.

 7                  MS. FREELAND:      And again, Your Honor, I'm

 8   not familiar with the clemency and commutation

 9   procedures.     I would have to think that some piece of

10   paper, some order directing the Bureau of Prisons to

11   reduce the sentence, just as a new judgment in a 3582(c)

12   is a new sentence of 270 months, would have to be

13   presented so that the Bureau of Prisons would release.

14                  But -- but that aside, the -- the real point

15   here is that the new judgment is a new judgment; it is a

16   new sentence.     This is not a reduction in the old

17   sentence.     It --

18                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Well, that's what it says.

19   It's -- the other thing that has bothered me, to tell you

20   the truth, is -- is the part of the point that was brought

21   up previously, that it is up to the Commission whether to

22   make it retroactive.     It is.

23                  MS. FREELAND:      I agree.

24                  JUSTICE BREYER:        I don't know why they

25   couldn't take into account that to make any drug-related

                                      25

 1   change, you see, and then make that retroactive, is

 2   going to reopen the sentencing for every single person

 3   who has already been convicted of a drug crime in the

 4   Federal courts, of which there are probably tens of

 5   thousands.

 6                And -- and I think they would properly take

 7   that into account.   And, therefore, they might properly

 8   say, we're not going to make this retroactive.

 9                MS. FREELAND:       Your Honor, the -- the

10   practice in the court of appeals post-Booker of

11   remanding all of the cases that were in the pipeline

12   shows that the Federal courts are able to handle

13   revisiting thousands of sentences imposed under a

14   mandatory system to revisit them under 3553(a).                   And as

15   Justice Walton said in testifying before the Sentencing

16   Commission with respect to this issue, that the courts

17   are fully prepared to handle any administrative burden

18   and believes that such a burden would be sufficiently

19   justified for people like Mr. Dillon who are deserving.

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I'll make this brief

21   because your -- your rebuttal light is on.                Your answer

22   made sense when we talk about term as opposed to

23   sentence, if you just look at (c).                But (b) says,

24   "Notwithstanding the fact that a sentence to imprisonment

25   can be modified ... a judgment of conviction that

                                     26

 1   includes such a sentence constitutes a final judgment."

 2   Does (b) not apply to (c)?

 3                MS. FREELAND:       (b) does apply to (c), Your

 4   Honor, and I'm glad that you raised that because 3582(b)

 5   is significant in that it does not distinguish the

 6   effect of finality of remands, modifications under

 7   3582(c); it's the judgment of conviction -- the

 8   conviction that remains final.           The sentence is no

 9   longer final if modified under any of the provisions

10   listed in 3582(b).

11                If there are no further questions, I'd

12   like to reserve the remainder of my time.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, Ms.

16               ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER

17                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18                MS. KRUGER:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19   please the Court:

20                The provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act

21   at issue in this case, unlike the provisions that were

22   at issue in Booker, do not govern the imposition of

23   sentence.   They instead provide a discretionary

24   mechanism for the exercise of leniency for defendants

25   who have already been sentenced.            The district court in

                                     27

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   this case properly exercised its authority under the

 2   statute to reduce Petitioner's sentence by a little bit

 3   more than 4 years, which was the maximum amount of

 4   reduction that was consistent with the Sentencing

 5   Commission's specification under section 994(u) about

 6   whether and to what extent its crack cocaine amendments

 7   warranted reductions in already imposed sentences.

 8               The district court had neither a further

 9   obligation nor indeed the authority to set Petitioner's

10   sentence aside altogether and resentence Petitioner

11   under the advisory guidelines regime announced in

12   Booker.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Does that extend to --

14   which was part of this case -- the court notices that

15   there was a technical error; it was a calculation error

16   the first time, and the judge says, well, I'll fix

17   that up, too.   That was an arithmetic error.

18               MS. KRUGER:     Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the same

19   rule applies to the calculation error that Petitioner is

20   raising.

21               Section 3582(c)(2) wasn't designed by

22   Congress to serve as effectively a less restrictive

23   substitute for raising such challenges on direct appeal

24   or where otherwise available under section 2255.           It was

25   instead designed for the limited purpose of providing an

                                    28

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   opportunity to extend leniency to defendants whose

 2   sentences are otherwise final, nonappealable, and

 3   therefore not subject to any modification.

 4                Justice Sotomayor, you had asked earlier

 5   whether this provision was designed as an act of

 6   clemency or was instead designed as a kind of adjunct to

 7   the court's judicial review power, a kind of 2255-type

 8   power.   We think the answer is clearly that it was

 9   designed as a mechanism for the exercise of a type of

10   clemency power.   I think that's particularly clear if

11   you look at the parallel provisions in section

12   3582(c)(1), which are reprinted at pages 3a and 4a of the

13   appendix to the government's brief.

14                Those provisions also provide for similar

15   types of sentence reductions in cases where the director

16   of the Bureau of Prisons makes a motion for sentence

17   reduction based either on extraordinary and compelling

18   reasons or because the defendant is over the age of 70

19   and has served more than 30 years in prison.

20                In all of these cases, the district court

21   exercises a discretionary power to reduce the sentence

22   in the exercise of leniency, not because of legal error

23   but for equitable reasons.

24                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Well, that gets tied up,

25   doesn't it, to your argument that this is not a part of

                                    29

 1   the criminal prosecution, that this is a -- not a Sixth

 2   Amendment proceeding, but -- not a Sixth Amendment

 3   proceeding, so it doesn't require constitutional

 4   protection?

 5                 MS. KRUGER:     That's correct, Justice

 6   Sotomayor.    We think that what Congress has called for

 7   in all of the sentence reduction provisions of section

 8   3582(c) is a kind of discretionary mechanism for

 9   reducing sentences that are already final and

10   nonappealable and can't be modified in any other respect.

11   It hasn't called for a de novo plenary resentencing so

12   to allow defendants in the position that Petitioner is

13   in to come into court and reopen every aspect of their

14   sentence, requiring reconsideration of guidelines

15   determinations made in this case more than a decade ago

16   or requiring application of intervening changes in the

17   law.

18                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Am I correct in

19   understanding that 3582(c) was enacted prior to our

20   decision in Booker?

21                 MS. KRUGER:     Yes, it -- it was.

22                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            And is it clear that it

23   should be construed as though the system was mandatory

24   before the decision in Booker, rather than construed in

25   the light of the remedial decision in Booker?

                                      30

 1               MS. KRUGER:       Well, I think there are two

 2   questions that are raised here about how this statutory

 3   scheme comports with Booker.              One is the Sixth Amendment

 4   question, whether this is a statutory provision that

 5   calls for a resentencing, at which Booker and its

 6   decision about the Sixth Amendment would apply.

 7               And then the second question is even if you

 8   think there is no constitutional problem with reading

 9   the statute in accordance with its plain terms, whether

10   Booker's remedial analysis requires treating the

11   reference to the policy statements in section 3582(c)(2)

12   as purely advisory.

13               We think with respect to that question, not

14   even Petitioner is quite willing to embrace the full

15   consequences of that argument.              It would mean severing

16   and excising the portion of 3582(c)(2) that requires

17   consistency with the applicable policy statements.

18               JUSTICE STEVENS:              Right.   Is that any more

19   a dramatic change than was made in the Booker remedial

20   opinion itself?

21               MS. KRUGER:       I'm not sure whether or not

22   it's a more dramatic change in terms of the number of

23   cases that would be affected, but it's --

24               JUSTICE STEVENS:              But the remedial opinion

25   basically rewrote the whole statute on -- except first

                                      31

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   it didn't have to reach 3582(c), but it certainly

 2   changed the -- the nature of the mandatory provisions

 3   that were previously in the statute.

 4               MS. KRUGER:    That's true, and it did so in

 5   order to solve the constitutional difficulties that were

 6   created by a mandatory guidelines system with respect to

 7   the imposition of sentence.

 8               Without that same kind of Sixth Amendment

 9   violation in the context of discretionary sentence

10   reduction proceedings, we think there is no basis in

11   Booker's analysis for severing and excising any portion

12   of 3582(c)(2), but I would note that the consequence of

13   severing and excising the requirement of consistency with

14   the applicable policy statements would be to free

15   district courts not only from the Sentencing

16   Commission's specifications about how much to reduce

17   sentences, but also which of its amendments to the

18   guidelines would justify retroactive application,

19   because it is after all in a policy statement, section

20   1B1.10, that the Sentencing Commission has specified

21   which of its amendments, among many, justify sentence

22   reductions under 3582(c)(2).           That would mean that every

23   time the Sentencing Commission revises its guidelines

24   and reduces applicable sentencing ranges, any number of

25   defendants would be free to come to the district courts

                                   32

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   and ask them to make their own independent judgment

 2   about whether or not they should be effectively

 3   resentenced as a consequence.             And that would certainly

 4   provide a significant disincentive for the Sentencing

 5   Commission ever to revise sentencing guidelines in a

 6   downward direction.

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Have there been other

 8   guidelines ranges that have been reduced, and, if so,

 9   were those also retroactive?

10                MS. KRUGER:      There have -- there have been

11   many guidelines ranges that have been reduced over the

12   course of the existence of the sentencing guidelines.             I

13   believe that right now, the current number of -- of

14   guidelines amendments the Sentencing Commission has made

15   retroactive stands at 27.

16                This was the -- one of the first decisions

17   that the Sentencing Commission made about retroactivity

18   in the wake of Booker, and it did so with full

19   consciousness of the potential for broadly reopening

20   sentences.   And it certainly weighed very heavily in the

21   Sentencing Commission's deliberations that the

22   traditional understanding, existing long before Booker

23   was ever decided, was that 3582(c)(2) proceedings do not

24   constitute plenary resentencings that incorporate all

25   intervening changes to the law.

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:         Can -- can I ask you a

 2   different question on the secondary argument that they

 3   make?   When I read the secondary argument, that there

 4   was an error in the calculation of the guidelines and

 5   she would like to have that error corrected, I didn't

 6   see anything in the policy statement that would prevent

 7   her from getting that correction.

 8                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           I think you told me -- I

 9   asked you that question, and you told me it could not be

10   corrected, because everything was final.

11                MS. KRUGER:     That's correct --

12                JUSTICE BREYER:         But why?

13                MS. KRUGER:     -- and the policy statement

14   actually also --

15                JUSTICE BREYER:         What in the policy

16   statement?   Because what it says is:             What you're

17   supposed to do is:   Judge, you go and look at the

18   guidelines that were applied.            Now, substitute the

19   new one reducing the sentence for the old one, and

20   then go apply it.

21                And, therefore, that seems to me not to

22   block a claim that would say, when you apply these

23   guidelines with the new one substituted for the old one,

24   apply them; that is, if, in fact, there was an error

25   the first time.

 1               Now, she may have a hard time showing that,

 2   but if she can show it, what in the words that are right

 3   there in (b)(1) stops her from getting that correction?

10   "In making such determination, the court shall

11   substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c)" --

12               JUSTICE BREYER:      That's right.

17   guideline application decisions unaffected."

18               JUSTICE BREYER:      Well, all other guideline

19   application decisions, and the claim is that they just

20   made an error, like a clerical error, a clear error,

21   manifest injustice, in that first math.           Do you think

22   that this would leave them unaffected?

 1   meaning of the Sentencing Commission's directive there.

 2   I would say that the question --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:          I guess they also made a

 4   mistake in not applying Booker, right?

 5               (Laughter.)

 6               MS. KRUGER:      Well, the premise of that

 7   question, I think, assumes two things.             It assumes that

 8   3582(c)(2) proceedings are plenary sentencings at which

 9   Booker applies, which the Sentencing Commission, based

10   on a very long history of rejections and precisely

11   that parameter.

12               JUSTICE BREYER:          No, no.      I would have thought

13   the objection to that is:        No, they didn't make a mistake

14   in applying Booker, because this Court has said that Booker

15   isn't retroactive.

16               MS. KRUGER:      Well --

17               JUSTICE BREYER:          And, of course, they did make

18   a mistake if it is retroactive.            And then the Court should

19   have said it is retroactive, in which case there would

20   be no problem.

21               MS. KRUGER:      Well, if Booker were

22   retroactive, I think that our position would still be

23   that this is not the proper vehicle for applying it,

24   that the proper vehicle would be to file a motion for --

25   to vacate or set aside the sentence under section 2255.

 1                  Congress didn't intend these sentence

 2   reduction proceedings to serve essentially the same

 3   purpose.     It -- it intended them to serve simply the

 4   purpose of reducing otherwise final, nonappealable

 5   sentences.     I would say --

 6                  JUSTICE BREYER:        I know my word was:    It

 7   shall leave all other guideline application decisions.

 8   Well, that's -- that's -- their claim is not that the

 9   guideline -- it's that they -- they chose the wrong

10   guideline or they didn't apply the right words.             You

11   see, so they weren't applying that -- they just applied

12   the wrong thing.     Now you say I'm working too hard.

13   Okay.

14                  MS. KRUGER:    I think you may be working a

15   little hard, Justice Breyer.

16                  (Laughter.)

17                  MS. KRUGER:    I would say that, on that

18   point, we also fundamentally disagree with Petitioner's

19   submission that there was any error in the calculation

20   of his criminal history score in 1993.

21                  But to the extent that Petitioner wanted to

22   raise any challenges to that determination, we think the

23   appropriate time and place to do that would have been on

24   direct appeal of that sentencing decision, rather than

25   waiting a decade and attempting to use the 3582(c)(2)

 1   proceedings as a kind of vehicle for collaterally

 2   reopening that aspect of his sentence.

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           When the judge considers

 4   the adjustment motion under the -- under the section,

 5   does he consider how the prisoner has behaved in prison;

 6   i.e., if he has behaved very badly, he doesn't give

 7   the -- the reduction?

 8               MS. KRUGER:    The district court can consider

 9   any disciplinary proceedings that have occurred in the

10   course of the defendant's imprisonment, yes.

11               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But he -- but he can't go

12   below.

13               The -- the Petitioner makes the argument

14   metaphysically that there's just a new sentence.           In

15   your view, is that refuted by the language of (c)(2)

16   because they talk about in the case of a defendant who

17   has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment, and then

18   they say the term can be reduced, and it doesn't use the

19   words "a new sentence shall be imposed"?           I assume that's

20   your argument.

21               MS. KRUGER:    I mean, I think that that

22   certainly reinforces the conclusion that I think also

23   arises from other aspects of the provision, that what

24   Congress had in mind wasn't the imposition of a

25   brandnew sentence, but simply a discretionary reduction

 1   of the old one.    I think that's right, Justice Kennedy.

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              I'm troubled by

 3   your response to Justice Kennedy's previous question,

 4   that the judge can take into account conduct in prison

 5   and all these other things.          It does seem to open it up

 6   to other factors than the crack cocaine disparity, and

 7   once you're looking at other factors, why not look at

 8   everything?

 9                 MS. KRUGER:    Well, I think the answer to

10   that question is resolved by looking at the plain text

11   of 3582(c)(2), Mr. Chief Justice, which directs that

12   district courts have a discretion to reduce sentences in

13   a manner that's consistent with applicable policy

14   statements, but after considering these statutory

15   sentencing factors under section 3553(a), which

16   include, of course, the need to protect the public from

17   future crimes committed by the defendant, as well as the

18   history and characteristics of the prisoner.

19                 The reference to 3553(a) guides district

20   courts' discretion in deciding whether or not to grant a

21   reduction that's authorized by the Sentencing Commission

22   in the course of its statutory duty under 994(u) to

23   specify whether and to what extent its amendments

24   justify retroactive application.

25                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So, it's a one-way ratchet?

                                     39

 1               MS. KRUGER:       Effectively.         I mean, it works

 2   in both directions.     It can justify granting a

 3   reduction; in the case of Petitioner, the district court

 4   thought that the 3553(a) factors clearly pointed in

 5   favor of granting the reduction.              But it also -- those

 6   factors can work in the direction of denying an

 7   otherwise available reduction.

 8               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              The Petitioner's brief

 9   opens with a statement about his rehabilitation.                We

10   don't know if that has been contested.              You don't

11   respond to it.   But let's assume that's all true.              He

12   established schools, and he helped young people and so

13   forth.

14               Does the Justice Department ever make

15   recommendations that prisoners like this have their

16   sentence commuted?

17               MS. KRUGER:       I am not aware of the answer to

18   that, Justice Kennedy.       It is certainly true that

19   evidence of that type of rehabilitation factored into

20   the government's recommendation in this case that

21   Petitioner --

22               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              And isn't the population

23   of prisoners in the Federal prisons about 185,000 now?

24               MS. KRUGER:       I think --

25               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I think it is.   And were

 1   there -- how many commutations last year?                 None.   How many

 2   commutations the year before?              Five.

 3               Does this show that something is not working

 4   in the system?     185,000 prisoners?              I think that's the

 5   number.

 6               MS. KRUGER:       I -- I'm not prepared to speak

 7   to that question today, Justice Kennedy.                 I can tell you

 8   that the government very much takes those considerations

 9   into account when making recommendations about available

10   sentence reductions under section 3582(c)(2).

11               And, indeed, in this case, the government

12   agreed that the Petitioner should receive the full

13   measure of the benefit that the Sentencing Commission

14   had made available when it decided to make the crack

15   cocaine amendments retroactive, based in large part on

16   Petitioner's conduct in prison and his other

17   characteristics.

18               JUSTICE STEVENS:              May I ask this question?

19   Accepting the point that there's no constitutional

20   compulsion that they had to open up for a full new

21   sentencing, and I understand one reason for not doing it

22   is that you don't impose too much work on the district

23   courts for doing it, but could you explain to me why

24   as -- just as a matter of policy and good judgment, the

25   Commission would say, well, you can take a look at all

                                      41

 1   the negative factors that would argue against reduction,

 2   but you cannot look at any of the factors that would show

 3   why you should have had the same sentence that if -- why

 4   you should get the kind of sentence you would have

 5   gotten if you had been sentenced in the first place

 6   today?

 7               Because I guess this particular man is

 8   going to be -- spend 22 more years in jail than if he

 9   -- if he had been sentenced today.

10               MS. KRUGER:     The reason why the Commission

11   doesn't do that is because it wouldn't comply with its

12   statutory mandate under 28 U.S.C. 994(u) to specify both

13   which guidelines amendments justify retroactive

14   application and the amount by which sentences may be

15   reduced.

16               The Sentencing Commission would have no

17   power to simply say in its policy statement:           District

18   courts, you are free to reduce sentences by however

19   much amount you believe is appropriate.

20               JUSTICE STEVENS:           You think the statute

21   would have prohibited a more generous policy statement,

22   then?

23               MS. KRUGER:     I do think the statute would

24   have prohibited such a policy statement.           Yes, that's

25   correct, Justice Stevens.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:         But I -- I still don't

 2   understand how you fit into that your answer to the

 3   Chief Justice earlier that, in fact, the court can

 4   consider other factors in -- in 3553 when it's making

 5   the reduction.

 6                MS. KRUGER:     Justice Scalia, I think the

 7   answer is simply that the 3553(a) factors and their

 8   consideration under 3582(c)(2) is designed for a

 9   different purpose than for the consideration that goes

10   into the initial imposition of the sentence.

11                The point of considering the 3553(a)

12   factors, to the extent they are applicable, to use the

13   words of 3582(c)(2) --

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Yes.

15                MS. KRUGER:     -- is just to determine whether

16   or not the district court will grant a reduction that is

17   authorized, to the extent it is authorized, by applicable

18   policy statements.   It's not to determine whether the

19   resulting sentence, as an original matter, is greater

20   than necessary to comport with the statutory sentencing

21   factors.   It's simply for the limited purpose of

22   deciding whether to exercise discretion to reduce the

23   sentence in a manner that's authorized by the statute.

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:         I see.       But -- but I

25   thought you said you could take into account good

                                     43

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   behavior in that determination?             But that isn't --

 2   that isn't a factor that would cause you to disallow

 3   the reduction.     It's a factor that --

 4                  MS. KRUGER:    It's a factor that would cause

 5   you to permit the reduction, presumably.                It's one of

 6   the many considerations that a district court can take

 7   into account in deciding that it will, in fact, exercise

 8   its discretion to reduce the sentence to the extent that

 9   that's permitted by Congress and applicable policy

10   statements.

11                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But it -- it's also

12   a factor that would -- might guide the district court to

13   a decision not to reduce the sentence.

14                  MS. KRUGER:    That's correct.           It can point

15   in either direction in any given case.

16                  But the critical point is that Congress has

17   set the parameters for the district court's exercise of

18   discretion in these proceedings.             Whatever the district

19   court chooses to do has to be consistent with applicable

20   policy statements, including the Commission's policy

21   statement in which it's implemented its statutory

22   authority to specify whether and to what extent its

23   guidelines amendments will justify retroactive

24   application.

25                  If the Court has no further questions, we

10                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11                 MS. FREELAND:      Three minutes, thank you.

12                 A couple of points.          I wanted to answer

13   Justice Kennedy's question.          The court is not only

14   permitted to consider bad behavior in prison; under

15   1B1.10, the court is required.           The word is "shall."

16   And, so, all of these things and many of your questions

17   point to the fact that this is an adversarial

18   proceeding.

19                 Section 3582(c) describes a sentencing.           It

20   requires the court to consider all of the 3553(a)

21   factors.    It requires the court to be consistent with

22   policy statements.     It requires the court to impose a new

23   sentence.

24                 And the word "modification" that's used in

25   3582(c) connotes correction, not leniency, not grace.

 1   Those are the functions of the executive branch, not of the

 2   judicial branch.     And, in this context, the court decided,

 3   after the Commission reduced the sentencing -- the

 4   sentencing guidelines for crack offenders, that a

 5   correction was warranted.         There was an error in the

 6   prior sentence that 3582(c) permitted the district court

 7   to correct, and when it imposed a new sentence, that new

 8   sentence has to comport with current law.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Can I get you to go back

10   to -- you said something that only the executive can grant

11   clemency or ought.    What -- what about a program where a

12   district judge says I'm going to have this person undergo a

13   course -- a drug addiction course, and if the defendant

14   successfully passes the course, then I'll give a

15   lighter sentence?    That -- that --

16               MS. FREELAND:         Justice Ginsburg -- I'm

17   sorry.

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Did your answer exclude

19   that -- that possibility?

20               MS. FREELAND:         Justice Ginsburg, your

21   hypothetical -- the court is imposing a sentence or

22   conditions of a sentence, and once those conditions have

23   been met, the defendant is relieved, just as when the

24   conditions of a sentence of imprisonment have been met,

25   the defendant is released from prison.

 1                  One point that I'd like to get back to,

 2   because there were many questions about it, is this

 3   consistent with policy statements?                 Policy statements by

 4   definition do not bind.        The Sentencing Commission in

 5   this case changed the 1B1.10 to say that the sentencing

 6   court could not, shall not, impose a sentence below the

 7   guideline range.     1B1.10 for all of the 26 retroactive

 8   amendments that preceded the crack amendment read

 9   district courts should sentence within the amended

10   guideline range, and that's appropriately a policy

11   statement.     1B1.10(b)(2)(A) is not a policy statement.

12   It purports to be a binding rule.              And as this Court

13   knows, policy statements do not bind.

14                  JUSTICE BREYER:        Yes, but they do if

15   Congress says they do.

16                  MS. FREELAND:      When Congress says consistent

17   with policy statements -- and, Your Honor, I would
