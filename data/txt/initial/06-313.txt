 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   We'll hear argument

 4   today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver.

 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREA K. SPILLARS

 7                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8              MS. SPILLARS:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10              While this Court has laid out a framework

11   for reviewing prosecutors' closing arguments, the

12   fairness standard established in Donnelly and Darden is

13   by its nature a very general standard.                   Under this

14   Court's interpretation of AEDPA, the State court should

15   therefore be provided more leeway in reaching outcomes.

16   Nevertheless, the Eighth Circuit afforded no deference

17   to the Missouri Supreme Court's decision.                   Instead, its

18   improperly substituted its own evaluation for the

19   comments, looking at each of them in isolation and

20   without considering the totality of the proceedings.

21              That decision was wrong not only because the

22   court of appeals failed to properly afford deference to

23   the State court, but because when viewed within the

24   entire proceedings the prosecutor's closing arguments

25   did not deprive the Respondent of a fair trial.

 1               Applying AEDPA correctly, the Missouri

 2   Supreme Court decision was well within reason given,

 3   one, the nonspecific standard of fundamental fairness

 4   and the fact that this Court has never applied that

 5   standard to a penalty phase closing argument; and, two,

 6   because, considering the record in the entire

 7   proceedings of this case, the Respondent was not

 8   deprived of fundamental fairness.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, we didn't --

10   haven't applied it to a penalty phase closing argument,

11   but we've certainly applied the general standard to the

12   penalty phase.

13               MS. SPILLARS:          That's correct, Your Honor.

14   And it's certainly is not our argument that it would not

15   apply to the penalty phase.             However, there simply may

16   be other considerations, because the fundamental

17   fairness standard essentially answers the question, did

18   the jury base their verdict on the evidence or did they

19   base it improperly on the prosecutor's comments.

20               JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask one sort of

21   preliminary question.      Supposing the prosecutor

22   misstated the law in his closing argument.                Would that

23   be reviewable in this Court under AEDPA?

24               MS. SPILLARS:          I think it certainly could

25   be.   In Brown versus Payton there was certainly a


                                        4

 1   concern about the --

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Do you think his argument

 3   here contained any misstatements of the law?

 4              MS. SPILLARS:             No, Your Honor.

 5              JUSTICE STEVENS:               You don't.

 6              MS. SPILLARS:             To help answer the question,

 7   though, in that context, Donnelly and Darden set down

 8   some general considerations that, while not exclusive,

 9   help provide the post and beams of the fundamental

10   fairness standard.      So even assuming that all of the

11   statements were improper, those considerations when

12   applied to this case show that the trial was not

13   rendered unfair because of the prosecutor's argument.

14   First, none of the comments misstated the evidence nor

15   did they misstate the law.

16              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Well, just on your

17   assumption, to make your hypothetical clear, you, you

18   want us to assume that three or four times at least he

19   violated a constitutional standard?

20              MS. SPILLARS:             No, Your Honor.

21              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               I just want to know what

22   arguendo assumption you are making.

23              MS. SPILLARS:             The assumption is that under

24   the first tier in Donnelly and Darden that the

25   statements were improper in the sense that within the


                                          5

 1   context of the multi-factor kind of considerations,

 2   whether or not they were improper, because obviously --

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I mean, they'd be improper

 4   because they -- they were based on an emotional appeal

 5   that's improper?

 6               MS. SPILLARS:           It could be improper in the

 7   sense that it was a misstatement of evidence.                  I don't

 8   know that impropriety would include necessarily

 9   emotional appeal.    I mean, the Constitution does not

10   require a trial devoid of emotion.                  However, impropriety

11   under Donnelly and Darden was the first tier of the

12   multi-tier kind of Fundamental fairness test.                  So even

13   assuming that that first tier, that the statements were

14   improper, they still did not rise to the level of

15   fundamental unfairness.

16               Secondly, none of the individual comments

17   implicated the defendant's rights under the Fifth or

18   Sixth Amendment, nor were they of the very specific kind

19   of comments that this Court has found to violate the

20   Eighth Amendment under Caldwell.

21               JUSTICE STEVENS:             Don't you think the

22   argument based on the General Patton analogy told the

23   jurors they had a duty to do what he suggested?

24               MS. SPILLARS:           No, Your Honor.        I would

25   disagree.

 1              JUSTICE STEVENS:            What is the relevance of

 2   that argument otherwise?

 3              MS. SPILLARS:          I would not -- it was not

 4   particularly relevant.      It was probably an inartful

 5   attempt to imply or tell the jury that it was a

 6   difficult decision that they had ahead of them, one that

 7   they might --

 8              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Do you think if he said in

 9   so many words, you have a duty to return the death

10   penalty, that would have been a misstatement of the law?

11              MS. SPILLARS:          Yes, a duty to return the

12   death penalty, which certainly is a misstatement of the

13   law.

14              JUSTICE STEVENS:            And you don't think this

15   could be so interpreted?        You don't think you could

16   interpret that, that passage, that way?

17              MS. SPILLARS:          No, Your Honor.

18              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            That passage was in the

19   context of other statements in which I think it's fair

20   to say that he analogized the role of the juror to the

21   role of a soldier who has to have the courage and the

22   duty to kill.

23              MS. SPILLARS:          I think a reasonable

24   interpretation of those statements could be that the

25   duty was to make the decision whether or not to impose


                                       7

 1   the death penalty.

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Wait.      Why is it improper

 3   for, for the prosecution to argue that, given the facts

 4   of this case, given the aggravating factors and the lack

 5   of mitigating factors, the brutality of the crime, the

 6   only sensible decision for you ladies and gentlemen of

 7   the jury is the death penalty?                That's an improper

 8   argument?   Doesn't that amount to saying you have a duty

 9   to come back with the death penalty?                      Why can't the

10   prosecution argue that?

11               MS. SPILLARS:            It's certainly not improper

12   to make statements based on inferences from the

13   evidence.

14               JUSTICE SOUTER:               Well, do you think the

15   Patton argument has anything to do with the evidence?                     I

16   mean, the Patton argument -- correct me if I'm wrong,

17   but I thought the argument that referred to General

18   Patton was an argument that, number one, talked about

19   his addressing the troops before battle.                     And he was

20   telling the troops that unfortunately it is sometimes

21   their duty to kill.       And he said:             Go out there and do

22   your duty, which I assume any reasonable listener would

23   say, go out there and kill.

24               If a prosecutor, as in this case, tells that

25   story and uses that analogy, it seems to me that the


                                          8

 1   argument is not an argument based on evidence, but an

 2   argument based upon the situation, the situation of the

 3   jurors vis a vis a capital defendant.

 4                 And I would suppose that the reasonable

 5   inference from the argument is that they have a duty to

 6   go out there to kill, to impose the death penalty.                     That

 7   does not sound to me like an argument based upon the

 8   evidence specific to this defendant and specific to this

 9   case.

10                 Now, am I wrong?

11                 MS. SPILLARS:         No, Your Honor.            It certainly

12   was not a statement on the evidence in sense of was it a

13   discussion of the facts in the case.                     However, based on

14   the totality of the entire proceedings, it's clear that

15   that statement did not render the entire trial unfair

16   because --

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't understand your

18   concession.    Surely, the prosecutor was not telling this

19   jury that in all capital cases you have to come in with

20   a death verdict.    Surely, although he didn't explicitly

21   mention the evidence, the underlying premise of his

22   argument was sometimes when you have a case this bad,

23   you have to do your duty.           Nobody likes to kill, but

24   just as soldiers sometimes have to do that if that's

25   their duty, so also jurors, if you really believe that

 1   the evidence is so one-sided in favor of the penalty

 2   that the State is asking for, it's your duty to bring

 3   the death verdict.      I don't see anything wrong with

 4   that.

 5                MS. SPILLARS:           And Your Honor, to the extent

 6   that I would certainly agree that those arguments based

 7   on the strength of the case were not necessarily --

 8                JUSTICE STEVENS:             I suppose your concession

 9   about the duty is based on Chief Justice Stone's opinion

10   in Viereck, isn't it?

11                MS. SPILLARS:           Well, in the sense that

12   Viereck was not directly --

13                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Which did involve the very

14   word "duty."

15                MS. SPILLARS:           I'm sorry?

16                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Chief justice Stone's

17   opinion in Viereck talked about telling the jury that

18   they have a duty and condemned that.                      That's probably

19   why you made the concession, I think.

20                MS. SPILLARS:           I think the concession is

21   important to get beyond the statements in isolation,

22   because --

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              It's not just in

24   isolation.     Didn't this prosecutor constantly say this

25   case is not about Weaver, this case is larger than

 1   Weaver.    I think several times in the closing the jurors

 2   were told:     Think big, think the large picture, don't

 3   think about this individual.

 4                 MS. SPILLARS:          Yes.      However, the jury was

 5   also told that it was their discretion to spare his life

 6   at appendix 275.

 7                 JUSTICE BREYER:            It is -- I agree with you,

 8   I agree with you that we should look at the whole

 9   picture.     When I look at the whole picture -- I've

10   actually got a little chart that my law clerk prepared.

11   And what he did, he went through this and looked at a

12   case called Newlon and it was the same prosecutor.                And

13   the prosecutor was told in that case just what he

14   shouldn't do.    And now if we look what he did in this

15   case and look what he did in that case and look at the

16   law, the whole thing, not just little bits, it looks

17   like he did an awful lot of what he wasn't supposed to

18   do.

19                 You're not supposed to give an argument that

20   vouches as the U.S. attorney that I think that this is

21   what you should do.       So in Newlon he says:           I'm talking

22   to you as prosecuting attorney of the county, the top

23   law enforcement officer.           And here he says:       I'm the top

24   law enforcement officer and I decide in which cases we

25   have the death penalty and not.                Worse than Newlon, I

 1   would say.

 2                Then what you're not supposed to do is

 3   you're not supposed to tell them they're like soldiers.

 4   I mean, there's Supreme Court cases that say, don't tell

 5   them you're like a soldier doing duty.                     At least that's

 6   what all these prosecutors -- a case called Byron versus

 7   the United States.      So in Newlon what he says is:                 I

 8   want to impress on you, this is a war and it's

 9   justifiable to kill in war.              Here he says:         As in the

10   movie "Patton" and in the movie George Patton is talking

11   to his troops because they're going out in battle like

12   the soldiers.   And then he says:                And when you're a

13   soldier, you know what to do when you put your hand in a

14   pile of goo that a moment before was your best friend's

15   face; you'll know what to do; and last July this

16   defendant's face was a pile of goo.

17                Okay, there we are.               I mean, that sounds

18   pretty emotional.     It sounds like a soldier does his

19   duty and you're doing it.

20                And then another thing you're not supposed

21   to do is you're not supposed to tell them it's their

22   duty to the community.         And this is just filled with

23   instances where you hardly even know that there's a

 1   message --

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Who said he was not

 3   supposed to do these things?

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, there's a brief --

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm sorry, counsel.

 6   Maybe, counsel, if you could answer that question?

 7                MS. SPILLARS:         In Newlon, Your Honor, it was

 8   a due process case which the same prosecutor tried, and

 9   it was an Eighth Circuit case.              And in that --

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:           And is that the law here?

11                MS. SPILLARS:         No, Your Honor.

12                JUSTICE BREYER:           It's not?         Why did they

13   file -- is this brief wrong, then, the brief of the

14   former prosecutors giving the propositions that I just

15   stated and have the Supreme Court case next to each one?

16   Are they wrong, those prosecutors?

17                MS. SPILLARS:         To the extent that Newlon

18   sets out those arguments, no, that's not incorrect.

19   Those arguments were made in Newlon.                    However, for two

20   reasons Newlon is distinguishable.                 In this case there

21   were curative instructions given to the jury.                    In Newlon

22   there were no objections made.              So in this case, when

23   the prosecutor made the statement, for example, that,

24   I'm the top law enforcement officer, there was an

25   objection and there was a curative instruction.                    So it

 1   was not --

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:           Was there with the Patton

 3   and the goo?

 4                MS. SPILLARS:         There was not an objection --

 5   there was an objection to the Patton, but it was

 6   overruled.

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:           Was there a curative

 8   instruction?

 9                MS. SPILLARS:         No, there was not.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Counsel, I'm looking

11   at the quote, the statement, the reference to Patton,

12   and I have to say I don't read it as imposing a duty.

13   It says what the prosecutor says is that sometimes

14   you've got to kill and sometimes you've got to risk

15   death because it's right.          His point is that at some

16   point, at some times, you have to impose death because

17   it's right, not because it's your duty as a soldier.

18                Now, where is the reference to you have this

19   duty as a soldier in the prosecutor's statements?

20                MS. SPILLARS:         There is none, Your Honor.

21   And a reasonable interpretation of that comment is that

22   he was imparting to the jury the duty to make the

23   decision, not necessarily to impose the death penalty.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:           In Viereck the words were:

25   "This is war, harsh, cruel, murderous war."                And the


                                       14

 1   prosecutor went on to analogize the jury's duties to the

 2   duties of soldiers and he said:               Do your duty.         Do you

 3   think that's a lot different than this case?

 4                MS. SPILLARS:          Well, I would distinguish

 5   Viereck on two grounds.         One, it was not directly a due

 6   process case as this case is raised, because it was

 7   raised under this Court's supervisory powers.                      Secondly,

 8   in this case there was -- out of the eight separate

 9   comments that the Eighth Circuit found improper, only

10   three of them were actually objected to, two of which

11   were sustained and curative instructions were given.

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But you just -- that's a

13   bit inconsistent with your point that Newlon is

14   distinguishable because there were no objections at all

15   and that was the reason for the court saying this goes

16   too far to the prosecutor.           But now you say when there

17   are objections --

18                MS. SPILLARS:          In Newlon the jury was never

19   told to disregard the statements.                 In our case the jury

20   was told to disregard the statements.

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Certain statements.

22   There are were many objections made here that were

23   overruled.

24                MS. SPILLARS:          Correct.             There were 12

25   objections made total.        Interestingly, though, the

 1   defense attorney did not raise objections to the

 2   majority of the comments that the Eighth Circuit found

 3   improper.     Now, while that's not dispositive, I think

 4   that the defense attorney is certainly in the best

 5   position to judge whether or not a comment prejudices

 6   his client.

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             To that extent the two

 8   cases were the same because in Newlon there were no

 9   objections either.

10                 MS. SPILLARS:          No objections at all.         There

11   were no objections at all.            In our case there were 12

12   objections, so clearly the defense attorney was on the

13   mark and was listening for prejudicial comments from the

14   prosecutor.    Of the eight comments that the Eighth

15   Circuit found objectionable in this case, only three of

16   them were objected to.

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Do you think --

18                 MR. SPILLARS:          So assuming that the defense

19   attorney was -- I'm sorry.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             There were two cases

21   cited as involving the same prosecutor?                   Was it Shurn

22   also?

23                 MS. SPILLARS:          Correct.

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And that there was a

25   significant overlap in the three charges in the three

 1   cases.   The prosecutor had been told in two of them, you

 2   went too far.   In this one, just in terms of what the

 3   prosecutor said in the closing argument, is this less

 4   offensive or would you say they're all on a par?

 5               MS. SPILLARS:            I would actually -- if you

 6   compare the three arguments side by side, the

 7   prosecutor's statements were tempered in this case.                      The

 8   decision -- when he tried this case, it was

 9   approximately five weeks after the district court in

10   Newlon had come down with the decision.

11               And there are statements that he made in

12   Newlon and Shurn that were not in this case.                      For

13   example, in Newlon he said this is the worst case ever

14   and in Shurn he said the same thing.                      He did he not say

15   that in this case.      So I think from -- if you do a side

16   by side comparison, his statements were actually

17   tempered.

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Could you tell us -- as

19   you know, AEDPA has the decisions of settled precedents

20   of the Supreme Court and there's the Supreme Court

21   standard, a very general standard that we can get from

22   Darden and Donnelly, although we didn't reverse there.

23               I take it that the counsel for the

24   Respondent is going to say:              Well, this is a Federal

25   standard, but the Eighth Circuit is entitled to apply

 1   the specificity and the application that it's given to

 2   this, so the Eighth Circuit's entitled to rely on its

 3   cases in reversing.

 4              Do you agree with that?

 5              MS. SPILLARS:          No, Your Honor.

 6              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I assume that's what

 7   they're going to tell us.

 8              MS. SPILLARS:          No, Your Honor, I would not

 9   agree.

10              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Why.

11              MS. SPILLARS:          Clearly, it's not established

12   law by this Court, and this Court has not specifically

13   outlined the kind of post and beam that would result in

14   a reversal in a penalty phase Closing argument.

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:            It says that in the text,

16   doesn't it, "clearly established by the Supreme Court"?

17   Is that not in the text of the statute?

18              MS. SPILLARS:          Correct, yes.

19              JUSTICE BREYER:            So those things that are

20   improper for a prosecutor to make in summing up in the

21   guilt phase, are they then proper to say, exactly those

22   things, in a sentencing phase with capital -- with --

23   you know, capital sentencing?

24              MS. SPILLARS:          Is it the same, the same

25   arguments in the --

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:            There are a number of cases

 2   in this Court that say what a prosecutor can't say,

 3   guilt phase.    All of them happen to be guilt phase, I

 4   guess.    You can't, you know, vouch.                    You can't use too

 5   much emotion.    You have to focus on what the defendant

 6   did, not on what somebody else did.                      I mean, there are a

 7   number of things.

 8                Now, do those -- is it fair or not fair to

 9   say that those precedents apply in the capital

10   sentencing phase, too?

11                MS. SPILLARS:          I think it is fair to say

12   that.    But it is also fair to say that there may be

13   other considerations that apply in the penalty phase

14   that don't necessarily apply in the guilt phase.

15                JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask you this

16   question about your position:              We are trying to find

17   cases that clearly establish law by decisions of this

18   Court.    Do you include in that group of cases, cases

19   such as Berger against the United States, and Viereck

20   against the United States, which were direct review of

21   Federal cases in which they say there was a denial of

22   the fair trial, but they're not setting aside State

23   cases?

24                Would it be proper for the Court of Appeals

25   to rely on those cases?


                                        19
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              MS. SPILLARS:          No.      And this is why.

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Even though those cases

 3   say in so many words it deprives you of a fair trial.

 4              MS. SPILLARS:          No.      Because of the very

 5   specific nature of the supervisory powers in those

 6   cases, I don't believe that in the larger context, the

 7   final standards, that we can say that those directly

 8   apply.

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 If those direct

10   Federal cases were interpreting the constitutional

11   provisions directly, they would count as established

12   law?

13              MS. SPILLARS:          Certainly, yes, Your Honor.

14              There was also no mechanism in this case for

15   the jury to apply any of the improper remarks to their

16   deliberations because they were properly instructed.

17   Instructions which we presume that they followed.               In

18   this case, the court read the instructions to the jury

19   before closing arguments, and a copy was also given to

20   the jury to deliberate with.

21              Four of those instructions, numbers 21, 28,

22   26, and 27, told the jury in various forms that it was

23   their duty, and theirs alone, to render a verdict.                  The

24   jury was also told in instructions 23, 24, and 26 that

25   it was -- that their decision must be within the


                                      20

 1   confines of the evidence.

 2               And thirdly, within the specific process

 3   laid out for finding ways -- mitigating and aggravating

 4   circumstances.   And finally, the last instruction that

 5   the jury heard before closing arguments was that closing

 6   arguments were not evidence.

 7               It is counterintuitive to assume that the

 8   jury disregarded those instructions as a whole and

 9   instead improperly relied on the prosecutor's closing

10   argument when they declined to find the one aggravating

11   circumstance that the prosecutor spoke most about.

12               At appendix 285 is the part of the closing

13   argument where the prosecutor discussed the aggravating

14   circumstances.   He argued to the jury that all four

15   applied, but spent most time speaking about number one,

16   which was that he had killed for money.

17               However, the jury did not find aggravator

18   number 1.   So the very aggravator that the prosecutor

19   argued most about to the jury, they did not find.

20               It's more reasonable to conclude that the

21   jury made its decision based on the strength of the

22   evidence and the strong evidence in support of the death

23   penalty.

24               Having rejected the misidentification

25   defense, the jury necessarily found that the respondent


                                       21

 1   was the passenger who had returned to the woods to shoot

 2   the victim several more times.

 3                JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I go back to my

 4   question?   Because there's a legal question here about

 5   what law we can look to under AEDPA.                     And actually, of

 6   course, it is a question of whether AEDPA applies, I

 7   suppose.    Because actually, wasn't this habeas petition

 8   filed two days before AEDPA was -- there's a footnote in

 9   the red brief that says -- raises that question.

10                MS. SPILLARS:          There was a habeas petition

11   filed prior to AEDPA, but it was dismissed and he did

12   not appeal from that.       This was filed after AEDPA.

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That was a slip on the

14   District Court's part, wasn't it?                 I mean, that original

15   petition that was dismissed because he had filed a cert

16   petition to this Court should not have been dismissed,

17   it should have been held, in which case the petition

18   would have been timely and would not have been trumped

19   by an AEDPA variant.

20                MS. SPILLARS:          However, Your Honor, he did

21   not appeal from that.

22                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, didn't he seek a

23   COA?

24                MS. SPILLARS:          Yes, he did.           However, he did

25   not appeal --

 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             This is a pro se prisoner.

 2   He gets his -- all the claims are exhausted, it's

 3   dismissed.     And he seeks a COA on that point.

 4                MS. SPILLARS:           However, the parties have --

 5   the respondent has not asserted that argument, that

 6   AEDPA does not apply in this case.                   And for good reason,

 7   because --

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Certainly didn't say it in

 9   the brief in opposition.           And we might not well have

10   taken the case had that point been raised in the BIL.

11                MS. SPILLARS:           That's correct, Your Honor.

12                Finally, given the overwhelming evidence --

13   it supported a finding that the respondent had carried

14   out an execution style murder for the purpose of

15   silencing a witness.        I'll preserve --

16                JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I ask this question

17   before you sit down?        In the Viereck opinion, Chief

18   Justice Stone reversed in that case.                      And one of the

19   reasons was the prosecutor indulged in an appeal wholly

20   irrelevant to any facts or issues in the case, the

21   purpose and effect of which could only have been to

22   arouse passion and prejudice.               That's part of our

23   Federal law.    Is that law applicable in this case, do

24   you think?

25                MS. SPILLARS:           Not directly, Your Honor.

 6   by State prosecutors?

 7                MS. SPILLARS:         Certainly not ignored, Your

 8   Honor.   But in the context of fundamental fairness, as

 9   to whether or not that case applies, I would argue that

10   it does not directly apply.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:           You have a much more

12   limited point, as I understand it.                 Your more limited

13   point is simply that this is not clearly established law

14   pronounced by the Supreme Court.

15                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Well, it is --

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:           In this area of

17   constitutional violation.

18                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Well, the question, I

19   suppose, is whether that is a constitutional rule.                 It

20   is established by the Supreme Court of the United

21   States, an opinion written by Chief Justice Stone a good

22   many years ago.   But you're argument is it is not

23   applicable to State prosecutors, as I understand it.

24                MS. SPILLARS:         Not necessarily not

25   applicable to State prosecutors.               However, in the

 1   context of fundamental fairness, does it establish a

 2   clear -- a rule in the sense of those kinds of

 3   statements will render a trial fundamentally --

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Why would it be applicable

 5   to State prosecutors if it is not a rule.                       I don't

 6   understand that.     Is it applicable to a State prosecutor

 7   or not?    If a state prosecutor asked you for your

 8   advice, is this opinion applicable.                       And you tell him

 9   yes or no.

10                MS. SPILLARS:           Certainly, it is something

11   that State prosecutors should follow in the sense of

12   what they should say and what they should not say.

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But they must follow

14   because it's the law, right?

15                MS. SPILLARS:           Under the -- it is not the

16   law in the sense of fundamental fairness.                      It is

17   certainly an indication of what --

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, where did Chief

19   Justice Stone get it from?

20                MS. SPILLARS:           I'm sorry?

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Where did Chief Justice

22   Stone get it from?      Just because of our supervisory

23   power?    I mean, if it's just Federal supervisory power,

24   then I think you could tell the counsel, he doesn't have

25   to follow it, it's due process.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:           You can't have it both

 2   ways, counsel.   I mean, you're really losing me here.

 3   Either it is our supervisory power and therefore the

 4   States don't have to follow it, or it is more than our

 5   supervisory power and the States do have to follow it.

 6   I don't know that there's any way to straddle that.

 7                MS. SPILLARS:         Well, I would argue that in

 8   those cases, it is a supervisory power case.                 And so to

 9   that extent, it's not applicable to this particular

10   case.

11                I'll reserve.

14                ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. BLUME

15                    ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

16                MR. BLUME:      Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

17   the Court:

18                As the former prosecutor's brief makes

19   clear, George "Buzz" Westfall's penalty phase closing

20   argument in Mr. Weaver's case contained a number of

21   improper and mutually reinforcing statements which

22   exploited the authority of his office, analogized the

23   jury's duties to that of soldiers in war time, injected

24   extraneous matters into the proceedings, and appealed to

25   the jurors' passions and prejudice.

 1              JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, I think they

 2   overstated the significance of Viereck.                Isn't Viereck

 3   -- does Viereck stand, do you think, for a per se rule

 4   that a prosecutor in a closing argument may never

 5   mention the word soldier?         Isn't that a much more

 6   limited -- much more limited holding?

 7              This was a prosecution during World War II

 8   of individuals for failing to register as agents of Nazi

 9   Germany, and the prosecutor said in the guilt phase --

10   and it wasn't a capital case obviously, in the guilt

11   phase of closing argument, that just as our soldiers who

12   are fighting the Japanese on the Bataan Peninsula are

13   doing their duty for the country, you have a duty to

14   return a guilty verdict against these individuals.

15              Now, isn't that very different from saying

16   that in a capital -- at the capital phase of the trial,

17   you have a duty to consider something that's very

18   unpleasant, and it's unpleasant in the same way that

19   what soldiers have to do in war time is different?

20   Isn't that very different?

21              MR. BLUME:       I think the historical context

22   is different, but this was set up in this case by

23   informing the jurors that we were involved in a war, in

24   a war on drugs in society.         And then he uses the same

25   story, analogizing jurors' responsibilities to that of


                                      27

 1   soldiers in a war.      I think it is also important to put

 2   that comment in the context in which it occurred.                       Not

 3   only in the broader context and the repeated -- the

 4   prosecutor repeatedly leveraging the power of his office

 5   behind this, but this came right on the heels of him

 6   saying, I'm the top law enforcement officer in this

 7   county.    I decide in which cases we seek the death

 8   penalty.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  That was objected to

10   and the objection was sustained, correct?

11                MR. BLUME:        It was objected to, and the

12   objection was sustained.           That doesn't mean that

13   comment --

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:             And a curative instruction

15   given.

16                MR. BLUME:        I agree with that.                But that

17   doesn't mean it's irrelevant for the due process

18   totality of circumstances analysis.                       And then he

19   proceeds from there directly in to the Patton analogy,

20   and I think if you read that analogy in context, he is

21   telling them you're soldiers in a war, you have a duty

22   to kill, I'm like Patton, I'm telling you it's your duty

23   to kill, go kill.

24                If you read that logically --

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Which in that case,

 1   AEDPA says we look to clearly established law by our

 2   U.S. Supreme Court decisions.             Which is the clearest

 3   U.S. Supreme Court decision that was violated here?

 4               MR. BLUME:       The decision that was violated

 5   was the rule of Darden, Donnelly, and Romano, which is

 6   that --

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, pick which one

 8   do you think is the most directly applicable.

 9               MR. BLUME:       Well, I think Darden established

10   the rule.   This Court applied it to the penalty phase in

11   Romano, and thus the Darden rule that if a prosecutor's

12   comments, the totality --

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It's not Romano.

14   Romano was an introduction of evidence case, right?

15               MR. BLUME:       Yes, but logically, if you have

16   established a rule for closing arguments, you

17   established it, you then say it is applicable to the

18   penalty phase for the admission of evidence, it would be

19   completely illogical to say it didn't govern penalty

20   phase closing arguments.

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 My point is simply

22   the level of generality at which the guiding principles

23   were articulated, which helps when you're applying it,

24   but in determining -- it is the point Judge Bowman in

25   dissent that when you don't have a case that's close,

 1   that you have more leeway in terms of the deference to

 2   the Court, because it's not a clearly established

 3   precedent of the Supreme Court.

 4              Yes, there are the Jenner cases that

 5   establish the general principles, but the question is

 6   how clearly those were contravened before you can say it

 7   violated clearly established law.

 8              MR. BLUME:       That is what this Court's

 9   decisions say, Chief Justice Roberts.                  I think I want to

10   make clear that we have two different positions on that.

11   The first is that any State court decision finding this

12   argument in its totality based on what happened and

13   based on the weight of the evidence in this case that

14   said that didn't render the proceedings fundamentally

15   unfair would be an unreasonable application of Darden

16   and Donnelly.

17              But in addition to that, the Missouri

18   Supreme Court in this case said the decision was

19   unreasonable because it failed to consider significant

20   portions of Mr. Weaver's challenge to this argument.                 It

21   did the analysis under a State law abuse of discretion

22   standard, and it refused to consider or failed to

23   consider several components of his claim.

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:            What do you mean, how do

25   you it failed to consider?         I mean, is there an

 1   obligation to respond to every single point that's made?

 2                 MR. BLUME:       Well --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Did they refuse to accept

 4   argument on those points?

 5                 MR. BLUME:       No.       But they -- on the first

 6   point, did they refuse to -- did they fail to consider a

 7   number of the challenges like the Patton analogy, that's

 8   clear.     He raised that in his brief.                    He said this was

 9   something I'm complaining about.                 They did not consider

10   it.   He raised the point about --

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            If they did consider it,

12   you mean they did not respond to that argument in their

13   opinion.

14                 MR. BLUME:       They did not refer to it in

15   their opinion.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            You don't know for sure

17   that they didn't consider it.               I mean, it may be

18   argument to them.     How could they not have considered

19   it?   They must have not considered it important, but

20   that's a different --

21                 MR. BLUME:       He also raised the point about

22   this is bigger than William Weaver.                       And that was

23   improper.    And when the State court cited what he said,

24   they chose to ellipses that out, and didn't even put in

 1                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, why is that improper?

 2   Is it improper at the penalty phase for a prosecutor to

 3   refer to the concept of deterrence, which by definition

 4   is bigger than the individual whose sentence is being

 5   considered?

 6                 MR. BLUME:       I don't think this can properly

 7   be considered a deterrence argument.                      When you say over

 8   and over, this is far more important than William

 9   Weaver, this goes way beyond William Weaver, this is

10   bigger than William Weaver, this doesn't just pertain to

11   William Weaver, then you add that in with the number of

12   comments about you need to give this person the death

13   penalty --

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, could a prosecutor

15   say, one of the factors you must take into account when

16   you begin to deliberate is the deterrent purpose of the

17   death penalty?    Deterrence is one of the reasons we have

18   the death penalty.

19                 MR. BLUME:       Uh-huh.

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            To teach us.         Can he say

21   that?

22                 MR. BLUME:       I think he could say that.

23                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So then now we have the

24   principle that you can talk about deterrence.                     Now it is

25   just the way in which he talked about deterrence?

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              MR. BLUME:        No, my point is I don't believe

 2   this is really a deterrence argument.                    Deterrence is not

 3   a substitute for moral culpability.                    We allow the

 4   deterrent function of the death penalty as a

 5   justification for it, but you couldn't give the death

 6   penalty to somebody who didn't deserve it under the

 7   State's scheme, in order to further deterrence.

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:            As I recall, he didn't just

 9   say it is bigger than Weaver.            He went on to discuss,

10   you know, the drug gangs.         And he says, they're not

11   going to be affected by the threat of going to prison.

12   They will be affected by the threat of dying.

13              It seemed to me he tied it very, very

14   closely into deterrence.        And if you say that deterrence

15   is okay for him to refer to, I don't know how there's

16   anything left to your argument about his saying it's

17   bigger than Weaver.

18              MR. BLUME:        I think the import of this

19   argument is you should give the person the death penalty

20   even if you're not sure he deserves it in order to

21   further the deterrent function of the death penalty.

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, but you're -- you're

23   saying look, he can make a general statement that we

24   have a death penalty in part for its deterrent function,

25   but he cannot make the argument that you ought to apply

 1   the death penalty in this case solely for deterrent

 2   reasons, i.e., reasons unanchored in the culpability of

 3   this particular defendant.

 4                MR. BLUME:        That's correct.                Not because,

 5   what this statement did.           Especially --

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Where?           Where?   Where?

 7   Where?    Where does it say that?              Where does it say never

 8   mind the facts?     Let's, let's give this guy the death

 9   penalty as a Napoleon said, "Por encourage les autres."

10   You know, he said it didn't matter which, whether the

11   general was guilty of, of cowardice or not; it would

12   help to encourage the others to execute him.                       Where is

13   there anything like that argument here?                      I don't see it.

14                MR. BLUME:        I think that us the logical

15   inference from the six or seven times he says -- in

16   variety of -- he says this is bigger than William

17   Weaver.   The one thing you've got to understand is this

18   is far more important than William Weaver; this is, goes

19   way beyond William Weaver; this does not pertain just to

20   William Weaver.     He says that on six or eight occasions.

21   And I think you could interpret that -- the logical

22   interpretation --

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:             If you let a person who is

24   as guilty as William Weaver go, you're affecting not

 1   drugs, you're affecting the -- what's wrong with that?

 2               I -- I fail to see any indication here that

 3   he's telling the jury never mind the facts.                 Never mind

 4   how -- you know -- how horrible you think the crime was.

 5   Never mind all of the instructions that the judge gives

 6   you about aggravating factors and mitigating factors.

 7   Forget all of that.     Kill William Weaver because it's

 8   bigger than him.

 9               I -- I just don't -- I just don't see the

10   argument.

11               MR. BLUME:       Of course, he does actually say

12   kill him now at another point in there.                 But I think if

13   you take those comments, you also look at those in the

14   context of where he goes on and on about the

15   consequences; you need to send a message to the drug

16   dealers, that's a huge theme --

17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            What do you think, go on

18   and on -- suppose he'd mentioned deterrence six times?

19               MR. BLUME:       I think as long as it is a

20   blanket sort of statement, that one purpose of the death

21   penalty is deterrence, that would probably be consistent

22   with this Court's decisions.

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Right.

24               MR. BLUME:       That's not what is happening

25   here, Justice Kennedy, especially when it is tied in to

 1   that, to send a message and then he also goes on to talk

 2   about the consequences.        If you don't sentence this

 3   person to death, then the animals will reign in the

 4   jungle and we can't have that in a civilized society and

 5   there's no point in having jurors, the dope peddlers

 6   prevail.   You put all that together, he is telling these

 7   people as the prosecutor in this county.                 If you don't

 8   give this person the death penalty there will be all

 9   these adverse social consequences.

10               And you wrap all this up; there is no

11   conscientious prosecute who could possibly believe that

12   these statements were proper.             No.

13               This argument is an outlier; it is beyond

14   the bounds; it contains essentially improper comments in

15   virtually every category that this Court --

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So Judge -- Judge

17   Bowman would be an unreasonable prosecutor?                 He

18   dissented; he thought these were not unreasonable on the

19   basis of on clearly established law.

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought Judge Bowman

21   said were it not for AEDPA this case might come out --

22   in his view this case might have come out differently.

23               MR. BLUME:       Judge Bowman --

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 The standard is

25   unreasonable in light of clearly established law.

 1                MR. BLUME:      Judge Bowman did say that.            But

 2   I believe the essence of his dissent was that, I think

 3   that he made the mistake which the Petitioners made in

 4   the cert petition, and he thought that there was no

 5   clearly established Federal law.               A point which is

 6   essentially conceded at this point in the proceedings.

 7                I wanted to --

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well no, he

 9   specifically recognized there was nothing on all fours

10   and that there these other generally applicable

11   decisions and he thought the state courts had broad -- a

12   broader range when there was no decision on all fours.

13                MR. BLUME:      Well, if I'm -- I'm sorry --

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I'm reading at the

15   bottom of page 820 in the petition appendix.

16                MR. BLUME:      Well, if I'm wrong about that,

17   I'm wrong.   But even -- I don't think it is also under

18   Justice O'Connor's opinion in williams versus Taylor,

19   you don't have to, this doesn't works at the level of

20   saying well, any one judge is unreasonable.                 The point

21   is, it's an objective standard, not is this judge, you

22   know, somehow out of touch here?

23                And I think -- so -- I wanted to make one

24   point before I forge about it, to correct one thing that

25   Petitioner said.   Mr. Weaver filed this prior to the

 1   act.     It was dismissed.        He did request counsel and a

 2   COA.     He did appeal this in the Eighth Circuit in his

 3   first appeal.

 4                 He appealed the improper dismissal of his

 5   petition.     The district court initially granted the writ

 6   on Batson grounds.       He appealed the fact that it should

 7   be -- his case should not be subject to the act --

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             You have this only in a

 9   footnote in your reply brief.                It wasn't raised in the

10   BIO.

11                 MR. BLUME:        It was not raised in the BIO.              I

12   did not represent Mr. Weaver at that time.                    But I

13   thought it was my obligation as an officer of the court

14   to raise this at the earliest possible opportunity.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:             Can I ask you, where -- one

16   of the passages that I thought went a little far where

17   is he says to the jury, the one thing you've have got to

18   into your head; this is far more important than William

19   Weaver.    This case goes far beyond William Weaver.                  This

20   touches all the dope peddlers and the murderers in the

21   world.    That's the message you have to send.                  It just

22   doesn't pertain to William Weaver.                    It pertains to all

23   of us, the community.         The message -- there are street,

24   et cetera.

25                 Okay.    Now.       That struck me, as you argue

 1   this is rather extreme.       Its seems to be removing the

 2   attention of the jury from William Weaver and saying you

 3   have a duty to send this man for other reasons.                Now --

 4   to execute him.

 5               But where do I find in the U.S. reports the

 6   case or statement that then says this is the kind of

 7   argument the prosecutor cannot make?

 8               MR. BLUME:      Okay.        Let me -- I want to back

 9   up, and I want to take on the premise of the question.

10   Which may be a mistake, but I think in determining, the

11   first part of the Donnelly/Darden standard is you look

12   at what the prosecutor argued and whether it was

13   improper.

14               I don't believe you have to have a United

15   States Supreme Court case directly on point for

16   everything the prosecutor said on that.                There are

17   decisions from this Court on a number of things he said.

18   There are also other touchstones, for example, the

19   standards on criminal justice which regulate what

20   prosecutors can say.

21               Then the way I understand this clearly

22   established Federal law to work, is you take what the

23   prosecutor said, you examine that in light of what

24   happened, what defense counsel did, what the trial judge

25   did, and the weight of the overall evidence.


                                      39

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              And if you believe that the prosecutor's

 2   arguments rendered the proceedings fundamentally unfair,

 3   then there's a violation of the due process clause.                  I

 4   don't think I have -- you have to show that there's some

 5   Supreme Court case directly on point going to each

 6   particular comment.

 7              JUSTICE BREYER:             You were talking --

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Even -- even the Supreme

 9   Court cases going to the other points, they didn't --

10   did any of them involve a separate penalty phase?                  They

11   were all just in the guilt, guilt phase of a non-capital

12   case, weren't they?

13              MR. BLUME:        Well --

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:             So that, so that when the

15   prosecutor was urging particular action, he was urging

16   the jury to find a person guilty.                He was not just

17   urging them what penalty is better or worse.                He was

18   saying for these reasons you should find the individual

19   guilty.

20              That's quite different it seems to me from

21   the situation in which guilt has already been

22   established.   The trial's done.             This person is guilty,

23   and the only thing they're arguing about is what the

24   penalty ought to be.      I'm not sure that you can

25   analogize, you know, from the one situation to the other


                                       40

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   in determining what kind of argument is proper.              Because

 2   in the former situation when the -- if the prosecutor

 3   says this is not just about this defendant, it's about

 4   the whole society, he's urging the jury to find the

 5   person guilty.    I mean -- and that's crazy.            You don't

 6   find the person guilty in order to stop drug

 7   trafficking.

 8                 But you do impose a heavier penalty in order

 9   to do that.    So I just don't, don't see the analogy from

10   the Supreme Court cases you have.

11                 MR. BLUME:      Well, I think that, I don't see

12   any reason why a principle which this Court has

13   repeatedly reaffirmed that a prosecutor is not supposed

14   to leverage his opinion and the prestige of his office

15   behind a particular outcome, would apply any less at the

16   penalty phase of a capital trial than at the guilt phase

17   of a capital trial.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           That's different.   Look --

19   it could -- could -- would defense counsel be able to

20   argue during the guilt phase of the trial, in an

21   ordinary trial where there's no separate phase, "ladies

22   and gentlemen of the jury, this person has a large

23   family that's dependent on him; he's a miserable wretch.

24   You shouldn't find him guilt.              Is there no mercy in your

25   heart?"

 1                  Would he be allowed to argue that?             Of

 2   course not.     Can he argue it in a guilt phase?             Of

 3   course he can.     And it seems to me in determining what

 4   arguments the prosecution can make you have to be guided

 5   by what arguments the defense can make.

 6                  The defense can surely come in and say

 7   ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you're being called

 8   upon to kill somebody.         Do you realize what a -- what a

 9   difficult, overwhelming thing that is?

10                  And then you say the prosecution can't come

11   in and say ladies and gentlemen, sometimes if you do

12   your duty, you have to kill.              This is the law here.     If

13   you find the facts this way, that's your duty.

14                  I -- I -- I think you're, you're taking hard

15   cases very much out of context by applying cases that

16   relate to the guilt phase, to a very special procedure

17   that we've set up in capital cases which is called the

18   guilt -- uh, the penalty phase.

19                  MR. BLUME:      Well, I disagree with that, and

20   to this extent.     Can a lawyer in a capital case argue at

21   the sentencing phase of the capital trial you should not

22   sentence this person to death because they've had a hard

23   life?   Yes.    Of course you can.             And why can you do

24   that?   Because according to this Court's cases, that

25   goes directly to the individual's moral culpability and


                                         42
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   whether they deserve the death penalty.

 2              The problem with many of the arguments which

 3   were made in this case is they are fundamentally

 4   inconsistent with the individual's moral blameworthiness

 5   and they can the jury to impose the death penalty in

 6   order to stop larger issues, to stop crime, to protect

 7   society.

 8              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 To -- to send a

 9   message?

10              MR. BLUME:       To send a message.                And if you

11   don't send a message, chaos will prevail and the animals

12   will reign in the jungle.

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What the defense

14   lawyer said to the jury in his closing was if you vote

15   for life, you are sending a message.                   He said if you

16   vote for life, you are still doing your duty.

17              MR. BLUME:       Yes.

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 How was that

19   message -- a different message, I guess, but he can

20   say send a message, but the prosecutor can't?

21              MR. BLUME:       No.       I think the important -- by

22   the time defense counsel said that, the prosecutor in

23   his opening statement had already made the send a

24   message statement about five times.                    She was trying in

25   that one limited instance to tackle that and say well,

 1   okay, if you give him life that's a message, too.

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So if the prosecution had

 3   not opened the door, that would have been improper?                  You

 4   overrule -- the judge said counsel, you can't argue

 5   about sending a message for life?

 6                 MR. BLUME:      I think that would have been

 7   completely within the trial court's discretion.

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You -- you think the trial

 9   court could tell the defense counsel that the defense

10   counsel cannot argue to the jury, ladies and gentlemen

11   there is nothing more precious than life and that's what

12   we're asking you to decide here and we want you to

13   assert the values of this community that we value life?

14                 You can't say that?

15                 MR. BLUME:      Maybe.         But I think that what

16   she -- but what she's saying here, though, is directly

17   responsive.    And that is also a factor which this Court

18   has noted in its decisions.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Suppose that you said

20   explicitly, the prosecutor -- which he didn't say -- but

21   you're arguing basically, it is a fair, sort of an

22   implication, suppose he said there are a lot of drug

23   dealers around, and he's one of them.                    And this

24   sentencing phase isn't about just -- just isn't about

25   William Weaver.    It is about sending a message to the


                                        44

 1   others.

 2               And if you execute him, even if you think he

 3   shouldn't be executed, you don't think he ever should

 4   be, but, you see, others will think that this is a

 5   message.   So do it just to give a message.                  Even if you

 6   think he never did it.       No matter what you think of him,

 7   you think he's the best person in the world.                   Still

 8   execute him just to send a message.

 9               Now would that violate the Constitution?

10               MR. BLUME:       Of course.

11               JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.      Of course.     What case

12   in the Supreme Court would you look to to show it did?

13               MR. BLUME:       I think it would -- there you

14   would easily just look to this Court's Eighth Amendment

15   decisions which say --

16               JUSTICE BREYER:            You don't find any one

17   where anybody ever had an argument like that.

18               MR. BLUME:       Right.          It wouldn't be an -- but

19   it would be inconsistent with the fundamental

20   principles --

21               JUSTICE BREYER:            Ah.     Ah.      So you are saying

22   we should look not just to -- if we try to look for

23   exact, identical arguments maybe we'll get into that

24   problem?   Of having to uphold things we all know -- or

25   is that right?   Or what?

 1                 MR. BLUME:       Well, I think, you know, at some

 2   point, right, you can say well, you don't have a case on

 3   point because no one has said anything so outrageous.

 4   If a prosecutor went up and said look, ladies and

 5   gentlemen, the judge is going to tell you about

 6   aggravating and mitigating circumstances; forget all

 7   that baloney, go in there, you know, put all that out of

 8   your brain, and give him death.                I don't think there

 9   would be any question --

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            The question has been

11   switched here, Counsel.          The question before us is not

12   whether it was wrong, even if you answer there's plenty

13   of Supreme Court precedent, even though none on these

14   particular facts, to convince me that he shouldn't have

15   said it.

16                 That's not the question before us.             The

17   question before us is whether it violates fundamental

18   unfairness, whether it's wrong to such an extent that it

19   invalidates the whole prosecution and -- and sentence.

20                 That's quite a different question.             I can

21   acknowledge, yeah, the prosecutor, you know, shouldn't

22   do it.     But that doesn't lead me to the, automatically

23   to the conclusion that the Supreme Court jurisprudence

24   shows that this so violates fundamental unfairness that

25   the, that the verdict has to be set aside.

 1                 MR. BLUME:      Well, let me tackle that

 2   head-on.   There were a number of improper comments made

 3   in this case.    Most, many of them -- a number of them

 4   were objected to and the objection was overruled.               Some

 5   of them were not objected to.              The only instructions

 6   they got were two curative instructions on two points

 7   and a general evidence, not arguments, instruction.

 8                 So nothing was really done in the context to

 9   ameliorate the presence of these comments.               And despite

10   what the Petitioner says, this was not a strong case for

11   death.   The evidence of guilt was circumstantial and

12   hotly contested.    Even the prosecutor in his penalty

13   phase acknowledged, look, he might be innocent, but kill

14   him anyway.    The State presented no additional evidence

15   in aggravation of punishment.              Mr. Weaver had no prior

16   record other than a misdemeanor conviction.

17                 There was substantial mitigating evidence

18   presented regarding his character, his good deeds, and

19   other things he had done in the community and his

20   adaptability to confinement.

21                 This was not a strong case for death.

22                 So you take these comments, which were --

23   they're trying to contrast -- this argument is worse

24   than Newlon in most respects.              It was made five weeks

25   after he was told that this argument rendered another

 1   trial fundamentally unfair.

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Your recital was not

 3   a complete picture of the case.              This was an

 4   assassination of a witness in a Federal drug

 5   prosecution, with how many shots to the head?

 6               MR. BLUME:       I believe there were six.

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Six.   And the jury

 8   determined unanimously beyond a reasonable doubt that

 9   this was the guy who did it.            So you do have to look at

10   the penalty phase in the context of those facts.

11               MR. BLUME:       I agree.          But to say that -- and

12   they found -- and I'm not suggesting that that's not

13   part of the totality of the proceedings.

14               But there's one significant point there that

15   also I think needs to be taken into account.                 He was a

16   witness, but he was also a drug dealer and involved in

17   the drug trade and was a straw purchaser for these Shurn

18   families.   And in many instances --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, serve him right?         I

20   mean, is that --

21               MR. BLUME:       I'm not suggesting it serves him

22   right.   I'm suggesting that whether juries impose death

23   often depends in part as well on the moral

24   blameworthiness or how they perceived the victim.                 This

25   was not like witness, an innocent witness.                 This was

 1   somebody who was involved in that.                   And that normally

 2   makes it more difficult for the prosecution to obtain a

 3   death sentence.

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  What do you -- what

 5   should a prosecutor's closing -- penalty phase argument

 6   look like?   What are the sorts of things that he should

 7   be talking about?

 8                MR. BLUME:        I think in general they stick to

 9   the evidence.     They can argue that the nature and

10   severity of the crime itself warrants the ultimate

11   punishment and focus on -- the focus of the penalty

12   phase is supposed to be on the individual's moral

13   culpability and whether they deserve the death penalty

14   based on what they did.          This argument, most of this

15   argument I believe, as Justice Breyer suggested, it went

16   on for pages and there was no mention really in any

17   substance of William Weaver and what he had done.

18                JUSTICE ALITO:           Do you think moral

19   culpability is the only factor that can be mentioned?                    I

20   thought you said earlier it was okay for the prosecutor

21   to refer to deterrence.

22                MR. BLUME:        I don't think it's the only

23   factor, but I was responding to the question of what

24   should a prosecutor do and in fact what most

25   prosecutors do in most cases.

 1                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Can a prosecutor say that

 2   killing a witness is something that needs to be deterred

 3   and therefore it's important, it's appropriate to impose

 4   the death penalty here in order to send a message of

 5   deterrence?    Is that improper?

 6                 MR. BLUME:       I think something probably like

 7   that would be.    But this -- again, this went way beyond

 8   that.

 9                 The other thing that you have to look at

10   here is that then he goes on to say, and if you don't

11   give him death chaos will reign, society will fall

12   apart, there's no point in having a death penalty, and

13   the animals will reign in the jungle and you can't that

14   have that in a civilized society.

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Is part of moral

16   culpability that you take moral instruction from thieves

17   murderers on the street, as opposed to those higher

18   standards for which society seeks to aspire?                   Is that

19   moral culpability?

20                 MR. BLUME:       I'm sorry.            I'm not sure --

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Is it moral culpability

22   for you to take as an example for your behavior the

23   criminal population?

24                 MR. BLUME:       I still -- I'm not trying to be

25   thick.

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You're talking about moral

 2   culpability.    Is it part of your moral culpability that

 3   you take your values, your instructions, your behavior

 4   from criminals, as opposed to people who uphold the law

 5   in society?    Is that part of moral culpability?

 6                 MR. BLUME:      It might be part of the picture

 7   of what this person is like.

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well then, isn't it

 9   relevant what's happening on the streets, etcetera?

10                 MR. BLUME:      I don't think it's proper to say

11   if you don't give this person death then all these other

12   things which are bad for society are going to happen.

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Of course, the

14   defense argument was not focused on Weaver either.                   The

15   defense counsel said it was a vote for life, fight for

16   it.   Always fight for life, always, always.                 The

17   argument by the defense wasn't -- and it's hard for me

18   to imagine in a penalty phase how the arguments wouldn't

19   extend beyond the particular individuals.

20                 MR. BLUME:      But there's beyond and there's

21   way beyond and there's beyond the pale.                  And I think if

22   you look at all these things that were said in this case

23   -- I have read hundreds of these arguments -- no

24   conscientious prosecutor could have thought that this

25   was appropriate.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:             How do you answer the

 2   argument, fight for life, always fight for life?                     How do

 3   you answer that argument, except by saying:                     Ladies and

 4   gentlemen, sometimes, sometimes it's your duty to vote

 5   for death?   How else would you answer that argument?

 6                MR. BLUME:        You could answer it that, look

 7   at what this person did.           You look at his crime.            We

 8   have the death penalty in this State.                     In some cases

 9   it's appropriate.     It's appropriate in this case.                  It's

10   not appropriate to say:          I'm the prosecutor, I decide in

11   which cases we seek death.

12                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Mr. Blume, before your

13   time is up, I want to ask you one other question.                    I'm

14   still troubled about whether AEDPA applies.                    And was it

15   argued in any court below?            Was the question actually

16   ruled on after an adversarial presentation as to whether

17   AEDPA applies or does not apply?                 As I understand it, it

18   either does or it doesn't and it doesn't matter whether

19   it was argued.     But was it discussed in any of the lower

20   court decisions?

21                MR. BLUME:        You're talking about on the

22   basis that he filed before the act?

23                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Two days before the act.

24                MR. BLUME:        He filed before the act.             The

25   district court dismissed and said, believing erroneously

 1   --

 2                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            No, I mean in this

 3   proceeding.

 4                 MR. BLUME:       It was argued in his initial

 5   habeas.    It was appealed to the Eighth Circuit, because

 6   the Eighth Circuit initially granted the writ on Batson

 7   grounds.    So he appealed it at that point and the Eighth

 8   Circuit said, basically with very little analysis,

 9   determined that AEDPA applied because he had to refile

10   after the act and AEDPA applied to petitions filed after

11   the act.

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            And was that this habeas?

13   Then he filed a subsequent habeas or what?

14                 MR. BLUME:       It was the same habeas

15   proceeding.     It was a continuation of the same.              It was

16   then remanded back to the district court.                 The district

17   court granted the writ on this ground and then it went

18   up on appeal.     I don't think he would have been under

19   any obligation to appeal it again, having sort of gotten

20   a ruling on that in the same habeas proceeding.

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            If the Eighth Circuit had

22   had Lawrence in front it, it would have ruled

23   differently?     Or should it have ruled differently, in

24   respect to Lawrence?

25                 MR. BLUME:       I believe that -- I'm sorry, I

 1   didn't mean to interrupt.

 2                I believe Lawrence makes clear that the

 3   district court made a fundamental mistake in law in

 4   dismissing his petition and should not be --

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Under Lawrence the Eighth

 6   Circuit would have been wrong?

 7                MR. BLUME:      Yes.

 8                JUSTICE STEVENS:           And if Lawrence had gone

 9   the other way, then it also -- then it would be right.

10   In other words, whether AEDPA applies really is a

11   function of our decision in Lawrence?

12                MR. BLUME:      Yes.       Lawrence made clear what I

13   think should have probably been clear beforehand, that

14   you didn't have to seek cert to this Court in order to

15   exhaust a petition, but that was the basis of the

16   district court's ruling.

17                Thank you.

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

19   Mr. Blume.

20                Ms. Spillars, you have four minutes

21   remaining.

22                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREA K. SPILLARS

23                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

24                MS. SPILLARS:         Thank you, Your Honor.

25                I would like to address two points.                First,


                                       54

 1   it is not clearly established that deterrence arguments

 2   in closing arguments are improper, and for good reason,

 3   particularly because of the strength of this -- the

 4   evidence in this case and the fact that the Respondent

 5   had killed a Federal witness execution-style.                To that

 6   extent, as I understand the Respondent's argument, the

 7   deterrence rises or falls on however the prosecutor has

 8   prefaced his deterrence argument, if he says certain

 9   words to mitigate the deterrence argument.                However,

10   trials don't operate in terms of specific words that

11   must be pre-spoken before an argument can be valid.

12                 Secondly, in response to Justice Kennedy's

13   question previously, I would advise that prosecutors

14   should not use some arguments, not necessarily the

15   deterrence argument, but not that in every instance they

16   must not use those arguments.               This Court's supervisory

17   role in those kinds of cases allows this Court to turn

18   should's into must's for Federal prosecutors, but that

19   is not the case here.

20                 Second -- thirdly, the Viereck case is in a

21   historical context which we don't have here, and the

22   Missouri Supreme Court did consider the penalty phase

23   arguments.    At page 237 of the appendix the court

24   specifically said:      "We have reviewed the penalty phase

25   arguments."

 1              And then at page 235, the Missouri Supreme

 2   Court distinguishes Newlon and says that they do not

 3   rise to the level of the statements made in Newlon.                So

 4   to that extent the Missouri State court was not an

 5   unreasonable application of this Court's precedents and

 6   deference should afforded to that State court decision.

 7   For that reason we would ask that this case be reversed.

 8              Thank you.

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

10   The case is submitted.

12   above-entitled matter was submitted.]
