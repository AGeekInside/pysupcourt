 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We'll hear argument

 4   next in 06-5618, Claiborne versus United States.

 5                 Mr. Dwyer.

 6                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL DWYER

 7                     ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 8                 MR. DWYER:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10                 The district court's 15-month sentence

11   combined with 3 years of supervised release conditioned

12   on drug treatments and the acquisition of a GED was a

13   reasonable sentence.       In the uniform and constant

14   tradition of Federal criminal sentencing, the district

15   judge in this case treated Mario Claiborne as an

16   individual.    She considered the guidelines and after

17   doing so turned to the judgment that 3553(a) demands in

18   every case.    She issued a sentence to avoid unwarranted

19   disparity, to impose just punishment, and to ensure that

20   deterrence did not throw away Mario Claiborne's chances

21   to resume his responsibilities to himself, to his

22   family, and to his community.

23                 The court of appeals, in contrast to the

24   district court's careful attention to the 3553(a)

25   factors, focused solely on the guidelines.                 The court of


                                         3

 1   appeals applied its extraordinary circumstances rule.

 2   That rule re-tethers sentencing to the guideline.

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What would be your test

 4   of reasonableness for appellate review?

 5                 MR. DWYER:      I think a sentence would be

 6   reasonable if a reasonable judge on the facts and

 7   circumstances of that case would find that the sentence

 8   imposed was sufficient but not greater than necessary to

 9   satisfy 3553(a) standards.

10                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It seems to me that gives

11   very little weight to the goal, which I think is a

12   congressional goal, of nationwide consistency in

13   eliminating the disparities in the sentencing system

14   which cause great disrespect to the justice system.

15                 MR. DWYER:      I think that the statute speaks

16   of unwarranted disparity and does not speak in terms of

17   uniformity.    And there is necessarily a tension between

18   the individualized sentencing that 3553(a) requires and

19   concerns about nationwide uniformity.

20                 But I think that what distinguishes

21   sentencing under the advisory guidelines system from the

22   Presentencing Reform Act system are several.             One is now

23   we explicitly have purposes of sentencing and factors

24   the judge must consider.          3553 didn't exist before that

25   time.

 1              Secondly, in every case, as a practical

 2   matter, the guidelines are going to exert a

 3   gravitational weight because they are there.                 They must

 4   be considered as part of the statute.

 5              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Can I substitute

 6   "substantial" for "gravitational" without offending your

 7   position or affecting your position?

 8              MR. DWYER:          I don't -- my position would be

 9   that 3553(a)(4) is the correct place for consideration

10   of the guidelines.      It's just one of seven factors.               As

11   a practical matter, I think it's going to get --

12              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Kind of a weak law of

13   gravity like the Moon.         It's only at one-seventh.

14              (Laughter.)

15              MR. DWYER:          As a legal matter weak.         As a

16   practical matter, I think unfortunately it's going to be

17   very strong.   And I think one of the real dangers of an

18   advisory guideline --

19              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Well, I guess the question

20   is how strong should we say or can we say, or can

21   Congress say it is?

22              MR. DWYER:          I think that the strength should

23   be no more than one of the 3553(a) factors, because I

24   think the danger, particularly after 20 years of

25   guideline sentencing, is that courts will routinely and


                                          5

 1   mechanistically apply the guidelines instead of

 2   exercising their discretion, which now runs to the full

 3   limit of 3553(a).

 4              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Then it seems to me that

 5   to accomplish the goal that you want to accomplish in

 6   this case, you almost remove the appellate courts from

 7   the process.

 8              MR. DWYER:         I think the appellate courts

 9   are -- I think Booker considered a very deferential

10   standard of review.      The cases that the Booker Court

11   cited to illustrate the standard of review of

12   reasonableness were all highly deferential decisions

13   regarding revocations following supervised release,

14   affirming sentences that were many times what the

15   chapter 7 policy guidelines would require.               The court of

16   appeals necessarily must be deferential or I think it

17   pushes the system back into a mandatory --

18              JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, suppose the court of

19   appeals had done exactly what it did in this case, but

20   it said, we're not giving any special weight whatsoever

21   to the guidelines, we're basing this just on our own

22   evaluation of the sentencing factors that are set out in

23   the Sentencing Reform Act.           Would there be a problem

24   there?

25              MR. DWYER:         I think there would,

 1   Justice Alito, because I don't think that the role of

 2   the appellate court is to substitute its judgment for

 3   the application and weight applied to the 3553(a)

 4   factors for the district court.

 5                 JUSTICE ALITO:         That's a principle that you

 6   derive from what?    From the Sixth Amendment?           From the

 7   Sentencing Reform Act?        From where?

 8                 MR. DWYER:      Well, I think it derives in part

 9   from the Sentencing Reform Act, which contemplated

10   individualized sentencing.

11                 JUSTICE ALITO:         The Sentencing Reform Act

12   required, as enacted by Congress, required trial judges

13   to apply the guidelines, to follow the guidelines.             And

14   you're saying that the Sentencing Reform Act now

15   precludes appellate review of -- it gives the trial

16   judges unlimited discretion or extremely broad

17   discretion?

18                 MR. DWYER:      Certainly extremely broad

19   discretion.

20                 JUSTICE ALITO:         How do you get that out of

21   the statute that was enacted to narrow their discretion?

22                 MR. DWYER:      Even under a mandatory

23   guidelines system that this Court considered in Koon, it

24   recognized that the Sentencing Reform Act also had an

25   important goal of individualized sentencing.             And the


                                         7

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Court in Koon recognized that district courts in their

 2   institutional position have a special competence to

 3   determine what's ordinary in a case, what's unusual in a

 4   case.   The court of appeals lacks that special

 5   competence.    It sees only a tiny fraction of the number

 6   of guideline cases.       It doesn't have --

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So one of the guides

 8   for reasonableness review is what's ordinary in a

 9   particular type of case?

10                 MR. DWYER:       I think that what guides the

11   court of appeals on reasonableness review is to look to

12   the particular case and determine if the reasons on the

13   record in that case, the district court's --

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It's impossible to

15   do in the abstract.       If you're just looking at a

16   particular case, you have no idea whether 5 years is

17   reasonable or not.      There has to be a background to it

18   so that you know that in this type of case, people

19   usually get a sentence of 3 years or they usually get a

20   sentence of 10 years.        And it seems to me that what's

21   ordinary is going to be a judge -- a driving fact in

22   determining what's reasonable.

23                 MR. DWYER:       I think the court of appeals'

24   job is to ensure that the district judge provides

25   reasoned elaboration of its judgment on the facts of


                                          8

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that case that establish that the district court had

 2   complied with 3553(a), and on the facts of that case,

 3   selected a sentence which is sufficient but not greater

 4   than necessary.

 5                I don't believe that it is the court of

 6   appeals' job, as was remarked earlier, to become a

 7   sentencing commission and begin to reexamine and reweigh

 8   district courts' decisions.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Even if you're

10   looking at not just the number, but the reasons.                In

11   other words, the question I asked earlier, you've got

12   nine district judges, they all say we do not depart

13   downward for military service, and you've got one

14   district judge that says we do.              It seems to me that if

15   the court of appeals can't review that to bring about

16   some uniformity in the factors that are appropriate to

17   consider, then it's essentially a lawless system.

18                MR. DWYER:      I think it is not lawless in the

19   sense that courts of appeals need to determine whether

20   in a particular case, the differences it finds are

21   warranted on the facts and circumstances of that case,

22   whether the district judge has consulted the guidelines,

23   has looked at the history and characteristics of that

24   defendant, has looked at the nature and circumstances of

25   the crime.   And if those reasons satisfy the court that


                                        9

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   a reasonable judge looking at those facts --

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 On my particular

 3   case, what's the right answer for the court of appeals?

 4   They've got two cases before them.                 One, the judge

 5   departs three years because of military service.                    The

 6   prosecutor appeals.     The other, the judge refuses to

 7   depart because of military service and the defendant

 8   appeals.

 9               Should those -- what should happen with

10   those two cases?

11               MR. DWYER:       I think the same process of

12   review applies to each.        And it may result -- and that

13   process of review is on the record in that case, would a

14   reasonable judge have arrived at that sentence?

15               And that review may result in both cases

16   being reversed, one, or the other, or neither being

17   reversed.

18               JUSTICE BREYER:            Where does that come from

19   as a matter of law?     That is, suppose -- now you can say

20   I -- if you want, say my hypothesis is wrong, but if I

21   start with an assumption that Congress did want the

22   court of appeals to try to create greater uniformity in

23   sentencing, and it wanted cooperation between the courts

24   of appeals and the sentencing commission, indeed the

25   sentencing commission itself is an effort to copy a


                                       10
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   system that exists in Britain where courts of appeals

 2   create a degree of uniformity.

 3               Suppose I start with that assumption and say

 4   that's what the guidelines were about and the reason

 5   that number 4 is in 3553, it's not just one factor among

 6   many.   After all, it was attached to a bill that was the

 7   guideline bill.

 8               And indeed, the part we excised was a floor

 9   amendment that came along later to make it even tougher.

10   So if I start with the assumption that's what Congress

11   wanted, not what I wanted, Congress wanted it, now is

12   there something in the Constitution that forbids it?

13               That's where I start -- I am starting

14   personally with that question in mind, always, if this

15   is what Congress wanted, we should try to do it unless

16   there's something in the Constitution that forbids it.

17   And is there something in the Constitution that would

18   forbid the court of appeals to do what on page 91 they

19   did here, leaving the word extraordinary out of it?

20               Now, just going through the different

21   elements of this case and coming to the conclusion that

22   what the district judge did was unreasonable?

23               MR. DWYER:       I think there is a

24   constitutional problem with that.                And it is that if --

25   it reinstitutes the mandatory guidelines system.               And I

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   think if there is to be an effectively advisory system,

 2   sentencing cannot center on the guidelines.                  The

 3   district judge needs to be free to accept or reject that

 4   advice and 3553(a), instead of the guidelines, becomes

 5   the focal point for sentencing.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:            It's not mandatory.       It

 7   says the district, the court of appeals judge says, now,

 8   let's think here.     We have 8 -- 7 people on the

 9   sentencing commission that have really looked into that.

10   And they think that in an ordinary course with this

11   small amount of drugs, the person ought to get so many

12   months.     That reflects a lot of thought.               Seems

13   reasonable to us.     And here the district judge is giving

14   him half that or 40 percent of that without a good

15   reason that we can find.

16                 The judge said he did it because it was just

17   one little episode and we think there were many

18   episodes.     And that's basically their reason.

19                 Now, now -- what -- the Sixth Amendment

20   forbids that?

21                 MR. DWYER:       Of course, the court of appeals

22   did not adhere to your hypothetical in this case.                  In --

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Yeah --

24                 MR. DWYER:       The Eighth Circuit in this case

25   simply said it is not a guidelines sentence, it is an


                                         12
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   extraordinary variance and we are reversing.                 The

 2   district court has to consider the sentencing guidelines

 3   and generally that must be part of the reason --

 4   elaboration of judgment, so they will necessarily be

 5   considered on appeal.

 6              But the notion somehow that simply because a

 7   sentence is in the guidelines, all disparity problems

 8   have been resolved, is clearly not true.                 As the amici

 9   briefs, and our brief have pointed out, even under a

10   mandatory guidelines system, racial disparity increased,

11   regional disparity increased.              It's disparity that

12   individualized sentencing, the judicial discretion

13   necessary to do that kind of individualized sentencing,

14   can counteract.    And that is genuine uniformity.

15              As -- as you pointed out in the Koon

16   decision, or the Koon pointed out borrowing your

17   language from Rivera, the district court's special

18   competence to determine what is ordinary and unusual is

19   exactly the kind of information the sentencing

20   commission needs to determine whether a guideline works

21   or doesn't work.

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Aren't you really saying

23   that the most weight that the guidelines can be given,

24   or guidelines can be -- is that -- I apologize for my

25   voice -- the most weight the guidelines can be given is,

 1   is the weight of necessary advertence?                    The guidelines,

 2   in effect, are at odds with the rest of 3553(a).                     The

 3   rest of them say individualized sentencing.                    The

 4   guidelines, in effect, says, no, sentencing by the

 5   guidelines.

 6                 Therefore, in order to -- to break this, in

 7   effect, logical incommensurateness, on your view, I

 8   think the most that you can concede is that before a

 9   district judge sentences finally, he must show that he

10   has considered the value of uniformity as something

11   different from individualized sentencing, but that's as

12   much as he can be required to do.

13                 Is that a fair statement of your position?

14                 MR. DWYER:       Yeah.        And I think 3553(a), in

15   fact -- I expect Mr. Dreeben to say this -- talks about

16   uniformity, twice, in the sense that both 3553(a)(4),

17   which requires consideration of the guidelines, and

18   3553(a)(6) talks about unwarranted --

19                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes.      I -- I stand

20   corrected here.     I'm sorry.

21                  MR. DWYER:        But I agree with you that it is

22   a consideration -- and I'm not talking about a check

23   list.     I'm not saying that we just use a list and that's

24   enough.    There has to -- I think sentencing under an

25   advisory system requires reason and judgment.                     We tried


                                         14

 1   to stress in our brief that judgment is somehow

 2   different.   It may involve fact-finding but is not the

 3   determinant, the automatic jury kind of finding that the

 4   guidelines require.

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, as one of the themes

 6   that you advance, you indicate that if your approach is

 7   followed that the guidelines will then be adjusted over

 8   time.

 9                I assume they would be adjusted to be more

10   precise, but then we are right back where we started

11   because you want to give the guidelines very little

12   effect.   It seems to me, in a way, you're arguing

13   against yourself.

14                If your view is accepted and the result is

15   considerable disparity, I suppose all that Congress can

16   do is have mandatory minimums.

17                MR. DWYER:       I don't believe that, that the

18   results are going to be considerable disparity.

19   Certainly no more disparity than existed under the

20   mandatory guidelines which wasn't being addressed

21   particularly.

22                I think indeed there may be more

23   non-guideline sentences, but less true disparity,

24   because it really is kind of idle to talk about

25   disparity unless you are measuring it against something.


                                        15

 1   And 3553(a) provides those purposes, and true disparity

 2   is measured --

 3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Do you think it is idle to

 4   talk about disparity before the Sentencing Reform Act

 5   was adopted?    You remember those days.

 6                 MR. DWYER:      I do remember those days.           And I

 7   think there are two significant points about that.                 One,

 8   judges sentenced in the pre-Sentencing Reform Act,

 9   knowing that their sentence wasn't the real time served.

10   So that a judge may say 20 year sentence knowing the

11   defendant was immediately eligible for parole and was

12   going to get out soon.

13                 The real number was parole eligibility

14   sentencing.    So that looking at just the actual sentence

15   imposed did not tell you very much about disparity.                 And

16   none -- in the study that the sentencing commission in

17   its amicus cited -- that study explicitly said that none

18   of the studies looking at pre-Sentencing Reform Act

19   interjudge disparity considered actual sentences served

20   as opposed to actual sentences imposed.

21                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Yeah, yeah.      But there --

22   you know, we can go back into that, but there was a

23   whole history that people testified, tremendously, no

24   opposition, virtually none, that you needed a judge

25   wheel.   Why do you need a judge wheel in New York if, in


                                        16

 1   fact, the sentence didn't depend on the personality of

 2   the judge?     And why did you get different sentences

 3   across the country which I don't -- I've never heard a

 4   possibility of explaining that the judges didn't

 5   understand what the parole commission was like.                       That's

 6   a different issue.

 7                 So what -- what I'm concerned about is if we

 8   followed your position literally, what we're saying is

 9   that the Constitution of the United States prevents any

10   effort to create uniform sentences throughout the

11   country for people who different judges -- God doesn't

12   tell us what the right sentence is.                       We don't know.

13   There are reasonable sentences within a vast, vast range

14   of possible sentences.

15                 And you're saying we have to go back to

16   that.     And that wasn't -- I'm looking, in other words,

17   for you to tell me something that says we don't have to

18   be back to that, but we don't have to make it that rigid

19   either.    And that's what I'm looking for, to be honest

20   with you, and I haven't -- I'm not certain I get it.

21                 MR. DWYER:       I don't believe that sentencing

22   under an effectively advisory system under the standards

23   of appellate review that I've described, which I think

24   is the standard Booker described, is in a sense an empty

25   exercise on appeal, and leading simply --

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Could you describe it

 2   again?   Because I'm not clear what your answer was to

 3   what the appellate court stance is.                     I take it the

 4   appellate court would owe deference to the district

 5   court's determination?

 6                MR. DWYER:      Yes.

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And no particular

 8   deference to the guidelines?

 9                MR. DWYER:      That would -- yes, I would agree

10   with that.

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So what is it other

12   than -- is this arbitrary and capricious?

13                MR. DWYER:      I think that the court of

14   appeals will first look to ensure that there was

15   reasoned elaboration of a judgment complying with

16   3553(a), that the district court considered all of the

17   factors and arrived at a judgment that this sentence was

18   sufficient but not greater than necessary.

19                Secondly, I think that the court of appeals

20   under that deferential standard of review that Booker

21   described would look to see if this is a sentence that a

22   reasonable judge would find sufficient but not greater

23   than necessary on those facts.

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But the -- one problem is

25   that two judges, both reasonable, might approach the


                                       18

 1   facts in this very case differently.                      That is, one as in

 2   this case might think as she expressed it, to sentence

 3   him to more than 15 months would throw away his life.

 4   Another might say it's -- it's unreal to assume that he

 5   just sold 23 grams of crack when he admitted that he had

 6   been out on that same street every night for two and a

 7   half weeks.    So the quantity is much larger.                    And he was

 8   in that sense a repeater, so I'm going to sentence him

 9   to at least the bottom of the guidelines, nothing less.

10                 Those could be reasonable determinations,

11   two different reactions that judges would have to the

12   same set of facts.

13                 MR. DWYER:       Yes.       That is correct.         And I

14   think that is what will result under an effectively

15   advisory system.     But here we're talking --

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            In any case, you -- you,

17   you are not driven to the alternative that

18   Justice Breyer suggests, that there is no way to achieve

19   absolute uniformity.        It's very easy.               It was what the

20   dissenters in the Booker remedial phase urged, which is

21   use facts found by the jury and you can have the

22   sentences as rigid as you like.

23                 It is really only, only when you want to let

24   the facts be found by the judge that you come into the

25   difficulty that, that we're arguing about.                     But it's

 1   certainly not decreed by logic or by heaven that there

 2   is no way to achieve determinate sentencing.                There

 3   certainly is.

 4               MR. DWYER:         I agree, Justice Scalia.

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:              Do you agree?    Because I

 6   think that system would, in fact, give total sentencing

 7   power to the prosecutor, who would determine the

 8   sentence by the kind and degree of evidence that he

 9   introduced and what he charged.                So I agree that that

10   might produce some kind of judicial uniformity, but only

11   because the prosecutor would have total power to decide

12   what the sentence will be.

13               MR. DWYER:         Well, I -- I also appreciate the

14   dialogue.   And --

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:              You don't -- you don't have

16   to engage in our dispute here.

17               (Laughter.)

18               JUSTICE BREYER:              We're pointing out there

19   are problems to every solution.                And that's why I'm

20   still looking for the --

21               MR. DWYER:         And -- and one of the serious

22   problems in the solution that Booker chose is that while

23   judicial discretion, which I think 3553(a) requires and

24   mandates, and an advisory system requires, that, too,

25   doesn't deal with the necessary exercise of

 1   prosecutorial discretion which has an enormous thumb on

 2   the scale, and which the district court, in the day to

 3   day work of the criminal system in the courts, in the

 4   district courts, has a far greater appreciation for,

 5   than a court of appeals would.

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Dwyer, before we get

 7   to the prosecutor, you were candid in saying a district

 8   court -- different district judges could act reasonably,

 9   one of them giving whatever it was, 33 months, and the

10   other giving 15 months, both of those would be

11   reasonable and could be affirmed on appeal.

12                But one of, one of the arguments that was

13   made by defense counsel here was just there was -- there

14   is an irrational disparity between the penalty for crack

15   and the penalty for powdered cocaine.

16                Your predecessor thought that was so wrong,

17   he thought it was unconstitutional.                     I think at the very

18   least you ought to take into account that if this man

19   were distributing or possessed for distribution powdered

20   cocaine instead of crack, the sentence range, the

21   guideline sentence range would have been six months to a

22   year.   Now we know that Congress wanted to retain that

23   disparity.   Is a district judge free to say under

24   advisory guidelines, I am going to ignore the

25   difference, I'm going to treat this defendant as though

 1   he possessed powdered cocaine?

 2               MR. DWYER:         I think that the judge in the

 3   obligation of imposing an individual sentence must

 4   consider the advice of the guidelines but must also be

 5   free to shape and tailor that advice as the

 6   circumstances of that case require.

 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Well, specifically, can

 8   you take into account, can he say I'm going to treat him

 9   as though he possessed powdered cocaine?                   Can he do

10   that?   Yes or no?

11               MR. DWYER:         Yes.

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Even though we know that

13   Congress didn't want that to happen?

14               MR. DWYER:         Yes, because I think if the

15   judge can elaborate reasons to justify that judgment in

16   that case --

17               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   That's got nothing

18   to do with that case.        That's got something to do with a

19   judgment apart from the particulars of the case about

20   whether crack should be treated the same as powdered

21   crack cocaine.     It's got nothing to do with the

22   individual case.

23               MR. DWYER:         Well, I beg to differ, Chief

24   Justice Roberts, because the differences were predicated

25   on assumptions about the type of individuals who would


                                         22

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   engage in that.   And the court in her experience could

 2   look at it and say you aren't the typical crack

 3   defendant, you are more like the people who come before

 4   me who are involved in powdered cocaine, or you don't

 5   possess the violence, the weaponry and the other things

 6   that justified Congress's decision to create disparate

 7   sentences for these two kinds of cocaine.

 8              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, I think you ran away

 9   from Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical just a little bit.

10   Let's assume that Congress wants to keep this

11   distinction and let's assume that there's no

12   constitutional problem with the distinction.             There

13   might be, but let's assume.

14              Can the judge simply say, I ignore that

15   congressional -- congressional judgment is wrong.                I'm

16   not going to do that.

17              MR. DWYER:        I don't think that the district

18   judge's role is to make categorical pronouncements.

19              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Is the judge permitted --

20              JUSTICE STEVENS:             To what extent is the

21   Congress's purpose later than the Congress that enacted

22   the statute we're construing?             The statute we're

23   construing was enacted by one Congress and these

24   expressions came later.

25              MR. DWYER:        Well, I would resolve the

 1   problem by saying that the district judge must consider

 2   the guidelines.     The district judge doesn't sit in

 3   review of the policy.        It has to apply it to a specific

 4   person.    In a particular case, as in Mario Claiborne's,

 5   that policy produced a sentence that would have been too

 6   great.

 7                 And the application had some numbers to it,

 8   so she said it was more serious because it was a crack

 9   cocaine case, you're going to get more than somebody who

10   was involved with powder would get, but you don't need

11   to get as much as the guidelines call for, for the

12   reasons that she expressed on the record at the

13   sentencing.

15   unless there are other questions?

20                 MR. DREEBEN:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

21   please the Court:

22                 This Court in Booker concluded that the

23   remedial severing of the statute's provision for

24   mandatory application of the guidelines and a provision

25   governing the standards of review on appeal rendered the

 1   statute constitutional.       It further implied a standard

 2   of review of reasonableness of guideline sentences on

 3   appeal, and it did not elaborate what that

 4   reasonableness requirement means.

 5              The Government submits that the best

 6   interpretation of a reasonableness form of review would

 7   be one that conforms as closely as it can to Congress's

 8   original intent of minimizing and eliminating

 9   unwarranted sentencing disparities between similarly

10   situated defendants.

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:            As closely as it can, and

12   the "as it can" depends upon violation of the Sixth

13   Amendment by entitling defendants to sentences

14   determined by facts found by a judge instead of a jury.

15              Suppose in this case the court of appeals

16   instead of disallowing the lower sentence, approved it?

17   And then in the next case that comes up involving what

18   was the small amount of equivalent, 5.26 grams of

19   cocaine powder rather than crack, okay?                Suppose in the

20   next case it would have been 30 grams of powder.                And

21   the district court judge once again departs just the way

22   the departure was here, and the court of appeals says

23   no, that departure is unreasonable.

24              You now have circuit law which says 30

25   grams, you get the guidelines sentence; 5.26 grams,

 1   you're entitled to a lesser sentence.                  Okay?

 2              Why isn't -- why haven't we fallen back into

 3   the same problem that produced Booker/Fanfan?                   You have

 4   fact findings being made by the judge.                  It's a judge who

 5   decides whether it's 30 grams or 5.26 grams.                   What

 6   difference does it make whether that factual difference

 7   produces an entitlement to a sentence on the basis of

 8   the guidelines or on the basis of an opinion by or a

 9   series of opinion by a court of appeals?                  Isn't the

10   Sixth Amendment equally violated?

11              MR. DREEBEN:         Justice Scalia, as I think we

12   talked about in the last argument, in theory it could be

13   if this Court concludes that judicial determinations on

14   appeal are equivalent to guidelines promulgated by a

15   commission or statute, and if what the court of appeals

16   does is essentially function as a sentencing commission,

17   literally prescribing particular levels of punishment

18   for recurring sets of facts.

19              The Government's submission here is not that

20   the court of appeals has to do that in order to apply a

21   proportionality principle.         A proportionality principle

22   will look to all of the facts of the case and will try

23   to get a handle on, is this a reasonable sentence in

24   response to all of the facts and circumstances that the

25   judge articulated within --

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:            But if you have two cases

 2   that are in other respects similar, and the court of

 3   appeals has held 5.26 is too little to apply the

 4   guidelines, it's okay to depart downward the way this

 5   judge did, it seems to me that the next case that comes

 6   up, the defendant has an entitlement to that lower

 7   sentence.

 8               MR. DREEBEN:         Well, he doesn't, Justice

 9   Scalia, because the second defendant may not encounter a

10   judge who concludes that that quantity warrants the same

11   level of leniency or any leniency at all.               That judge

12   will retain the judge's classic discretion to look at

13   the totality of the facts and conclude whether a

14   sentence that would be below the range is a reasonable

15   sentence.   And unlike a situation that some of us might

16   prefer in which the court of appeals would ensure that

17   like cases are treated with reasonable consistency, the

18   system of reasonableness review on top of advisory

19   guidelines will not produce perfect levels of

20   consistency.

21               And what the defendant is entitled to under

22   the Sixth Amendment rulings of this Court is knowing

23   that if the law says if I commit this crime and these

24   are the facts that support it, my level of sentence is

25   this and no higher, that any higher sentence that's


                                       27

 1   produced by a fact finding gives him a jury trial

 2   entitlement.     That's what the Sixth Amendment entitles

 3   you.

 4              But no defendant who commits a crack offense

 5   can say that even after a series of court of appeals

 6   rulings that mark out various points of reasonableness.

 7   That defendant will not know whether the judge that he

 8   or she appears in front of will give the same kind of

 9   weight to those facts as some other judge did who was

10   affirmed or reversed.        Nor will that judge be able to

11   say what is the constellation of policy and factual

12   reasons that this particular judge will find in

13   announcing the judge's sentence.

14              So I don't think that a proportionality

15   principle runs afoul of the Sixth Amendment.                And I

16   don't think that it runs afoul of anything in 3553(a) or

17   any other part of the statute.                What the Court is left

18   with is the task of interpreting reasonableness, and I

19   submit it should ask the same question that it asked in

20   Booker itself:    Which alternative, the Petitioner's

21   alternative in this case or the Government's, conforms

22   more closely to Congress's original claim in the

23   Sentencing Reform Act?

24              The Petitioner's version of appellate review

25   as I understand it is very light review, if at all, of

 1   the substance of what the district judge does.            It may

 2   reach a truly extreme case such as if a judge said a

 3   second degree murderer, I think probation is the

 4   appropriate sentence.      Perhaps the Petitioner would

 5   concede that that would be arbitrary and irrational; but

 6   beyond such an extreme case that it is so unlikely to

 7   arise that Petitioner can feel free to give it away,

 8   Petitioner gives the Court nothing, and gives the courts

 9   of appeals nothing to apply standards to determine

10   whether a particular sentence is reasonable.            And that

11   is what the court of appeals have been reaching for when

12   eight of them have adopted this proportionality

13   principle.

14                JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I ask this question:

15   It seems to me that in sentencing there are two

16   different broad categories of decision that the judge

17   has to make, one involving the severity of the crime,

18   and the other the characteristics of the particular

19   offender.

20                And might it not be the case that you give a

21   greater presumption of following the guidelines when

22   you're talking about the severity of the offense, and a

23   greater deference to the trial judge when you're

24   evaluating the factors of the individual that might

25   affect the sentence?      There might be a difference in the


                                       29

 1   --

 2                 MR. DREEBEN:         I think at a high level of

 3   generality, that is true.            Because what the sentencing

 4   commission is good at is taking paradigmatic

 5   circumstances and assigning them a numerical weight that

 6   will transfer into a sentence.                And what the strength of

 7   the district judge is is looking at the defendant in

 8   front of that particular judge and seeing how that

 9   person's characteristics may map onto the policies of

10   sentencing.

11                 But I don't agree that that distinction

12   would support a two-track form of appellate review that

13   would give the district judge greater deference to take

14   personal characteristics into account and to impose

15   widely varying sentences.            That is exactly the situation

16   that we had in the pre Sentencing Reform Act era when

17   any district judge could choose whatever policies of

18   sentencing appeal to that judge, find the facts, and

19   impose a widely disparate sentence.                       And as the Court

20   well knows, there was no appellate review of that

21   exercise of discretion unless it could be shown that the

22   judge didn't exercise discretion at all.

23                 Now it is not an exercise of discretion if a

24   judge simply says for this crime, I always give the same

25   sentence.     That would not take into account the full


                                         30

 1   range of facts and factors that are present in the

 2   sentencing court and as a result, that wouldn't be an

 3   exercise of discretion.

 4                But in the pre Sentencing Reform Act era,

 5   the judge had pretty much plenary reign to decide what

 6   facts mattered.   If we continue with that same sort of

 7   deference on appeal in the Booker remedial opinion, then

 8   it's hard for me to see how appellate review can serve

 9   any valid purpose of channeling and ensuring some

10   consistency and uniformity in the way district judges

11   impose sentencing.

12                JUSTICE BREYER:             What do you think about

13   taking some of the Rivera ideas -- I'm slightly

14   hypothesizing this -- and following up with what

15   Justice Stevens said.        You'd say look, one thing a

16   district judge can't say, he can't say that I believe

17   the guideline is right for a typical case.                And I think

18   this is a typical case.          And I won't follow the

19   guideline.   You couldn't think those three things?

20                MR. DREEBEN:          I agree.

21                JUSTICE BREYER:             So one big power a judge

22   has that they didn't have before, after Booker, is to

23   say the guideline itself is unreasonable.                 So we're --

24   let's just say -- and there if they say that, the

25   district judge could decide whether or not, the court of


                                         31
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   appeals could decide is the guideline reasonable or not

 2   reasonable.     But leave those cases aside.               I imagine

 3   they'll be few and far between.

 4                 Now we take one they assume is reasonable.

 5   And now unlike the past, the judge has to do three

 6   things.     One, to give the kind of thing that -- the

 7   reason he's not following the guideline, which he admits

 8   is reasonable for a typical case.                  So what's the kind of

 9   thing that leads you to think yours is not typical?                    And

10   he says it.    And then he has the evidence as to the

11   related facts.     And then he has the degree of departure.

12                 As to the first thing, the court of appeals

13   could review it and decide whether it is or is not the

14   kind of thing.     As to the second and third, they also

15   could review it but only after giving considerable

16   weight to what the district judge thinks about the case

17   in front of him.

18                 Now maybe that's -- I mean, you might not

19   have a reaction to that.           I'd have to sort of think

20   about it.

21                 MR. DREEBEN:         Well, Justice Breyer, if the

22   system that you're describing is a replica of the system

23   that existed under Koon versus United States --

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Not quite --

25                 MR. DREEBEN:         -- then it runs into the same

 1   problem that led to the constitutional problem in

 2   Booker.   Where I think I would amend Your Honor's

 3   proposal is that if the judge concludes that this is a

 4   typical case but the guideline really doesn't prescribe

 5   what I think is a reasonable sentence and here are the

 6   reasons why, in the pre-Sentencing -- in the pre-Booker

 7   system, that could have been problematic legally.

 8   Today, it is not forbidden.            But what it should be

 9   subject to is a reasonableness review check on appeal

10   that take a look at what are the reasons that the

11   district judge articulated for that sentence.

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why, why do we assume that

13   the district judge cannot depart from the guideline

14   recommendation unless he thinks the guideline

15   recommendation is unreasonable?              He doesn't -- does he

16   have to find it's unreasonable?              There can certainly be

17   two reasonable sentences; and he's under no obligation

18   to select the guidelines sentence, is he?

19               MR. DREEBEN:         That's correct.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:            So he doesn't have to

21   determine that it's unreasonable.                I don't think we

22   should approach the discussion as though that's, that's

23   the situation.

24               MR. DREEBEN:         I do think, though, that the

25   Court should be concerned about each district judge


                                       33
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   formulating his or her own set of personal sentencing

 2   guidelines and then applying them in the court to the

 3   cases that appear on that judge's docket without any

 4   check on appellate review to ensure that, although the

 5   sentence might be in some possible world reasonable,

 6   it's out of whack with what the Sentencing Commission

 7   has prescribed and what other district judges are doing.

 8   If there is no check on appeal, then I do think that the

 9   clock has been turned back to the 1983 era before the

10   Sentencing Reform Act; and that does not seem to me a

11   reasonable interpretation of what the Booker remedial

12   opinion thought it was accomplishing.                   What the Booker

13   remedial opinion said that it was accomplishing was

14   providing an important mechanism that Congress itself

15   had intended, namely appellate review, in order to iron

16   out sentencing differences.

17               And our submission is that inherently means

18   some form of substantive proportionality review.

19               JUSTICE BREYER:            That's the other thing I'm

20   not certain about, the proportionality, and the reason

21   I'm not certain of it is I'm not certain what it means.

22   That is, it sounds nice, as if you're saying something,

23   but proportional to what?          I mean, I can think of two

24   problems.   One problem, of course, is that the chart in

25   the guidelines is written on a logarithmic scale and


                                       34
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that means that if you move from one level, from 9 to

 2   10, it's 3 months or 2 months; if you move from 29 to

 3   30, it's 2 years.

 4               Now, whether you're at 29-30 or whether

 5   you're at 9 and 10 might depend upon things that just

 6   have nothing to do with your reason for departure.               You

 7   might have added on something for having a gun and your

 8   reason for being lenient might have to do with the

 9   person's having a gun.        So you're going to say it make a

10   difference whether you were high up or whether you were

11   low down, when your reason for departing has nothing to

12   do with whether you're high up or whether you were low

13   down?   You see?   It doesn't actually work, I don't

14   think, proportionality review, because it's so hard to

15   say what's proportional.

16               MR. DREEBEN:          I think what is proportional

17   is a matter of common sense, and the eight circuits that

18   have been using this rule have not had a great deal of

19   difficulty in noting that you look at the extent to

20   which the sentence varies from the guidelines range, you

21   look at the absolute amount of time that's involved, and

22   have a sense of is this a significant deviation away

23   from what the guidelines would actually describe.

24               JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, why use the word

25   "proportional," because the other thing is what the


                                        35

 1   Chief Justice brought out, is that why is it that if a

 2   person has a bad reason, I mean, why should a bad reason

 3   justify a little departure rather than a lot?              And if he

 4   has a good reason, well, why doesn't it justify a lot

 5   just as much as it might justify a little?

 6              MR. DREEBEN:           If the sentencing court

 7   articulates a bad reason, namely a reason that's

 8   irrational or one that does not respond to facts of the

 9   case, then that really shouldn't justify the sentence at

10   all and what the court of appeals should do is vacate

11   it, send it back for resentencing, and allow the

12   district court to articulate the reasons why the

13   sentence that the court now chooses to impose is an

14   appropriate sentence under 3553(a).

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Mr. Dreeben, if we could

16   focus on the facts of this case and what the district

17   court appeared to do, she made a kind of proportionality

18   judgment, too.   She said this is a young man.             It's his

19   first offense.   He has a good family relationship, a

20   good work record.    I am making a determination that will

21   put him away for a significant amount of time.              But I'm

22   trying to figure the point at which he will lose touch

23   with his family, with his work, he will be thrown away.

24              That was the judgment that she made.               She

25   tried to make a sentence that would be significant, 15


                                        36

 1   months, but that would not be so long that it would put

 2   him out of touch with his children and his wife and his

 3   work.

 4                 Now, in -- by some measures that would be

 5   entirely reasonable.       But on your measure, it isn't

 6   reasonable.

 7                 MR. DREEBEN:        That's right.          And I think,

 8   Justice Ginsburg, you've done a better job of

 9   articulating a justification for the sentence than the

10   judge's own articulation, which did not focus on family

11   separation and employment to the degree that you have

12   now articulated it.      What the judge did was focus on the

13   quantity of drugs and the fact that the defendant didn't

14   have any criminal history and that he qualified for the

15   safety valve.

16                 She also said, without specifying any other

17   cases, that other cases that have come before my court

18   have had -- you know -- perhaps larger quantity of drugs

19   and very different sentences.              When a court of appeals

20   is asked to review that line of reasoning and try to

21   decide whether the outside the guidelines sentence is

22   reasonable, it makes sense for the court to ask, do we

23   know anything, for example, about what this judge is

24   saying about other cases with other drug quantities?

25   There's no specifics in the record that enable the Court

 1   of Appeals to measure the accuracy or the validity of

 2   that observation.     It's also relevant for the court of

 3   appeals to say the guidelines range itself has taken

 4   into account all of the factors that this judge has

 5   previously noted and what has happened in the sentence

 6   is that the judge has varied widely from the sentence

 7   for reasons that the commission already took into

 8   account.     Now, that doesn't prohibit the judge from

 9   relying on those facts, but it does mean that the

10   farther the sentence goes from the guidelines range the

11   more likely there is to be unwarranted disparity.

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But you did leave out

13   what -- she didn't elaborate on it, but she said, I

14   would be throwing him away.              And I take it what she was

15   saying by that is it would be -- he would be

16   incarcerated beyond the point where he could reintegrate

17   into the community.

18                 MR. DREEBEN:         Well, this brings me to my

19   last point about this particular sentencing, which is

20   that in this very case Judge Jackson looked at the

21   defendant.    She said, candidly I don't know really very

22   much about you other than what I've learned about in the

23   presentence report and I can't tell whether you're

24   unlucky or you're stupid, and then effectively gave him

25   a sentence that reflected, you know, a tremendous

 1   indulgence of a presumption that maybe this kid needs a

 2   wakeup call and nothing more.            What she ignored is his

 3   own proffer in the safety valve that he had been on a

 4   street corner for 2-1/2 months selling crack cocaine,

 5   that he was arrested and placed into the State system,

 6   put into a pretrial diversion program through a drug

 7   court, in essence being said, here's your chance, you

 8   know, straighten up, we are going to be lenient on you,

 9   we're going to give you an opportunity to reintegrate

10   with your family, and what did the defendant do but get

11   caught within 6 months with 5 grams of crack.

12              And on that record -- and this is what the

13   court of appeals said -- there's a disconnect between

14   the judge's conclusion that, with little information

15   more than what she had in the PSR, the kid deserved

16   leniency versus the fact that he had already had that

17   chance and he had not --

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Yes, but didn't the court

19   of appeals draw the inference that he had been

20   distributing drugs during that 6-month period and that

21   was not supported by the record?              Am I wrong on that?

22              MR. DREEBEN:         Well, Justice Stevens, we're

23   not relying on the inference of the --

24              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Would it have been error

25   for the court of appeals to find a fact like that that

 1   was not supported by the record and didn't it do it in

 2   this case.

 3                 MR. DREEBEN:        Well, supported by the record

 4   is something of a judgment call.                You'd have to assume

 5   that Mr. Claiborne was found by the police, 6 months

 6   after he had previously been arrested for crack

 7   offenses, holding a 5-gram bag of crack and that was the

 8   very first time after his arrest that he had been in

 9   possession of drugs, that just he got extremely

10   unlikely, the police caught him.

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           And the court of appeals

12   is willing to draw a factual conclusion that he had in

13   fact distributed during that 6-month period?

14                 MR. DREEBEN:        That's right.          And I would say

15   that a reasonable fact-finder could draw that

16   conclusion.

17                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           But should the court of

18   appeals act as a fact-finder in that posture of the

19   case?

20                 MR. DREEBEN:        Not in my view.         And I think

21   on this record that's not a fact that we're relying on.

22   It's not a fact that the Government --

23                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Is it not possibly a fact

24   that would justify the conclusion that they committed

25   error?

 1                 MR. DREEBEN:        This aspect of the court of

 2   appeals opinion in my view is not essential to the

 3   judgment that it reached, which is correct.

 4                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           It may not have been

 5   essential, but it may have contributed to their

 6   judgment.

 7                 MR. DREEBEN:        It may have, but what they did

 8   not mention is an equally validate reason for concluding

 9   that this is a defendant who is in effect a recidivist

10   even though he had no criminal history.                  He had been

11   previously arrested for crack distribution crimes.                     He

12   had admitted that this was not -- the occasion of his

13   arrest wasn't the first opportunity that he had to deal

14   crack.   He'd been doing it for 2-1/2 months.                 And the

15   judge essentially turned all of those facts off.                  She

16   did not really factor that into her sentence at all.

17                 And the court of appeals, although it may

18   have fastened on the wrong time frame in concluding that

19   this defendant was in effect a recidivist and not the

20   sort of blameless ingenue that the trial judge had

21   treated him as, the record does indeed support the court

22   of appeals' central conclusion, which is this defendant,

23   despite his criminal history, really looks more like a

24   recidivist.    And when you're talking about a defendant

25   whose mandatory minimum sentence would have been 5


                                        41

 1   years, but who gets out of that sentence because he

 2   satisfies the safety valve which allows defendant who is

 3   a first-time offender and meets certain other

 4   requirements to get a sentence under the mandatory

 5   minimum, that defendant's culpability had already been

 6   substantially reduced under the guidelines because of

 7   the safety valve and because of his criminal history.

 8   And the judge basically said:             I'm going to take a

 9   chance with him and give him a much lower sentence than

10   what the guidelines described.

11               Our view is the judge can look at the facts

12   she looked at, but she went down to a level that is

13   productive of unwarranted disparity.

14               JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask just one other

15   question?   I do not understand you to argue that the

16   court of appeals can apply a presumption of

17   unreasonableness just because there's a departure.

18               MR. DREEBEN:         That's correct.        We're not

19   arguing for a presumption of unreasonableness on appeal.

20   We're arguing for a presumption of reasonableness for a

21   guidelines sentence.      For an out of guidelines sentence

22   there is no presumption that it is unreasonable, but the

23   court of appeals under a proportionality analysis would

24   look and require increasingly strong reasons with the

25   increasing degree of variance from --

 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:            That's the part, they said

 2   that.   An extraordinary reduction must be supported by

 3   extraordinary circumstances.              What worries me about that

 4   it sounds like a slogan.           I would think an extraordinary

 5   reduction must be supported by whatever reasons that

 6   justify the extraordinary reduction, period.

 7                 And it also sounds like you're going to

 8   start getting a mechanical set of charts and things,

 9   which is going to be a true nightmare, and if we really

10   were to repeat that it would take on a tremendous force

11   of generative law which would worry me quite a lot

12   because I just think it's too complex to reduce to a

13   formula.    What you want is a reason that supports the

14   sentence.

15                 It is --

16                 MR. DREEBEN:         I think you want a better

17   reason for a sentence that is farther away from some

18   mean.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Better than what?    Better

20   than justifies it?

21                 MR. DWYER:       Perhaps the best way to do this

22   is to give a example.        Suppose that the shoe were on the

23   other foot.    Suppose that Judge Jackson had looked at

24   this defendant and said, you know, this defendant did

25   not learn from his experience.                He was given leniency in

 1   the State court.      He didn't take advantage of that

 2   opportunity.      His statutory maximum is 20 years and I'm

 3   going to give him, maybe not the statutory maximum, I'm

 4   going to give him an 18-year sentence, or suppose she

 5   said a 15-year sentence or a 10-year sentence.

 6                 I submit that in that circumstances the

 7   Petitioner would be here saying, well, the guidelines

 8   recommended a sentence of between 37 and 46 months and

 9   this is a dramatic increase from that and the reason is

10   not something that's particularly unusual, it's a very

11   usual reason, and as a result, the magnitude of this

12   deviation is unreasonable.

13                 And I have no problem with a Petitioner

14   making that argument if that's what happens to his or

15   her client.      My problem is that without that kind of

16   anchoring effect of the guidelines in a proportionality

17   review, a court of appeals has almost nothing to work

18   with.

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             But what happens when that

20   case -- it goes back down to the district court.                 The

21   district court says well, okay, not 10 years.                 Nine

22   years.   Okay?     It goes back up.             I mean, you know, when

23   do we end this game?         Or does the court of appeals take

24   over the sentencing function and specify -- you know,

25   five years?

 1               MR. DREEBEN:         Justice Scalia, I don't think

 2   that the courts of appeals are, at least absent very

 3   unusual circumstances, to act as sentencers to specify a

 4   sentence.   There have been a couple of instances where

 5   courts of appeals have said this is really the bottom

 6   sentence that we can see that would be reasonable on

 7   this particular constellation of facts.                 I think that

 8   reflect as sense of potential impatience with a

 9   ping-pong game that would occur if the court of appeals

10   says your sentence is unreasonable, Mr. District Judge,

11   and the district judge imposes a sentence that's one day

12   lower.

13               Another solution to that problem would be

14   reassignment to a different judge who would start with a

15   clean slate and could read the court of appeals' opinion

16   and apply the section 3553 factors.

17               We are not suggesting that the court of

18   appeals should assume the sentencing role here.                All

19   we're suggesting is that the court of appeals needs to

20   have some intelligible legal principles that allow it to

21   identify and select unreasonable sentences versus

22   reasonable sentences; and when you have wide statutory

23   ranges as you do in the Federal system, if you don't

24   have the guidelines describing at least a benchmark,

25   it's not more, then I don't think courts of appeals have


                                       45
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   a good, coherent, consistent way of fulfilling their

 2   tasks.    And if the courts of appeals can do that, can

 3   look more with greater scrutiny at a sentence the

 4   farther that it goes outside the guidelines range,

 5   without violating the statute and without violating the

 6   Constitution, then it seems to me the only thing for the

 7   Court to ask at that point is which approach, that

 8   approach of proportionality, or and approach that

 9   basically says appellate review is procedural only,

10   absent the most glaringly aberrant sentences, conforms

11   to Congress's intent of producing a greater degree of

12   uniformity and consistency.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, it wouldn't be, just

14   be procedural only.      You -- you could say procedural

15   plus, you know, certainly review of the facts on, on

16   which the district court was -- was proceeding.                 So you,

17   if you could find that the determination that this was

18   just a good kid who made a mistake is, is an

19   unreasonable finding, you could reverse for that reason.

20                MR. DREEBEN:         That -- that is true.         But I

21   submit that -- I would like to hear what Petitioner has

22   to say.   If Petitioner's client had been given 10 years

23   in this case, I have no doubt that Petitioner would be

24   arguing that's an unreasonable sentence.                 But I don't

25   see how you reach that judgment assuming that the court


                                        46

 1   has articulated a rationale that's consistent with

 2   section 3553 and a rational interpretation of the facts,

 3   unless you have the guidelines as an anchor for the

 4   analysis.

 9                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL DWYER,

10                      ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

11                 MR. DWYER:       I believe that Justice Breyer

12   put his finger on one of the central problems with the

13   Government's proposed rule.              And that is what does it

14   mean?     The Government talks about substantial variances

15   in Petitioner's case.        The court of appeals spoke of it

16   as extraordinary variances.              And the Government doesn't

17   suggest to us that substantial means the same thing or

18   means something different from extraordinary.                  And we've

19   already demonstrated in our brief why relying on

20   percentages as the court of appeals also did, is

21   pointless, because, one, if -- the arithmetic gets very

22   complicated at the low end and the percentages just

23   don't make any sense from a proper application of a rule

24   of law.

25                 The Government's proposal, apart from having

 1   no basis in the statute and no basis in Booker, is just

 2   not susceptible of any kind of application because

 3   nobody really knows what it means.

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What about Mr.

 5   Dreeben's parting challenge?            What are you going to do

 6   if your client gets 10 years?             You're going to argue

 7   that's an extraordinary departure from the guidelines,

 8   right?

 9               MR. DWYER:       I'm certainly going to argue

10   that under the facts and the record before the Court,

11   that was not a sentence that was sufficient but not

12   greater than necessary.        And I think the absence of a

13   prior record, the young man's work history, all of those

14   factors, the low amount of crack cocaine involved, his

15   age, all of the things which as Justice Ginsburg pointed

16   out that judge relied on in her sentencing decision,

17   could not possibly support a 10-year sentence.

18               And you know, it is easy to do this in a, in

19   a hypothetical sort of way.            But the district judge --

20   and this was a very experienced district judge --

21   looking at the person in the eye, made a call based on

22   judgment.   And that call was not treated with any

23   respect in the court of appeals.               It was sloganeered

24   away as an extraordinary variance.                 And -- because the

25   court of appeals focused only on the guidelines.

 1              The -- this Court in crafting the appellate

 2   standard can't just look to determine what Congress
