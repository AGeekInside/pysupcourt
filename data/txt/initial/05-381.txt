 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

 8                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. PINCUS:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10   and may it please the Court:

11               The question in this case is whether the

12   standards this Court adopted in Brooke Group to

13   determine whether a seller's prices violate the

14   antitrust laws because they are too low also should

15   apply in assessing the claim that the buyer's purchase

16   prices are illegally high.          We submit that the Brooke

17   Group test applies because the four key underpinnings of

18   the Court's ruling apply fully here.

19               First, there's a high risk of mistaking

20   aggressive competition for anticompetitive behavior.

21   Increasing the prices that are paid for inputs like

22   lowering sales prices is a mechanism by which a firm

23   competes.   It's the result that we would expect from a

24   buyer's ordinary competitive instincts.                 So the conduct

25   targeted here is on its face identical to core


                                        3

 1   procompetitive conduct.        It's also very hard to

 2   distinguish losses suffered by a more inefficient

 3   competitor from hard -- to anticompetitive behavior, but

 4   the antitrust laws --

 5               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Can I ask you a

 6   preliminary question before you get too far into your

 7   argument?   Is it your understanding that the

 8   instructions to the jury were that finding that

 9   predatory price cutting was in itself sufficient to

10   establish a Section 2 violation?               I know the Court of

11   Appeals opinion reads that way but is it, do you think

12   the jury was so instructed?

13               MR. PINCUS:        Yes.       Our position is that that

14   is what the jury was instructed, because the predatory

15   pricing instruction said one of plaintiff's contentions

16   is that defendant purchased more logs than needed or

17   paid a higher price for logs than necessary in order to

18   prevent the plaintiffs from obtaining the logs they

19   needed at a fair price.        I'm reading from page 14(a) of

20   the appendix to the petition.             And then it concluded, if

21   you find this to be true, you may regard it as an

22   anticompetitive act.

23               JUSTICE STEVENS:            You may consider it as an

24   anticompetitive act, but it does not say you may regard

25   it as a violation of Section 2.

 1                 MR. PINCUS:       No.

 2                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            And as I read the

 3   instructions, it did require there be three elements of

 4   the violation of Section 2 which, two of which were not

 5   discussed by the Court of Appeals.

 6                 MR. PINCUS:       Well, Your Honor, there is no,

 7   there is no contention here about monopoly power.              The

 8   focus here is on the conduct element of Section 2.

 9                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Do you concede there is

10   monopoly power?

11                 MR. PINCUS:       We are not disputing it before

12   this Court.

13                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           But is that relevant to

14   the question whether, if there is monopoly power plus an

15   attempt to preserve that power or require that power,

16   plus an anticompetitive act, is that a violation of

17   section 2.

18                 MR. PINCUS:       Well, Your Honor, our view is

19   what the Court has said in cases like Trinko, is that

20   the test is monopoly power and anticompetitive conduct.

21   Those are the two elements.              We are not contesting the

22   monopoly power element.         We are looking at whether there

23   was anticompetitive conduct here.

24                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           But you do agree that the

25   conduct in itself is not sufficient to establish a


                                         5

 1   violation, the question of whether the conduct plus the

 2   monopoly power --

 3              MR. PINCUS:          Yes.       Because this is a claim

 4   under Section 2, there would have to be either monopoly

 5   power or a danger of probability to the monopoly power.

 6   It's single firm conduct so there would have to be --

 7              JUSTICE STEVENS:              And so you're arguing not

 8   only that the pricing conduct was not itself sufficient

 9   to prove a violation, but it also was not even an

10   anticompetitive act that may give rise to damages?

11              MR. PINCUS:          Yes, Your Honor.         We are

12   arguing both things.       I think, I'm not sure that there

13   is much space between the two, but to the extent there

14   is, we are arguing both.

15              JUSTICE STEVENS:              Obviously, if there's just

16   an anticompetitive act without a violation of the

17   statute, then there would be no basis for damages.

18              MR. PINCUS:          I think that's right, but I

19   guess the way I think the Court has approached

20   determining anticompetitive act, anticompetitive

21   conduct, is it's the kind of conduct when engaged in by

22   a monopolist or an entity that has a dangerous

23   probability of cheating it, it is a violation of this

24   statute.

25              JUSTICE STEVENS:              Of course in the Brooke


                                         6

 1   case, it may not have even been a monopolist.

 2               MR. PINCUS:        Well, because Brooke involved a

 3   claim under the Patent Act.             But this Court in the

 4   Trinko case has certainly interpreted the Brooke

 5   Standard as also applying to claims under Section 2.

 6   And in fact the Court explicitly said that in Brooke

 7   Group.

 8               As I said, the first critical underpinning

 9   is the risk of mistaking aggressive competition for

10   anticompetitive behavior.          Second, this case involves --

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, it's a little

12   different here in that in the Brooke Group cases, of

13   course, the alleged anticompetitive conduct was pricing

14   too low, which has at least a direct benefit to

15   consumers either in the short term, certainly in the

16   short term, and arguably in the long-term as well, while

17   here that is not the form in which the anticompetitive

18   conduct, that's not the form the anticompetitive conduct

19   takes.   So isn't that a reason not to think that we

20   should apply the Brooke Group test to this situation?

21               MR. PINCUS:        Your Honor, we don't, we don't

22   think that that difference is a distinction that

23   warrants a different test, for several reasons.                 First

24   of all, we are dealing here with single firm pricing

25   conduct and it's recognized that that's key to the


                                        7

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   proper functioning of the markets.                 As the court said in

 2   Professional Engineers, fixed pricing is the central

 3   nervous system of the economy.              It allocates goods and

 4   ensures that, that they are allocated to the most

 5   efficient use.

 6              Here, although there's no immediate benefit

 7   to consumers, there is an immediate benefit to the

 8   sellers of the logs, who certainly benefit when

 9   competition drives up the prices that they achieve.                 And

10   we think that the Sherman Act protects them and gives

11   them the benefit of full competition just as much as it

12   does consumers.   Over the course --

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Have we ever

14   identified that as a benefit that the antitrust laws try

15   to achieve, people get higher prices for what they sell?

16              MR. PINCUS:         Yes.       In Mandeville Farms,

17   which was a Section 1 case, the Court did talk about the

18   fact that the antitrust laws protect sellers as well as

19   buyers, and that was a case in which there was allegedly

20   a Section 1 conspiracy to price too low, and the Court

21   said that's per se unlawful.

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So in Brooke Group,

23   we said it's a benefit when prices are low to consumers,

24   and in this other case we said it's a benefit when

25   prices are high to suppliers.

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              MR. PINCUS:        Because the benefit that I

 2   think the Court is looking at in both cases is not the

 3   particular price levels, but in achieving and ensuring

 4   free price competition because of the central role that

 5   price plays in the economy.            That's what the Court is

 6   trying to protect in Professional Real Estate -- in

 7   Professional Engineers --

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:             I assume it's a benefit to

 9   consumers if the supply of the needed goods is increased

10   because of higher prices being paid for those needed

11   goods, and I assume when a higher price is paid, more of

12   those goods will be forthcoming, which will benefit

13   consumers who want those goods.

14              MR. PINCUS:        That is our second argument,

15   Justice Scalia.

16              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, you don't have that

17   in this case, do you, because I thought the, I thought

18   one of the arguments on the other side was the

19   inelasticity of the supplies, so that no matter what

20   they were paying, basically the same amount of wood was

21   ultimately going to get processed; is that correct?

22              MR. PINCUS:        No, Your Honor.          The claim is

23   that the supply was relatively inelastic, not that it's

24   perfectly inelastic, and as long as the supply market is

25   not perfectly inelastic, an increase in price may lead


                                       9

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to more supplies, maybe not as much as if there were

 2   higher elasticity, but more.           But there's another

 3   benefit to consumers here, which is that if one would

 4   expect that a buyer bidding more can make a more

 5   efficient use of the product and therefore generate more

 6   output, and that output expansion which doesn't depend

 7   on supply expansion is also beneficial to consumers

 8   because that means there will be more output in the

 9   downstream market and a corresponding decrease in price.

10              So we have those two benefits to consumers

11   and we also have the fact that as the Court said in

12   Professional Engineers, the Sherman Act reflects a

13   judgment that price competition generally, a free and

14   open price competition will produce lower prices and

15   better goods and services, and the Court has not

16   required that that be traced to consumer welfare in

17   every particular case.

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:            I presume it could lead to

19   lower consumer prices too.         If you have a firm that has

20   developed a new, a new technique for processing the

21   logs, and it can process them cheaper and faster, and

22   sell them for a lower price but in greater volume, and

23   thereby make even more profit, that firm would be

24   willing to pay more for those logs, even though it would

25   sell them for less than competitors might sell them.

 1                 MR. PINCUS:        That's exactly right, Justice

 2   Scalia, and that's what the record reflects here, that

 3   Weyerhaeuser invested in its lumber mills and created a

 4   process that got more value out of a log.                 The record

 5   reflects that plaintiffs, for example, did not do that.

 6   And there is testimony that plaintiff's mill was quite,

 7   relatively inefficient compared to Weyerhaeuser.

 8   Weyerhaeuser invested new processes that had less waste,

 9   produced more output as Justice Scalia suggested, and

10   therefore it was able to sell, sell that output at a

11   lower price and still make a profit, because it was

12   getting more output for log and therefore could pay more

13   for the log.

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Was there any argument in

15   the trial court or in the briefs of the Court of Appeals

16   as to how to calculate cost?              You basically have two

17   markets.     You don't usually think of cost when you buy

18   something.     But was there any argument as to how to

19   determine whether or not this was below cost in the

20   Brooke Group sense?

21                 MR. PINCUS:        Well, our view, Justice

22   Kennedy, there really wasn't, because the district judge

23   had made clear his view in the pretrial motions that

24   there wasn't a need to prove prices, and that --

25                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But that was the end of it

 1   at the trial court.

 2                 MR. PINCUS:        But our position is, and there

 3   has certainly been some writing on this in the

 4   literature, is that what one does is take the cost of

 5   producing the output which includes the allegedly

 6   predatory price of the log, and here logs are 75 percent

 7   of the cost so it's a very big cost.                      Compare those

 8   costs to the revenues that are received in the

 9   downstream market and if those revenues exceed costs,

10   then you're in a position where the defendant is

11   behaving perfectly economically rationally.                     If they're

12   less, then you go on to recoup it.

13                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Pincus, how do you

14   determine the price of the logs?                 Because we, the

15   charges that some logs were purchased at an excessive

16   price, and if we were dealing with only those logs to

17   determine cost, that's one thing.                  But we are, also in

18   this picture is that some of the logs came from

19   Weyerhaeuser's own land and some came from long-term

20   contracts that it had, and those, the price was not

21   inflated on those.      So if you take those into account

22   you may get one figure, but if you take only the high

23   bid logs you might get a different picture.                     So how,

24   what is it?    How do you determine costs?                   Do you look at

25   all the logs that were purchased or only the ones that


                                         12

 1   were allegedly bid out?

 2              MR. PINCUS:        No.      You would look, you would

 3   look, Your Honor, at all of the, at all of the logs,

 4   just as in the downstream market if you have a sell side

 5   case, you look at, you look at prices of all sales.

 6   Here it's interesting that the record reflects that

 7   plaintiff received more than, between 30 and 50 percent

 8   of its logs from the same kind of long-term sources that

 9   it argues that Weyerhaeuser received it from.           So in

10   this case there really isn't the kind of disparity, but

11   our position would be that you add all of those up and

12   compare them to revenues.

13              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It's not clear to me that

14   we have to get into this but if we do, I'm not sure

15   about your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question.           If

16   you have your own logs that you own already and if you

17   have logs on a long-term contract, the only relevant

18   logs are the logs that both people are competing for.

19   That's the only relevant market that we are talking

20   about insofar as the purchaser is concerned.

21              MR. PINCUS:        And it might be --

22              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And if Weyerhaeuser wanted

23   to drive somebody out of the market, then they go after

24   the logs which are open to both parties.

25              MR. PINCUS:        And Your Honor, as the Court

 1   observed in Brooke Group, there really wasn't a need

 2   there to get into how the test works and we think there

 3   isn't here.    We think the issue is symmetrical and it

 4   might be that the focus is on the incremental costs that

 5   are associated with the alleged predatory volume, and

 6   therefore that might focus on those incremental costs.

 7   But in this case there's no dispute that, whatever the

 8   measure of costs, there has been no challenge to the

 9   position that Weyerhaeuser's prices were above those

10   costs.

11                 Let me just turn back to, to the other two

12   reasons why we think Brooke Group applies because I

13   think they're important.          The third is it's much more

14   likely that the high bids here were going to, were a

15   result of legitimate competition than of anticompetitive

16   effort.   As this Court has observed both in Brooke Group

17   and Matsushita, predatory conduct is self-deterring.            To

18   engage in it, the defendant has to be willing to incur a

19   near-term loss against the hope of higher returns later.

20   And as the Court explained in those cases, the loss is

21   definite but the gain depends on a number of

22   imponderables.    So there is some self-deterring.

23                 And finally, a test that provides no

24   guidance threatens false positives that will deter the

25   very competition that our economy requires and that

 1   helps our economy reach its most efficient state.                As

 2   Justice Breyer put it for the First Circuit in Town of

 3   Comfort, antitrust rules must be clear enough for

 4   lawyers to explain them to their clients, especially in

 5   a sensitive area like pricing.                And certainly the rule

 6   that the Ninth Circuit adopted here has none of that

 7   clarity and we think that the Court's Brooke Group

 8   decision and that test does.

 9              JUSTICE STEVENS:               May I ask this question?

10   Supposing the evidence was perfectly clear that the

11   company did engage in a plan to get a total monopoly and

12   there were minutes of the board of directors says that

13   in order to do this we've got to drive company X out of

14   business and so you, we want you to compete in every

15   transaction with company X that you can and buy the logs

16   at a higher price.      Would that be an anticompetitive act

17   even if it did not result in loss to the defendant?

18              MR. PINCUS:           And the only anticompetitive

19   conduct alleged was pricing conduct, Your Honor?

20              JUSTICE STEVENS:               No.      The

21   anticompetitive -- the plan is to drive the company out

22   of business.   And the only anticompetitive conduct other

23   than proving the whole objective is that you pick on

24   this one competitor and outbid him every time you can.

25   Could that possibly give rise to a damage claim?

 1                 MR. PINCUS:       No, it wouldn't, Your Honor.

 2                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Even if the whole purpose

 3   was to drive it out of business?

 4                 MR. PINCUS:       Even if that was the whole

 5   purpose.

 6                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Pursuant to a plan to

 7   acquire a monopoly.

 8                 MR. PINCUS:       And the reason for that,

 9   Justice Stevens, is it's very hard to distinguish,

10   especially for the judicial system to distinguish,

11   between hard-fought competition and anticompetitive

12   intent if all we're looking at is what's in people's

13   mind set.   As judge Easterbrook wrote in his AA Poultry

14   decision --

15                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Why is it so hard if you

16   take Justice Stevens' premise that there's an agreement

17   and we take that as a given, as a given premise?

18                 MR. PINCUS:       Well, because there won't be a

19   given premise in every case, Your Honor, and the problem

20   is the Court has to write rules that will, that will

21   govern conduct, primary conduct of business people in

22   the market, and a rule that says if you can prove intent

23   then you don't have to worry about prices and costs is a

24   rule that opens the door to second-guess, judicial

25   second-guessing of prices --

 1                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           No, but only intent plus

 2   monopoly power.    You have to be able to prove monopoly

 3   power, too.

 4                 MR. PINCUS:       You do, Your Honor.

 5                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           There aren't too many

 6   cases that fit this.

 7                 MR. PINCUS:       As the Court has recognized in

 8   the section 2 context, the problem of deterring

 9   procompetitive conduct is even more serious because you

10   don't have the threshold environment of proof of

11   conspiracy, as one does in section 1.                    We're dealing

12   with unilateral conduct, and so --

13                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           No, but unilateral conduct

14   where you have monopoly power.               There aren't too many of

15   these cases, as you know.

16                 MR. PINCUS:       Well, Your Honor, market

17   definition is a complicated issue and it may be hard for

18   businesses --

19                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           It was an issue that was

20   resolved by the jury in this case and I don't understand

21   you to be disputing the resolution of that issue.

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           What do we do in the

23   correlative situation where there is an allegation of

24   predatory selling rather than predatory buying if you

25   had the same situation posed by Justice Stevens?                    Namely

 1   evidence that you're trying to drive the competitor out

 2   of business, wouldn't that establish a violation?

 3                MR. PINCUS:        It would not establish a

 4   violation, Your Honor.        In fact, the Brooke Group Court

 5   dealt with that very case because the dissent in Brooke

 6   Group pointed out that the district court in that case

 7   had held that the intent evidence was amongst the most

 8   powerful that had ever been, been presented in any case,

 9   and it still said, even though there was a clear

10   evidence of intent --

11                JUSTICE STEVENS:            But that did not involve a

12   monopoly.    That did not involve monopoly power.

13                MR. PINCUS:        But it involved the test for

14   predatory pricing, Your Honor, under Robinson-Patman.

15   But the Court said its test was perfectly applicable to

16   section 2.    And the lower courts have certainly applied

17   that test in just that way in section 2 cases.                   And if

18   the rule would be that even in the predatory selling

19   situation intent can override the price-cost and the

20   recoupment requirements, then you're in a situation

21   where there's no ability for business people to know in

22   advance when low prices are justified.                   All we think is

23   that there should be symmetry.

24                If the Court has no further questions I'll

25   reserve the balance of my time.

 4            ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

 5                  ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,

 6           AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER

 7                 MR. SHANMUGAM:         Thank you, Mr. Chief

 8   Justice, and may it please the Court.

 9                 Aggressive bidding by the buyer of an input,

10   no less than aggressive pricecutting by the seller of a

11   finished product, is usually procompetitive.                   Because a

12   claim of predatory bidding is simply the flip side of a

13   claim of predatory pricing, the Brooke Group standard

14   for predatory pricing claims should apply to predatory

15   bidding claims as well.         And in our view the court of

16   appeals erred in this case by sanctioning a broader and

17   more subjective standard of liability.                   In Brooke Group,

18   this Court adopted its now familiar two-pronged standard

19   for predatory pricing claims despite recognizing that

20   each prong of that standard might permit some

21   anticompetitive pricecutting.              The court was willing to

22   tolerate that modest degree of underinclusion because,

23   in the Court's own words, "The mechanism by which a firm

24   engages in predatory pricing is the same mechanism by

25   which a firm stimulates competition, namely by lowering

 1   its prices.    And the Court explained that a broader or a

 2   less precise standard of liability would run the risk of

 3   prohibiting or chilling some procompetitive price

 4   cutting.   In our view the same analysis can apply to a

 5   claim of predatory bidding.             Because aggressive bidding

 6   is usually procompetitive, application of the Brooke

 7   Group standard is warranted in order to avoid

 8   prohibiting or chilling procompetitive conduct with

 9   regard to price in that context as well.

10                 The court of appeals in this case held that

11   Brooke Group was inapplicable to respondent's claim of

12   predatory bidding by --

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Would you describe

14   the hypothetical Justice Stevens posed to your, your

15   brother, would you describe that as just aggressive

16   bidding?   Aggressive is, you know, it's kind of a good

17   term when you're talking about competition.                     But what if

18   it's purposely bidding higher than you know your rival

19   can afford?

20                 MR. SHANMUGAM:         Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I

21   understood Justice Stevens' hypothetical, and he can

22   correct me if I'm wrong, to posit a case in which there

23   was dynamite evidence that the defendant had a

24   monopolistic or exclusionary intent.                     But in our view

25   that is insufficient to state a section 2 claim.                     One

 1   has to have exclusionary conduct as well.

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:            No, you have to have the

 3   monopoly power as well.

 4              MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, that is also true, and

 5   with regard to a claim of attempted --

 6              JUSTICE STEVENS:            In your view, if as the

 7   jury was instructed in this case there was proof of

 8   monopoly power and intent to maintain or preserve that

 9   power, plus anticompetitive acts, does the

10   anticompetitive act have to be in and of itself a

11   violation of the Sherman Act?

12              MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, I think you need to

13   have all three of those elements in order to state a

14   claim of attempted monopolization --

15              JUSTICE STEVENS:            And if you do have all

16   three, is that enough to prove a violation?

17              MR. SHANMUGAM:          That would be enough to

18   state a claim for attempted monopolization under this

19   Court's decision in Separate Forks.

20              JUSTICE STEVENS:            And isn't that how the

21   jury was instructed in this case?

22              MR. SHANMUGAM:          In our view the jury was

23   instructed that it would be sufficient to establish an

24   anticompetitive act to find that petitioner priced its

25   logs --

 1              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Yes, but if it was not

 2   instructed it would be sufficient to find a violation of

 3   section 2 by those, by that accounting, is that not

 4   correct?

 5              MR. SHANMUGAM:             That is correct, Justice

 6   Stevens, and the jury was also instructed and in our

 7   view the jury was properly instructed with regard to the

 8   other two elements, namely a dangerous probability of

 9   monopolization and a specific intent to monopolize.                  The

10   sole question before this Court is what constitutes

11   exclusionary conduct for purposes of section 2, what

12   constitutes it regardless of whether it's a claim of

13   attempted monopolization or actual monopolization.

14              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Go back to my

15   hypothetical.   Supposing you have the first two elements

16   and you say in order to drive this company out of

17   business we want you to compete with them and get the

18   logs at whatever cost it takes.                Would that be an

19   anticompetitive act?

20              MR. SHANMUGAM:             No, Justice Stevens.        That

21   would solely be --

22              JUSTICE STEVENS:               Even if it was for the

23   sole purpose of driving the company out of business in

24   order to accomplish the goal of getting a monopoly?

25              MR. SHANMUGAM:             That would be evidence, and

 1   it may be powerful evidence, of a monopolistic intent,

 2   though courts have noted that even with regard to that

 3   requirement it's famously difficult to distinguish

 4   between a legitimate competitive attempt on the one hand

 5   and an illegitimate monopolistic intent.

 6              JUSTICE STEVENS:            No, no.         I'm assuming this

 7   is not evidence of intent.         There's independent evidence

 8   of both intent and monopoly power.                With those two

 9   elements established, would this, the kind of evidence I

10   described, be evidence of an injury to the plaintiff

11   that could be actual in damages?

12              MR. SHANMUGAM:          No, Justice Stevens.          You

13   would need to have objective evidence that the defendant

14   met both of the prongs of the Brooke Group requirement.

15              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Will you need to meet the

16   prongs of the Brooker test even if you otherwise prove a

17   violation of section 2?

18              MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, I'm not quite sure

19   what it means to say that you otherwise prove a

20   violation in that example.

21              JUSTICE STEVENS:            You prove monopoly power

22   plus an intent to maintain or acquire it.

23              MR. SHANMUGAM:          That is insufficient.           You

24   have to have some action --

25              JUSTICE STEVENS:            That's insufficient to

 1   prove a violation of Section 2?

 2                MR. SHANMUGAM:          It is insufficient to prove

 3   a violation of section 2 because you have to have some

 4   conduct that is classed as exclusionary, and in our view

 5   that is the content that the Brooke Group standard

 6   supplies.    It specifies the conduct that you need to

 7   have and that conduct is the defendant suffering a loss

 8   in the short term and having a dangerous probability of

 9   recouping that loss in the long term.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I assume you could have a

11   company that has a dynamite evidence of seeking to

12   monopolize and the means that they choose is just

13   idiotic.    For example, they say, we're going to try to

14   get a monopoly by buying these logs at a lower price as,

15   at as low a price as possible.               You would have the two

16   elements, monopoly power, intent to monopolize, but you

17   wouldn't have an act that constitutes anticompetitive

18   conduct.

19                MR. SHANMUGAM:          Justice Scalia --

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:            And that's what you're

21   asserting is the case here.

22                MR. SHANMUGAM:          You could have an

23   incompetent monopolist more generally or an incompetent

24   predator in this specific context.                  And I think that the

25   only other thing I would say with regard to this

 1   colloquy is that the Court really did confront this

 2   issue in Brooke Group.       There was fairly strong evidence

 3   of monopolistic intent and the majority opinion --

 4                JUSTICE STEVENS:           But there is no evidence

 5   of monopoly power and it isn't even remotely at issue in

 6   that case.

 7                MR. SHANMUGAM:         That's right, and it wasn't

 8   an issue simply because it was a Robinson-Patman Act

 9   case and all that is required under the Robinson-Patman

10   Act is the possibility of harm to competition and there

11   was some disagreement about whether a showing had been

12   made of that requisite possibility between the majority

13   opinion and your dissenting opinion.                    But I don't think

14   that there was any disagreement in Brooke Group with

15   regard to the relevant standard for exclusionary

16   conduct.   Even the dissenting opinion recognized that

17   recoupment would be necessary in order to state the

18   predatory pricing claim in the Robinson-Patman Act

19   context.

20                JUSTICE ALITO:         Would your answer be the

21   same if you added to Justice Stevens' hypothetical very

22   high barriers of entry that would prevent other

23   competitors from entering the market after the target

24   was driven out?

25                MR. SHANMUGAM:         High barriers to entry,

 1   Justice Alito, would be very relevant to the inquiry

 2   under the second prong of the Brooke Group standard,

 3   namely whether the defendant had a dangerous probability

 4   of recoupment in the long term.              And indeed in many

 5   predation cases, many predatory pricing cases in the 13

 6   years since Brooke Group, barriers to entry have been

 7   absolutely vital in resolving predatory pricing claims

 8   at the summary judgment stage, because typically

 9   defendants will make the argument that the absence of

10   barriers to entry make the possibility of recoupment

11   unlikely.   But that is a consideration that is built

12   into the Brooke Group standard and it certainly would be

13   part of the Brooke Group analysis in the predatory

14   bidding context as well.

15               I want to say just one thing in response to

16   Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kennedy's questions to my

17   friend Mr. Pincus about the question of the appropriate

18   measure of cost if Brooke Group were to apply to

19   predatory bidding claims.          As in Brooke Group itself, we

20   believe that it is unnecessary for this Court to specify

21   the exact method of calculating costs in this case.               But

22   the position of the United States more generally both in

23   the predatory pricing context and in the predatory

24   bidding context is that a Court should look to a

25   defendant's incremental costs, and in this context that


                                       26
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   would mean looking to the amount of the input that was

 2   the subject of the alleged predation.                     So in this case

 3   the amount of logs that petitioner allegedly predatorily

 4   purchased on the open market.               And such an incremental

 5   approach to be sure is not within its difficulties in

 6   application and for that reason a number of lower courts

 7   in the predatory pricing context have instead looked to

 8   average variable costs or other measures as a proxy for

 9   incremental costs.      But we believe that in a case such

10   as this one, looking to incremental costs may be useful

11   because it effectively excludes from the analysis any

12   potential cross-subsidization, whether by virtue of the

13   fact that in this case, for example, petitioner may have

14   harvested logs from its own lands.                   There are claims in

15   this case that petitioner entered into various exclusive

16   dealing arrangements as well, obtained logs at a lower

17   price on that basis.        And an incremental approach has

18   the virtue of focusing only on that portion of the

19   market that is the subject of the alleged predation

20   claims.

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:               You also, I take it, have

22   to have an equally limited approach on the recoupment

23   analysis, then.   I mean, your recoupment analysis would

24   have to be symmetrical with your cost analysis.

25              MR. SHANMUGAM:             Yes.       That's absolutely


                                         27

 1   true, Justice Souter, and again this is an issue that

 2   the lower courts have been grappling with in the

 3   predatory pricing context, and I by no means want to

 4   suggest that it is always an easy analysis in the

 5   predatory pricing context.           Professor           Arita's treatise

 6   has hundreds of pages on the appropriate calculation of

 7   cost, but I think that the important thing to remember

 8   with regard to the below cost pricing prong of the

 9   Brooke Group analysis is that it does provide an

10   objective yardstick by which a defendant's loss can be

11   measured.

12               Thank you.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you,

14   Mr. Shanmugam.

16            ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. HAGLUND

17                 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

18               MR. HAGLUND:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19   please The Court.

20               In this Court's antitrust jurisprudence over

21   the last 25 years, market realities have consistently

22   trumped per se rules.       The same approach should apply

23   here.   Brooke Group's per se rule which carved out a

24   special exception to the standard rule of reason

25   balancing test in Section 2 cases should not be extended


                                        28

 1   to the buy side.   No safe harbor per se rule is

 2   justified here because raising input prices, unlike

 3   cutting output prices, is moving prices in the wrong

 4   direction for consumers.

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:             But even it does hurt the

 6   suppliers and the antitrust laws are just as, I don't

 7   know just as, but they are just as concerned about a

 8   group of small farmers or a group of small growers or a

 9   group of small fishermen faced with a monopsony buyer as

10   they are with a group of consumers having to fight off a

11   monopoly seller.

12              MR. HAGLUND:          Justice Breyer --

13              JUSTICE BREYER:             I mean that's pretty well

14   established, isn't it?

15              MR. HAGLUND:          Well I'd like to point out

16   that the Mandeville Farms case that Mr. Pincus cited

17   does not stand for the same --

18              JUSTICE BREYER:             No, no, Congress has

19   actually passed special legislation that the Mandeville

20   Farms is consistent with the Farmers Cooperative and so

21   -- you want me to write the proposition that the

22   antitrust laws are not concerned --

23              MR. HAGLUND:          Oh, absolutely --

24              JUSTICE BREYER:             -- with the monopoly buyer

25   who would in fact exploit a group of small suppliers,


                                       29

 1   farmers?

 2              MR. HAGLUND:          Absolutely not.

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:             Okay.

 4              MR. HAGLUND:          But in this particular context

 5   which the Ninth Circuit repeatedly emphasized, in an

 6   inelastic market like this one raising input prices is

 7   not going to increase supply and --

 8              JUSTICE BREYER:             That can't possibly be

 9   right, can it?   I mean if in fact the object here is to

10   strike, is -- suppose their object is what you say.

11   Their object is in fact to try to get a monopoly on the

12   buying side over a group of small woodsmen.                     And they

13   might do that if they drove out all the buying

14   competitors, and now what are they going to try to do?

15   What they will try to do if they get that terrible

16   monopoly, which would be bad --

17              MR. HAGLUND:          Drive prices down.

18              JUSTICE BREYER:             Right.           Drive prices way

19   down, below what the woodsmen could get for them.                     And

20   if that's going to have any effect aside from an income

21   effect, it will leave some of them to go to the bread

22   line or go to other places where they have other jobs at

23   lesser revenue than they would get by staying in the

24   woods business and selling at a reasonable price.                     That

25   would be an antitrust concern.

 1                MR. HAGLUND:          Absolutely, and that is

 2   exactly what Weyerhaeuser's plan was here, as shown by

 3   their own materials, that their plan was and in fact

 4   they did foresee and project that log prices would go

 5   down in 2001 --

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:             So where we are is at the

 7   problem.    The problem is the same as at the buying side.

 8   What we have is possibly a very bad motive and very bad

 9   effects.    On the other hand, low prices are good for the

10   consumer.

11                MR. HAGLUND:          But you're not --

12                JUSTICE BREYER:             Here we have bad effects,

13   bad possibilities.      On the other hand, higher prices are

14   good for the woodsmen.         So we need rules to separate the

15   sheep from the goats.        And the other side is proposing a

16   rule, and the rule simply is don't count this as bad

17   conduct, unless the person who pays the money for the

18   goods is in fact buying so many goods that later on when

19   he tries to sell them he will incur a loss.

20                Now I would have thought for 40 years that

21   was a traditional idea.          If you're trying to decide

22   whether people are hogging goods unnecessarily for bad

23   purposes, or rather storing up nuts for winter for good

24   purposes, then a very good key to that is do these

25   people expect in the long run to make money out of this

 1   without driving those victims out?                  If the answer is

 2   yes; they can make money on the market, they are storing

 3   up nuts for winter.      It's good.           And if the answer is no

 4   it's bad.    That's called the recoupment test.                    I don't

 5   think that's new.     I think it's old.                   And I'm not sure

 6   what your view of it is.

 7                MR. HAGLUND:         Well, as to Brooke Group and

 8   what the Court's being asked to do here, Justice Breyer,

 9   is to go down the same path that it did in Albrecht

10   versus Harold Company in '68 when it agreed to treat

11   completely symmetrically minimum and maximum vertical

12   resale price restraints.

13                Later on, in State Oil Company vs. Kahn the

14   Court abandoned and accepted Justice Harlan's dissent

15   that it was wrong to equate those two.

16                JUSTICE BREYER:            -- I agree with you.           But I

17   don't still think you can defend this retail versus

18   maximum price restraint.          That's a whole another kettle

19   of fish.    And what I'm interested --                   I guess my

20   question particularly is, I propose one test not two,

21   but it might be that my test encompasses the dollar test

22   and incremental costs and so forth.                      What do you think

23   of my one test?

24                MR. HAGLUND:         Well --

25                JUSTICE BREYER:            One test is if they are not

 1   going to make money legitimately out of this in the long

 2   run, it's bad, unless they can explain it away.                   But if

 3   they are, it's okay.

 4                 MR. HAGLUND:         The problem with granting a

 5   safe harbor for above cost input purchases is that it

 6   does not work well in this context, especially in an

 7   inelastic market.     The suggestion that you can simply

 8   use incremental cost is not a workable approach here if

 9   you look at the facts in this case.

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What about the fact

11   that the woodsmen in Justice Breyer's story are rational

12   actors as well, and they don't have to be geniuses to

13   realize that they are in a better shape having two

14   buyers rather than just one.              So maybe they forego the

15   extra 50 cents a log, or whatever -- tree, it is in the

16   short term and sell enough to keep the other company in

17   business?     I mean they can make that decision

18   themselves.     Or they can make the decision as rational

19   actors that they are better off having more money that

20   they can then use to buy more alder saplings that they

21   can plant for the future.            And either way it benefits

22   the consumers.

23                 MR. HAGLUND:         Well not, that's not quite

24   correct, because the signals that the higher input

25   prices show, yes, they do generally incent more


                                         33

 1   production in a, in a typical market.                  Here, however,

 2   where you have a product that takes 30 to 50 years time

 3   and production, the price, higher price signals when

 4   they are sent by a monopsonist, like Weyerhaeuser in

 5   this case, actually send a very powerful message to tree

 6   farmers not to replant alder, despite those high prices.

 7   And there was evidence in the follow-on cases that

 8   reference that.

 9              It was alleged in our complaint in this case

10   but not actually backed up by any testimony at trial,

11   that tree farmers in Oregon and Washington were actually

12   electing not to replant alder and as Professor Noel

13   notes in his law review article in the issue of the

14   Antitrust Law Journal, which by the way is the only area

15   -- half of this issue is devoted to this subject.                 It's

16   the sum total of literature devoted to predatory

17   overbidding in this area.         And what Professor Noel notes

18   is that where you have localized monopsony, the result

19   is when the monopsony is in full flower a misallocation

20   of resources between regions.            The highly productive

21   forest lands of the Pacific Northwest won't have as much

22   alder in the future because of the significant signals

23   sent by a monopsonist, even when they are engaged in

24   that scheme.

25              The seller is happy if he has mature alder


                                      34

 1   to sell at that time to get the good price, but he is

 2   not going to replant, because he sees that 30 years down

 3   the road he will not have a competitive marketplace

 4   within which to sell his timber, and that was the

 5   reality in this case.

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well if he is, if he

 7   is that rational and foresighted, why isn't he rational

 8   and foresighted enough to know that he ought to be

 9   selling some to the other, the other processor even if

10   that processor is not bidding as much?

11              MR. HAGLUND:          Well we did actually have some

12   record evidence in this case that at least a few people

13   were doing that.   One of the major suppliers of the

14   respondent here, Ross-Simmons, was a company called

15   Longview Fiber which made it -- a very sophisticated

16   publicly held company -- made it a practice to sell most

17   of its volume to Ross-Simmons on a market basis because

18   it did not want the eventuality of not having

19   Ross-Simmons in that competitive circle with

20   Weyerhaeuser.

21              Most small woodland owners, however, who may

22   only be in the market once every five years because

23   that's the nature of their rotation, of the age classes

24   of the timber that they have got, are not in that kind

25   of sophisticated position because they are in the market

 1   so infrequently to make that kind of a judgment.            It's

 2   been --

 3                 JUSTICE ALITO:         If we don't take the Brooke

 4   Group approach, is the alternative to ask the jury to do

 5   what the instructions in this case ask them to do.

 6                 MR. HAGLUND:        No, it's not.

 7                 JUSTICE ALITO:         To decide whether

 8   Weyerhaeuser bought more logs than it needed in order to

 9   prevent its rivals from obtaining the logs that they

10   needed at a fair price?         How is a jury to, a lay jury,

11   to decide whether a company like Weyerhaeuser bought

12   more logs than it needed, or what is the fair price?

13                 MR. HAGLUND:        We don't contend that the

14   instruction was perfect here, but if one looks at the

15   instruction as a whole and --

16                 JUSTICE ALITO:         But you think it was

17   sufficient.

18                 MR. HAGLUND:        Pardon me?

19                 JUSTICE ALITO:         You think it was sufficient

20   enough.

21                 MR. HAGLUND:        In this case it was legally

22   sufficient and I point out that this Court very recently

23   has issued a decision in the first case of the term,

24   Ayers vs. Belmontes, where you looked at the question of

25   the catch-all mitigation factor in California in the

 1   penalty phase of a capital murder case.                   And you looked

 2   at the instruction and interpreted it in terms of the

 3   closing arguments, the evidence and the other

 4   instructions as a whole.

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Who proposed the

 6   instruction in this case?

 7                 MR. HAGLUND:         The instruction, the paragraph

 8   that is subject to the great criticism on the other

 9   side, was a paragraph that was drafted by the district

10   judge and handed out near the end of the trial and then

11   commented on by the lawyers in, prior to --

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             There was no requested

13   charge on this point by the plaintiff?

14                 MR. HAGLUND:         That's -- as to the issue of

15   predatory pricing, plaintiffs, as we make clear in our

16   brief, actually submitted a predatory pricing

17   instruction three weeks before the trial.                  You tend to

18   be overinclusive pretrial.            Defendant on the other hand

19   surprisingly submitted no such instruction on predatory

20   pricing.     The judge submitted a paragraph that had

21   something more than what the current, or the ultimate

22   paragraph contained.        There was a debate over whether it

23   needed to be, whether it was consistent with Brooke

24   Group.     I agreed with the other side that it did not

25   have both components of the Brooke Group test.                  Judge

 1   Panner and I had a colloquy where ultimately he was

 2   going to turn one paragraph into two, include a Brooke

 3   Group test.     We then withdrew our request for that

 4   instruction, Weyerhaeuser objected to the, the thinned

 5   down version of the ultimate paragraph.

 6                 But the interesting thing about

 7   Weyerhaeuser's relationship to this instruction is that

 8   they really invited the linguistic framework of this,

 9   "bought more than they needed" or --

10                 JUSTICE ALITO:          What does that mean?             What

11   does a fair price in this, in this context mean?                       Does

12   it mean the price that's necessary in order to keep an

13   inefficient competitor in business?

14                 MR. HAGLUND:         Well, what it meant in this

15   case, Justice Alito, is that it meant what, how much did

16   Weyerhaeuser artificially increase the log market above

17   where it otherwise would have been?                       We had several

18   experts and a number of both industry and forest

19   economists testify that for 20-plus years log prices had

20   been following lumber.         There was an equilibrium in the

21   market.     Then you get to --

22                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Why is that the standard of

23   fairness?     I mean that, you know, that may be fine.                     But

24   how does, how does a jury, A, what's the authority for

25   saying that is the standard of fairness and B, how does

 1   a jury know that?

 2               MR. HAGLUND:          The -- if you look at the

 3   Ninth Circuit opinion, the Ninth Circuit made it clear

 4   that the instructions as a whole provided sufficient

 5   guidance.   Nowhere in the case as we tried it did we

 6   attempt to exploit the instruction in the way that

 7   Weyerhaeuser suggests happened.

 8               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Maybe you didn't, but that

 9   basically left the jury on a, on a free float, didn't

10   it?

11               MR. HAGLUND:          Well, I don't think so if you

12   look at the evidence.       The evidence that we presented

13   included a forest economist who presented three

14   different scenarios where he identified how much

15   Weyerhaeuser had artificially increased log prices above

16   where they would have been but for their anticompetitive

17   behavior.   We in no way went to the jury in closing,

18   saying award what you think is fair.                     We relied

19   completely on that evidence, and in fact the jury, which

20   included a Ph.D. in physics in a high-tech industry, an

21   accountant, the head of a chain store, and a banker and

22   a retired farmer, they looked at the evidence and they

23   actually to the dollar picked one of those market -based

24   scenarios for how much was the market elevated.

25               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Okay.       Let's assume I

 1   accept your sort of Delmonte's analysis here.                     If we

 2   were to approve of that instruction in effect, as you

 3   want us to do, and we also believe that on its face

 4   something more has got to be said than merely the word

 5   fair, what proposition would we say must be included in

 6   that instruction to make the so-called fairness

 7   instruction a sensible one that can be consistently

 8   applied?

 9              MR. HAGLUND:          And we don't contend that it

10   was a perfect instruction.          We think it would be

11   perfectly appropriate if --

12              JUSTICE SOUTER:             No, I realize that.

13              MR. HAGLUND:          Okay.

14              JUSTICE SOUTER:             And I'm saying if we follow

15   your lead, we're going to try to take that and make it a

16   closer to perfect instruction, and what should we say

17   must be added to it?

18              MR. HAGLUND:          It's quite simple.              If you

19   look at that paragraph, there are two pieces of it.                       One

20   of them, one portion says that you can regard it as an

21   anticompetitive act if defendant purchased more logs

22   than it needed.   We don't think that needs to be

23   improved because that's easy to figure out, and here we

24   had evidence that they continued --

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Why?          Why is it easy to


                                       40

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   figure out?    As Justice Breyer brought up the

 2   stockpiling, how do you know whether they are storing

 3   it, or a time when the supply is short, or they are just

 4   letting it go to rack and moon in order to put this

 5   company out of business?

 6                 MR. HAGLUND:        Justice Ginsburg, you will

 7   know because of the evidence in the case.                  If the

 8   plaintiff, the defendant is able to show that they were

 9   storing up this extra input against a prospect of a

10   price hike in the future or because they were out trying

11   to get enough volume for some promotion for a customer

12   that was going to significantly increase their

13   purchases, then you'd have a different kind of case.                    We

14   have a situation where they warehoused large,

15   unprecedentedly high volumes of lumber because they --

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Why did they say they

17   needed it?    I mean, why do you need all this Ph.D. guy

18   up there?    Why don't you just prove what you just said?

19                 MR. HAGLUND:        We did.

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Fine.       Then why do you need

21   all these other instructions about pricing?                 I suppose

22   the only reason you'd need them is if there's a dispute

23   as to whether it was in their economic interest in the

24   absence of any intent to monopolize these people to buy

25   all these logs or not.        And so it would be very


                                        41
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   interesting if you have a way of proving that they did

 2   not need these for any legitimate purpose, a matter

 3   which is likely to be disputed.              So, I think the hard

 4   thing in these cases is to prove that.                  And if you can

 5   tell me how you prove that without giving the jury an

 6   instruction something like, look to see whether they can

 7   sell them reasonably at a profit.                Or, look to see even

 8   if they can't sell them at a profit, whether they could

 9   recoup whatever they are losing later.                  Or, or, and you

10   fill in some blanks, and now I'll have some candidates

11   for testing.

12               MR. HAGLUND:         Well, as to the paid a higher

13   price than necessary, the language we would suggest

14   could be used in another case and passed on by this

15   Court, is the following:         Paid a higher price than

16   necessary to move the log market to higher levels than

17   otherwise would have prevailed in order to injure

18   competition.

19               JUSTICE BREYER:            Oh.     But of course, I want

20   to injure competition always when I in fact sell at a

21   lower price that I very much hope my competitor can't

22   possibly meet, indeed would go out of business.                 I

23   cheer.   I would love to get a monopoly.                I would love to

24   make a better product, lower prices, et cetera.                 Do you

25   see the problem?   And so what you've told the jury there

 1   on that instruction --

 2              MR. HAGLUND:            But here --

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:               -- is that they can find

 4   this person guilty even if all he wants to do is so

 5   second-guess that market that he gets the logs and will

 6   sell them at a huge profit later on in a competitive

 7   selling market.

 8              MR. HAGLUND:            We don't have a situation

 9   here, Justice Breyer, where Weyerhaeuser presented

10   evidence that they were the most efficient and able to

11   pay higher prices.      Weyerhaeuser presented no

12   quantitative evidence that it was the lowest cost

13   producer in terms of costs --

14              JUSTICE BREYER:               What if it were the highest

15   cost producer?    Suppose still, they think that by buying

16   these logs we later can make a profit when we resell

17   them on the competitive market.                You see, the reason

18   they're coming up with this test is they don't think you

19   can give, the reasoning of it is that they don't think

20   that you can produce a better one.                   So I'm listening.

21              MR. HAGLUND:            Well, one of the reasons that

22   one can't go in this direction here, Brooke Group was a

23   pricing only case.      As the briefs make clear and the

24   decision made clear, if that had been a standard

25   monopolization case it would have been out the door on


                                         43

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   summary judgment because the defendant was a 12 percent

 2   player.    They had no prospect of, of attempted or

 3   monopolization, a viable monopolization claim.                    Here we

 4   have a situation where Weyerhaeuser's pricing conduct,

 5   deliberately and artificially pushing the market up

 6   through a variety of mechanisms, was also interconnected

 7   and linked to complementary other conduct that we think

 8   set the table for the effectiveness of their strategy in

 9   elevating the log market that our client was

10   participating in.

11                Bear in mind that, that at JA 901 we have a

12   Weyerhaeuser document showing that very significant

13   foreclosure from their exclusive contracts in the, in

14   Oregon for example, this is a document that shows that

15   62 percent of the market was covered through either

16   exclusive purchase arrangements between Weyerhaeuser and

17   large landowners, or non-efficiency-based trades were

18   the, were linked to the exchange of the alder sawlogs

19   from that landowner.       Only 33 percent according to JA

20   901 show, in Oregon, was projected to be open market

21   bidding.   Weyerhaeuser acquired, when it was then at a

22   65 percent market share, acquired the dominant seller, a

23   built-in monopsony in British Columbia and it's five, 15

24   to 20-year exclusive forest licenses.                    That kind of

25   foreclosure, linked with the anticompetitive behavior


                                        44

 1   they engaged in that was a variety of bidding practices,

 2   some of it was overbuying, some of it was manipulating

 3   bidding back and forth, and then putting the last bid in

 4   terms of that cost on the other side.

 5              I think it's important, I'd like to shift to

 6   the instruction again, and make the point that

 7   Weyerhaeuser never gave either the plaintiff in this

 8   case or the district judge the opportunity to consider a

 9   different instruction than was given here.                 And the fact

10   that's demonstratively shown if one looks at page 43 of

11   their opening brief in the Ninth Circuit, in the Ninth

12   Circuit they only took the position in the bulk of their

13   brief that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of

14   law on the basis of Brooke Group.                 As to the ground or

15   the contention --

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Do you -- do you agree

17   that you couldn't have made it on Brooke Group because

18   they were selling these logs at a profit?

19              MR. HAGLUND:           I didn't quite hear that,

20   Justice Ginsburg.

21              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Do you agree that you

22   could not have prevailed under the Brooke Group test

23   because Weyerhaeuser was, was making a profit on these

24   sales even though it had bid up the price of the logs?

25              MR. HAGLUND:           We do not agree as to the


                                        45

 1   evidence in this case.       We have evidence in this case

 2   that we cited to in our brief that when you adjust, as

 3   against the Longview mill which our client was literally

 4   right next door to, when you adjust for the fact that

 5   Weyerhaeuser supplied half of the raw material needs of

 6   the Longview mill at way below market transfer prices,

 7   when you adjust those to the average price they paid

 8   other third parties for logs, the Longview mill ran at a

 9   loss for a significant part of the, of the predation

10   period.   We do have the evidence in this case to

11   contend --

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:           It's ultimately a jury

13   question, I assume.

14                MR. HAGLUND:        If Brooke Group is applied --

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:           But that question was not

16   put to the jury, right?

17                MR. HAGLUND:        That's correct.          We withdrew

18   the request for a Brooke Group instruction.

19                But to finish my point about the fact that

20   this --

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So then, would you

22   be entitled to a remand on that or not, given that you

23   withdrew that instruction?

24                MR. HAGLUND:        If the Court concludes the

25   Brooke Group applies to this case, then the instruction

 1   was incomplete, it was not correct, and we would be

 2   entitled to a remand and a chance to retry the case.

 3               JUSTICE ALITO:          But what about the

 4   recoupment prong, given that Weyerhaeuser doesn't have

 5   market power in the selling market and that mills were

 6   entering, new mills were coming on line during this

 7   period.   How would you satisfy the recoupment?

 8               MR. HAGLUND:         Well, the recoupment is not in

 9   the output end of things.          The recoupment is the

10   opportunity to drive log costs down to recoup the extra

11   costs you pay during the predatory period.                   And we had

12   evidence in the record that a former executive from

13   Weyerhaeuser testified that they had used this strategy

14   multiple times, that when it was questioned by some in

15   top management that the head of a division would always

16   say once we either acquire or get rid of a competitor,

17   we will recoup those costs many fold.                   That's at JA 260,

18   Cliff Chulos.   We also had at JA 903 a planning document

19   in 2001 where Weyerhaeuser was showing in that

20   PowerPoint chart the expectation that log prices would

21   be going down in '01, '02, '03, and for every 2 percent

22   change downward it was an extra $2 million in profits to

23   the bottom line.   There was no plan to pass on the

24   benefits of those lower input prices to consumers.

25   Obvious consumer lack of benefit in that situation.

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              Also as to recoupment, if you look at JA 831

 2   to 95, which are the year-end financials for the

 3   Weyerhaeuser alder mills in Oregon, Washington and BC

 4   during a roughly four-year period, you see a monu -- a

 5   huge price differential between the prices in British

 6   Columbia and those prevailing in Oregon and Washington.

 7   We think there was every expectation on management's

 8   part to drive the prices down to the levels that

 9   prevailed in British Columbia, which works out to about

10   $40 million a year, way way above the amount they were

11   spending in this predatory scheme predominantly in

12   Oregon and Washington, because there is no competition

13   in British Columbia.

14              But I would like to point out that they

15   never preserved the issue of whether or not the standard

16   that the Ninth Circuit in dictum stated was as a whole

17   sufficient to guide the jury as to a definition of

18   anticompetitive conduct.        At page 43 of their brief

19   after quoting this paragraph they so criticize, they

20   note, although that statement of the law -- this is 43

21   of the Ninth Circuit brief, not the blue brief that you

22   have -- although that statement of the law may have been

23   acceptable when Reed Brothers was decided, it is not in

24   the wake of Brooke Group for reasons explained above.

25   The point here is that they never made any charge in the


                                      48
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Ninth Circuit that the instruction was flawed

 2   independent of Brooke Group.           Now we concede, if Brooke

 3   Group applies, the instruction was -- was -- is wrong,

 4   and the case should be reversed and remanded.             But the

 5   second point that they try to make in their briefing is

 6   not properly preserved.       And in fact, I'd like to point

 7   out that they contributed to the linguistic framework of

 8   this instruction in a very significant way.             First --

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:            I'm losing you.    What's the

10   second point that they're trying to make besides the

11   fact that this didn't conform to Brooke Group?

12              MR. HAGLUND:         Well, they have also asserted

13   in their briefing that as an independent ground for

14   reversal, the instruction was so standardless that the

15   verdict cannot stand.

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Regardless of Brooke Group.

17              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But isn't that something

18   that we've got to consider because if, if we disagree

19   with them on Brooke Group, we've got to do it in the

20   course of making a choice between a Brooke Group

21   instruction and something else, and the only something

22   else we've got right now is what we have in this case

23   and we ought to, we ought to decide whether in fact that

24   is good enough.

25              MR. HAGLUND:         I agree with that.

 1                JUSTICE SOUTER:             And so I mean, I think,

 2   they may not have made that an independent basis of

 3   reversal but we've got to consider it.

 4                MR. HAGLUND:          I agree with that, but I would

 5   like to point out these facts in terms of the way they

 6   contributed to it.      They submitted jury instructions

 7   just like us based upon the ABA model instructions,

 8   theirs are at JA 97 to 122, that used the words outside

 9   of this paragraph that we are talking about, fair,

10   reasonable or necessary 18 times.                  They showed up 19

11   times in those instructions.              In their opening and

12   closing --

13                JUSTICE SOUTER:             I'll stipulate to that.

14                MR. HAGLUND:          Right.

15                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Assuming they don't have a

16   leg to stand on in complaint, we have still got to face

17   what the alternative to a Brooke Group kind of

18   instruction is.   And -- and however they may have tried

19   their case, we've still got the same problem.

20                MR. HAGLUND:          That's correct.         And I suggest

21   that you look to the type of formulation I gave a little

22   earlier where you're looking at how much did the

23   defendant push the market to levels that are above where

24   it otherwise would have been.               It's not too far from the

25   test that is proposed by the State at page 29 of their


                                         50

 1   brief where they suggest it's, that the conduct be

 2   measured by whether it raised the price that the buyer's

 3   rivals had to pay for the input beyond a level that

 4   could be justified or explained by other market or

 5   exogenous factors and substantially affected the ability

 6   of the buyer's rivals to compete for the input.                    The

 7   eight States, all of which have concerns both as sellers

 8   into these vulnerable resource markets and for citizens

 9   and companies in their own resource State, laden States,

10   whether it's mineral, whether it's agriculture, they

11   have that concern and they've offered that test that's

12   not too far from what I posited as a way to improve the

13   instruction that Weyerhaeuser invited.

14                  I'd like to make one further point on

15   that subject and that is, if you look at the opening

16   statement of their counsel, the closing, he used that

17   very language.   They were going to put on witnesses who

18   would all state that they never bought more than they

19   needed, they never paid more than necessary.                    That same

20   litany was put to 13 different witnesses.

21                  Thank you.

22              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you,

23   Mr. Haglund.

24              Mr. Pincus, you have two minutes remaining.

25             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1                    ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 2               MR. PINCUS:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 3   Just a couple of points.

 4               With respect to the story of how this

 5   instruction came to be, in fact it closely resembles

 6   some language that was requested by respondent that

 7   appears on page 93A of the joint appendix which refers

 8   to a test that paying a price for logs with higher than

 9   market value unnecessarily to drive out or injure

10   competition.   So I do think that this is an instruction

11   that comes from respondent.

12               It's true that we did not request a Brooke

13   Group instruction because the district court had ruled

14   that Brooke Group didn't apply at the summary judgment

15   phase.   We did object to the instruction proposed by the

16   district judge on the grounds that it did not conform

17   with Brooke Group in order to preserve our argument here

18   and we believe that that objection gives the Court the

19   power to adopt an intermediate rule, but it isn't

20   exactly what we requested and there are decisions in the

21   court of appeals of to that effect.

22               With respect to the question about

23   purchasing more logs than they needed, as we say in our

24   briefs we think that that claim can't really be

25   separated from the predatory pricing claim here because


                                       52
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the argument is that by purchasing more logs the price

 2   was driven up and it's the increased price, that's the

 3   impact that respondent complains of.                   So creating a

 4   separate overbuying claim that relies on price for

 5   impact would be the same thing as saying on the sell

 6   side you can have an overselling claim regardless of

 7   whether you flunk the Brooke Group standard with respect

 8   to prices, and that's just going to undercut the

 9   certainty that this Court has prescribed.

10              With respect to the document that

11   Mr. Haglund cited, 901A about the inputs, that document

12   is described in testimony in the joint appendix at 571A

13   to 573A, and that's a hypothetical look at what the

14   market might would look like if current, past purchasing

15   patterns had continued.       It's not a document that in any

16   way says that the various sources of log supply were

17   locked up and it doesn't indicate that, and in fact

18   there's nothing in the record to indicate what the

19   percentage of logs were that were available to

20   Weyerhaeuser by long-term contract, in contrast, as I

21   said, to the testimony in the record that indicates that

22   respondent got between 30 and 50 percent of its logs

23   through those long-term sources.

24              With respect to the proper disposition of

25   the case, in the Boyle case this Court made clear that


                                      53

 1   where there's no, not sufficient evidence in the

 2   record -- I'm sorry, my time is up.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You can finish your

 4   sentence.

 5                 MR. PINCUS:       Where there's not sufficient

 6   evidence in the record to go to the jury under the

 7   proper jury instruction, the proper outcome is for the

 8   claim to be dropped from the case.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

10   Mr. Pincus.    The case is submitted.

11                 (Whereupon, at 11:03 a.m., the case in the

12   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
