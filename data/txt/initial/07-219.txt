 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  We'll hear argument

 5   versus Baker, et al.

 6               Mr. Dellinger.

 7                   ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER

 8                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9               MR. DELLINGER:           Good morning, Mr. Chief

10   Justice, and may it please the Court:

11               When the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince

12   William Sound on March 24, 1989, the resulting spill of

13   11 million gallons of oil was one of the worst

14   environmental tragedies in U.S. maritime history.

15               The only remaining aspect -- the only aspect

16   of the litigation over the Valdez disaster that is

17   before the Court today concerns almost entirely lost

18   revenues by the commercial fishing industry.                 Exxon long

19   ago paid $400 million in compensation for that lost

20   revenue.   At issue here is whether an additional warrant

21   to the commercial fishing class of $2.5 billion dollars

22   in punitive damages is permissible under Federal

23   Maritime Law.

24               The first of the three reasons that the

25   decision below should be reversed is that the Ninth


                                         3

 1   Circuit erred in overturning a maritime law rule that

 2   has been settled for 200 years.                Although a shipowner

 3   is, of course, liable to fully compensate for all of the

 4   damages caused by the wrongful acts of a captain in

 5   compensation, it is liable for punitive damages under

 6   the long-settled rule only if the shipowner directed,

 7   ratified, or participated in the --

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Mr. Dellinger, how was

 9   that rule settled?      You go in that story and The Amiable

10   Nancy, but no one even raised the question of punitive

11   or exemplary damages in those cases.                      So what is the

12   long-settled line of decisions of this Court in maritime

13   law that you are relying on?

14               MR. DELLINGER:            Justice Ginsburg, The

15   Amiable Nancy is the only maritime case, but this Court

16   in Lake Shore in 1893 --

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               That was on land on the

18   railroad.

19               MR. DELLINGER:            Yes, but this Court's

20   unanimous opinion by Justice Gray in Lake Shore cites

21   with approval The Amiable Nancy decision and the

22   maritime context.     Three times this Court has considered

23   the question of whether there should be respondeat

24   superior liability in punitive damages for the wrongful

25   action.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             You are talking about

 2   maritime law, and relying on The Amiable Nancy.                And my

 3   only point is that was not raised, argued, or decided.

 4   So it's rather, I think, an exaggeration to call it a

 5   long line of settled decisions in maritime law.

 6               MR. DELLINGER:          Justice Ginsburg, the issue

 7   has been so well settled, and Courts of Appeals have so

 8   long recognized, that punitive damages are not available

 9   in vicarious liability in maritime cases that the issue,

10   understandably, doesn't -- doesn't come up.               It's --

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:             And we thought so in

12   Prentice.

13               MR. DELLINGER:          Yes.       In Lake Shore versus

14   Prentice, this Court did in 1818 and 1893 and 1999

15   address this question, once in the maritime context,

16   once in the context of Federal common law, and once in

17   the particular statutory context of --

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, the Lake Shore

19   case, if I remember right, did not involve a managerial

20   employee.   It involved a conductor on a train.

21               MR. DELLINGER:          That's -- that's correct.

22   But it -- but the rule is clear from Lake Shore versus

23   Prentice that it is the same rule as The Amiable Nancy

24   rule.   There is not respondeat superior liability in the

25   absence of some action on the part of the shipowner.

 1   Now, the reason --

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So the shipowner is,

 3   I suppose, the owner of Exxon or the hundreds of

 4   thousands of shareholders, right?                  So you have to have a

 5   shareholder driving the boat before you can assess

 6   liability?

 7                MR. DELLINGER:           No.      The company acts

 8   through its policymaking officers or through its

 9   policies; so that if a reckless judgment is made by

10   someone who had authority to set policy for the company,

11   either the president of Exxon Shipping -- I mean if the

12   Plaintiffs were correct that the jury actually,

13   necessarily --

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So it's not quite

15   correct to say only the owner.                In other words, it is a

16   certain level of employee, because corporations only act

17   through individuals.        It is a certain level of employee

18   in the company.

19                Now, where do you draw the line between the

20   CEO and the cabin boy?         How do you do that?            And I would

21   suspect, just instinctively, that somebody driving one

22   of these huge tankers is a lot closer to the CEO than

23   the cabin boy.

24                MR. DELLINGER:           The one thing that,

25   traditionally, if you look at all the Courts of Appeals

 1   cases and all of the tradition and maritime law, is that

 2   the captain or the pilot, anyone on board the ship, does

 3   not implicate in punitive damages the company, or the

 4   shipowner.

 5                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You mean the captain --

 6                MR. DELLINGER:         -- or the ship owner.

 7                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           -- is not a managerial

 8   officer for any purpose?         Suppose he decides that he's

 9   going to leave despite an adverse weather report?            Is he

10   not a managerial agent at least for that?

11                MR. DELLINGER:         I think the tradition is

12   clear, Justice Kennedy, that if it's a -- that the

13   maritime tradition is that, while you are liable for all

14   of the harms caused by that, the decisions made on the

15   ship do not implicate in punitive damages.

16                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, I'm -- I'm asking

17   about the concept of the managerial officer in general.

18   And I think that we can explore in this argument,

19   whether or not The Amiable Nancy held very squarely

20   about punitive damages, whether we ought to do so in the

21   first instance.

22                MR. DELLINGER:         That is correct.

23                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And it seems to me a large

24   part of that inquiry turns on what a managerial officer

25   is and what -- was Hazelwood not a managerial officer

 1   for any purpose at all?

 2                 MR. DELLINGER:         You know, I can't rule out

 3   the possibility that someone in that position might be,

 4   but he did not set company policy.

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But I thought that you're

 6   talking about a different level.                I think we ought to be

 7   clear on this.    I thought it was conceded that Hazelwood

 8   was, indeed, a "managerial agent" as that term is used

 9   in the Restatement of Torts, right?

10                 So you are talking about it's not good

11   enough that you are managerial agent; you have to be in

12   a higher echelon in the company.                That's your position?

13                 MR. DELLINGER:         That is correct.       There has

14   -- one has to be someone with authority to set relevant

15   policy who has some responsibility over that area of the

16   company's operations that would not --

17                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Why should that be?       I

18   mean, why should there be a different rule?                Let's

19   assume -- I mean I'll assume for the sake of argument

20   that The Amiable Nancy does not settle the issue

21   absolutely.

22                 Why, then, should the -- and it doesn't, it

23   seems to me, settle this distinction at all.                So why

24   should there be a distinction between corporations

25   generally and maritime corporations?

 1                 MR. DELLINGER:          Well, there are two

 2   responses to that question.

 3                 The first is that there is -- this has

 4   worked in the context of maritime law for 200 years, and

 5   -- and because of the -- there has been a long tradition

 6   of needing to foster and promote maritime commerce, and

 7   the fact that it's thought to be particularly risky and

 8   dangerous to conduct maritime commerce.                   But --

 9                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, isn't -- isn't part

10   of the reason, at least for the assumption that there's

11   a distinction, something that I think was mentioned in

12   The Amiable Nancy?      And that is in those days, when a

13   ship put to sea, the ship was sort of a floating world

14   by itself.    And the -- the contact with the shipowner

15   was simply gone until the thing came back into port

16   again.

17                 That is certainly not the case today, and we

18   know it's not the case in the circumstances here.

19                 So if the -- if the relationship to the

20   corporation, to the CEO, if you will, and the captain of

21   a vessel is not in any way different from the

22   relationship of the CEO and, say, a division chief of a

23   corporation, I don't see why that distinction should

24   hold today.

25                 MR. DELLINGER:          There is no question,


                                          9

 1   Justice Souter, but that communications have -- have

 2   improved.   There is a -- there is much of the tradition

 3   of maritime law that still obtains.                     Maritime commerce,

 4   because it takes place on the high seas, is an

 5   inherently and continuously more risky endeavor than

 6   most other occupations, but --

 7               JUSTICE SOUTER:            That may be an argument for

 8   no punitive damages, but I don't see why it's an

 9   argument for distinguishing between maritime

10   corporations and others.         I mean, other -- other kinds

11   of enterprises have a lot of risk in them, too.                    And I'm

12   missing the distinction there.

13               MR. DELLINGER:          Well, to the extent that one

14   doesn't see that the tradition of -- of what's worked in

15   maritime law in its own system of law for 200 years

16   should be different, it is not at all clear why the

17   maritime law rule ought not be the rule on land.                    There

18   are eight States --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, I had not understood

20   you to concede that -- that the land rule was different

21   from the maritime rule.        I gather that in many States

22   it's the same as what you assert the maritime rule to

23   be.

24               MR. DELLINGER:          That is correct.            And it is

25   the rule that this Court adopted in Lake Shore versus

 1   Prentice, and it is -- it is --

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Which was a land case.

 3              MR. DELLINGER:          And the policy behind it --

 4              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But you are right, and I

 5   want to make -- let me just make clear one other point.

 6   You are drawing a distinction, as I understood you to

 7   say to Justice Ginsburg, between the Restatement

 8   position and your position.

 9              MR. DELLINGER:          That is correct --

10              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.

11              MR. DELLINGER:          -- although there are some

12   States that have the Restatement position that may read

13   "managerial employee" in the way that maritime law does,

14   and that is a person who is in a position to set

15   relevant policy for the company and not just the branch

16   manager at a -- at a Wal-Mart.

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But there aren't many

18   States that follow the Restatement position.

19              MR. DELLINGER:          That is correct.     And -- but

20   my point is not that -- my point is simply that there

21   are good reasons for the maritime law rule, and they

22   have been accepted in other cases.

23              When Justice Gray embraced that rule in the

24   Lake Shore case, he did so because he thought it

25   inappropriate to impose punitive elements on someone who


                                      11

 1   was not actually the wrongdoer.               And when Justice

 2   O'Connor wrote in Kolstad, she spoke of the important

 3   principle underlying common law limitations on vicarious

 4   liability for punitive damages.

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Am I right, Mr.

 6   Dellinger, that in the railroad case the court was

 7   dealing with the concept of respondeat superior?                     It

 8   didn't make any distinction between regular employees

 9   and managerial employees, and, indeed, it was not

10   dealing with a managerial employee.

11                MR. DELLINGER:          It was dealing with someone

12   who was at the level of a conductor, I think, exactly on

13   par with the captain.

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But I don't recall that

15   they made anything about managerial.                     They were just

16   talking about respondeat superior at large, I thought.

17                MR. DELLINGER:          Yes.       Now, I think --

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But I don't think the

19   conductor is on a par with a captain.                     The captain has

20   this huge vessel.     He can decide when it leaves.                  He

21   decides the course.      And I think that "managerial

22   officer" might be a divisible concept.

23                Obviously, he doesn't bind Exxon for filing

 1   purpose at all, ever.

 2                 MR. DELLINGER:          For punitive damages.    Of

 3   course, they are bound to pay for all of the harm

 4   caused.     But that --

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Of course, we are talking

 6   about punitive damages but at the concept of a

 7   "managerial officer."        And I haven't heard why he isn't

 8   a managerial officer at least as to some things.

 9                 MR. DELLINGER:          Well, for two reasons:

10                 One, he was unable to set policy for any of

11   these issues.    And think of the larger context.           The

12   reason we want to hold someone, an entity or a person,

13   liable in punitive damages is because they make a

14   decision that is malicious or profit-seeking, or

15   whatever.

16                 When you are advancing the policies of the

17   company and are empowered to advance those policies, and

18   you do so in a way that is either malicious or driven by

19   profit motives or hope to conceal it, when all of those

20   things happen, it is appropriate to visit upon those

21   persons the extra punishment of punitive damages.

22                 And that's why it's not the importance of

23   the job.    It's the fact that when someone acts contrary

24   to the interest -- contrary to the interest of a company

25   and its shareholders, why in that instance should

 1   someone who is not advancing the company's interests,

 2   not authorized to make policy, do so?

 3              So if the --

 4              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Are you --

 5              JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I ask this question,

 6   Mr. Dellinger?

 7              MR. DELLINGER:           Yes.

 8              JUSTICE STEVENS:             In some punitive-damages

 9   cases, the liability attaches because the person has

10   hired someone who is obviously incompetent.

11              Supposing that the -- a crew member was --

12   an obviously incompetent crew member was hired by the

13   captain of the ship.      Would that be sufficient to

14   justify punitive damages?

15              MR. DELLINGER:           Not against the company that

16   owned the ship.   Only if someone --

17              JUSTICE STEVENS:             And if he was hired by a

18   shore-based personnel, then, would that be the

19   difference for you?

20              MR. DELLINGER:           The -- only if the company

21   at a policymaking level is implicated would the company

22   --

23              JUSTICE STEVENS:             The one -- the company

24   says the captain hires the crew members who could cause

25   all sorts of damage.      And another company says somebody


                                       14

 1   on shore can do it.     You have a different rule between

 2   those two?

 3                MR. DELLINGER:         Oh, well, I think if the

 4   case arises in a maritime context, there would not be --

 5   there would not be a different rule, whether a decision

 6   was made on shore or not.          If you are talking about a

 7   maritime law case --

 8                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Would there be vicarious

 9   liability or not in the case:             Negligence in hiring an

10   incompetent crew member?

11                MR. DELLINGER:         Not unless the decision was

12   made by someone at a policymaking level.

13                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Well, he has the authority

14   to decide who to hire.       Is that policymaking?

15                MR. DELLINGER:         No.      That's the

16   implementation of -- that's the implementation of a

17   policy.   So I think what -- if you keep in mind the

18   purposes of punitive damages, as to whether conduct

19   should be deterred and whether it should be punished,

20   and when you are talking about going against the

21   shareholders of the company, not -- of course, they have

22   to pay for all the compensatory harms.                  We don't doubt

23   that.

24                But for punishment the notion is that it is

25   the -- that-- that at least eight States have and it is

 1   in the maritime law rule that you need to show that

 2   there is -- that there is --

 3                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Recklessness in hiring the

 4   employee who caused the damage can be a --

 5                MR. DELLINGER:           Yes, absolutely.         We have

 6   not disputed the fact that if the jury actually did have

 7   to conclude that Exxon was reckless in the supervision

 8   or the hiring or the placement of Hazelwood, that that

 9   would be a grounds for imputing punitive-damages

10   liability.

11                JUSTICE STEVENS:             In hiring the third mate

12   here, if he was negligently hired by somebody on shore,

13   there would be liability?            But if he was negligently

14   hired by the captain, there would be no liability?

15                MR. DELLINGER:           No.      I think it has to do

16   with the level at which the -- at which the hiring

17   decision was made.      It has to be a decision -- and I

18   think the way the case was tried it makes sense that if

19   senior officials for Exxon were informed and if the jury

20   decided on the basis that at a high level at Exxon

21   Shipping that they knew that this person was -- should

22   not be put in command of a ship, and, nonetheless, it

23   did so, that would implicate them.                   If I could --

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              There was -- there was

25   sufficient evidence of that.              I mean --

 1                 MR. DELLINGER:         Yes.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The jury could have found

 3   that Exxon knew that this captain had a severe alcohol

 4   problem; and, yet, they let him stay on voyage after

 5   voyage and did nothing about it.

 6                 So the jury could have found:               Never mind

 7   the captain.    Exxon, itself, is a grave wrongdoer

 8   because it allowed the tanker to be operated by a

 9   captain who was certainly not fit.

10                 MR. DELLINGER:         Yes, and I want to be clear

11   about that.    The answer to that question is:               Yes, the

12   jury could have found that Exxon was reckless in

13   allowing Hazelwood to command the ship and that that

14   recklessness would implicate the company for punitive

15   damages.

16                 But they need not have done so.               They need

17   not even have reached the issue, and the court of

18   appeals said -- it is at page 88 and 89.                 The Ninth

19   Circuit said that the jury could also, in the

20   alternative, have found that Exxon followed a reasonable

21   policy of fostering reporting and treatment by alcohol

22   abusers, knew that Hazelwood had obtained treatment, and

23   did not know that he was taking command of the

24   ship drunk.

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            It was a jury question.

 1   There was evidence both ways.               So, on this issue, am I

 2   right in thinking that if you succeed, all you can get

 3   is a new trial?

 4                 MR. DELLINGER:          That is correct.

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And, I take it, next time

 6   around the jury would get a special verdict and be

 7   asked:     Was Exxon, itself, reckless in allowing this

 8   captain to stay on the ship?

 9                 MR. DELLINGER:          That is correct.           That is

10   correct.

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 That is only true if

12   you lose on your second and third questions as well,

13   right?

14                 MR. DELLINGER:          Yes.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 The answers to your

16   second and third questions preclude a new trial?

17                 MR. DELLINGER:          That is correct.           And that's

18   actually a recent --

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Do you want to get --

20   looking at this case of Lake Shore, as I read -- as I

21   read that case, I'm thinking that they looked back to

22   the admiralty case, but they're saying this isn't an

23   admiralty rule.    It's a Federal rule.                   And the Federal

24   rule is that to make the corporation liable for

25   punitives in the absence of bad conduct by anyone in the

 1   corporation but for the lower executive, you can't do

 2   it.

 3                But if it were a higher executive, the

 4   president and general manager or, in his absence, the

 5   vice president in his place, then you could.

 6                So they are distinguishing among levels of

 7   corporate officials.      Now that seems to be the Federal

 8   rule, right?

 9                MR. DELLINGER:         Yes.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.       Now, what

11   happens to that Federal rule?             One thing we know

12   happened to it is that time passed; Erie v. Thompkins

13   came along; and most of the relevant cases left the

14   Federal courts or Federal law and were decided under

15   State law.

16                Was there anything left in the Federal

17   system besides admiralty where this Federal rule might

18   apply; and, if so, what happened to it?

19                MR. DELLINGER:         The only place it would

20   remain is in statutory settings where the court has to

21   supply the answer to a question of whether punitive

22   damages are an available remedy in a Title VII case.

23   And that's -- that's the only --

24                JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, what happened?         And

25   the reason I think I'd like to know is because it seems

 1   to me it makes a difference from the point of view of

 2   stare decisis whether the Federal rule, as Federal rule,

 3   has always stayed the same or the Federal rule has

 4   eroded so that in place X and Y it disappears, remaining

 5   only in admirality, in which case you have a genuine

 6   outlier.

 7                 And I don't know what the history is.

 8                 MR. DELLINGER:         Well, the -- of course, with

 9   the -- with the replacement of the Arrowsmith versus

10   Tyson by Erie against Thompkins, it was no longer a

11   broad area.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           I know.          That's beside the

13   point to my question.

14                 MR. DELLINGER:         In the lower courts the rule

15   has continued as a maritime rule law.                    It has worked

16   within the context of a maritime law rule.                     Maritime is

17   its own system of law.        The fact that West Virginia --

18   West Virginia has a different law than this Court's

19   maritime law --

20                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Let me just interrupt.          To

21   what extent is present maritime law informed by State

22   common law throughout the country?

23                 MR. DELLINGER:         It is in the absence of a --

24   in the absence of a Federal rule, but here the -- there

25   are -- there's not uniformity among the States.

 1              To turn to the second question of whether --

 2   which would actually preclude the need even to resolve

 3   The Amiable Nancy issue as to whether there should be as

 4   a matter of judge-made maritime law a punitive-damages

 5   remedy for unintentional oil spills.                    Now, the starting

 6   point to think about that, I believe, is this Court's

 7   decision in Milwaukee versus Illinois in 1981.

 8              This is the standard the Court set:                     Federal

 9   courts create common law only as a necessary expedient

10   when problems requiring Federal answers are not

11   addressed by Federal statutory law.                    That precisely

12   describes this case.

13              The Court looking out --

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, the City of

15   Milwaukee involved the displacement by Federal statutory

16   law of Federal common law.         Your case involves the

17   displacement of Federal maritime law by Federal

18   statutory law.

19              Federal maritime law is routine.                     Federal

20   courts do that all the time.           Federal common law is

21   unusual, and in the City of Milwaukee was resorted to

22   simply by necessity.

23              Doesn't that suggest that whatever the

24   Federal maritime rule on punitive damages is, it's a

25   harder showing on your part to conclude that it's


                                      21
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   displaced by the statutory process?

 2              MR. DELLINGER:          Well, the reason I think

 3   that's not -- not the case is twofold.

 4              First of all, the era in which this Court

 5   created lots of admiralty law has receded itself because

 6   Congress has become active, and then there's no longer

 7   a -- as necessary, a role for this Court.

 8              Justice O'Connor, for example, said that in

 9   -- that we sail -- the courts sail -- now sail in

10   occupied waters in making maritime law because of the

11   amount of Federal statutory law.

12              And, secondly, the assumption that there was

13   a well developed punitive damages remedy in maritime

14   law, and that we have a harder road to show that the

15   existence of a series of Federal statutes eliminates the

16   need for that, is just not established.

17              This Court itself has never affirmed an

18   award of punitive damages under maritime law.                 It has

19   never held that punitive damages are available for

20   unintentional conduct in maritime law.                 It has never

21   held that they were available for oil spills.

22              There were only four cases of Federal

23   maritime punitive damage awards in the history of the

24   country before the Clean Water Act was passed.

25   Professor Robinson finds eight more cases that don't use


                                      22
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the term "punitive damages" or "exemplary," or anything

 2   else; but, at most, that would be 12.                      We think the

 3   answer is four.

 4              So that -- and, in fact, the largest award

 5   ever -- ever made was for $500,000.                       So there was no --

 6   and that was after the Clean Water Act.                      So there's no

 7   established tradition of -- of punitive damages.

 8              This Court would be making a major step to

 9   affirm an award, to play a role, in an unintentional

10   case of punitive damages in maritime law for oil spills.

11   Because what Congress has done here is to obviate the

12   need for a remedy by passing a comprehensive and

13   carefully calibrated statute.

14              But the hallmark of the Clean Water Act is

15   the obvious effort to balance --

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                Mr. -- Mr. Dellinger,

17   before we get into the merits of that issue, the Clean

18   Water Act did not enter this case until 13 months after

19   the jury verdict.     And the trial court, who had very

20   carefully managed this case -- and it was a humongous

21   case -- would never list it as an issue in the case.

22   And so he said:     I won't hear it 13 months after the

23   verdict.

24              Why shouldn't we instruct the court of

25   appeals that when a district judge does a diligent job

 1   like that one did to try to get at all the issues --

 2   says you're too late; you can't come in 13 months after

 3   the verdict and argue a point of law that would have

 4   overtaken the verdict, because essentially you're asking

 5   for judgment as a matter of law on this issue.

 6              MR. DELLINGER:          Justice Ginsburg, that sort

 7   of concern has much more force if you are talking about

 8   issues that go to the substantiality of the evidence.

 9   But here the court of appeals --

10              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             No.      Well, what did you

11   make -- you made a motion to bring up the Clean Water

12   Act as dispositive on punitive damages, and you made

13   that motion 13 months after the jury verdict.

14              MR. DELLINGER:          Right.

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And what is the basis in

16   the Federal rules for that motion?

17              MR. DELLINGER:          The motion was made before

18   the entry of judgment.

19              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             13 months after the

20   verdict.

21              MR. DELLINGER:          That -- the motion was

22   not on -- on -- the court of appeals held -- not only

23   did the court of appeals press -- not only was the issue

24   pressed and passed upon by the court of appeals, the

25   court of appeals held that the district court was wrong

 1   in assuming that it was waived.                The district court was

 2   told by the plaintiffs that this was the same motion --

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               But I -- that's not my

 4   question.   My question is:           Under what Federal rules did

 5   you move to bring up this issue 13 months after the

 6   verdict?

 7               MR. DELLINGER:            It was under rule 59, under

 8   rule 49.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               49 is on special

10   verdicts.   What did this have to do with special

11   verdicts?

12               MR. DELLINGER:            I'm sorry.          It was a rule 50

13   -- it was a rule 50 motion.              It was not untimely, and

14   the court of appeals --

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Rule 50 is pretty strict,

16   isn't it?   I mean, rule 50 -- if you want to use rule

17   50, you have to first move before the case goes to the

18   jury.   And if the judge says no, I'll reserve it.                   Then

19   you move again after the jury.                And if you don't, it's

20   got very tight timelines.

21               And you are arguing to a court that has held

22   that these limitations in the Federal rules must be

23   strictly observed.      And I don't know of any time limit

24   in the Federal rules that's stricter than the rules that

25   involve 50(b).

 1                 MR. DELLINGER:          Justice Ginsburg, there are

 2   several answers to the waiver question.                   First of all,

 3   this Court has the authority to based upon it because

 4   the court appeal based upon it.                Secondly, the court of

 5   appeals correctly said that as the -- the plaintiffs had

 6   told the judge, that motion, he need not rule on because

 7   it is the same motion that the -- that had been made

 8   earlier.     Now the earlier motion was based upon the

 9   TAPAA Act, as -- that it features it as a reason why the

10   court need not create or recognize a punitive damages

11   remedy.    The second motion --

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And you didn't appeal on

13   that.     You raised it properly, you lost on it, and you

14   didn't appeal on TAPAA.

15                 MR. DELLINGER:          That would be the case if we

16   hadn't raised it all.        We raised it both times, the

17   court said it was the same motion.                   Here's what the

18   court of appeals said.         The court of appeals said that

19   Exxon clearly and consistently argued statutory

20   preemption as one of the theories --

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Statutory.      But the

22   statute was TAPAA, and it was not the Clean Water Act.

23                 MR. DELLINGER:          That is correct.         But the

24   essential argument, the court of appeals is the same,

25   and if the issue were not raised -- even if the issue


                                         26

 1   had not been raised at all in the trial court, even if

 2   the had not been put before the district court, the

 3   court of appeals still could have agreed to hear the

 4   question of whether a punitive damages remedy is

 5   obviated by the panoply of Federal statutes that are out

 6   there.   That -- that there is -- there was an exercise

 7   of the court of appeals.         The decision is now the law in

 8   the Ninth Circuit and this Court has full authority to

 9   review it, because as the --

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            As you know, there were

11   or at least some strong amici briefs in this case that

12   have asked this Court, tell the court of appeals that's

13   no way to operate vis-a-vis district courts.

14                MR. DELLINGER:         Well, the -- even Professor

15   Miller recognizes that this is not jurisdictional and

16   that the court has the power to do it, the power to hear

17   this case.   And it is before it.              And -- and even if the

18   matter had not been raised in the district court, the

19   court of appeals had authority to consider it.                 And

20   there's --

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Mr. Dellinger, did

22   you say you had a second and a third point?

23                MR. DELLINGER:         Yes.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You going to get to

25   them?

 1                MR. DELLINGER:           Oh, uh -- yes, indeed.

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  All right.

 3                MR. DELLINGER:           The -- the Clean Water Act,

 4   the reason it's an important issue, is that the one

 5   thing that Congress has not done, whether it's in TAPAA,

 6   in the Clean Water Act or the Oil Pollution Act, is they

 7   have not provided for punitive damages but moreover,

 8   they have never had any remedy that is uncalibrated,

 9   that is limitless, that is not carefully measured so

10   that it respects the need to protect the interests to be

11   protective by those laws, by the interest in clean

12   water, with a decision not to overdeter.

13                The problem with having a punitive damages

14   remedy in an area where punitive damages has played no

15   significant role, that is judge-made, is that it simply

16   obliterates the balance that Congress has struck.                    If

17   you look at the --

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             You're talking about

19   tradition.     It has never been the tradition for criminal

20   statutes to have open-ended penalties.                    So that -- that

21   explains why the CWA has specific limits.

22                MR. DELLINGER:           Even on civil fines, even on

23   other aspects of it, there is -- there is a careful

24   calibration.    And once Congress has decided that the

25   limits of liability are twice the measurable pecuniary

 1   loss, to add to that careful set of remedies that

 2   Congress has adopted another remedy that is however many

 3   billions of dollars the jury might choose totally

 4   unsettled the scheme when Congress has addressed the

 5   very issue.    When you ask the question:                  Are punitive

 6   damages available for oil spills, and you look at the

 7   Clean Water Act, which covers so much of the territory

 8   of this act, it is hard to make out the case that --

 9   that there's a need for a judicially created remedy,

10   particularly when the judicially created remedy, unlike

11   something that was done by Congress comes without caps,

12   without structure, without guidance.

13                 If Congress were to decide that a

14   punitive-damages remedy, it's likely that they would

15   place some kind of structural limits or caps on it and

16   not have this limitless, free-floating --

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, perhaps that's a

18   segue to point No.      3.     I don't wish to --

19                 MR. DELLINGER:          No.      That's a -- I think

20   that --

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- to cut you off.           On

22   point --

23                 MR. DELLINGER:          Even if the --

 1   question?

 2               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              My only question is this:

 3   Assume that there will be punitive damages applicable to

 4   Exxon under maritime law in in case.                      We have read in

 5   the briefs about the limits that should be imposed on

 6   these punitive damages.          And those are from our

 7   due-process cases.

 8               If we are deciding this case as a matter of

 9   our authority to determine Federal maritime law, are

10   there factors that we should include in a

11   punitive-damages framework that do not -- that do not

12   appear in our due-process cases?                 And, if so, what are

13   those factors?

14               MR. DELLINGER:            Well, I think surely that's

15   right.   And the -- your question recognizes, as have

16   individual Justices, that -- that here you are like a

17   State court in the sense that, as Justice Scalia said,

18   State courts have ample authority to eliminate

19   unfairness and to set their own rules in this area, as

20   you do here.

21               Now, the first --

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:              You would say one of those

23   factors is the Clean Water Act, wouldn't you?

24               MR. DELLINGER:            Yes.

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Even if it is not

 1   pre-emptive as a matter of law, it's one of the factors

 2   that you can bring to the Court's attention, I suppose.

 3              MR. DELLINGER:            That is correct.

 4              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              And I take it, under that,

 5   you would point to the double -- the provision for a

 6   fine double the amount of the damages?                   That would be a

 7   factor?

 8              MR. DELLINGER:            The --

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I mean, if we're looking

10   for guidelines --

11              MR. DELLINGER:            Yes.       A double --

12              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              -- double general damages

13   is a factor that we could -- that we could follow in the

14   maritime framework?

15              MR. DELLINGER:            Yes, but you would look to

16   what the criminal penalty is that's actually imposed.

17   The Court has said civil fines are a better guide.                  And

18   the civil fine, the maximum civil fine here for both the

19   State of Alaska and the United States, would be $80

20   million.

21              If you look to what the responsible law

22   enforcement authorities and public officials of both the

23   United States and Alaska thought was the proper amount,

24   they imposed a criminal fine of $150 million, which was

25   reduced to $25 million because of the cleanup efforts

 1   and the fact that Exxon prepaid $300 million of the

 2   losses in advance.

 3              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                What about looking at

 4   what this Court said in TXO was proper in a

 5   punitive-damages case?         That is, this spill was

 6   horrendous, but it could have been far worse.

 7              And so, under TXO, you look at what was the

 8   -- could be the maximum damage that could have been

 9   caused by this occurrence, and that could be many

10   times --

11              MR. DELLINGER:             Well, there was -- first of

12   all, it would be different to look at potential harm if

13   the potential harm were attempted by the defendant, and

14   the defendant had been unable to carry out the --

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                But it wasn't --

16              MR. DELLINGER: -- the planned harm.

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                -- a factor here.   I

18   mean, wasn't the example that the captain was trying to

19   maneuver the ship after the disaster in such a way that

20   would have made it much worse?

21              MR. DELLINGER:             That was not even the basis

22   of liability that was put before the jury.                And if you

23   -- and -- nor was it shown that that -- that that would

24   have caused harm.

25              What -- what you really have here is you --


                                         32

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the first thing you would start with, Justice Kennedy,

 2   is to ask whether it is necessary for punishment and

 3   deterrence.

 4                 And when you start with payments that have

 5   reached $3.4 billion in terms of compensation, fines,

 6   remediation, restitution, that clearly obviates the need

 7   for deterrence.

 8                 And if you look to -- if you look to

 9   punishment -- if you look to punishment, here the one

10   thing that is clear is that this was not an intentional

11   act.   It was not malicious.            The company did not stand

12   to make one dollar of profit.              There was no effort to

13   enhance the profits of the company, nor was there any

14   possibility of concealment.

15                 And what the -- what the Plaintiffs put

16   before this Court, the Respondents in this case, are a

17   number of issues that were never put before the jury,

18   not part of the case, by people who were not even

19   plaintiffs; matters that were outside of the record and

20   contrary to the instructions.              So that the jury was told

21   compensation --

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           What would be the

23   formulation of the rule if the Court thinks that any

24   added amount would not deter, and how do we know that?

25   How do you formulate this rule?

 1                MR. DELLINGER:           Well, it is absolutely

 2   essential to formulate some kind of rule.                 The best

 3   guide is to look, I think, at civil penalties, which

 4   gets to -- to $80 million, but to look to what the Court

 5   said in your opinion in State Farm, where -- where

 6   compensatories are so substantial it may eliminate any

 7   need for additional punitive-damages remedy.                 There's --

 8                JUSTICE SOUTER:             May I go back to your

 9   civil-penalty point?

10                MR. DELLINGER:           Yes.

11                JUSTICE SOUTER:             Isn't the problem with the

12   civil-penalty argument is -- that the civil penalties

13   were calibrated for environmental damage, and what we

14   are dealing with here is individual economic damage?                 So

15   we've got an apples and oranges comparison, haven't we?

16                MR. DELLINGER:           Well, two responses:

17                First of all, the $150 million penalty did

18   -- the purpose of the Clean Water Act also includes

19   protection of property.          So it's not just for the

20   environment.     And, indeed, part of the reason for

21   cutting the $150 million award was the compensation that

22   had been paid.

23                But, secondly, if you --

24                JUSTICE SOUTER:             To the -- for lost trade or

25   something?


                                         34
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              MR. DELLINGER:           Right.         It -- even if you

 2   took that as calibrated to the environmental damage, the

 3   environmental damage was twice what the compensation --

 4   the total compensation paid was $500 million.                 The

 5   company paid nearly a billion dollars for natural

 6   resources harm.

 7              If $150 million was the right amount for the

 8   environmental damage, then the right amount for the half

 9   of that that constitutes the lost wages would be $75

10   million, which is itself close to the $80 million.

11              But here I think that it is incumbent upon

12   the Plaintiffs to show why you need deterrence when

13   there was no profit motive, and you've had to pay $3.4

14   million dollars.   And when if you look to punishment,

15   that can't be a black hole into which all the limits on

16   punitive damages disappear.

17              It's whether that -- if this Court can't set

18   standards that would limit an award of this kind, that

19   is a reason for believing that this ought to be done by

20   Congress if there are going to be punitive damages.

21              I'd like to reserve --

22              JUSTICE BREYER:             But the -- I mean, the

23   obvious kind of thing would to be say that the standard

24   would depend upon the reprehensibility of the conduct of

25   the officer of the corporation, including the captain,

 1   if you lost on that.

 2              And where we said roughly before zero to 10

 3   -- and you are quite right that this is a huge amount of

 4   money -- you'd say zero to five, up to five times.                       I

 5   mean that would be rough and ready.                       But the idea would

 6   be to impose enormous deterrence upon large firms

 7   involved in your industry that you are representing not

 8   to make certain the officers on the ship behave in a

 9   reprehensible way.

10              It's crude, but I mean that's the kind of

11   thing that we said in the due-process cases.

12              MR. DELLINGER:             Well --

13              JUSTICE BREYER:               Then why wouldn't you --

14              MR. DELLINGER:             Keep in --

15              JUSTICE BREYER:               Why wouldn't you --

16              MR. DELLINGER:             Keep in mind that the

17   largest award in the history of punitive damages was an

18   award for 500,000.      That was 1/14 --

19              JUSTICE BREYER:               You're going to say --

20   you're going to hear in two seconds -- they're going to

21   say this is the company that makes the most amazing

22   profit, et cetera.      And so you're trying to deter them.

23   So we know what, you know -- so, what do you say to

24   that?

25              MR. DELLINGER:             I -- I say that this -- that

 1   the amount is enough to deter anybody for anything when

 2   it is $3.4 billion.      And it's hard to know how you could

 3   have a punitive rationale for something which was

 4   unintentional, not designed to make a profit, and could

 5   not have been concealed.

 6               Thank you.

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, counsel.

 9                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

10                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

11               MR. FISHER:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

12   please the Court:

13               Each of the three rulings at issue here

14   rests firmly in the mainstream of American tort law.

15   And there is no reason in maritime jurisprudence to

16   depart from those rules.

17               I want to start with the first question

18   presented, what Exxon calls the vicarious liability

19   issue.   And I think it's important to frame the

20   discussion by starting with the actual jury instruction

21   that's at issue in this case.              It's at Pet. App.     301a.

22               It says that a managerial agent is someone

23   who supervises other employees and has responsibility

24   for, and authority over, particular aspects of a

25   corporation's business.


                                        37

 1                 And, as Justice Ginsburg noted, Exxon has

 2   never disputed that Captain Hazelwood satisfied this

 3   definition.     As its own internal documents explain,

 4   Captain Hazelwood was in charge of what they called a

 5   business unit of Exxon Shipping.                 He was in charge of

 6   hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment, of

 7   product; he was in charge of budgeting and personnel

 8   with respect to the vessel; he was also in charge of

 9   safety.     He was the person who decided on behalf of

10   Exxon that it was safe to leave port the night of March

11   23, 1989.

12                 Now, it is our submission that it is

13   perfectly appropriate to expose the corporation to

14   punitive damages based on the reckless acts of such an

15   individual.

16                 In doing so, it does not, as Exxon would

17   contend, impose vicarious liability.                      Rather, what it

18   does is it exposes a corporation to liability based on

19   its own culpability.

20                 The very point of the restatement test, as

21   opposed to the vicarious liability rule that is followed

22   by the majority of the States, is that it requires some

23   complicity on the part of the corporation.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What if it's the

25   lookout posted -- I don't know if they have one -- but

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the lookout posted in the front of the ship, and he is

 2   drunk, and doesn't see the reef or something?                   Is the

 3   corporation liable in that case?

 4              MR. FISHER:           Not for punitive damages,

 5   Mr. Chief Justice.      And the reason why is because the

 6   lookout does not run a business unit of Exxon Shipping.

 7              What is happening here -- and I want to

 8   focus on this for a moment because Mr. Dellinger --

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So you regard the

10   ship as a business unit?

11              MR. FISHER:           That's what Exxon regarded the

12   ship as, and so that's what the record says.                   And the

13   idea is that you had --

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    That's different if

15   they say that it's -- depending on how they categorize

16   the different units tells whether they are liable or

17   not?

18              MR. FISHER:           Well, I don't want to rest

19   primarily on labels.        The idea is function.             And I

20   think, going back to the instruction, what the

21   instruction is asking the jury to determine is:                   Is this

22   a person who has authority over an aspect of a

23   corporation's business?          I think a shorthand for that is

24   in Exxon's own documents that it is --

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:               In respect, I mean, the


                                         39
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   janitor has authority over an aspect of the corporation.

 2   I mean, surely, that can't be the test.

 3                 MR. FISHER:       Well, I think the authority --

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I assume the test is the

 5   person has to be high enough that it justifies holding

 6   the entire corporation.         And I doubt whether a captain

 7   is -- is high enough.       How many of these units does

 8   Exxon have?

 9                 MR. FISHER:       There are about 20 vessels like

10   the Valdez.

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Twenty vessels.

12                 MR. FISHER:       Now, I think Mr. Chief Justice

13   had it right when he said it's no answer to say it can't

14   be the master; it has to be the corporation.                  The

15   corporation can only act through people.                  So there has

16   to be a line drawing that takes place.

17                 Now, this notion of the idea that the master

18   isn't good enough because he had to be a policymaker is

19   new to us.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That was a question

21   that I asked, not a statement.

22                 Well, how do you draw the line?                I mean, is

23   the second in command on the boat a man responsible for

24   policy?

25                 MR. FISHER:       He may not be.           I don't think


                                        40
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the question is whether he's responsible for policy.

 2   Again, it's whether he's the person in charge.

 3              What Exxon during instruction to the

 4   district court asked the jury to be required to find is

 5   that there was a shore-based supervisory official of the

 6   Exxon defendants who made the decision.                     So Exxon itself

 7   recognized that you have to draw the line somewhere.

 8              We think the best place to draw the line,

 9   and the conservative place to law, the line is the

10   managerial-agent rule that's in the Restatement.

11              Now, Mr. Dellinger says there are eight

12   States that follow a different rule.                     And it's important

13   to understand that that's not the case.                     Even among the

14   States that follow the Lake Shore formulation in

15   general, you still have to have a way to implement it.

16   It's not -- the idea is if the corporation has to be

17   complicit, you still have to tell the jury which human

18   beings they can look to for that complicity.

19              So at page 33 of our red brief --

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:              I thought the Lake Shore --

21   well, I thought the Lake Shore and Amiable whatever it

22   is principle was that a captain ain't one of those.                     The

23   captain doesn't -- doesn't do the job.

24              MR. FISHER:          There was no captain at issue

25   in Amiable Nancy.    And, Of course, there wasn't a


                                        41
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   captain at issue in Lake Shore, because it was a

 2   land-based case.

 3               But on page 33 of our red brief we've given

 4   you seven -- several States that say we follow the

 5   complicity test, and here's how you do it.                     You require

 6   the jury to find that the person is at least a

 7   managerial agent.

 8               Exxon itself in its reply brief on page --

 9   page 11, footnote 5, cites several States.                     And I gather

10   these are the States to which Mr. Dellinger is referring

11   when he says there are eight States that follow our

12   rule.

13               Well, we did some research after getting the

14   reply brief, and I want to give you a few cites, because

15   it illustrates the principle yet again.                  Several of

16   those States say we follow the Lake Shore complicity

17   idea.   And, therefore, the way we do it is we require a

18   jury to find at least a managerial agent.                  So Kansas is

19   a State that Exxon cites.

20               In the Flint Hills case at 941 P.2d 374,

21   Kansas says the way in modern times you implement Lake

22   Shore is you require a managerial agent.                  In

23   Connecticut, the Stoltz case 867 A.2d 860, and in the

24   D.C. Circuit, Justice Scalia, they quote one of your

25   opinions.   If you look at D.C. law, the D.C. Court of


                                        42
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Appeals itself and a D.C. circuit in another case have

 2   said -- and this is the Arthur Young case, 631 A.2d 354,

 3   and the GMAC case at 273 F.2d 92 --

 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Do any of those cases say

 5   the managerial agent is liable if he violated express

 6   instructions from an employer?

 7               MR. FISHER:        No State tort case that we're

 8   aware of, Justice Kennedy, adopts -- I think what you're

 9   referring to is the Kolstad policy exception.

10               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Because that's what the

11   last part of your instruction 33 says.                  And it does seem

12   to me that this captain may be managerial for some

13   purposes and not others.         I think that's the way it's

14   going to have to come out.          Maybe not.          But certainly he

15   was not entitled to set aside the policy of Exxon that

16   you cannot navigate a vessel while intoxicated.

17               MR. FISHER:        Well, I think I want to say two

18   things.   The first is that, as I understand it, Exxon

19   has conceded across the board that Captain Hazelwood is

20   a managerial agent.     And in this case -- in this Court's

21   own Kolstad case, if you look at it again, it says

22   Amiable Nancy, Lake Shore and the way you implement

23   that --

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But they have not conceded

25   the accuracy or correctness of instruction 33.                  And


                                       43
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that's because he was not entitled to set aside the

 2   policy on intoxication.

 3              MR. FISHER:         Well, if you were to adopt a

 4   rule that no other State has adopted, which is to say

 5   there was a policy defense in ordinary tort cases, which

 6   unlike Kolstad do not rest on the subjective knowledge

 7   of the actor, even then, we submit, we tried that issue

 8   in this case, Justice Kennedy; and there was -- Exxon

 9   had every opportunity to argue policy.                 In its closing

10   argument to the jury, the only policy it mentioned was

11   the policy of two officers on the bridge while

12   transporting --

13              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            No.      Your instruction says

14   if he was a managerial agent, his acts are attributable

15   to the corporation.     That's it.

16              MR. FISHER:         That's right, Justice Kennedy.

17   We think that's the proper rule of law.

18              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So the corporation's

19   responsibility or complicity or culpability is simply

20   not relevant under your theory of the case, even though

21   that's what you talk about in your brief.

22              MR. FISHER:         Well, I don't want to act like

23   a dog chasing his tail here, Justice Kennedy, but the

24   idea is to ask whether the corporation is culpable, you

25   have to ask which people.         And what happened in this


                                      44
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Court's own decision in Kolstad said in implementing

 2   Lake Shore that you look to the managerial agents.                      And

 3   that's what --

 4                 JUSTICE BREYER:            That's -- that's why I'm

 5   interested in the same question I asked on the other

 6   side.   As I read Lake Shore, it seemed to me my first

 7   reading of it that it picked up this distinction that

 8   Justice Story made, and it said quite right, you could

 9   impute punitives or exemplary damages to a corporation

10   where its managerial official is the one who causes --

11   who behaves recklessly.          But wait, we don't mean quite

12   that.   We mean some managerial officials.

13                 And they seem to refer in the admiralty

14   case, I'll tell you one who he isn't, namely, the ship's

15   captain.     He's not in that category.                   And then in this

16   other case, they say -- they talk about a superintending

17   agent authorized to imply, employ, and discharge the

18   conductor.

19                 And they give that as an example of a

20   managerial official where there would not be exemplary

21   damages assessed against the corporation in light of his

22   conduct.

23                 So when I read that, I thought that this

24   Lake Shore case is just picking up the earlier case; and

25   that's the Federal law.          And you've given the examples


                                         45
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   where the State law has changed; and I have no doubt you

 2   are right.     You read the cases very well.

 3                  But is there an example where I could say

 4   that the Federal law has changed, too?                    And you started

 5   down that track, but the reason this is of probably more

 6   than inordinate concern to me is that I wrote the case

 7   in Sand, I wrote a dissent in Legion, I looked into

 8   stare decisis law and made fairly clear views of what it

 9   is.

10                  So what would you say to someone who has

11   accepted certain legal principles that we have had in

12   prior cases?     And you want to say nonetheless you win.

13   Okay.   Why?

14                  MR. FISHER:       Three reasons, Justice Breyer.

15   The first is with all due respect, Amiable Nancy did not

16   involve the wrongdoing of the captain.                    It involved the

17   wrongdoing of a lower officer on the ship; and so

18   it's -- there's nothing in the Amiable Nancy that deals

19   with captains, so you don't have a stare decisis effect

20   that comes from Amiable Nancy with respect to captains.

21                  The second thing is there are some more

22   recent Federal cases that discuss the Lake Shore

23   managerial agent idea.         We've cited them in our -- in

24   our red brief along through -- I'm flipping now -- but

25   there are RICO cases; there are other cases, and


                                         46
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Mr. Dellinger said, where statutory case -- statutory

 2   regimes need to be implemented.             And we have cited

 3   several lower court decisions that look to the

 4   managerial agent rule to do that, none of this Court.

 5              The third thing is to understand, as you

 6   talked about in Lake Shore, you are having to pick

 7   somebody, and the general idea is higher up is okay, and

 8   way down low is not okay.         Fletcher in his Cyclopedia on

 9   corporations says that if the Lake Shore idea is to make

10   sense today, you have to understand that when you're

11   dealing with humongous corporations, you have to look

12   not just to the president or vice president -- and this

13   is what the D.C. Circuit said in the GMAC case as well

14   -- is that when you deal with multinational corporations

15   with tens of thousands of employees and divisions, you

16   look to -- you look a little bit lower down than those

17   top job titles to managers.

18              And so again this is what Professor

19   Schoenbaum says in his amicus brief to this Court

20   dealing with that from a maritime perspective.

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Mr. Fisher, you --

22   your friend says in his reply brief that you cannot cite

23   one U.S. maritime case that has allowed vicarious

24   liability for punitive damages.             Is this the first one?

25              MR. FISHER:        No, it would not be, Mr. Chief

 1   Justice.   What we did --

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 What's your best

 3   case?

 4               MR. FISHER:        What we did our reply brief --

 5   I'm sorry, what we did in our red brief is cite to

 6   Professor Robertson's article in saying that he

 7   collected the cases, and which he did; and so our best

 8   cases are the City of Carlisle case, the Ludlow and

 9   Ralston against States Rights is very close.                 There's a

10   distinction in Ralston versus exemplary --

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, let's take --

12   take the Ludlow.   Mr. Dellinger says that's a case where

13   the court found that the owner is not vicariously

14   liable.

15               MR. FISHER:        We don't think that's the right

16   reading of the case.      We submit -- we have a footnote in

17   our own brief that says that there are only two cases

18   that they cite in which a captain's conduct is not

19   imputed to the ship's owner.            They are both more than

20   100 years old, and neither of them deal with

21   corporations.

22               So I think it is entirely fair to say that

23   you have more or less an open issue before you today.

24   What I think I want to be sure the Court understands,

25   though, is that there is not a stare decisis problem


                                       48

 1   that this Court has to confront with respect to the

 2   first question.   You have a spattering of a few old

 3   cases that lean in different directions.

 4              JUSTICE BREYER:             And so it differs from

 5   Sand, for example, where they are like two cases?

 6              MR. FISHER:         Pardon me?

 7              JUSTICE BREYER:             It differs from Sand?          You

 8   say it is not -- I'm interested in your last remark.                    In

 9   the Sand ways I found -- you know we went through it,

10   public policy was on the other side.                    But -- but we had

11   several cases, it wasn't a thousand; it was more like

12   two; and the Supreme Court had said in two cases, one

13   very clearly, you know -- you see the point there.

14              MR. FISHER:         Yes.

15              JUSTICE BREYER:             Why do you say there is no

16   stare decisis problem?

17              MR. FISHER:         Well, because neither Amiable

18   Nancy nor the Lake Shore case, which are the only two

19   cases from this Court, dealt with a managerial agent.

20   The more recent cases from this Court, Hydrolevel and

21   Kolstad -- Hydrolevel says any agent for treble damages

22   for antitrust, and Kolstad follows the managerial agent

23   principle, following in the natural evolution of Amiable

24   Nancy and Lake Shore.

25              So I don't think this Court has ever


                                       49
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   considered it to be any stare decisis problem, even if

 2   all of the lower courts were lined up against it, which

 3   is far from the -- far from the case here.               What you

 4   have is a just few lower courts in either correction.                 I

 5   gather that's one of the reasons why this Court decided

 6   to grant certiorari in this case, because there's some

 7   dispute among the lower courts as to exactly how this

 8   principle works in maritime law.

 9              But again, we don't think there's any

10   problem with this Court --

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:             That, and $3.5 billion.

12              (Laughter.)

13              MR. FISHER:         I said one of the reasons,

14   Justice Scalia.

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              There's some confusion,

16   Mr. Fisher, about this Kolstad.              I take your -- it has

17   entered this case at two levels.               One is this business

18   about the company policy; but as far as Exxon having a

19   policy, you don't mix alcohol with employment on a

20   tanker; but Kolstad said it has to be a consistently

21   enforced policy.   So you don't have any problem with

22   Kolstad on that issue, if you're using it here for a

23   managerial --

24              MR. FISHER:         Kolstad starts from the

25   proposition of managerial agent is the proper way to


                                       50
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   implement a complicity rule.

 2               There's a second part of Kolstad that says

 3   we have to change what we think is the ordinary common

 4   law rule, the proper Federal common law rule.                We have

 5   to change it in the context of Title VII because of the

 6   unusual situation in which employers can be held liable

 7   based on the subjective knowledge of the wrongdoer; and

 8   tort law is exactly the opposite.                It is an objective

 9   test.   And so there's no worry in imposing punitive

10   damages here, that you're going to -- that you're going

11   to dissuade an employer from training its employees.

12               Now, on the facts, even if you were to agree

13   with me on that legal argument, you're exactly right on

14   the facts, Justice Ginsburg.            Exxon had a paper alcohol

15   policy that prohibited drinking aboard ship, just like

16   the Coast Guard has a policy to that effect.               But the

17   evidence in this case was that Exxon didn't enforce it.

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So in your theory of the

19   case, instruction 33, if the superior had told Hazelwood

20   don't pilot the ship today, Exxon would still be liable?

21   That's your theory of the case under instruction 33?

22               MR. FISHER:        On the --

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Or the last part of the

24   instruction 36, I think.

25               MR. FISHER:        On the first part of the case


                                       51
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   in phase one that was our -- that was the legal theory,

 2   Justice -- you're right, Justice Kennedy.                 But in phase

 3   three of the trial when a jury decided whether to award

 4   punitive damages, the instructions told it, among other

 5   things -- this is instruction 30 in phase three -- it

 6   told among other things to consider whether or not the

 7   wrongdoers were violating company policy.

 8              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, but that -- that

 9   goes to measures, not to liability.

10              MR. FISHER:         Absolutely.

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             That was the first phase.

12   And that's the instruction, it seems to me, that you

13   have to explain.

14              MR. FISHER:         Well, I -- I accept that, and I

15   think I've explained that by distinguishing an ordinary

16   tort case from the situation in Title VII.                 I think it's

17   instructive for this Court, and we agree with Exxon that

18   when this Court sits as a maritime court, it looks for

19   guidance to what other State courts have done.                    And we

20   think it's instructive that not one single State court,

21   either before or after Kolstad, has adopted a policy

22   defense for defendants.        There's simply no such decision

23   on the books outside of discrimination cases.

24              We think --

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  What is your

 1   position of how to look at the case if you have a

 2   managerial employee who acts contrary to corporate

 3   policy?    Is the corporation still exposed to punitive

 4   damages?

 5                MR. FISHER:        In a tort case, Your Honor?

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 In a case like this.

 7                MR. FISHER:        Yes.       We think -- and that's --

 8   and that's what instruction Justice Kennedy --

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So what can a

10   corporation do to protect itself against punitive

11   damages awards such as this?

12                MR. FISHER:        Well, it can hire fit and

13   competent people who it decides --

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, and assume it

15   has a policy that we will hire fit and competent people?

16                MR. FISHER:        Well --

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And you're saying --

18   that's the question I'm asking.               What if there is a

19   breach of the corporate policy?               I don't see what more a

20   corporation can do.      I mean, your --- other than --

21   other than what?   I mean it has to say that the policy

22   is this, and if somebody breaks the policy, they're

23   liable for compensatory damages, which can as this case

24   shows be in the billions of dollars, and of course the

25   individual is liable for punitive and other awards.

 1                But what more can the corporation do other

 2   than say here is our policies?               And try to implement

 3   them.

 4                MR. FISHER:        Apart from adopting a policy,

 5   they need to implement it soundly.                  And the argument

 6   you're making, if I understand it correctly, would

 7   obtain just as easily if the vice president of Exxon

 8   Corporation or the president of Exxon Shipping, whom

 9   Mr. Dellinger says would put Exxon on the hook, had made

10   the decision to put Joe Hazelwood in command of this

11   ship.   And so you always have the problem --

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 At that level -- at

13   that level, the president, I think you would have an

14   argument that the policy was being changed.                  It's not

15   clear that that argument works when you're dealing with

16   someone at Mr. Hazelwood's level.

17                MR. FISHER:        Well, in some -- I think in

18   some respects we're back to the argument of where you

19   draw the line.   But let's look at the conduct in this

20   case.   Who made the decision that it was safe to depart

21   port that night on behalf of Exxon Corporation?                  Captain

22   Hazelwood.   The record unequivocally says that Captain

23   Hazelwood is the one who made that policy decision.

24                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Let me throw this thought

25   on the table.    If the policy is made by the board of


                                        54
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   directors, can the president unilaterally change the

 2   policy?     The Chief seems to be suggesting he could?

 3                 MR. FISHER:        I don't think so.

 4                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            It seems to me we have

 5   this problem, the president of the company is the same

 6   as the vice president.

 7                 MR. FISHER:        I think that's the point that I

 8   was trying to make.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I suppose that would

10   go to how consistently and how effectively the policy is

11   enforced.     If the president of the company isn't

12   following the policy it's not going to be taken very

13   seriously.     That's different than saying you have a

14   situation where on an episodic and sporadic basis a firm

15   company policy is breached, the individual is breaching

16   the policy.

17                 MR. FISHER:        Well, if we're to the point

18   where the question is whether or not the policy was

19   enforced, we'll very happily rest on the record in this

20   case, because that was what we tried to the jury:                  That

21   there was no serious alcohol policy that was enforced.

22                 We showed 33 instances in the record of

23   Exxon employees drinking with Hazelwood or learning that

24   he drank.     Up and down the corporation, as the district

25   judge explained, for three years, upper management was

 1   receiving reports that this man was drinking aboard the

 2   vessel.

 3               Now, its policy, Mr. Chief Justice, was that

 4   that was not allowed.      But over a three-year span, as

 5   the district judge found again and again and again, they

 6   were told there was a problem.

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:            That wouldn't -- you might

 8   win on that one.   I mean if you show that.               They have --

 9   we have to assume that that isn't so, don't we --

10               MR. FISHER:        I think you assume --

11               JUSTICE BREYER:            -- for purposes of this

12   argument?

13               MR. FISHER:        Well, two -- two points,

14   Justice Breyer:

15               On answering the first question presented --

16               JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.      Okay, that's all.

17               MR. FISHER:        -- you assume --

18               JUSTICE BREYER:            That's fine.

19               MR. FISHER:        -- unless we can show -- unless

20   we can make an overwhelming harmless errors --

21               JUSTICE BREYER:            On the second and third,

22   this is what --

23               MR. FISHER:        The second and third, I think

24   you assume the facts --

25               JUSTICE BREYER:            -- some time available.       I

 1   would like you to address at some point at your

 2   convenience what should the standards be if, in fact,

 3   the captain of a ship, or responsible for conditions,

 4   for example, negligence or recklessness is now going to

 5   be not only imputed to the corporation but subject for

 6   punitives.

 7                 Now, what I'm interested in, in the back of

 8   my mind is:    This is a very dramatic accident.         It

 9   involves oil spills, and they cause a enormous amount of

10   trouble.    But there are accidents every day, and ships

11   are filled with accidents like automobiles in other

12   places.    And there are all kinds of things that go

13   wrong.

14                 And if, in fact, it has not been normal in

15   admiralty until now to assess punitives against the

16   corporation on the basis of the activity of, say, the

17   ship's master, failures of responsibility, then it will

18   be a new world for the shipping industry and for those

19   who work on the ships.

20                 What happens when a sailor slips and is

21   hurt, and it's very serious to that sailor, et cetera?

22   What principles do you have to suggest, if any, for

23   creating a fair system that isn't just arbitrary?

24                 MR. FISHER:       Well, I think this is the

25   perfect segue from the first and third questions.             As I


                                        57
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   transfer there, I want to point out that I think the

 2   only reason that we heard in the first -- the first

 3   portion of the argument for absolving Exxon of

 4   responsibility in the situation is because of the

 5   dangerousness of captaining vessels like this.

 6              This Court has already addressed that

 7   concern in its collision doctrine, and tort law

 8   generally addresses the problem of dangerous activities

 9   and split-second decisions.            And the answer to that is

10   they are simply not reckless when somebody makes a

11   good-faith decision in a crisis in the midst of

12   dangerous activity.     So we don't think there's any

13   special rule that is necessary with respect to the first

14   question presented.

15              Now, you asked me how do deal with it in

16   terms of the size of the award.              We think -- first of

17   all, I think that if I can beg to differ slightly with

18   the way you framed it, as Professor Robertson explained,

19   punitive damages are -- have always been firmly

20   established in maritime law.

21              And then just because there haven't been

22   that many cases doesn't tell you that they've been

23   frowned upon.   It just means that we haven't had that

24   many cases that have resulted in reported decisions.

25              Now, in looking to guidance, this Court


                                       58

 1   isn't sitting as a maritime court.                  So it -- it's siting

 2   as a common-law-type court.             We think the best place to

 3   start is with the common-law tradition, which is that

 4   cases are tried to juries; juries make the first

 5   decision; and then the trial court reviews for passion

 6   and prejudice and for substantial evidence, as our trial

 7   court did here.    And then the court of appeals reviews

 8   that for abuse of discretion.

 9                If there's anything more that's necessary in

10   maritime law, we submit Congress has already stepped

11   into the breach with the Limitation of Liability Act.

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Correct me if I'm wrong.

13   You've read the case -- our case in Cooper, which says

14   that the appellate court has to examine de novo to

15   determine the adequacy or the excessiveness of the award

16   to deter.

17                MR. FISHER:        I think that's a constitutional

18   holding.    What this Court said in Cooper was if --

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, then, a fortiori, it

20   gives us the right and the duty to do so as -- sitting

21   as a common-law-type court.

22                MR. FISHER:        Yes.       I'm not going to fight

23   you on that, Justice Kennedy.              There was an earlier

24   sentence in Cooper that says if no constitutional issue

25   is raised, the only thing an appellate court should do


                                        59

 1   is review for abuse of discretion.                  But I think that

 2   ultimately you end up in the same place, which is that

 3   there's a de novo review of the excessive -- of whether

 4   the award is excessive based on the facts that have been

 5   -- that have been tried.

 6               And if this Court is going to adopt a set of

 7   guideposts for maritime law, we think the proper place

 8   to look is the due- process cases this Court has already

 9   decided.

10               This Court has already -- in its due-process

11   cases, the Court looked to the common law.                 That's

12   where, I gather, the guideposts this Court adopted came

13   from:   Reprehensibility, in particular, which this Court

14   said was the most important indicia, as well as a

15   reasonable relationship, what's commonly referred to as

16   the "ratio test."

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:             What about -- what about

18   looking to the Clean Water Act?               And I wanted to ask you

19   this question about the Act.             Assuming we agree with you

20   that -- that it was too late to raise the Clean Water

21   Act as a separate pre-emptive factor in the case, why

22   was it too late in the appellate court to raise the

23   Clean Water Act as an additional reason why maritime law

24   should not be interpreted to allow punitive damages and,

25   in part 3 of the case, as a factor, why punitive damages

 1   of the amount at issue here should not be allowed?

 2                It seems to me there it's not a new

 3   argument.    It's just an additional factor for arguments

 4   that have already been made.

 5                MR. FISHER:        I think I accept what you said,

 6   Justice Scalia.    The third -- with respect to the size

 7   of the award, we never contested Exxon's ability to

 8   argue that the Clean Water Act is one place you can

 9   look.

10                So, if you were to look to the Clean Water

11   Act, you initially have the problem that Justice Souter

12   mentioned.   You have the apples and oranges problem.

13   The Clean Water Act sets a fine cording to the

14   environmental harm.      Now, the State of Alaska had that

15   estimated in its -- and this is in its brief -- and that

16   came out to be -- I believe the number is about

17   $2.6 billion.

18                So, if you were to look -- if you were to

19   put aside the apples and oranges problem and look to the

20   Clean Water Act, then you get almost the number that

21   we're standing here with today.

22                If you look at the harm a different way, you

23   still get an extremely large number.                     You get $500

24   million of compensation to the Plaintiffs.                     And then on

25   top of that, we think in light of the way this Court has


                                        61

 1   addressed ratio analysis in its other cases, you need to

 2   take account of the fact that there are vast injuries

 3   that have not resulted in any compensation.

 4               So to do any kind of --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Yes.      That's part 3.   What

 6   about part 2?   Why -- why can't the Petitioner raise the

 7   argument or why could not the Petitioner raise it in the

 8   court of appeals?     Okay, we agree that the Clean Water

 9   Act does not pre-empt the granting of punitive damages

10   here, but one of the factors that we ought to take into

11   account in deciding whether modern admiralty law in this

12   situation permits punitive damages is the existence of

13   the Clean Water Act.       That's not a pre-emption thing.

14   Is that also waived, do you think?

15               MR. FISHER:         Well, I think it would be

16   because that's --     they never made that argument in the

17   district court, and they didn't make that argument to

18   the --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:             They don't have to make

20   every tiny little argument.             I mean, you can think of

21   additional points on appeal so long as it's under the

22   same major heading.      And the major heading here is not

23   the Clean Water Act pre-empts punitive damages; the

24   major heading is, rather, modern admiralty law does not

25   permit.   And, you know, they had made other arguments


                                        62
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   about prior cases; they had talked about State law; and

 2   this is just another argument:                By the way, here's

 3   another one.   There's the Clean Water Act.

 4              MR. FISHER:           Well, they didn't make that

 5   argument, but if they had, I don't think it ends up

 6   being any different than their pre-emption argument

 7   because -- remember their pre-emption argument isn't a

 8   pure pre-emption argument.            They're not here today

 9   saying the Plaintiffs can't recover compensatory

10   damages, as was the case in the Milwaukee and Illinois

11   case, for example.      What they're saying is that the

12   Clean Water Act displaces our ability to recover

13   punitive damages.

14              And there, by making the argument that I

15   gather you've sketched out, it looks very much like the

16   same argument that they didn't properly make.

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:               It's close.

18              MR. FISHER:           But it doesn't --

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:               But it doesn't really say

20   pre-emption, and so it's -- it's just another factor to

21   consider when you decide what the evolving law of

22   admiralty requires.

23              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                There was a statute that

24   was raised in the district court.                  And the district

25   court raised this TAPA Act, and they thought that that


                                         63
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   was the statutory guide, and that was the reason why

 2   there should not be punitive damages, but -- so that was

 3   one of the things the court of appeals said under the

 4   head of waiver.     They're substituting one federal

 5   statute for another.

 6                 MR. FISHER:        That's right, Justice Ginsburg.

 7   And at page 103 of the joint appendix, the district

 8   court ruled on that motion and held that TAPAA was the

 9   statute that was controlling with respect to spills of

10   trans-Alaska oil and that the savings clause of TAPAA

11   expressly preserved our ability to seek punitive

12   damages.

13                 That's a ruling that, as you noted, Exxon

14   never appealed, and so it is the law of the case.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 A while ago you were

16   about to make a point on the Limitation of Liability

17   Act.

18                 MR. FISHER:        Yes.

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 A little while ago,

20   you were about to make a point on the Limitation of

21   Liability Act.

22                 MR. FISHER:        Yes.

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But I was -- I would

24   have thought that cuts heavily against you on the third

25   point.     In other words, if we're looking to guidance,


                                         64
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   you look to Federal law.        And whether it's directly

 2   applicable or not, the Limitation of Liability Act

 3   reflects a very strong Federal policy about restricting

 4   liability on shipowners, adopted at a time when it was

 5   intended to encourage maritime -- the maritime economy.

 6   And why isn't that something we should look to, at least

 7   under question three?

 8              MR. FISHER:        Well, as I said, I agree you

 9   should look to it, but you should do it in a way this

10   Court's Miles decision instructs.               It says that Congress

11   doesn't just enact general policies.                   By enacting a

12   statute that gives some protection, Congress indicates

13   not just a general policy, but more importantly, the

14   sphere into which that policy is to be given effect.

15              And so the notion that Congress did step in

16   and give shipowners some protection but left out

17   shipowners like Exxon that behave in the manner at issue

18   in this case, we think is a strong --

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, that means

20   they don't get the really quite extraordinary protection

21   that the limitation of liability gives.                   It doesn't mean

22   that we should ignore the reflection of that policy

23   outside the confines of the Limitation of Liability Act.

24              MR. FISHER:        Well, I think -- I think you

25   should look to it and understand that Congress has


                                      65
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   declined to give the protection.                In OPA 90, which was

 2   passed right after the spill in direct response to the

 3   spill, Congress made explicit that the Limitation Act

 4   should never apply to spills of Trans-Alaska oil.                    And

 5   the TAPAA did the same thing in the --

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   The argument is not

 7   that the Limitation of Liability Act should apply.                   It's

 8   that it would be very strange to say, where Congress has

 9   radically reduced the exposure of shipowners in one

10   area, that we as a matter of development of Federal

11   common law, Federal maritime law should allow

12   dramatically expanded punitive liability in another area

13   of shipowning liability.

14              MR. FISHER:          Well, we don't think we're

15   asking for any kind of expansion of liability.                 All

16   we're asking is for the traditional admiralty rule which

17   has been recognized by Justice Story early on and all

18   through the cases that in cases of reckless indifference

19   a shipowner can be held liable for punitive damages.

20   The only thing --

21              JUSTICE SOUTER:              Mr. Fisher, the problem I

22   have -- maybe it isn't a problem I have, but a question

23   that that argument raises is this:

24              We know something now that Justice Story did

25   not know, and that is we've had an awful lot more


                                        66

 1   experience with punitive damages practice.                And we've

 2   spent the last decade or so of this Court dealing with

 3   the problem of how to set constitutional limits for

 4   awards which sort of by most people's standards verged

 5   on the excessive.

 6                The problem that we've had -- we've had two

 7   problems in coming up with those constitutional

 8   standards:

 9                One is we can't simply substitute ourselves

10   as lawmakers for the State.             We're talking about

11   constitutional limits, not optimum standards.

12                And number two, given those limits on us, we

13   have not been able to come up with anything that could

14   be called determinant standards.                We've never, for

15   example, found a sufficient reason constitutionally to

16   put an absolute ratio kind of limit on it.

17                But here, as you were pointing out earlier,

18   we're sitting as a kind of common-law court.                We are in

19   the position of the States here.

20                Why shouldn't we recognize the difficulty of

21   trying to deal with indeterminate limits which we've

22   proven in the constitutional context and say, therefore,

23   we've simply got to come up with a number, because no

24   other way is going to give us any kind of an

25   administrable standard; and our number -- and I'm not


                                        67
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   saying this should be it -- but our number is going to

 2   be double the compensatory damages?                       That's the limit.

 3              Would that be an illegitimate thing for us

 4   to do or an unwise thing for us to do?

 5              MR. FISHER:           Well, I think it would -- I'll

 6   stick with unwise, Justice Souter.

 7              (Laughter.)

 8              MR. FISHER:           And I think the reason why is

 9   because we agree with that.              You should -- you should

10   look to the experience of the States.                      Not one single

11   State, as a matter of common law authority, has set a

12   bright-line ratio.      The only place --

13              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               But the -- the United

14   States Code, the general criminal code, 18 U.S.C. 3571,

15   has exactly that number.           It's -- for -- it's double the

16   pecuniary loss for a criminal act.

17              And it seems to me, if when we're looking

18   for guidance, as Justice Souter quite properly indicated

19   we must, and Justice Scalia has indicated with reference

20   to the Water Act, that this is -- gives us a very

21   valuable instruction.

22              MR. FISHER:           We think that's one place this

23   Court can look.   But again, a common-law court, we

24   believe, sets standards, not a bright-line rule.                      If you

25   were to adopt some sort of bright-line statute, you'd

 1   have to deal with any number of legislative problems

 2   that the several States have dealt with and Congress,

 3   when it has passed these kinds of limits.

 4              First, you have to decide the ratio number.

 5   You have to pull something out there.                   Then you have to

 6   decide is it on a per capita basis in terms of -- what

 7   several States have done is they've set a limit, that a

 8   ratio only kicks in at a certain dollar amount.                   In this

 9   case, it's worth remembering that the plaintiffs are

10   only standing to recover $75,000 a piece in punitive

11   damages.

12              Now, most States that even have caps, or

13   several of the States at least, say they don't apply if

14   the awards are under a $100,000 per capita.

15              JUSTICE BREYER:             Why?      What's even the

16   theory of that?   Because the theory of punitives is that

17   the individual who's receiving the money wasn't hurt one

18   penny's worth?

19              MR. FISHER:         But the theory --

20              JUSTICE BREYER:             And that really the money

21   ought to go to the people generally in the State or it

22   ought to go to other people, rather than those people

23   who have already been compensated.                 That's the theory of

24   it.

25              MR. FISHER:         I think that's --


                                       69
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 JUSTICE BREYER:            That exhibits the

 2   difficulty for me of trying to figure out how to do it.

 3                 MR. FISHER:        I think the theory of the

 4   States, Justice Breyer, is that if you hurt lots and

 5   lots of people, it's a worse act than if you only hurt

 6   one or two.    And so if you have, as in this case,

 7   destroyed an entire regional economy, that it would be

 8   inappropriate to give some sort of credit for that by a

 9   lower ratio just because you've harmed more people.

10                 Now, there's also --

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But isn't the measure what

12   is necessary to deter?         Isn't that what we've asked

13   first and foremost, not exclusively perhaps?

14                 MR. FISHER:        Well, I think you've looked at

15   punishment and deterrence, Justice Kennedy.

16                 And if I could finish the last thing I want

17   to say about looking at a ratio, several States that

18   even have ratios carve out drunk driving cases and cases

19   involving intoxication from any other otherwise

20   applicable limits.      And that's -- I think one reason

21   why, Justice Kennedy, is deterrence.                      And so, I think

22   let's start with deterrence, but I want to frame that

23   discussion by recognizing that in Cooper this Court said

24   that deterrence is not the only goal; you also look to

25   punishment.

 1               Now, I think Exxon's primary argument on

 2   deterrence grounds is that we've paid $3.4 billion out

 3   of our pocket already as a result of this spill, and

 4   that's a lot of money.         The reality is, once they get

 5   their tax credit and insurance benefits for that money,

 6   the number is really under 2 billion.                     But it's still a

 7   lot of money.

 8               And so I think it's important to look at the

 9   district court proceedings involving the Clean Water

10   Act, involving the criminal prosecution here, and ask

11   whether it makes sense to have Exxon pay additional

12   money in punitive damages.            We think it is.

13               The first thing to understand is that the

14   same district judge that saw the criminal proceedings in

15   this case sat over our trial.               He understood what the

16   criminal case was about, and what it was about was the

17   environment.     That was only thing on the table in the

18   criminal case.     And so, when we tried to argue --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   It was a different

20   jury.   And the jury is the one that set the amount of

21   punitive damages.

22               MR. FISHER:          There was no jury, of course,

23   in the criminal case.

24               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Right.

25               MR. FISHER:          But there was a jury in our


                                         71

 1   case.   The district judge reviewed that and said, after

 2   being instructed in instruction number 36 in our case --

 3   and this is something that we tried -- the chairman of

 4   Exxon took the stand in trial and gave the jury a chart

 5   of all the money that Exxon had paid out of its pocket

 6   and told the jury:        We've been deterred enough, so you

 7   shouldn't award any punitive damages.                       And the jury, of

 8   course, rejected that argument that Exxon made.

 9                 And the district judge reviewing that

10   decision -- and this is around page 240 to 245 of the

11   petition appendix -- the district judge said:                       I think

12   the jury had ample reason to do so.                       And remember to the

13   tune of $5 billion.       And so why did the district judge

14   think that?     Well --

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 This is the same

16   judge who approved the instruction that said Hazelwood's

17   negligence and recklessness is automatically imputed to

18   Exxon, right?

19                 MR. FISHER:        Yes.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So he was operating

21   that under understanding of the law.

22                 MR. FISHER:        Well, not when he was reviewing

23   the size of the award, Mr. Chief Justice.

24                 In the criminal case, the statement of facts

25   supporting the guilty plea in the criminal case -- and

 1   remember, we're only talking about environment in the

 2   criminal case -- and in terms of punishment, the only

 3   money for punishment in the criminal case is $25

 4   million.     All the rest of the money is, as the district

 5   court said, to clean up Exxon's mess or to put money

 6   into the environment.

 7                 Now, for $25 million fine that Exxon paid in

 8   the criminal case, the district judge explained -- or

 9   I'm sorry, the district judge approved the statement

10   that the U.S. attorney submitted, which said the basis

11   for this is that the captain and the third mate were

12   negligent.    That was the only thing even there.

13                 It wasn't until our trial and our discovery

14   that it was brought out that the complicity of the

15   organization ran far deeper.              And so at our -- phase

16   three of our trial, which was entirely about Exxon's

17   conduct, not any more at all about Captain Hazelwood's

18   conduct -- in phase three of our trial we started out

19   the closing argument by saying here's the relevant

20   evidence for the jury.

21                 And we played something for the jury called

22   Trial Compilation 9.        Now, that appears at appears at

23   page 1295 of the joint appendix, and we actually

24   submitted a videotape that we have submitted to the

25   Clerk's office, and it is sitting in the Clerk's office.

 1                 There are 50 segments in Trial Compilation

 2   9, and all 50 deal with Exxon's upper management

 3   receiving reports of Hazelwood's conduct and deeming it

 4   a gross error to put him in command and so forth, all

 5   there.

 6                 So it wasn't until the trial in our case

 7   that it came out how deep the complicity ran in the

 8   organization and how reprehensible the conduct was.

 9                 And in reviewing the award the district

10   judge said:    Now, with that level of complicity and

11   reprehensibility, I think the jury could have decided

12   that Exxon should be punished for this --

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:           What is the relevance?

14                 MR. FISHER:       -- occurrence.

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           What's the relevance of the

16   leg that we're assuming Exxon, other than the captain,

17   did bad things?

18                 MR. FISHER:       We submit that --

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:           You seem to be now talking

20   about the evidence that they did bad things.             But that's

21   the leg that they did --

22                 MR. FISHER:       The district judge said that

23   this is what he deemed a critical factor supporting the

24   punitive award.

25                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, doesn't that show,


                                        74

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   then, that there had to be a finding that they did the

 2   bad thing?

 3                MR. FISHER:       No.      If you accept our argument

 4   in the first that to get in the door, all we had to show

 5   was that a managerial agent was reckless and that

 6   Captain Hazelwood, as Exxon conceded, Was a managerial

 7   agent.   When you are reviewing the size of the award --

 8   and I think we're talking about the third question

 9   presented, the size of the award -- all the -- all the

10   evidentiary questions are resolved in favor of us, and

11   certainly they are resolved in a way that conducting de

12   novo reviews, a lower court understood and told this

13   Court what the record was.          And it is all about the

14   three years that they knew Captain Hazelwood was

15   drinking.

16                But I don't want to leave Justice Kennedy's

17   question about deterrence, because even if this Court

18   looks at the payments Exxon has made from a perspective

19   of deterrence, there are two legs in which Exxon has

20   clearly not been deterred.          The first is that Exxon's

21   own executives testified to Congress shortly after the

22   spill that the results of the spill were, quote, "pretty

23   much as we envisioned."

24                Now, it was also common knowledge in the

25   organization, and this came out at trial, that the idea


                                       75
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   of putting a drunken master in charge of a supertanker

 2   was a potential for disaster and incalculably raised the

 3   chances of a disaster and a catastrophic spill

 4   occurring.     Knowing all this; knowing what could happen;

 5   knowing that the industry did not have sufficient

 6   cleanup equipment to contain a big spill; knowing that

 7   tens of thousands of Alaskans that depended on Exxon

 8   taking proactive action, the kind of action that

 9   Congress had demanded in passing the TAPAA; Exxon

10   nonetheless left Captain Hazelwood in command over a

11   three-year span.     So it wasn't deterred by knowing what

12   would happen if the tanker ran aground.

13                 Even if you look at it from the perspective

14   of having paid the money out of its pocket, what did it

15   do?     It still hadn't been deterred.                    In the wake of the

16   spill, and this is part of Trial Compilation 9, and this

17   was part of the argument to the jury, Exxon fired one

18   person -- Captain Hazelwood.              They reassigned the third

19   mate.     Everybody else up -- further up the chain of

20   command who allowed this to happen received bonuses and

21   raises.     They have taken no action inside the company to

22   express in any meaningful way that they've been deterred

23   by what happened in this incident --

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Fisher --

25                 MR. FISHER:        -- and the amount of money that

 1   they've had to pay.

 2                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- your time is running

 3   out.   And this there's one question I'd like you to

 4   address, and that is are there other cases against Exxon

 5   seeking compensation and punitive damages based on this

 6   oil spill that are still awaiting trial or decision?                  Or

 7   is this it?

 8                 MR. FISHER:       By definition,

 9   Justice Ginsburg, this is a mandatory punitive class, so

10   this is the one and only time Exxon will face the

11   respect of punitive damages.

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So you don't have the

13   problem of litigant A getting these punitive damages and

14   than B, C and D all wanting to --

15                 MR. FISHER:       Right.        One of the many ways in

16   which this case is the mirror image of the due process

17   cases that Justice Souter was referring to that caused

18   this Court to have such great concern about the uptick

19   in punitive damages, here you have a single case.               You

20   have a single digit ratio which is proportionate to the

21   harm that was shown in this case.

22                 You have -- in contrast to State Farm, in

23   the most recent -- second most recent case this case

24   had -- in State Farm you had two plaintiffs who stood

25   before this Court having received $500,000 each in

 1   compensatory damages for the emotional distress of 18

 2   months of not knowing whether an insurance claim was

 3   going to be paid.    What you have today are 32,000

 4   plaintiffs standing before this Court, each of whom have

 5   received only $15,000 for having their lives and

 6   livelihood destroyed and haven't received a dime of

 7   emotional distress damages.

 8                 If there are no further questions, I'll

 9   submit.

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you,

11   Mr. Fisher.

12                 Mr. Dellinger, you have four and a half

13   minutes.

14              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER

15                    ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

16                 MR. DELLINGER:         Let me begin by noting that

17   it's -- I do not think the Court will find in the record

18   that Exxon said this was expected and approved the --

19   you can look at that excerpt on the DVD and see for

20   yourself what was -- what was meant by that.

21                 With respect, it is difficult to decide what

22   level of employee should implicate a company; but it is

23   divisible I think, as Justice Kennedy suggested.                 It is

24   based on whether that employee has authority over the

25   policy, and even a ship captain may have authority over


                                        78

 1   some policies; he did not here.              At the end of the day

 2   what the Ninth Circuit held was that Exxon was liable --

 3   could be liable for 2.5 billion, simply because against

 4   its policies, Hazelwood left the deck.                  That's all that

 5   we need to be found.

 6              Now with respect to the -- with respect to

 7   the amount of punitive damages here, where you are --

 8   punitive damages cases generally look to for the need to

 9   deter the activity where someone acts out of malice and

10   hostility, intending to harm, which is not true here; or

11   when a corporation acts out of a profit motive and hopes

12   perhaps it will be concealed or that it will make enough

13   money off of it.   That is not true here.                Exxon gains

14   nothing by what went wrong in this case, and paid dearly

15   for it.

16              In the criminal case, the U.S. and Alaska

17   agreed that the amount of the penalty was quote,

18   "sufficient to provide punishment and deterrence for the

19   conduct in question."

20              Now if you talk about the -- the amount

21   where you have that kind of deterrent, for an

22   unintentional act that -- of the amount that's already

23   paid, I heard no response to what one would say to

24   Justice Kennedy's opinion in State Farm as an outer,

25   outer limit.   In State Farm the Court said where


                                       79
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   compensatory damages are substantial, then perhaps --

 2   this is the constitutional context -- perhaps an amount

 3   equal to compensatories would be the most.

 4                 What was substantial there was 1 million

 5   dollars.   The compensatories here were 400 or 500 times

 6   the -- what the Ninth Circuit found -- 504 million

 7   dollars.   Yes?

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Just as a class, if you

 9   take them individually, each individual, did Mr. Fisher

10   say 15,000 something?

11                 MR. DELLINGER:         Well, from the stand --

12   first of all, from the stand point of a company it

13   doesn't matter whether you pay one person 500 million

14   dollars or a lot of people 500 million dollars, in terms

15   of punishment and deterrence.

16                 But also it is the case that -- that with

17   regard to the first plaintiff who had been fully

18   compensated, the argument would have been that in light

19   of all that happened, there is no need for punishment

20   and deterrence even in the first case, and certainly

21   cumulatively, when the amount ad reached, say the amount

22   of the civil fines of 80 million, one would have said no

23   more punitives, because the purpose of punitive damages

24   is a public purpose.       It is not to compensate the

25   individual.

 1                 Here we're at 500 times what was considered

 2   substantial in State Farm.            I don't see -- and what is

 3   that -- that part of State Farm is to be considered a

 4   dead letter, how one could not see that this is the

 5   case.     But that -- that amount of compensatories is an

 6   outer limit, because if you look to what the civil

 7   penalties would be that responsible officials have

 8   obtained, it is 80.2 million dollars; and when you look

 9   to the fact that this is a case where, as Justice Breyer

10   notes, with the First Circuit opinion, outside the

11   fishing context there would have been no compensatories

12   paid at all, or owing, because it's consequential

13   damages and in most States, the great majority of the

14   States, that is not even a compensable -- a compensable

15   injury.    But it is a special rule for -- for fishing.

16                 So these are awards -- that would not have

17   been done in any case.         This was a tragic and terrible

18   event, and one for which the company has paid dearly,

19   and the -- at the end of the day, the question will be

20   whether this Court without any guidance should assume

21   that there should a punitive damages remedy in areas

22   where Congress has already acted, and whether, if so,

23   the plaintiffs have made out any case of an additional

24   need for punishment and deterrence beyond what public

25   authorities have agreed to.
