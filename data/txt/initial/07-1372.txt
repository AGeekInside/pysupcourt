 7            ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. MARK J. BENNETT

 8                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 9              MR. BENNETT:            Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11              A 1993 congressional apology resolution did

12   not alter Hawaii's right to transfer its public lands or

13   repeal, by implication, prior congressional enactments

14   that it extinguish all competing claims to those lands.

15   It was, as its sponsor said at the time, a simple

16   apology, and no more.

17              The lands in question were the former Crown

18   and government lands of the Kingdom of Hawaii.                  The

19   Republic of Hawaii was the successor in interest and

20   ownership to those lands and was recognized as such by

21   the United States.      The 1898 Newlands Resolution of

22   Annexation recited that the Republic of Hawaii was

23   ceding the absolute fee ownership of those lands to the

24   United States, and that that cession was accepted,

25   ratified and confirmed.          Once the United States Congress


                                          3

 1   so acted, all competing claims to title were

 2   extinguished, and under precedent going back almost

 3   200 years, the determinations by Congress to accept the

 4   cession were final and conclusive on any court.

 5               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Excuse me.      Does that

 6   proposition settle the question whether your opponents

 7   have equitable interest in the lands?

 8               MR. BENNETT:         Your Honor, what the

 9   Respondents have contended from day one in this case is

10   that they have a property right in this -- in the land,

11   and the Newlands Resolution conclusively settled that

12   question.   There is no property interest that could have

13   competed with the United States as perfect title.               That

14   perfect title was passed to the State of Hawaii in 1959

15   through the 1959 Hawaii Admission Act.

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But would the state of

17   Hawaii, under Hawaii law, be entitled to take the

18   position, if it so chose, that as the new owner of the

19   lands, it has a special duty as a trustee that some

20   other owner might not?

21               MR. BENNETT:         Your Honor, the Admission Act

22   gives the State the right to manage and dispose of the

23   lands according to State law.             So the political branches

24   certainly have the right to decide which lands they are

25   going to use for which of the five purposes --

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But then -- then it's just

 2   a question of whether the Hawaiian Supreme Court --

 3   assuming that it made the decision that I hypothetically

 4   stated -- whether the Hawaiian Supreme Court, as opposed

 5   to Hawaiian legislature, could make the determination of

 6   whether or not there is some special trust obligation

 7   imposed on the State of Hawaii by reason of its own

 8   duties.

 9                 MR. BENNETT:        But, Your Honor, in this case

10   what Respondents urged was that the Apology Resolution

11   changed the legal landscape and commanded the State to

12   hold these lands possibly in perpetuity without

13   alienation.    The Hawaii Supreme Court specifically found

14   that the Apology Resolution dictated the results here,

15   that plaintiffs claims did not even arise until the

16   Apology Resolution was signed into law by President

17   Clinton.   In addition, the plaintiffs -- the Respondents

18   urged upon the Hawaii Supreme Court a property right, a

19   property and ownership interest in these lands.              Even if

20   --

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But, General Bennett, if

22   I understand correctly, looking to your question

23   presented, the only thing before us is the effect of the

24   Apology Resolution.      The question presented doesn't say

25   anything about the Admissions Act or the Newlands


                                         5

 1   Resolution.    So shouldn't we just stick to the question

 2   as you presented it?       Whatever the picture is, does the

 3   Apology Resolution have any substantive effect?

 4                 MR. BENNETT:        Your Honor, that certainly is

 5   one question before the Court, but we believe fairly

 6   included in that question is the issue of the nature of

 7   the State sovereign authority.               The question presented

 8   talks about whether the Apology Resolution changed in

 9   any way the State's sovereign authority, and that

10   question -- certainly interior and predicate to an

11   intelligent resolution of that question is the nature of

12   the State sovereign.

13                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Why is it necessary?   Why

14   isn't it sufficient just to say that this resolution has

15   no substantive effect, period, and then remand to the

16   Hawaii Supreme Court?

17                 MR. BENNETT:        Because, Your Honor, the

18   Hawaii Supreme Court's decision also rests on a premise

19   foreclosed by Federal law, that is that there are

20   competing claims to title.           As late as page 18 of the

21   red brief, Respondents even say now that Native

22   Hawaiians are entitled to these lands as a matter of

23   property law, but they do not say anywhere in the red

24   brief how that property law claim arises or how that

25   property law claim could survive the Newlands

 1   Resolution, the Hawaii Organic Act, or the Admission

 2   Act.

 3                JUSTICE SOUTER:              General, the difficulty I

 4   have is that not only do they not say, so the Supreme

 5   Court of Hawaii didn't say so either.                     And it seems to

 6   me that we would be well advised to make sure that we

 7   understand the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Hawaii

 8   before we start talking about the relationship between

 9   the various Federal statutes and whatever this claim may

10   be.    I simply don't understand the claim myself.

11                I do understand your point, because I think

12   this much is clear from the Hawaiian opinion:                    That they

13   think the Apology Resolution seriously affects the

14   claim.    That we can deal with, but once we get out of

15   that, the -- the whole case seems murky to me.                    Am I

16   missing something?

17                MR. BENNETT:          Well, Your Honor, the Hawaii

18   Supreme Court, at page 69a of the appendix for the

19   petition, says that this was a claim seeking an

20   injunction -- injunctive relief with regard to property

21   rights.    At page 87a of the petition appendix, the

22   Hawaii Supreme Court said there are questions regarding

23   the title to the State's ceded lands.

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              There -- there may well

25   be, but then the Hawaii Supreme Court chose its grounds,


                                          7

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   and it said at one point the resolution dictates the

 2   preservation of the ceded lands.                At another place it

 3   said that Federal law provides the basis for its

 4   decision and that State trust law is interwoven with

 5   that Federal law.    It also said that Federal law grounds

 6   the decision and provides the governing legal standards.

 7               Now, they could not have been clearer.                    They

 8   repeated at least five times that their decision rested

 9   on the resolution, that everything turned on that

10   resolution having substantive effect.                    That's why they

11   said that their decision was driven by Federal law.                    And

12   I don't know why we shouldn't take the Hawaii Supreme

13   Court at its word repeated so many times.

14               MR. BENNETT:          Well, Your Honor, we believe

15   that Respondents' attempt to trivialize this Court's

16   jurisdiction -- they say, for example, in the brief in

17   opposition that even if this Court were to reverse, the

18   Hawaii Supreme Court will simply reinstate the exact

19   same decision, and presumably they would press upon the

20   court the exact parameters they've pressed for 14 years

21   --

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              We don't --

23               MR. BENNETT:          -- that is --

24               JUSTICE BENNETT:             We don't know that for

25   sure.   It may well be, but there is a large -- large


                                         8

 1   difference, and if they're relying on Federal ground

 2   that insulates them from any checks by the Hawaii

 3   polity, but if they are forced to rely on State law,

 4   then it's up to the people of Hawaii whether they like

 5   it or not.   They could change the State statutory law,

 6   equitable notion, constitutional law.                   But by doing what

 7   the Hawaii Supreme Court did, they have taken the case

 8   out of the realm of State law, subject to the political

 9   check, put it on Federal grounds.

10                So I think that that's what -- the issue

11   properly before this Court, and not anything about the

12   interpretation of the Admissions Act, which -- if it's

13   implicit in your question, it's a little hard to see.

14   Ordinarily, if a party wants us to address the effects

15   of a piece of legislation, they will mention that in the

16   question presented.

17                MR. BENNETT:        Your Honor, I agree that this

18   decision clearly rests on Federal grounds, but we would

19   also suggest that the question presented talks about

20   whether the State's sovereign authority is stripped, and

21   the State's sovereign authority, we would submit, is

22   clear.

23                The United States had perfect title.                 The

24   State of Hawaii succeeded to the United States perfect

25   title.   Respondents do not suggest that anywhere in


                                        9

 1   their pleadings why that is not so, or why they continue

 2   to press even with this Court this property right claim

 3   to these lands.    And so we would suggest that it would

 4   be prudent for the Court to address what we believe is

 5   the fairly included question of the nature of the

 6   State's sovereign authority, especially as it would

 7   appear to be entirely not subject to contravention by

 8   the Respondents.

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Well, I'm not sure it

10   would be prudent when the great bulk of the opinion is

11   based on the Apology Resolution.                And I -- I certainly

12   do think you have a powerful argument if the Apology

13   Resolution presents us with a Federal question.                   But the

14   more far-reaching question -- I just inferred --

15   suggests -- might not even be very specifically within

16   the question presented, and even if it's fairly

17   embraced, you used the word "prudent."                   It seems prudent

18   for us to confine our decision to the effect of the

19   Apology Resolution and whether or not the Hawaiian

20   Supreme Court got that part of that right.

21              MR. BENNETT:           Well, with -- with respect,

22   Your Honor, the Court could limit its ruling, but in a

23   case that has been gone on for 14 years and which, in

24   virtually every pleading, the Respondents have filed

25   they have asserted essentially that the State lacks

 1   title to these lands because the United States lacked

 2   title, the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii was

 3   illegal, and that's the precise reason for 14 years the

 4   State has either been through an injunction or, as a

 5   practical matter, not been able to alienate its lands,

 6   that this Court certainly has the ability for a question

 7   that we believe --

 8                JUSTICE ALITO:           If the Apology Resolution is

 9   put aside, I'm not quite sure what is left, other than

10   State-law issues.

11                MR. BENNETT:          Well, what's left --

12                JUSTICE ALITO:           You could -- would there be

13   anything to prevent the Hawaiian legislature from

14   passing a law that says, we have absolute -- we have

15   title to these lands, but we are going to impose a

16   five-year moratorium on any transfer of these lands

17   because we want to promote a reconciliation process?

18                MR. BENNETT:          Your Honor, certainly under

19   the terms of the Admission Act, the authority given the

20   political branches for the management and disposition of

21   the lands is broad and would run up against only the

22   Federal common law of trust that the Ninth Circuit says

23   governs --

24                JUSTICE SOUTER:             But that's not what the

25   Hawaiian Supreme Court said.              I am reading from page 98a

 1   of the petition appendix, the concluding portion of the

 2   opinion. "We hold, number one, that the Apology

 3   Resolution and related state legislation give rise to

 4   the state's fiduciary duty."

 5                The only Federal statute mentioned is the

 6   Apology Resolution, and the rest of their reasoning

 7   seems to rest upon some kind of State equity law or

 8   trust law.   Now, that trust law may ultimately be

 9   inconsistent with prior Federal acts, but the only --

10   the only thing they are disclosing right now is -- aside

11   from the Apology Resolution, seems to be State trust

12   law.

13                MR. BENNETT:        Well, Your Honor, the Hawaii

14   Supreme Court did say that this is an injunction based

15   on property rights.     The Hawaii Supreme Court did say --

16                JUSTICE SOUTER:           But trust law is based on

17   somebody's property rights.            We don't know whether they

18   are talking about legal rights or equitable rights, and

19   that's consistent with the statement I just read to you.

20                MR. BENNETT:        Well, Your Honor, at page 85-A

21   of the appendix to the petition the Court said that the

22   Congress recognized that native Hawaiians had

23   unrelinquished claims to the ceded lands.               And as a

24   result of that recognition the Apology Resolution

25   dictated the entry of this injunction.

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              We believe that clearly that is not so, but

 2   that this idea of unrelinquished claims is an

 3   unrelinquished property-right claim.                   This is what was

 4   urged upon the Hawaii Supreme Court at every stage.

 5              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But, General, I think --

 6   with respect, I still don't know what the position of

 7   the Hawaiian Supreme Court is going to be if this Court

 8   rules that the Apology Resolution does not support the

 9   proposition that you just read.

10              I don't know whether at that point the

11   Hawaiian Supreme Court is going to say, okay, all we

12   have got left to deal with now is State trust law, or

13   whether they've got to pull another rabbit out of the

14   hat and say, but there is -- there is some kind of -- of

15   prior -- there is some kind of a -- a claim against

16   which prior Federal law could not prevail.

17              I don't know.          And I -- that's -- that's why

18   it seems to me, to -- to say the least, imprudent to

19   wade into it at this point.           The one thing we know that

20   seems to have been significant to their decision is the

21   Apology Resolution.     And I think we would be wise to

22   stick to that.

23              MR. BENNETT:         Your Honor, what our response

24   would be is a simple one:         That the issue of the State's

25   title would in our view be undisputed.                  The United

 1   States's title is perfect and indisputable, and the

 2   State's title is perfect and indisputable.              And this

 3   Court has said that one of the functions in -- in cases

 4   where respondents claim an adequate and independent

 5   State-law ground is to remand the case by disabusing the

 6   State court of incorrect notions of what Federal law

 7   either permits or requires.

 8               JUSTICE ALITO:          A point on which both you

 9   and your adversaries seem to agree is that the Apology

10   Resolution really is not critical to the decision of the

11   Hawaii Supreme Court.      Because if you thought that

12   simply taking the Apology Resolution off the books would

13   provide an acceptable outcome from your point of view,

14   you would be happy with our deciding just that narrow

15   question.   And your opponent explicitly says that the

16   apology resolution wasn't critical to the decision of

17   the Hawaii Supreme Court; isn't that true?

18               MR. BENNETT:         Yes, Your Honor, and they have

19   not asked this court to affirm.

20               JUSTICE ALITO:          And isn't it true that you

21   don't think that just saying the Apology Resolution did

22   not change anything would be insufficient?

23               MR. BENNETT:         Your Honor, because it seems

24   to us clear that both the respondents and Hawaii Supreme

25   Court believe that there are property-right claims that


                                       14
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the Native Hawaiians have.          And we believe those

 2   property-right claims are clearly inconsistent with

 3   Federal law, the Newlands Resolution, and the Admission

 4   Act, and that there is no reason for this Court not to

 5   reach such a clear claim.

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:           But they don't say that --

 7   there is nothing in the Resolution and nothing in the --

 8   does anything in the Court's opinion or the Resolution

 9   say that the claims are valid?              We all know they have

10   claims.   They have been making claims.                 Is there

11   anything in any document I have that says the claims are

12   valid claims?   Maybe they are valid, and maybe they are

13   not.

14                MR. BENNETT:        The -- the only thing is the

15   position of the Respondents who assert --

16                JUSTICE BREYER:           Of course, they think they

17   are valid.

18                MR. BENNETT:        But I mean --

19                JUSTICE BREYER:           So -- so since you have

20   normally one group thinks they are valid; another group

21   thinks they are invalid.         Well, here we are.           Let them

22   fight it out.

23                And all we can say is that this Resolution

24   of the Apology doesn't really say who's right.                     And if

25   Hawaii wants to give some more money, or whatever they

 1   want to do, to the Native Hawaiians, that's their

 2   affair.   What's the -- what's the problem?

 3                 MR. BENNETT:        Well, Your Honor, it is

 4   certainly true that the Apology Resolution does not as

 5   Respondents state recognize the validity of any claims,

 6   but federal law forecloses the validity of any claims.

 7   And we believe that that is a question that is fairly

 8   included interior to the question of whether the

 9   Resolution stripped Hawaii of its sovereign authority.

10   It's only natural for the Court to declare what we

11   believe is the indisputable proposition that Hawaii's

12   sovereign authority is based on --

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Could the Hawaiian

14   Legislature pass a law saying that the Native Hawaiians

15   have claims?    Those claims, because of the Federal 1950

16   -- whatever it is -- are not valid any more.                     But that

17   was pretty unfair to them.           And, therefore, what we

18   think we should do is the following.                     And then they pass

19   a whole lot of things that they think would be

20   appropriate to do in light of what I just said.                     What

21   stops that?

22                 MR. BENNETT:        Your Honor, the -- legislature

23   has wide discretion in managing and disposing of the

24   assets.

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And the legislature, if

 1   they had wanted to -- as I understand the Admission Act,

 2   it lists five purposes to any one purpose.              And the

 3   legislature, if it so chose, could say, we want this

 4   property -- the proceeds from this property to be for

 5   the exclusive betterment of the conditions of the Native

 6   Hawaiians.   They could.       It would be up to the

 7   legislature to give it all to the Native Hawaiians.

 8                MR. BENNETT:        That would not violate the

 9   Admission Act, Your Honor.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:           That -- that would not?

11                MR. BENNETT:        That would not.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Would it violate the

13   Admission Act if the legislature had not said -- said we

14   are giving it to them because we want to, because we

15   think it's a good idea.        No, we are giving it to them

16   because we think they have a right to it.

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:           And we feel that we must

19   give it to them because it's theirs.

23                MR. BENNETT:        The legislature believed that

24   it bettered the condition of Native Hawaiians to provide

25   proceeds from land to the Native Hawaiians.             The

 1   Admission Act gives them that ability to do it.

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Did you answer my question

 3   just then?

 4                 MR. BENNETT:         Yes.       I'd -- I'd like to --

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Please, let me put my

 6   question again.     Let's assume that the legislature does

 7   not say, we want to give it to the Native Hawaiians

 8   because we like the Native Hawaiians or because we think

 9   they deserve it; but, rather, we think we have to give

10   it to the Native Hawaiians because it's theirs.

11                MR. BENNETT:          I think that would be contrary

12   to Federal law, Your Honor.

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:             I think it would be.

24                Three binding Federal laws make clear that

25   the State of Hawaii has absolute fee title to the lands

 1   in the Federal trust and also has the power to sell

 2   those lands for the purposes Congress set out in the

 3   trust instrument.

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    What do you think on

 5   the question-presented issue?               Are all of the Federal

 6   laws on which the Hawaii Supreme Court relied to say

 7   there was a cloud on the title before the court.

 8              MR. JAY:         We think that they have been in

 9   the case from the beginning, and they -- they were

10   clearly pressed in the State supreme court.                  And we

11   think they are fairly encompassed in the question

12   presented partly because, as General Bennett said, the

13   -- the questions referenced to the State's sovereign

14   authority, which necessarily includes consideration of

15   the act which made Hawaii a sovereign state, the

16   Admissions Act, is -- is a necessary antecedent to the

17   resolution of that question.

18              But also the admission in the Apology

19   Resolution, itself, in the preamble on which the

20   Respondents rely extensively goes into great detail

21   about the Newlands Resolution and the cession of

22   absolute fee and ownership by the Republic of Hawaii to

23   the United States.

24              JUSTICE ALITO:             Well, I don't see where this

25   law -- where those laws get us.                The -- the argument


                                         19

 1   that is made on the other side is that the Native

 2   Hawaiians have a moral claim to these lands, not that

 3   they have a property-right claim to the lands.

 4               And if the State of Hawaii, acting through

 5   any branch of its government -- and that is not a matter

 6   of concern to us -- says they have a moral claim to the

 7   land and, therefore, there should not be any land

 8   transfers for some period of time, what's inconsistent

 9   with Federal law in their doing that?

10               MR. JAY:      Let me answer that in two steps,

11   Justice Alito.   The first step is that the State's

12   supreme court permanent injunction, although Respondents

13   are now saying that the claims on which -- the claims on

14   which -- they state are moral in nature, but a permanent

15   injunction is a legal obligation and enforceable by

16   contempt.

17               So the State supreme court, by effectively

18   locking up the lands for an indeterminant period of

19   time, has treated them as -- as legally valid and has

20   entered relief that is legal in nature.

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is -- is it the function of

22   the Hawaiian Supreme Court to declare moral obligations?

23               MR. JAY:      Well, Justice --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Would there be any problem

25   -- certainly there is noted the legislature deems there


                                       20

 1   to be a moral obligation and gives the land away on that

 2   basis.   But do you -- do you think there -- there might

 3   be some democracy problem if -- if the Supreme Court of

 4   Hawaii goes around pronouncing moral obligations and --

 5   and giving away land on that basis?

 6               MR. JAY:      Well, Justice Scalia I guess the

 7   second half to my answer to Justice Alito as well, which

 8   is that the State supreme court is not free as a matter

 9   of State trust law or otherwise to formulate obligations

10   that don't relate to the State's obligation as trustee

11   of the Federal trust --

12               JUSTICE STEVENS:            But isn't it perfectly

13   clear that's a question of State law?

14               MR. JAY:      I don't think so, Justice Stevens,

15   because that State law has to comply with the

16   limitations set out in section 5(f)of the Admissions

17   Act.   To be sure, the political branches operating as

18   trustee of the trust have broad discretion to allocate

19   lands within and among the five purposes set out in

20   section 5(f).

21               But what the State can't do and what in

22   particular the State courts can't do in the name of

23   formulating State trust law is to rely on considerations

24   that are all together outside the trust.                In this case,

25   any consideration of the unrelinquished claims of the


                                       21

 1   Native Hawaiians would not be based on their status as

 2   one of the beneficiaries of the trust.

 3              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Are you saying that the

 4   State court couldn't do it but the legislature could?

 5              MR. JAY:       I'm saying the -- the -- no,

 6   Justice Stevens.   The State court can't rely, nor, I

 7   think, could the State legislature --

 8              JUSTICE STEVENS:             Could the legislature do

 9   it?

10              MR. JAY:       The legislature could determine

11   that the wisest use of the lands today, the way that

12   would best further -- promote the welfare of Native

13   Hawaiians today would be not to sell it.                The

14   legislature certainly could do that and then could enact

15   a moratorium that was consistent with that view.

16              But what it can't do is treat it -- and this

17   is the question Justice Scalia asked at the end of

18   General Bennett's presentation -- what the State is not

19   free to do is, based on claims by Native Hawaiians, not

20   as beneficiaries of the section 5(f) trust, but based on

21   considerations that arose before the Admissions Act was

22   ever enacted, based on -- based on their status as

23   competing claimants to the title of the land, give them

24   an equitable, moral, or otherwise claim to lock up the

25   use of the land.

 1              The theory that the Respondents advanced in

 2   the state Supreme Court under the name of trust law is

 3   that a trustee may not, in furtherance of a trust,

 4   engage in an illegal act.           And that is on Joint Appendix

 5   141A to 143A and other places in the record.                     And the

 6   illegal act they contemplate is the continued ownership

 7   of the lands by the State of Hawaii.                     So, the State

 8   cannot, in ostensible furtherance of the federal trust,

 9   rely on State law principles that presume the illegality

10   of the federal trust or the illegality --

11              JUSTICE STEVENS:              The State power -- the

12   State legislative power to act depends on the validity

13   of its reasoning.

14              MR. JAY:        Well, Justice Stevens, the

15   State -- the State has given authority to act for

16   particular purposes.       And so, the purpose of the -- of

17   the -- for which the State acts is necessarily relevant.

18   The State can't act for a purpose that is not --

19              JUSTICE ALITO:            What is the position that

20   it's -- it is imposing a moratorium on land transfers

21   because it thinks this is the best way to promote the

22   interests of the Native Hawaiians, and part of their

23   thinking is that there was an inequity done when

24   absolute title was transferred to the United States and

25   then to the State of Hawaii?             Would that be a violation


                                        23
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   of federal law?

 2              MR. JAY:      I think, Justice Alito, that if

 3   the state made that determination with respect to the

 4   classic Native Hawaiians who are defined in the

 5   Admissions Act as -- as one of the present day

 6   beneficiaries of the trust, and determined that it

 7   was -- that that was the best way to act for the

 8   betterment of Native Hawaiians, which is a permissible

 9   trust purpose, that that would be permissible.

10              But for the State to act on considerations

11   that are wholly extrinsic to the trust, to treat the

12   native -- the claims of Native Hawaiians as valid, even

13   though they are -- and to assume a duty to the Native

14   Hawaiians that has nothing to do with the State's

15   obligations as trustee of the section 5(f) trust, we

16   think that would be impermissible.

17              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But that doesn't seem to be

18   what the Supreme Court of Hawaii has done.             The Supreme

19   Court of Hawaii, in effect, has said the land is tied up

20   until these people who are currently negotiating, the

21   State, the Native Hawaiians and -- what is it, the

22   United Church of Christ, all come to a -- in effect, a

23   resolution and a reconciliation.

24              Whatever that means, it does not sound to me

25   as though it is the recognition of a legal title claim


                                      24

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   or indeed the validity so far as courts are concerned

 2   with validity of any claim the Native Hawaiians are

 3   making.   They are just saying, no more land transfers

 4   until these people sit down and make up their

 5   differences.

 6                 Isn't that all the court is saying at this

 7   point?

 8                 MR. JAY:     Well, the court said,

 9   Justice Souter, that there is a fiduciary obligation not

10   to make these land transfers at any time until this

11   indeterminate point in the future which reconciliation

12   is achieved.

13                 But to say -- to say that that -- that they

14   are not thereby pronouncing on the validity of the

15   title, I think that is inconsistent with the Newlands

16   Resolution.

17                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Isn't the fact that you and

18   I are having this exchange a pretty good indication that

19   we don't know what they meant exactly by that?                  The only

20   thing we can be sure of is that that thought the Apology

21   Resolution had some legal significance.                  They said, you

22   know, it's required after the Apology Resolution.

23                 We can say you are right or you are wrong,

24   and I think we know what -- what we are talking about.

 1   wading into an argument that you and I can't settle

 2   here.

 3              MR. JAY:       Well, I wholly agree,

 4   Justice Souter, that the State supreme court thought

 5   that the Apology Resolution had significance and that

 6   the Apology Resolution --

 7              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             More than significance.

 8   I am reading the sentence that immediately follows the

 9   one that General Bennett brought to our attention on

10   page 85A. It says, "Accordingly, the Apology Resolution

11   dictates that the ceded lands should be preserved

12   pending a reconciliation between the United States and

13   the Native Hawaiian people."

14              It is very fear language, dictates.            And

15   that's why I am really puzzled as how this Court has any

16   business wading into any question other than telling the

17   Hawaii Supreme Court either their right about what the

18   resolution dictates or they are wrong, and they are

19   wrong because it's a nice apology but it's without

20   substantive effect.

21              MR. JAY:       Well, I certainly agree,

22   Justice Ginsburg, that the State supreme court thought

23   the Apology Resolution dictated the entry of the

24   injunction, and the -- also on page 85A the State

25   supreme court says that the Apology Resolution gives

 1   rises to the -- to a fiduciary duty to Native Hawaiians.

 2              And it is -- it is that principle that the

 3   State supreme court was able to find a fiduciary duty

 4   and impose it on the State's trusteeship obligation,

 5   even though that fiduciary duty arises outside the

 6   section 5(f) trust.     And that is why we think that the

 7   scope of the State -- of the State's obligation as

 8   trustee is within the Court's review at this stage.

15   Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

16              The only issue properly presented in this

17   case is whether the Hawaii Supreme Court concluded that

18   the Apology Resolution created an affirmative federal

19   obligation not to sell ceded land.                 In our view, it did

20   not.

21              The Hawaii Supreme Court held only that the

22   sale of ceded lands would breach the State's fiduciary

23   duty to Native Hawaiians under State law.                 And it relied

24   on the Apology Resolution only for its recognition that

25   Native Hawaiians have claims to the ceded lands that are

 1   currently being addressed through the political process.

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So, they relied on

 3   federal law to create the fiduciary obligation.                     So if

 4   we think that federal law did not create the fiduciary

 5   obligation, what should we do?

 6                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          Then the Court should vacate

 7   and remand.     But we believe the better interpretation of

 8   the Hawaii Supreme Court's opinion is that it believed

 9   that the source of the fiduciary duty at issue was State

10   law and not Federal law.           To be sure --

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 All Federal law?

12   All Federal law?    In other words, not simply the Apology

13   Resolution but the other Federal provisions?

14                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          As the source for fiduciary

15   duty?

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Do you think

17   those -- yes.

18                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          The source for the fiduciary

19   duty, according to the Hawaii Supreme Court, was State

20   law.    To the extent that the Hawaii Supreme Court --

21                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Mr. Shanmugam, on page 99,

22   the State supreme court is saying, inasmuch as the

23   Apology Resolution and related State legislation give

24   rise to a fiduciary duty.            They are saying the Apology

25   Resolution did so, too, not only State law.

 1               MR. SHANMUGAM:          They did say at various

 2   points in the opinion that the Apology Resolution,

 3   together with State law, gave rise to the fiduciary

 4   duty.

 5               But I think that if one looks at the

 6   critical portion of the Hawaii Supreme Court's opinion

 7   on pages 31A to 32A, where the Hawaii Supreme Court

 8   actually discusses the relevance of the Apology

 9   Resolution, the Court makes clear that it is relying on

10   it only for the acknowledgment that Native Hawaiians

11   have unresolved claims.

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Then how to you explain

13   the language, over and over again, I won't repeat it,

14   but they said this resolution of ours is dictated by,

15   compelled by, the Apology Resolution?                   Without the

16   Apology Resolution it would be an entirely different

17   case.   And now you seem to be taking what the Hawaii

18   Supreme Court put as the necessary link, the Apology

19   Resolution, before that this would have been impossible,

20   and you are treating it now as sort of window dressing,

21   icing on the cake, really didn't matter.

22               But we would disrespect the Hawaii Supreme

23   Court if we didn't take them at their word and say --

24   using words such as "dictated," "compelled."                   You -- you

25   are treating this as sort of just part of the

 1   atmosphere.

 2                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, it was more than mere

 3   window dressing, Justice Ginsburg.                   The apology

 4   resolution really did confirm the factual predicate for

 5   Respondent's State law claim.               And I do mean to

 6   emphasize that these have been State law claims from the

 7   outset.     If you take a look at the original complaint in

 8   this case, which is found in the Joint Appendix at pages

 9   34a to 36a, the only source of law on which we rely for

10   the counts at issue here was article 12, section 4 --

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That's what you relied on

12   but it's not what the Hawaii Supreme Court relied on,

13   and I would repeat the point I made in the prior

14   argument:    what's worrisome about this is they are

15   fastening on a piece of Federal legislation and said, we

16   are compelled to do this because of Federal law.                   What

17   that does is it removes it from the Hawaii political

18   process.

19                 If they left Federal law out of it, and they

20   said truly this decision rests on State law, we think

21   that the title belongs with the Native Hawaiians, then

22   they have to answer to the policy; and here the Hawaii

23   Supreme Court insulates themselves by using the Federal

24   law as a crutch.

25                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          Let me -- let me be clear

 1   about this, Justice Ginsburg, if the Hawaii Supreme

 2   Court's opinion is read to construe the Apology

 3   Resolution as creating some affirmative duty or

 4   obligation as a matter of Federal law, we agree that

 5   that would be erroneous.        And if the Court --

 6              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Would you agree that there

 7   would be a Federal question if the Hawaiian Supreme

 8   Court said the Apology Resolution dictates our results?

 9              MR. SHANMUGAM:          No, because we believe that

10   read in context, Justice Kennedy, that that statement is

11   consistent with our theory of the Hawaii Supreme Court's

12   reliance on the Apology Resolution.                    So --

13              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why doesn't the Hawaii

14   Supreme Court's reliance upon Hawaiian law to establish

15   that there is some property right on the part of these

16   native Hawaiians -- why doesn't that conflict with

17   Federal law?

18              MR. SHANMUGAM:          The Hawaii Supreme Court

19   relied on Hawaii law only for the existence of the

20   fiduciary duty and that fiduciary duty has repeatedly

21   been recognized by the Hawaii Supreme Court.                   That duty

22   gives Native Hawaiians an equitable or beneficial

23   interest in the plan.

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't care what you call

25   it; it's a property interest.

 1              MR. SHANMUGAM:           Well --

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:             As I read the Federal law,

 3   it extinguished all property rights in these lands; the

 4   lands were transferred to the Federal Government; and

 5   the Federal Government transferred them in absolute fee

 6   without any encumbrances to the State of Hawaii.                 Now if

 7   you are telling me the Hawaii Supreme Court is now

 8   finding as a matter of State law that there is a

 9   property interest on the part of the Native Hawaiians --

10   I don't care what you call it, equitable or whatever --

11   it seems to me that is flat contradiction of Federal

12   law, and probably is an issue that we ought to address

13   in this opinion.

14              MR. SHANMUGAM:           There are two separate

15   issues, Justice Scalia.        The first is what was the

16   source for the injunction in this case.                 And the source

17   of the injunction was Respondent's instant claim for

18   breach of fiduciary duty.          Now to be sure, we were

19   arguing that there would be a breach of the fiduciary

20   duty to Native Hawaiians precisely because Native

21   Hawaiians have underlying claim to the land.                 It's those

22   underlying claims that trigger all of these additional

23   Federal issues that Petitioners are now seeking to

24   inject into the case.

25              But I think that the critical point for

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   purposes of this Court's review at this stage is that in

 2   the Hawaii Supreme Court, we freely and repeatedly

 3   conceded that any underlying claims to ceded lands would

 4   be nonjusticiable.      That much was clear as a matter of

 5   State law.

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:             You concede -- you concede

 7   that the Apology Resolution does not say that the

 8   Hawaiian people's claims are valid.

 9                MR. SHANMUGAM:           The Apology Resolution --

10                JUSTICE BREYER:             Does it say that?   Yes or

11   no.

12                MR. SHANMUGAM:           -- does not directly speak

13   to the merits of any underlying claims.

14                JUSTICE BREYER:             Okay, so if that's so, do

15   you object to a three-sentence pro curiam opinion in

16   this case where we say, to the extent that the Hawaiian

17   Supreme Court could be read to suggest that the Apology

18   Resolution either resolved or cast a cloud, legally

19   speaking, on the title of the trust land, or suggested

20   in any way that land be enjoined -- the sale be

21   enjoined, the Court made a mistake; and insofar as it is

22   resting on State law, that's up to them.

23                MR. SHANMUGAM:           I -- I think so, with one

24   caveat and I don't mean to quibble --

25                JUSTICE BREYER:             Do you think your draft --

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You would object to

 2   that?

 3                 MR. SHANMUGAM:         I think we would acquiesce

 4   in that with one small quibble, which is that I think

 5   the issue being debated here is not whether the Hawaii

 6   Supreme Court relied on the Apology Resolution as

 7   creating some cloud on title.              Precisely because we

 8   conceded below that the underlying claims were

 9   nonjusticiable, the Hawaii Supreme Court did not opine

10   on the merits of those underlying claims.                 The only

11   issue is whether the Hawaii Supreme Court believed that

12   the Apology Resolution created a fiduciary obligation to

13   essentially preserve and protect the ceded lands, until

14   those underlying --

15                 JUSTICE BREYER:           How could it have done

16   that?   I mean, I didn't see anything in here that

17   suggests anything like that.             That is to suggest that

18   the Apology Resolution created an obligation on the part

19   of the State courts to enjoin sales until everything was

20   worked out.    Now I have read this Apology Resolution

21   about six times, and I certainly didn't see anything

22   like that.

23                 MR. SHANMUGAM:         Yes.       And we agree that the

24   Apology Resolution could not be read to create some

25   affirmative duty not to sell the ceded lands.

 1              JUSTICE BREYER:            You agree that the Apology

 2   Resolution does not say who's right about the claim?

 3              MR. SHANMUGAM:          No.      There are various --ere

 4   are various findings in the Apology Resolution that

 5   could potentially be relevant to the ultimate

 6   disposition of the land.

 7              JUSTICE BREYER:            Like what?

 8              MR. SHANMUGAM:          It is, after all,

 9   significant that Congress --

10              JUSTICE BREYER:            What?

11              MR. SHANMUGAM:          Congress expressed its

12   support for the reconciliation process, Justice Breyer,

13   and that would provide an obvious boost in the Hawaii

14   legislature for the ultimate resolution of those claims;

15   and it's really for that reason, to get back to

16   Justice Ginsburg's question, and we feel it's important-

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             If -- if you took Federal

18   law, the Apology Resolution, out of the picture, the

19   Hawaii Supreme Court could reach the result that it

20   reached and then we might have questions about its

21   consistency with the Admissions Act and the Newlands

22   Resolution; but as Justice Breyer said, if we disabuse

23   them of the notion that there is any Federal compulsion

24   here, then the rest is to be sorted out.               We wouldn't

25   have to say that they have a claim under State law, just

 1   not address it.

 2              MR. SHANMUGAM:           Yes.       I think that's it.

 3              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              And the political process

 4   question I think is really bothersome, that the Hawaii

 5   Supreme Court chose to use this Federal crutch.                 It

 6   seems a very weak reed.

 7              MR. SHANMUGAM:           And it's for that reason,

 8   Justice Ginsburg, that we freely concede that if the

 9   Hawaii Supreme Court had relied on the Apology

10   Resolution as creating some Federal duty, that would be

11   problematic.   That would be not --

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  What about the

13   Newlands Resolution and Admission Act and the Organic

14   Law, do you acknowledge that if the Hawaii Supreme Court

15   relied on those, that also would be inappropriate?

16              MR. SHANMUGAM:           Well, it's hard to say

17   because it would depend on how they relied on them, but

18   I think that the critical point --

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  They relied on them

20   the same way you say they relied on the Apology

21   Resolution, to give rise to a fiduciary responsibility

22   under State law.

23              MR. SHANMUGAM:           Well, I don't think that a

24   Federal act could be read as creating a fiduciary duty

25   not to sell the ceded lands.            So I think I would concede


                                       36

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that that would be problematic as well.                But I think

 2   that the question before the Court according to

 3   Petitioners is whether an injunction, even if that

 4   injunction were framed solely in terms of State law,

 5   might itself contravene the Newlands Resolution by

 6   virtue of --

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So you would have no

 8   -- just to carry on the opinion-drafting process, you

 9   would have no objection to an opinion that said no

10   source of Federal law gave rise to a duty under State

11   law, fiduciary or otherwise; that any further

12   proceedings on remand should be based solely on State

13   law?

14              MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, I think that that is

15   right in the sense that we certainly think that the

16   Hawaii Supreme Court in the first place intended to rely

17   on a State law of fiduciary duty.               And we would

18   certainly have no problem with and indeed would welcome

19   a remand that afforded the Hawaii Supreme Court an

20   opportunity to do what we think they did in the first

21   place.

22              JUSTICE SCALIA:            They do nothing at all?

23   Could I get back to Justice Breyer's three-sentence pro

24   curiam, where we just say to the extent that the Supreme

25   Court of Hawaii relied upon the Apology Resolution as

 1   creating any -- any property entitlement in the

 2   Hawaiians, it was in error.            Okay, we send it back to

 3   the Hawaiian Supreme Court and the Hawaii Supreme Court

 4   smiles, and doesn't do a blessed thing.                 Leaves --

 5   leaves the injunction against any distribution of the

 6   land in effect.   What -- what happens then?

 7                MR. SHANMUGAM:         Well, I don't think they

 8   would do that, Justice Scalia.

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:           You don't?

10                MR. SHANMUGAM:         On remand, I think that they

11   would consider the issue of whether the injunction could

12   be granted on State law, which after ball was the basis

13   of our complaint from day one in this case.                And there

14   is certainly language --

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Not if we said "to the

16   extent that."   I mean, if we said it is -- it's grounded

17   on the proposition that the Apology Resolution creates

18   property rights, and that's wrong; then they have to do

19   something.

20                MR. SHANMUGAM:         Well, presumably --

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:           To the extent that it may

22   be grounded on that, we take no position on whether it's

23   grounded on that or not --

24                MR. SHANMUGAM:         Presumably, Justice

25   Scalia --

 1              JUSTICE SCALIA.            -- why would that require

 2   any action on their part?

 3              MR. SHANMUGAM:          If the Court were to write

 4   that opinion, I assume the last line of the opinion

 5   would be to vacate and remand, and that would eliminate

 6   the injunction and so the Hawaii Supreme Court would

 7   have the case once again; and at that point the Hawaii

 8   Supreme Court could clarify that the source of fiduciary

 9   duty at issue was State law.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It's not simply a

11   question of the source of the fiduciary duty.                It,

12   presumably, in the course of saying what the Apology

13   Resolution, the Newlands Act, the Organic Act, and the

14   Admission Act had to say, we may well say something to

15   the effect that, because it conveyed perfect title, it's

16   inconsistent with the cloud of that title, under a

17   fiduciary obligation created by State law or anything

18   else.

19              MR. SHANMUGAM:          And if the Hawaii Supreme

20   Court on remand, Mr. Chief Justice, addressed the merits

21   of any underlying legal claims, then the Court could

22   review the decision, and at that point it might have a

23   sense of, for instance, what those legal claims actually

24   are.

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But if we told them


                                      39

 1   that these various Federal resolutions, including the

 2   Apology Resolution, conveyed title to the State in a

 3   particular way that precluded the burdening of the

 4   State's title on the basis of Federal law, then they

 5   would have to find a basis under State law that was not

 6   inconsistent with the Federal law's conveying of perfect

 7   title.

 8              MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, that is presumably

 9   always true, but, you know, I think for purposes of the

10   current posture of the current case, Mr. Chief Justice,

11   the only Federal issue that is before the Court is the

12   question of whether the Apology Resolution was the

13   source of the underlying obligation.

14              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And do you think --

15              MR. SHANMUGAM:          Petitioners did not --

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Do you think that that

17   resolution is distinguishable in any way from the

18   apology that the United States made to the people of

19   Japanese ancestry who were interned after World War II?

20   The United States did say -- it was -- I think it was an

21   executive order by President Ford that, in no uncertain

22   terms, stated that the United States made a dreadful

23   error and there was never reason for rounding these

24   people up and putting them in interment camps.

25              Did -- is there any difference?             And that,

 1   as I understand it, had no substantive effect until

 2   Congress passed legislation providing for compensation.

 3              MR. SHANMUGAM:          The -- the Apology

 4   Resolution in this case does not speak directly to the

 5   merits of any underlying claims.              What does do is

 6   recognize that the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii

 7   was illegal, apologized for the Federal Government's

 8   involvement in that overthrow, and, in the operative

 9   provision of the resolution, expresses support for the

10   reconciliation process.       And it is that expression of

11   support on which the Hawaii Supreme Court critically

12   relied here in informing its application of State law.

13              JUSTICE BREYER:            If I said that -- just in

14   the opinion -- and said just what you said, and nothing

15   else about the resolution, say we don't see any other

16   way in which the resolution could have supported this,

17   would that -- is that okay with you?

18              MR. SHANMUGAM:          Yes, that would be okay,

19   Justice Breyer, and I do think that it would be

20   important for this Court to make clear that to the

21   extent that the Hawaii Supreme Court, in any subsequent

22   remand, relies on the Apology Resolution only for what

23   are essentially factual findings, its acknowledgment

24   that Native Hawaiians have unrelinquished claims, which

25   is undoubtedly true as a factual matter -- I don't hear


                                      41

 1   petitioners to suggest otherwise -- and its recognition

 2   that there is an ongoing reconciliation process, that is

 3   entirely proper.     And the --

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But then it would

 5   also have to just -- the opinion we're drafting would go

 6   further, I suppose, and since we are interpreting all

 7   these Federal provisions, it may not be sufficient to

 8   say that it did not create this obligation and the

 9   Hawaiian Supreme Court was wrong to do that, but that it

10   precluded the creation under State law of this type of

11   obligation.

12                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, that --

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And if the Hawaiian

14   Supreme Court wants to create, under State law, a

15   particular type of fiduciary obligation grounded on the

16   status of the land prior to admission, then it has to

17   run -- under the Supremacy Clause, it has to be

18   consistent with the Federal provisions.

19                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          But the Hawaii Supreme

20   Court, in the opinion under review, did not ground that

21   duty on any judgment about the validity of the original

22   conveyance of title --

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 No, I'm not saying

24   they did.     That's the first question.                  I'm not saying

25   they grounded it on Federal law; I'm saying we would

 1   have to determine whether Federal law precluded the

 2   grounding of the fiduciary duty under the status of the

 3   land prior to admission.

 4              MR. SHANMUGAM:          But I do think,

 5   Mr. Chief Justice, that that is an entirely discrete

 6   question from the question presented, and it's entirely

 7   discrete precisely because this argument concerning the

 8   Newlands Resolution could have arisen, even if the

 9   injunction were, as we believe it was, unambiguously

10   based solely on State law with nary a reference to the

11   Apology Resolution.

12              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The Native Hawaiians --

13              MR. SHANMUGAM:          And it is precisely --

14              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The Native Hawaiians --

15   they do get 20 percent of the proceeds, correct?

16              MR. SHANMUGAM:          That's correct.

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And what -- that comes

18   out of Hawaii legislation?

19              MR. SHANMUGAM:          Yes, that's right.     It comes

20   out of -- I think it's Hawaii statute 10-13.5, and as a

21   matter of State law they get 20 percent of the revenue

22   from the ceded-lands trust, though the amount of that

23   revenue has itself been the subject of protracted and

24   unresolved litigation.

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The -- the $5.5 million

 1   figure, is that the subject of litigation?

 2                 MR. SHANMUGAM:         The valuation of the

 3   Leiali'i parcel was challenged in this litigation, and

 4   it remains pending before the trial court.

 5                 But, I think, more broadly the important

 6   point is that to the extent that the injunction in this

 7   case was based on the lack of resolution of underlying

 8   claims in the State political process, the Hawaii

 9   legislature could readily resolve those claims without

10   in any way casting any doubt on the validity of the

11   original conveyance of lands to the Federal Government.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           It also, I guess, has a --

13   there -- in the Admission Resolution, it set up a trust.

14   They hold it in trust, and there are five purposes in

15   the trust, and only one of those relates to the Native

16   Hawaiians.    Now, I know from the newspapers -- I don't

17   know the merits of it -- but the trust that has been set

18   up is the subject of controversy continuously.

19                 So what I don't see -- and I hope we don't

20   have to get into this -- is what the relation between

21   the trust principles as enacted in the legislature is

22   and the trust principles set forth in the Admissions

23   Resolution.    Is there any law going to anything like

24   that?

25                 MR. SHANMUGAM:         Well, now -- but let me say


                                        44
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   something about that, because you think that it is

 2   relevant to our interpretation of the Hawaii Supreme

 3   Court's opinion.     What State of Hawaii did, with article

 4   12, section 4 of the Hawaii Constitution, was

 5   essentially to say that, while the State does have some

 6   discretion to use the assets in the section 5(f)

 7   ceded-lands trust for any of the stated purposes, the

 8   State owes a particularly high duty to Native Hawaiians.

 9               The Hawaii Supreme Court has so construed

10   article 12, section 4, in other cases involving the

11   ceded-lands trust.      And, at page 39a of its opinion in

12   this case, the Hawaii Supreme Court plainly relied on

13   that provision as a source of its fiduciary duty, the

14   fiduciary duty that we believe was at issue in this

15   case.   The opinion does not cite that provision in so

16   many words, but it refers to the Hawaii Constitution in

17   a case construing that provision.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Is the court the trustee?

19               MR. SHANMUGAM:            The State is the trustee.

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:              The State is the trustee.

21   So I assume it would be up to the State officers to

22   decide to what extent the obligation to the Hawaiians,

23   among the five obligations, should be given precedence.

24   Is the Supreme Court of Hawaii directing the State

25   officers to give it precedence?

 1              MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, article 12, section 4,

 2   we would respectfully submit, Justice Scalia -- it does

 3   place Native Hawaiians in something of a privileged

 4   position vis-a-vis the other beneficiaries.            And in

 5   construing article 12, section 4, the Hawaii Supreme

 6   Court was doing, albeit in a somewhat unusual context,

 7   what courts do every day, which is essentially to

 8   evaluate whether the trustee is acting consistent with

 9   the trustee's obligations under the terms of the trust.

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:            And saying that the trustee

11   must direct it primarily to -- to that among the five

12   ends.

13              MR. SHANMUGAM:          All that the Hawaii Supreme

14   Court said was, in light of the very realistic prospect

15   that lands may be returned to Native Hawaiians as part

16   of the reconciliation process that Congress recognized

17   in the Apology Resolution, it would constitute a breach

18   of fiduciary duty to sell those lands for another trust

19   purpose, for the simple reason that once those lands are

20   gone, they are gone forever.           And that is entirely

21   consistent with the general principle of trust law, that

22   a trustee in exercising its discretion --

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:            And all this comes from the

24   fact that Congress made reference to and approved a

25   so-called reconciliation process?

 1              MR. SHANMUGAM:             Well, Congress did support

 2   that --

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:               So in -- in perpetuam, this

 4   land can't be transferred because Congress approved the

 5   this reconciliation process?

 6              MR. SHANMUGAM:             Only until the claims of the

 7   Native Hawaiians are resolved.                And what is clear --

 8              JUSTICE SCALIA:               I see.

 9              MR. SHANMUGAM:             -- regardless of the degree

10   of the reliance on the Apology Resolution, Justice

11   Scalia, is that the Hawaii legislature has substantial

12   discretion to act and to act in a way that essentially

13   vacates the terms of the injunction.                      So if the Hawaii

14   legislature either says, we're going to reach a

15   definitive solution of the underlying claims of the

16   Native Hawaiians by giving them land or additional

17   monetary compensation, or the Hawaii Supreme Court

18   determines that --

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Or denying it to them?

20              MR. SHANMUGAM:             Or denying it to them.            Then

21   presumably, according to the terms of the injunction, it

22   would no longer have any force.                So the Hawaii

23   Legislature remains empowered to act in such a way as to

24   get out from under the terms of the injunction to the

25   extent they are restrictive.

 1               I would note, however, parenthetically, that

 2   immediately after this litigation was commenced the

 3   Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources imposed

 4   a unilateral moratorium on the sale of ceded lands.

 5   That moratorium, as an executive matter, has remained in

 6   effect during the 14-year pendency of this litigation

 7   even during the considerable period between the trial

 8   court's ruling in favor of the Petitioners and Hawaii

 9   Supreme Court's ruling in our favor.

10               So there doesn't seem to be any great

11   impetus on the part of the State to sell the ceded

12   lands.   Indeed, Governor Lingle, one of the Petitioners

13   in this case, has recently and repeatedly made

14   statements to the effect that the State has no intention

15   to sell ceded lands.

16               And if that is really the State's position

17   -- and I would be very interested in my friend's,

18   General Bennett's, views on the matter, then it would

19   seem that there really is no case or controversy before

20   this Court at all.      Because if the State has no

21   intention to sell ceded lands and the sale of ceded

22   lands was the instigating event for this litigation,

23   there would not necessarily be any real dispute between

24   the parties.

 1   word --

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So the decision of

 3   the Hawaii Supreme Court would then be vacated.

 4                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          The petition would be

 5   dismissed under Munnsingwear.

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Under Munnsingwear.

 7                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          Yes.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, what is --

 9                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          If there is, in fact,

10   mootness.     And if there were -- if the State -- if the

11   State had not intention to sell ceded lands, presumably

12   the underlying dispute would be moot.

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            I don't quite understand.

14   You mean -- you mean a Federal court can enjoin the sale

15   of my house, and there is nothing I can do about it

16   inasmuch as I do not have any present intention of

17   selling my house --

18                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, if --

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- except to live under

20   that injunction.

21                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          If a Federal court enjoins

22   you from selling your house without any underlying legal

23   authority for doing so, presumably that injunction would

 1   controversy, so I -- I cannot get its validity

 2   adjudicated, right?

 3                 MR. SHANMUGAM:         Well, here the lawsuit was

 4   commenced by Respondents, because Respondents believed

 5   that the State was going to imminently sell the Leiali'i

 6   parcel.   That was the triggering event for this

 7   litigation.

 8                 It now appears at -- at least possible that

 9   the State has no intention to sell even that parcel.                         If

10   that was true --

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't think that -- I

12   don't think that the State has to have an immediate

13   intention to sell any particular piece of land in order

14   to object to an injunction against any sale of land by

15   the State in the future.          I -- I don't think it has to

16   wait until it -- it wants to sell a particular plot.

17                 MR. SHANMUGAM:         Well, it just -- it merely

18   suggests that the -- that there is no longer an

19   underlying dispute, Justice Scalia.                      Because, again --

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           But there is.          The State

21   says that I am free to sell the land, and -- and the

22   Court says, no, you are not.             Isn't that a dispute?

23                 MR. SHANMUGAM:         Well, I -- I think that

24   there is -- you know, that there was a case or

25   controversy as this case came to the Court in the

 1   Article III sense precisely because there was a dispute

 2   between the parties about --

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Your whole case rests on a

 4   cloud on the title in favor of your clients.                    But you --

 5   you ignore the cloud on the title that has been entered

 6   against the State.

 7               MR. SHANMUGAM:            Well, first of all, our

 8   whole theory has never been that there is a cloud on the

 9   title.   To be sure, we have maintained at various points

10   in this litigation that Native Hawaiians do have

11   potentially valid legal claims, as well as moral and

12   political claims, to the underlying land.

13               But we have never argued that the injunction

14   in this case should be based on some assessment of the

15   existence or validity of legal claims.                    To the contrary,

16   we have consistently taken the position -- and this is

17   clear from our briefs in support of the Hawaii Supreme

18   Court -- that any such underlying claims would be

19   nonjusticiable.

20               And for that reason all we were seeking was

21   an injunction to protect these lands until those claims

22   could be resolved through the political process.                    That

23   was all we were conceding below, and the Hawaii

24   Legislature again could readily resolve those underlying

25   claims without in any way casting doubt on the validity

 2   enactment that purports to recognize absolute title --

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Can I --

 4                 MR. SHANMUGAM:         -- to ceded lands.

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Can I go back to your --

 6   your suggestion that this is a moot case because the

 7   government -- because the -- the governor agrees with

 8   your position.    But wasn't a lot of money already sunk

 9   into developing this area of Maui for desperately needed

10   housing?

11                 MR. SHANMUGAM:         A lot of money was sunk into

12   this parcel, at least according to the record below.

13   And the State would remain free at a minimum to proceed

14   with the development by simply entering into long-term

15   leases instead of the sale of these parcels of land.

16   Indeed, that appears to be some suggestion that that is

17   what the State would do in the event that this Court

18   does not vacate the injunction.

19                 And so -- and, indeed, in the State of

20   Hawaii it is not uncommon for land to be transferred by

21   means of such long-term leases.               So it isn't as if the

22   State would be barred from engaging in any development

23   whatsoever.    The terms of the injunction simply prohibit

24   the sale of these lands.

25                 And, again, the State's executive has been

 1   operating under an effective moratorium on the sale of

 2   ceded lands of its own volition during the pendency of

 3   this litigation, which suggests at a minimum, regardless

 4   of the jurisdictional implications, that there is no

 5   great burden on the State from this injunction, which,

 6   again, by its terms lasts only as long as the State

 7   legislature acts.

 8                 And I would add one additional point on that

 9   score, which is that to the extent that we believe that

10   the Hawaii Supreme Court's decision rested on a

11   fiduciary duty under State law, the State would, of

12   course, be free to amend its constitution in order to

13   make clear that the State's fiduciary duty to Native

14   Hawaiians does not run to the extent of requiring this

15   injunction.    But this -- there has been no effort to do

16   that, and I would submit, as a political matter, it

17   would be highly unlikely.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Mr. Shanmugam, you -- you

19   didn't raise in -- in your opposition to the petition

20   the -- the question of mootness.

21                 MR. SHANMUGAM:         Well, the governor's

22   statements about the lack of an intention to sell ceded

23   lands were only made literally in the days before we

24   filed our brief.    We do refer to them in a footnote in

25   our merits brief, and I think that that would be

 1   sufficient to preserve the issue.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, you don't have to

 3   preserve it.   I mean it's -- it's an issue of Article

 4   III jurisdiction, so we would have to look into it on

 5   our -- on our own.      But it does suggest that it is not a

 6   very strong string to your bow, if I may put it that

 7   way.

 8                MR. SHANMUGAM:           Well, I would submit that

 9   even if the Court does not believe that this rises to

10   the level of jurisdictional import, that it is at least

11   significant in assessing the substantiality of the

12   burden on the State.        That the State through its highest

13   representative appears to be suggesting that the State

14   has no present need to alienate any of these lands.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Mr. Shanmugam, just

16   as a matter of curiosity, do you know what percentage of

17   the Hawaiian population is comprised of Native

18   Hawaiians?

19                MR. SHANMUGAM:           I think the most recent

20   figures from the 2000 census are that there are

21   something like 1.2 million people in the State of

22   Hawaii.   And of that number something like 240,000

23   identify themselves as Native Hawaiians in the way that

24   that phrase is currently defined under State law.

25                Thank you.

 3           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. MARK J. BENNETT

 4                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 5              MR. BENNETT:         Thank you, Your Honor.

 6              It is undisputed that Respondents asserted a

 7   property-interest claim.        That any property-interest

 8   claim is, in fact, inconsistent with Federal law.                That

 9   the State has perfect title to these lands, and that

10   there is no possible reason why this Court should not

11   disabuse the State court of the incorrect notion that

12   the State lacks perfect title.

13              On the mootness issue, the ASARCO versus

14   Kadish case makes clear that the injunction that has

15   been entered is a present injury.               But, in addition, the

16   governor, who does not control all of the State lands --

17   there are a variety of independent agencies that do --

18   talked about sale but not transfer or exchange, which

19   are other things that are forbidden by this court's --

20   the State court's -- injunction.              But ASARCO clearly

21   sets out that we have an injury.

22              But, again, what -- the basis of the State

23   court's decision is a property-right interest.               It is

24   now undisputed by counsel that such a property-right

25   interest is absolutely inconsistent with Federal law,

 1   and there is no reason why in this 14-year-old

 2   litigation this Court should not make clear the simple

 3   and indisputed fact that, pursuant to the Newlands

 4   Resolution, the Organic Act and the Admission Act, that

 5   the State has perfect title.
