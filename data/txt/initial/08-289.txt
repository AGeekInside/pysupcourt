 7               ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. STARR:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               In January of 2000 the district court in

12   Arizona concluded that the Nogales school system had

13   failed to provide an equal educational opportunity for

14   its English language learners in that particular

15   district.

16               JUSTICE SOUTER:              I -- I thought the

17   determination was that it had failed to provide funds

18   that could reasonably accomplish the -- the -- the plan

19   which the district itself had adopted.

20               MR. STARR:         Well, Your Honor, the specific

21   finding was that there needed to be -- there were very

22   elaborate findings here.           There needed in fact to be

23   remediation to in fact support a plan, and the State --

24               JUSTICE SOUTER:              But the district agreed on

25   that, I take it.    The district said, you've got to do


                                          4

 1   something.   This is our plan.

 2                And I thought the district court then

 3   said -- the school district did that, and I thought the

 4   district court then said, well, the -- the funding that

 5   you have come up with, or the funding scheme you have

 6   come up with simply is not rationally related to the

 7   plan that you, yourself, have adopted.                  Am I -- am I

 8   wrong on that?

 9                MR. STARR:      You are correct.

10                JUSTICE SOUTER:           Okay.

11                MR. STARR:      It needs to be a rational plan.

12   But then by the time of the 60(b) hearing, the

13   circumstances had dramatically changed.                 There had been

14   a failure.   But in November of 2000, a sea change

15   occurred in educational policy.              The old system in

16   Nogales was done away with throughout the State.

17   Strategic English Immersion, intense immersion, and the

18   results are already being shown.               Nogales --

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What was the year, Mr.

20   Starr, the year of that change to the SEI from the

21   bilingual education?      What was the year of that?

22                MR. STARR:      The voters voted it in, in

23   November of 2000, and it began feathering in very

24   promptly as soon as the school districts could in fact

25   respond, and Nogales --

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And yet the district

 2   court kept renewing his instruction, provide funding

 3   that reasonably relates to the cost, many, many times

 4   after the SEI became effective.                And we -- we have the

 5   original decree which was, what, a declaratory judgment

 6   in 2000.     Then he issues a series of order.                  None -- and

 7   none of them are ever appealed.

 8                 MR. STARR:       That is true.              And in fact one

 9   of the grounds of our submission this morning is that

10   the failure to appeal should be in fact a cause for

11   concern.     Indeed, 60(b)(5) is all about exceptions to

12   finality, especially when we are dealing with a very

13   quintessential State and local function, namely,

14   education.

15                 And, thus, the court should have been open

16   to consider what the Ninth Circuit had commanded it

17   consider, namely the changed circumstances.                    And what

18   were those changed circumstances?                  Nogales was doing

19   great.     A new leadership came in.               Superintendent Cooper

20   made tremendous reforms.           The State responded, not only

21   with a new methodology, but by funding that methodology.

22   And, Your Honor, all of this --

23                 JUSTICE BREYER:             Nogales was doing great?          I

24   mean, I asked my clerk to go get some figures out of the

25   record and she says in 2008 in the sixth grade, just to


                                          6

 1   take an example, 77 percent of the English learners in

 2   Nogales failed the tests as compared to 32 percent

 3   statewide.   In the tenth grade 84 percent failed the

 4   reading exam compared with 34 percent statewide.                   In

 5   2008 the reading exam fourth graders, 67 percent failed

 6   in Nogales, the English learners, compared to 30 percent

 7   statewide.

 8                Now, I'm sure that progress has been made,

 9   but it doesn't seem to me, looking at that kind of thing

10   -- and the record is filled with that kind of thing --

11   that that -- that you could say that the objectives are

12   achieved.

13                MR. STARR:      Your Honor, first of all, the

14   exam to which you are referring is given in English.                    If

15   I am taking German, then I am not going to do well in a

16   German --

17                JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, isn't the point of

18   this to teach the children to learn English?

19                MR. STARR:      But the point is the -- the exam

20   that you should look at is the AZELA exam.

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Excuse me.      I am not

22   following this exchange because I don't understand

23   whether the -- the statewide percentage is the statewide

24   percentage of English learners or the statewide

25   percentage of all students.

 1              MR. STARR:        Here is -- and I think we can

 2   cut to -- I'm sorry.

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:              If you can't answer that, I

 4   think Justice Breyer can.          But I would like to know what

 5   comparison --

 6              JUSTICE BREYER:              He doesn't actually have

 7   the right to ask me questions.

 8              (Laughter.)

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:              I don't.        That's -- that's

10   exactly true.   But --

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Very much true.

12   Counsel, why don't you try and answer?

13              MR. STARR:        Thank you.

14              I would go, if I would -- if you would, to

15   page 46a of our Pet. Ap, where you -- Petition Appendix,

16   where you, in fact, get the information summarized, and

17   then go to -- and this is the Ninth Circuit's own words

18   that "Nogales is doing substantially better," "the State

19   has developed a significantly improved infrastructure."

20              And then if you go to the superintendent's

21   Petition Appendix, you will see -- this is the relevant

22   information under No Child Left Behind, which is one of

23   the changed circumstances -- the Nogales students are,

24   in fact, doing better than across the State.                  The key is

25   to measure the progress that has, in fact, been made and


                                        8

 1   that is not disputed.      Everyone agrees.

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I still don't

 3   have an answer to Justice Breyer's -- I guess

 4   Justice Scalia's question following up on Justice

 5   Breyer's.   What are the parameters or the -- the data

 6   with respect to the figures Justice Breyer gave you?

 7               MR. STARR:       Yes.       The key, I would refer the

 8   Court to Appendix 312 of the superintendent's petition

 9   and the prior pages.      And that gives the percentage of

10   students making progress under the exams that are

11   administered by the State statewide, and that you will

12   see that throughout, including in the high school, that

13   the students are, in fact, making progress.                   The

14   district court concluded that Nogales had --

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So the answer is

16   that Justice Breyer's figures are correct with respect

17   to the appropriate bases of children.                   You are just

18   saying that you want to use a different test than the

19   one that he was quoting?

20               MR. STARR:       Well, again, my quarrel with his

21   figures had to do with the nature of the test being

22   exam.   There are different tests being administered.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Right.    The figures

24   are accurate.   You just think a different test should be

25   used?

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 MR. STARR:       That one shouldn't take too

 2   seriously a test that is --

 3                 JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.       Let's take the

 4   one you mentioned. Let's take the one you mention.                   The

 5   one you mentioned, I take it the student academic

 6   achievement in mathematics, which is something called

 7   the AYP guidelines test, they are for high school, which

 8   you mentioned.     It has -- I think it's 2008, maybe it's

 9   2007 -- we have limited English proficient students,

10   this is passing their test, 22.4 percent of the English

11   learners are at students scoring at or above proficient.

12   The overall rate is 68 percent.                So it seems like about

13   a third.

14                 Now, if you look at the reading language

15   arts, the average is 73.5.            Limited English proficient

16   is 15.4.     And that's quite a difference, 75 percent as

17   to 15.4, in the high schools, on the tests that you have

18   mentioned.

19                 So I just say -- my only point is that we

20   have a couple of findings here; you are right, they have

21   made progress, but they are not quite home yet.                  And I

22   would say that, looking at this record, it seems to

23   suggest that.

24                 MR. STARR:       But not home yet, Your Honor,

25   is, in fact, the key question.                What is home?    And that

 1   brings us to --

 2                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Let's do another one.           What

 3   they started out in the year 2000 is they said one

 4   problem with this State is we don't know what it costs

 5   the average -- the increased program.                       They haven't done

 6   a good study to tell what it costs.                       But we think it's

 7   somewhere around $1500, maybe it's $1300, maybe it's

 8   $1400 per student.      And as of this very moment, the

 9   State is providing 3 to $400, leaving it up to the

10   school district to find the rest of the money, which it

11   has to take from other things like English, or -- is

12   that right?

13                 MR. STARR:       No, that is incorrect, Your

14   Honor.   First of all, there has been a substantial

15   increase in funding, which we supply and summarize at

16   pages 22 and 23 of the opening brief.                      And you will see

17   throughout the testimony -- the testimony is absolutely

18   clear, including the plaintiffs', the Respondents', key

19   witness, Dr. Zumudio, agreed that there has, in fact,

20   been substantial progress, indeed there is an effective

21   program in place.

22                 And so our fundamental quarrel with the

23   approach of the district court is it blinded itself to

24   the significant changes structurally as well as the

25   progress that had been made and just said it doesn't

 1   matter because this is all about funding, and that is

 2   not true.

 3                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Starr, can I take you

 4   back to the beginning of the 60(b) motion, because you

 5   seem to have shifted ground?             The 60(b) motion as

 6   presented to the district court said that this new law

 7   passed by the Arizona legislature, 2064 -- "2064 creates

 8   a plan for adequate funding of programs for the ELL

 9   students."

10                That was the whole basis for the 60(b)

11   motion, whether the new law was supplied adequate

12   funding, and the Speaker of the House and the Senate

13   intervened specifically for the purpose of defending the

14   new law.    Your current argument is detached from the new

15   law.

16                MR. STARR:       It is not detached, but our

17   submission is, in fact, that we look to what the

18   district court had before it in the 60(b)(5) hearing.

19   It had an eight-day evidentiary hearing.                 It was not

20   simply legal argument over that particular bill.                 And

21   that evidence --

22                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But that was the basis

23   for the 64(b) motion, that 2064 provided adequate

24   funding.

25                MR. STARR:       Your Honor, there were a variety

 1   of points made, and the 60(b) submission was not limited

 2   to this new bill.     Rather, it was a totality of the

 3   circumstances, here are the changed circumstances.

 4   That's what the whole eight-day trial was about.                    The

 5   eight-day trial was about what are the new funding

 6   mechanisms, what is happening on the ground in Nogales.

 7   And as I say, even the Respondents' own key witness said

 8   that there is an effective ELL program now in place, and

 9   that, in fact, progress --

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Do we -- do we have

11   the -- the intervention application in the papers before

12   us and the 60(b) motion?

13                 MR. STARR:      Yes, you do -- you do have it

14   before you.    And there is no question that the Speaker

15   and the President were, in fact, submitting to the

16   district court HB 2064 as part of the submission.

17                 My point is the evidentiary hearing went

18   much more broadly and here's the key:                    Under the EEOA,

19   all that is required under the Castaneda framework is,

20   in fact, good faith efforts toward compliance.                    The

21   questions that are flowing suggest there has been no

22   good faith effort at compliance, and there has been.

23   That's what the eight-day hearing was all about.                    That's

24   one of the things that Superintendent Cooper testified

25   to and discredited.

 1               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, I -- help me out

 2   then.   I thought the -- the issue was not whether there

 3   had been any good faith attempt at compliance, but

 4   whether there were two deficiencies under the scheme,

 5   under the -- I forget the statute -- the new bill.               One

 6   deficiency was that it limited the funding for any given

 7   student subject to -- to ELL -- to two-year funding

 8   when, in fact, the evidence showed that you couldn't get

 9   a kid up to par with two years of education.

10               The second deficiency was that the -- that

11   the State funds -- strike that, I'm sorry -- that

12   Federal funds were being used to supplant what should

13   have been a State responsibility rather than merely

14   supplementing.   I take it that is simply a matter of

15   degree, but that was the problem.

16               I thought those were the two problems,

17   two-year funding, supplantation.               Am I -- am I wrong?

18   So there was no -- my point is that there was no denial

19   that some good faith efforts had been made.               The finding

20   was that there were two deficiencies and these were the

21   two deficiencies; is that correct?

22               MR. STARR:       As -- that is correct.          But as

23   to the latter with respect to the Federal funds,

24   supplant versus supplement, all that we have is -- and

25   this is an issue that is entrusted to the Department of

 1   Education.   It's not trusted to the district courts

 2   under No Child Left Behind.            This is an apparatus that

 3   Congress has determined there should no longer be -- not

 4   that EEOA doesn't -- it has its beachhead, it has its

 5   place, but now No Child Left Behind has a very elaborate

 6   process including a plan, and Arizona is in compliance

 7   with that plan.

 8                The point is the HB 2064 points completely

 9   blinded the district court to what was actually before

10   him, and we think that that is wrong.

11                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Mr. Starr, how do you

12   explain the fact the State of Arizona and the board of

13   education are troubled by the same two points?

14                MR. STARR:      There is no question that there

15   is disagreement within the house with respect to that.

16   But, Your Honor, there is no authority on the part of a

17   Federal court under No Child Left Behind to render this

18   kind of interpretation.        And it has blinded us --

19   ultimately, it is irrelevant.             It has blinded us to the

20   issue --

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, what is it -- No

22   Child Left Behind I thought has a specific saving

23   clause, "Nothing in this part shall be construed in a

24   manner inconsistent with any Federal law guaranteeing a

25   civil right."   And the EEOA is such a law.

 1               MR. STARR:         That is correct.           The point that

 2   I am making is the interpretation of supplemental versus

 3   supplant is in fact one that is entrusted to the

 4   Department of Education.           We only have a letter.        That's

 5   not final agency action.           But I want to return to what

 6   we think is the key in a 60(b)(5) hearing.

 7               What is key in 60(b)(5) is to listen to the

 8   changed circumstances.         What are the changed

 9   circumstances?     And the Court blinded itself to these

10   very important changes in terms of State funding --

11               JUSTICE BREYER:              What is the one State

12   funding?   Because I looked at your brief, page 22 to 23,

13   and if I understand it correctly it says that the

14   educational expenditures, that is to say monies,

15   increased in this Nogales and USD --

16               MR. STARR:         Yes.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:              -- maintenance and

18   operation budget, by 30 percent.                 Well, I'm sure they

19   did.   But that's I take it the entire maintenance and

20   operation budget.     The numbers I had -- and I am quite

21   interested to know if they are wrong -- the numbers that

22   I have is that the only survey they've done across the

23   State, or the most recent one, says that the English

24   language instructional costs range between 1570 and

25   $3300 per pupil.    And then if you look at the amount the

 1   State provides outside of the reading, writing and

 2   arithmetic, which they provide, et cetera, for all

 3   students, what they provide is -- currently it's $340,

 4   and if that law had gone into effect, 2064, it would

 5   have been $450.    Now, are those numbers totally wrong?

 6                 MR. STARR:      The numbers are not wrong, Your

 7   Honor, but the numbers are in fact not the pivotal

 8   point.   The EEOA is not a funding statute, and let me

 9   come to the specific point of cost studies.              The State

10   of Arizona did in fact seek to undertake a statewide

11   cost study.    And our -- one of our fundamental problems

12   here is this case is no longer about Nogales.              It has

13   been expanded.    Even though it was a class action

14   limited to Nogales, it has been expanded to include an

15   intrusion into the prerogatives of the State.

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            That was the fault of the

17   Arizona attorney general, who told the court:              You

18   cannot deal with Nogales alone because under the Arizona

19   Constitution the -- all -- all the school districts have

20   to be treated equally.        So, it wasn't the plaintiffs

21   that initiated that move to make it statewide; it was in

22   fact the Arizona attorney general.

23                 MR. STARR:      And we are now seeking relief

24   from that, because what we now know --

25                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           Well, it should -- has the

 1   state law changed?

 2                MR. STARR:        What has changed --

 3                JUSTICE SOUTER:             I mean, the reason -- the

 4   reason for getting into this is that the State required

 5   it.   Has the State law changed?

 6                MR. STARR:        The State law does not require

 7   specific earmarked funding, district by district, and

 8   here's the key --

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:             I assume it's --

10                JUSTICE SOUTER:             No, we are not talking

11   about -- I'm sorry.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:             I also assume the State law

13   does not require that any -- any judicial decree with

14   respect to a particular district be expanded to the

15   whole State.   It seems to me you could comply with the

16   State Constitution.       If and when a judgment is rendered

17   as to the district, it would then be, under the State

18   Constitution, the responsibility of the State executive

19   to make sure that the other -- other districts are

20   equalized.

21                But why the attorney general had to come

22   into the Federal court and say, do it to the whole

23   State, because the whole State has to be equal, I -- I

24   can't understand that, to tell you the truth.

25                MR. STARR:        It's why the district

 1   court should have been on guard --

 2                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            What is the district court

 3   supposed to do?    The attorney general for the State

 4   comes in and says, do it this way.                   It seems to me that

 5   the State has no standing later on to say:                   Oh, gee, the

 6   district court should have said:                 Sorry, Mr. Attorney

 7   General; you don't know anything about your State law;

 8   we won't do it this way.

 9                 MR. STARR:       Your Honor, we are not trying to

10   relitigate the original judgment.                  We quarrel with it,

11   but that's not why we're here.                We're here --

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            The fact is he wanted to be

13   thrown into the briar patch, didn't he?

14                 MR. STARR:       It was --

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            The State attorney general

16   wanted the decree.

17                 MR. STARR:       There is -- there is no question

18   that there was a division of the opinion within the

19   State and that in fact the attorney general was

20   essentially siding with the plaintiffs in their

21   litigation.    There is now a very different perspective

22   and you have that before you, that the governor who

23   controls the litigation in the State is the chief

24   executive of the State in terms of determining what the

25   State's position is --

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Could you tell me what

 2   your submission is with respect to the error you see in

 3   the findings and the order made after the eight-day

 4   hearing?    First, are you saying that after No Child Left

 5   Behind that the duty of the State with respect to

 6   educating the students who have a different language was

 7   less onerous?

 8                 MR. STARR:      No, it's not less onerous, but

 9   there is a different methodology and a different

10   approach.

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           All right.        And are you

12   saying that because of that methodology any remedy based

13   on funding is no longer appropriate?

14                 MR. STARR:      A funding remedy is in fact

15   inappropriate presumptively statewide.                   That is our key

16   submission, because of the variation in costs, district

17   by district.

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           If we could -- is it valid

19   as to Nogales, if we focus just on Nogales?

20                 MR. STARR:      Not in terms of changed

21   circumstances, because of what has in fact happened on

22   the ground.    Namely, one of the thing when we go back to

23   the original order --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You lost me.

25                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Are you saying -- are you

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   saying that the order the district court gave with

 2   respect just to Nogales --

 3               MR. STARR:        Yes.

 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             -- is inappropriate

 5   because it used a funding remedy or a funding measure of

 6   compliance when it should have used blank, and then fill

 7   in the blank?

 8               MR. STARR:        Yes.       It should have simply

 9   determined under Castaneda the three-part test.                    It

10   should not have said the EEOA requires a particular

11   level of funding.    That's precisely what Castaneda --

12               JUSTICE SOUTER:             But that isn't what it -- I

13   don't understand that it has ever said that.                    I thought

14   the funding point was basically this:                    You, Nogales,

15   have come up with plan A.           You have come up with funding

16   B.   Funding B is not enough money to fund plan A.                   It is

17   your plan, you've got to fund your plan.

18               That is not saying that the Federal statute

19   requires a particular level of funding.                    It's not saying

20   that the district court can take over the responsibility

21   of deciding what is appropriate funding in a school

22   district.   It's simply saying, "If you choose plan A,

23   you have got to pay for plan A."

24               MR. STARR:        And --

25               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Am I -- am I wrong?         Did it

 1   ever go beyond that?

 2                MR. STARR:       It did go beyond that in this

 3   sense.    It did not in fact determine whether in fact

 4   there was an effective program in place.                  That's the

 5   oddity about this case --

 6                JUSTICE SOUTER:            In other words, it should

 7   have said:    Before I decide whether your funding for

 8   plan A is good enough, I have got to decide whether plan

 9   A itself is worth anything?             I mean, I have got to

10   evaluate plan A?

11                MR. STARR:       No.       The difficulty is seeking

12   to enforce a specific funding order, and particularly

13   statewide, which intrudes --

14                JUSTICE SOUTER:            All right.       Let's go back

15   to Justice Kennedy's point a moment ago.                  Let's just

16   talk about Nogales for a minute.                With respect to plan

17   A, that was Nogales' plan.           And the district court said:

18   You can't fund that plan with the amount of money that

19   you have appropriated.        Did the district court go beyond

20   that with respect to Nogales?

21                MR. STARR:       The district court failed to

22   note that plan A had changed.              There was no longer a

23   plan A.   It was strategic English immersion which has an

24   entirely different methodology.               And what it also --

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But that came in in 2000

 1   and this case was going on for, what, eight, nine years

 2   before there was ever an argument.                  I mean in all of

 3   these orders that were not appealed, don't those

 4   judgments, unappealed judgments, settle anything?

 5                MR. STARR:       Of -- of course.              They let that

 6   judgment stand during that period of time.                    But the

 7   whole purpose of 60(b)(5) is relief from finality.                      It's

 8   a --

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yes, but didn't -- didn't

10   the court -- you say plan A is no longer in effect; they

11   have a new plan under the No Child Left Behind Act.                     But

12   didn't the -- didn't the district court find that the

13   funding for that plan is inadequate, for the two reasons

14   that were mentioned earlier?

15                MR. STARR:       Well, it said that -- here is

16   what the court held:       That it has developed a

17   significantly improved infrastructure for ELL

18   programming, but it has not complied with the original

19   judgment.   That is our complaint.                The original funding

20   judgment was in fact informed by a different methodology

21   and a different set of circumstances.                    For example,

22   Superintendent Cooper comes in and says:                    I don't want

23   to spend money on teachers' aides; they are standing in

24   the way.    Yet the Respondents say:                We need money for

25   teachers' aides.    That's part of No Child Left Behind.

 1                Inputs -- now we look at -- we test, we

 2   determine what progress is being made and, we are

 3   requiring progress to be made.

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I didn't think there was

 5   in the district judge's declaratory judgment, spend this

 6   much on teachers aides, that much on the other.                It was:

 7   You need a plan and you have to figure out how much it

 8   costs, and then you have to appropriate money that

 9   matches the cost.

10                But the district court -- I may be wrong

11   about this, but I thought that the original declaratory

12   judgment didn't try to tell them what the components of

13   that plan had to be.

14                MR. STARR:       You are precisely right, but the

15   point I'm making is that the objects of that underlying

16   decree shifted by virtue of the new methodology that was

17   in fact adequately funded through a whole variety of

18   funds.   The funds that Justice Breyer has referred to

19   are only part of the basket of funds that have been made

20   available.

21                JUSTICE SOUTER:            No.     But doesn't it --

22   doesn't it -- don't we come back to Justice Scalia's

23   question of a moment ago?           Even with the -- the changed

24   plan to immersion, isn't the finding that two years of

25   funding per child is not enough?                And you are

 1   supplanting, not supplementing.             Isn't that still the

 2   problem?

 3              MR. STARR:       We believe not.            We believe that

 4   ultimately those two issues are irrelevant to the issue

 5   that is before the Court.

 6              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But those are the issues

 7   that the court focused on; are they not?

 8              MR. STARR:       Wrongly, because that's --

 9   that's part of our quarrel, THAT the district court

10   simply focused on these two elements of HB 2064, and

11   blinded itself to the evidence --

12              JUSTICE BREYER:            There is a minor thing that

13   I -- I think -- I'm not sure that Justice Ginsburg said.

14   I thought that the funding order was not fund the plan

15   you come up with; but rather, come up with a funding

16   plan that bears a rational relationship to -- to the

17   plan you come up with.      So is that right?

18              MR. STARR:       That is correct, and that is --

19              JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.       And now the

20   district court is at considerable remove.                He says they

21   have not yet come up with a study and a plan that seems

22   satisfactory, and they haven't shown how the funding is

23   rational in relation to the plan that they haven't fully

24   developed, though they've made progress.                That's where

25   we are -- is that where we are?

 1                 MR. STARR:       Three brief points.           On the

 2   study, the State did undertake a study, and this is in

 3   the record.     And the National Conference of State

 4   Legislators said:     We throw up our hands because we

 5   can't do this statewide.           I would invite the Court to

 6   refocus on Nogales as a district versus statewide.

 7                 What was entered here in this order, which

 8   makes it so extraordinary, is that the entire State

 9   funding mechanism has been interfered with by the order.

10   This case started out in Nogales.                  And so the statewide

11   study was in fact undertaken.               But we could not do it.

12   The National Conference of State Legislatures said:                   We

13   throw up our hands.       We can do a local study, and it was

14   done.   And if the Court refocuses on the various

15   tranches of funding, including in Nogales itself and

16   from the State, one will see that there has been a very

17   substantial increase in the actual funding as well as

18   progress.

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, I -- I agree with

20   that.   I think it was a vast mistake to extend a lawsuit

21   that applied only to Nogales to the whole State, but the

22   State attorney general wanted that done.

23                 MR. STARR:       But we should be able now to --

24                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            But that's -- that's water

25   over the dam.    That's not what this suit is about now.

 1                 MR. STARR:       No, Your Honor, not under 60(b),

 2   and this Court has warned about the ability of State

 3   officials --

 4                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            What has 60(b) got to do

 5   with the question of whether the attorney general

 6   represents the State before the court?                    If the attorney

 7   general comes back into court and says, no longer do we

 8   want this statewide, then you've got an issue.                    If the

 9   -- if the attorney general speaking for the State does

10   not do that, then I don't see why Justice Scalia's point

11   is not the answer.

12                 MR. STARR:       Not under Arizona law.            It is

13   the governor who speaks and the attorney general is

14   beholden --

15                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            So the district court is

16   supposed to referee a fight between the governor and the

17   attorney general at this point?                Is that what's going

18   on?

19                 MR. STARR:       No, Your Honor.            The district

20   court is to listen to what the State has to say through

21   -- once the legislature was fine.                  It was brought in.

22   It should have listened to the --

23                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Doesn't the attorney

24   general speak for the State?

25                 MR. STARR:       No, Your Honor, not in Arizona.

 1   The attorney general speaks for the State when the

 2   governor directs him or her to do that.

 3                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But he was speaking alone

 4   for years and years, and 60(b) -- and it has been said

 5   over and over again -- is not a substitute for appeal.

 6   What wasn't appealed was that Arizona is required by

 7   Federal law to determine the cost and adequately fund a

 8   statewide system of English acquisition programming.

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Which would be good enough

10   to fix Nogales.   So you are quite right.                 There is a

11   vast difference in each district.                But that attorney

12   general wanted enough money to fund the whole State the

13   way you have to fund to -- to fix Nogales.                  That's what

14   he wanted.

15                MR. STARR:      And former officials shouldn't

16   continue to be able to bind the State.                  I would like to

17   reserve the remainder of my time.

20                ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN

21                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

22                MR. SRINIVASAN:           Thank you, Mr. Chief

23   Justice, and may it please the Court:

24                When the district court issued its initial

25   judgment in 2000, what the court found was that there

 1   was a systemic violation of the EEOA.                     And the court

 2   further found that the program deficiencies were the

 3   result of the lack of funding rationally related to the

 4   programs.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Can I ask whether the

 6   requirements of the EEOA are at all affected

 7   by Congress's later enactment of the No Child Left

 8   Behind Act?     I mean, you know, it's a very vague

 9   requirement that you make a good faith effort to -- to

10   provide language assistance to children.

11                 Why shouldn't the courts decide that what

12   constitutes a good faith effort is pretty much what

13   Congress thought was necessary in the -- in the No Child

14   Left Behind Act, and if you comply with that, you are

15   doing okay?

16                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            Justice Scalia, just one

17   point of clarification on -- in our view on what the

18   EEOA requires, and then I will address the No Child Left

19   Behind point.    The EEOA doesn't really require good

20   faith efforts.    It requires efforts that are in fact

21   reasonably calculated to overcome language barriers.

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay.       I would call that

23   good faith, but that's fine.

24                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            With that -- With that

25   clarification, thank you.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:             That's fine.

 2                MR. SRINIVASAN:             With that clarification on

 3   the question of whether No Child Left Behind sets the

 4   standard for compliance with the EEOA, which is, I

 5   think, what the petitioners' position is, we think the

 6   answer is no for two fundamental reasons.                 First is just

 7   a textual point.     The text of No Child Left Behind

 8   doesn't say anywhere that it displaces the standards for

 9   compliance with the EEOA.

10                JUSTICE ALITO:           I don't think that's their

11   argument, counsel.      I don't think that it is their

12   argument that No Child Left Behind supplants the earlier

13   act.    It is simply their -- their argument is that it

14   informs an interpretation of the language of EEOA, which

15   is that the State is required to take appropriate

16   action, which is a very vague standard.

17                MR. SRINIVASAN:             I think their argument at

18   the end of the day, Justice Scalia, is that if you

19   comply with No Child Left Behind -- and I will get to in

20   a moment what compliance with No Child Left Behind can

21   mean -- then you have necessarily complied with the

22   EEOA.    That compliance with the No Child Left Behind

23   sets the standard for compliance with the EEOA.

24                And I don't think that is workable

25   particularly when you take into account what petitioners


                                         30

 1   mean by "compliance with No Child Left Behind."

 2                JUSTICE ALITO:          Can I ask you this question

 3   about the Ninth Circuit's decision, which is what we are

 4   reviewing?   Suppose -- I know there -- there is a debate

 5   about how well Nogales is doing at this time.             But let's

 6   suppose Nogales came in, and they said this:             We had

 7   plan A back when this was originally litigated, and now

 8   we have an entirely different plan, and this plan

 9   doesn't cost one penny more than what we were spending

10   in 2000.   But it is a very good plan, and it has

11   produced very good results.

12                As I read the Ninth Circuit's decision, they

13   would not grant relief from the judgment under those

14   circumstances, because they focus exclusively on

15   incremental funding for EEL programs and Arizona's

16   funding model.   Isn't that correct?

17                MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, I -- I don't know

18   that that is a correct interpretation of the EEOA.                What

19   we would say is that if the State came forward with a

20   showing that completely regardless of funding the

21   programs on the ground work, well, that would be

22   something that the district court would have to take

23   into account.    But the state hasn't --

24                JUSTICE ALITO:          No, but isn't -- that isn't

25   really my question.      Isn't -- isn't it the case that the


                                        31

 1   Ninth Circuit judged the -- the permissibility of relief

 2   under 60(b) solely with regard to incremental funding

 3   and Arizona's funding model?

 4               MR. SRINIVASAN:            The Ninth Circuit focused

 5   on funding, Justice Alito, because that is the way the

 6   case has been litigated from the outset.                     And that's the

 7   way the State has said from the outset that it would

 8   achieve compliance with the --

 9               JUSTICE ALITO:          That's the way it was

10   litigated originally, but I thought the whole focus of

11   the motion for relief from the judgment was:                     We have a

12   new plan, and it is not tied to funding, and it will

13   produce good results without looking at incremental EEL

14   funding.   And wasn't the Ninth Circuit obligated to look

15   at that?

16               MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, I think the Ninth

17   Circuit was -- was required certainly to review the

18   district court's inquiry into that.                     And what the

19   district court found is at page 100-A of the appendix to

20   the petition filed by the legislative intervenors.                        And

21   what the district court found there is that the

22   improvements today, although significant, failed to

23   reach the high school; that they were fleeting.                        And --

24   and this is particularly significant.                     In addition, the

25   district court also explained that it was premature to


                                       32

 1   make an assessment of many of the changes, because many

 2   of the new standards are still evolving.

 3              And the reason the district court said that

 4   is that -- is because of the enactment in 2006 of

 5   Arizona HB 2064, which changes the framework for

 6   administration and funding of ELL programs in a way that

 7   I think fortifies the district court's denial of

 8   complete dissolution of its judgment and -- and ensuing

 9   orders.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    But I guess, as I

11   understand Justice Alito's question, if the prior order

12   is based on funding a particular plan and the State

13   comes back and says, this is a new approach.                   It could

14   be for any number of reasons, and say that, you know,

15   the plan is not working, or there have been other

16   budgetary crises in the State that strain what we can

17   afford to spend on this particular program.                   Here's

18   another plan.   The funding levels are different.                  You

19   should look at it.

20              MR. SRINIVASAN:               Yes, that --

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    What's wrong with

22   that?

23              MR. SRINIVASAN:               There is nothing wrong with

24   that, and it should be looked at.                  And the district

25   court did look at it, and what the district court found


                                         33

 1   was that the claims of progress, although there had been

 2   progress, the progress hadn't reached the high school.

 3   The progress was fleeting and that it was premature --

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It's not a question

 5   of progress; it's a question of the plan and the

 6   approach.     And I understood the Ninth Circuit -- I'm

 7   looking at page 72a -- it talks about the ELL's specific

 8   funding that was based on the prior order.                   And what I

 9   understood the State's submission to be -- look at what

10   the superintendent has done in this particular case, and

11   so on, so that those specific funding levels aren't

12   applicable.    And I would have thought it an

13   extraordinary enough thing for a district court to tell

14   a State legislature:        Pass this budget, and you,

15   Legislature, pass it, and -- I guess -- you, Governor,

16   sign it, or you are not going to be in compliance.                  And

17   if they've come up with a different way with different

18   funding requirements, I don't know why that's not a

19   changed circumstance that justifies looking at the

20   judgment --

21                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, the district court

22   didn't issue that sort of order.                 And -- and the Ninth

23   Circuit -- if you look at page 66a -- it did review the

24   evidence in the record and fortified the district

25   court's conclusion that the new plan, Your Honor,


                                         34

 1   Mr. Chief Justice, that was presented, which is to the

 2   effect that, regardless of funding, we have made

 3   advances based on management improvements that should

 4   satisfy the statute.      That was the claim that was made

 5   by Petitioners.   I think that's what you're alluding to.

 6   And the district court rejected that at page 100a, and

 7   the Ninth Circuit fortified the district court's

 8   rejection of it by looking at the evidence in the record

 9   concerning --

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:             What -- what page is this?

11              MR. SRINIVASAN:             It's at 66a.           That the

12   court of appeals reviews the testimony and fortifies the

13   district court's conclusion that, based on the advances

14   to date, there's still work left to be done.                     Because at

15   the end of the day you have to have a plan in place.

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, I don't think

17   the State -- I didn't understand the State to disagree

18   that there's still work to be done.                     I thought that the

19   plan -- the point was that their approach had changed,

20   including by No Child Left Behind, that they don't have

21   to reach the same specific funding levels that the

22   district court order required.              And what I understood

23   the Ninth Circuit to say is, no, those specific funding

24   levels are still in place.

25              MR. SRINIVASAN:             Well, there's two

 1   fundamentally different assertions being made by

 2   Petitioners, if I understand it:              One is what

 3   Justice Scalia alluded to earlier, which is that No

 4   Child Left Behind changed the legal landscape in a way

 5   such that compliance with No Child Left Behind, such as

 6   it is, sets the standard for compliance with the EEOA.

 7              Now, there's a distinct argument that's also

 8   being made which is that conditions on the ground have

 9   improved as a consequence of management improvements.

10   Regardless of No Child Left Behind, this is a factual

11   argument, that factually things have changed in a way

12   that ought to let us from underneath the district

13   court's supervision.

14              Now, the -- they are different points, and I

15   think the district court addressed both of them.                With

16   respect to the second one, where there is the facts on

17   the ground, what is critical is that, in order to

18   justify complete dissolution in a case like this, the

19   Petitioners would have to show, not only that conditions

20   have improved, but they have improved in a way that is

21   durable and sustainable over time.                And the district

22   court --

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:            What degree --

24              MR. SRINIVASAN:            -- doubted that.

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:            What degree of improvement

 1   do you think is necessary?           Do you agree with the Ninth

 2   -- the Ninth Circuit says, "We cannot say the district

 3   court clearly erred when it found this burden was not

 4   met.   A district in which the majority of ELL tenth

 5   graders failed to meet State achievement standards while

 6   the majority of native English speakers passed is not

 7   one whose performance demonstrates that the State is

 8   adequately funding ELL programs."

 9               Do you really think that you haven't

10   complied with adequate funding of ELL programs until you

11   raise all of the ELL students up to the level of native

12   English speakers?

13               MR. SRINIVASAN:             No, I don't think the EEOA

14   requires raising everyone.           I think it requires --

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, that's all this says.

16   The majority doesn't --

17               MR. SRINIVASAN:             Well --

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:             -- doesn't meet the -- a

19   majority of ELL tenth graders fail to meet the

20   standards, but the majority of native English speakers

21   do.

22               MR. SRINIVASAN:             Well, that's part of what

23   it says, and I think what the Ninth Circuit is also

24   alluding to with respect to the high school in

25   particular that, if you look at State survey that


                                        37
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Petitioners rely on in -- in touting the improvements in

 2   certain schools, it also with respect to the high school

 3   shows that the two high schools in Nogales was ranked --

 4   were ranked at the very bottom of the survey for ELL

 5   students.

 6               So there's problems on the ground, but what

 7   the district court focused on concerns the enactment of

 8   2064, which is that no matter was think about the

 9   improvements that have -- that have been made to date,

10   the landscape fundamentally shifts upon the enactment of

11   2064 because the administration and funding of ELL plans

12   changes at that point.      And it's --

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            That's the new plan that

14   we're talking about, is 20 -- there have been references

15   -- well, now they have a new plan.                Does everybody agree

16   at least that the new plan is 2064?

17               MR. SRINIVASAN:           I -- I think we would agree

18   because that sets the charter for provision of programs

19   to ELL students going forward from its enactment.

20   That's the infrastructure from -- from here on out.

21               And that -- there's three particular

22   features of that that I think are significant and that

23   fortify the district court's conclusion that complete

24   dissolution was unwarranted.

25               The first is the one that was raised by


                                      38

 1   Justice Souter, which is that whatever you think of the

 2   progress that has been made to date -- and the district

 3   court found that, while it was significant, it didn't

 4   suffice -- that changes from what can be brought to bear

 5   from here on out as half the resources that were

 6   available before, because that's the net effect of 2064.

 7   That's what the district court found, at pages 107 to

 8   108a of the Petition Appendix.              And when you have half

 9   resources to work with -- at the very least I think what

10   the district court thought in saying that it was

11   premature to make an assessment is that we have to have

12   some period to assess what happens on the ground as a

13   consequence --

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Is there any --

15              MR. SRINIVASAN:             -- of this new funding

16   recipe.

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Does -- then does

18   that stay true without regard to what is happening

19   economically to the State?          In other words, the district

20   court can say:   You've got to spend this much money on

21   this program, and I don't care what it means for jails,

22   roads, anything else, when there are profound changes in

23   economic circumstances of the sort that everybody's

24   experiencing lately.

25              MR. SRINIVASAN:             No, the -- the district --

 1   the State would have to present that, Your Honor, and I

 2   don't believe the State to have done that so far.              But

 3   the State would have to make the argument that funding

 4   constraints are inexistence in a way that doesn't allow

 5   us to -- to use one example -- to -- to put together an

 6   optimal program, and so here's the program that we want

 7   to put in place in --

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Counsel, I --

 9                 MR. SRINIVASAN:           -- jurisdictions.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I find it bizarre that we

11   are sitting here talking about what the whole State has

12   to do on the basis of one district which is concededly

13   the district that has the most nonnative English

14   speakers and has been a problem district all along.               And

15   we are saying whatever this district court says for --

16   for this school district applies statewide.              Now, that

17   is bizarre.

18                 MR. SRINIVASAN:           Well --

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           And the mere fact that the

20   State Attorney General acquiesced in that kind -- kind

21   of a system at the outset, does that force us to still

22   accept at this time that whatever is -- is necessary for

23   Nogales is also necessary for the entire State?

24                 MR. SRINIVASAN:           Justice Scalia, I think

25   that that issue becomes largely an academic one for the

 1   following reason:    that the reason that the State

 2   Attorney General made the acknowledgment that he did is

 3   that, under the Arizona State Constitution, funding

 4   decisions don't vary from district to district.             So

 5   whatever funding menu is put into place in order to

 6   achieve compliance with the EEOA with respect to Nogales

 7   is going to be the same one that exists throughout the

 8   State.

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I'll let --

10                 MR. SRINIVASAN:           It's --

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I'll let Arizona worry

12   about that.    It's -- it's another matter to have a

13   district court decree that the whole State has to do

14   this thing.    And whether -- whether it's done equally or

15   not would be a matter for the State courts to determine,

16   instead of for this district judge to determine, right?

17                 MR. SRINIVASAN:           Well, it could be, but I

18   don't think there's really much of a dispute that the

19   statewide funding measure doesn't really affect what the

20   State's going to do in this case, because --

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, it seems to me very

22   odd that -- assume you have a constitutional provision

23   which says funding must be equal in each district.               Then

24   you find one district that's way behind, and that is, we

25   will assume, is -- has been deficient in -- in providing

 1   language education.     You are saying that if the court

 2   orders more money spent for that district, it must

 3   automatically order money -- additional money for every

 4   other district in the State?

 5              MR. SRINIVASAN:            No, absolutely not.      Not --

 6   certainly not in the abstract.

 7              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But -- yes, but that seems

 8   to me the necessary conclusion of your argument in the

 9   answer you gave Justice Scalia.

10              MR. SRINIVASAN:            I don't think it's a

11   necessary conclusion of my argument, Justice Kennedy.               I

12   think it's a conclusion that rests on we are in this

13   litigation in this particular context, given the Arizona

14   Constitution's uniformity clause.               It's as a consequence

15   of that clause that this issue even arises.               And I think

16   the Attorney General --

17              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But, again, what you're --

18   you're saying that any time a district court in a single

19   district orders more money to remedy a constitutional

20   problem, that because of that clause it has to apply to

21   every other district.      That just can't be.

22              MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, if the --

23              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And if -- and if it is,

24   then that is a very good reason for the district court

25   to cede its jurisdiction to the State authorities.

 1               MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, if the litigation had

 2   come up in a different way, Justice Kennedy, such that

 3   it had always focused exclusively on what happened in

 4   Nogales, including the funding aspect of the case, but I

 5   think what would have been appropriate is that the

 6   district court would have inquired about what funding

 7   resources belong to Nogales in particular.                     And then

 8   what would have happened by operation of State law would

 9   be that, whatever the funding calculus with respect to

10   Nogales, it would automatically apply across the State

11   because of the Arizona Constitution's uniformity clause.

12               Now, in this case, the litigation -- the

13   complaint was assessed against the entire State, and the

14   Attorney General accepted that, and I don't think at

15   this point in time we can revisit that, particularly

16   when it's largely an academic question given the

17   uniformity clause --

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But I gather it's

19   often the case in institutional litigation of this sort

20   that the political figures, whether it's the Governor or

21   the Attorney General, can't go to the voters say, look,

22   we should spend more money on this.                     So they go to the

23   district court judge and say, make us spend more money

24   on this.   And they get the same result they'd wanted in

25   a non-democratic way, particularly when there's a


                                       43
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   division, such as here the legislature doesn't want to

 2   do something, and the Governor or the Attorney General

 3   does.

 4              So why should we put a lot of weight on what

 5   the representation is when we are at least concerned

 6   that it might be a -- I don't mean it in a pejorative

 7   sense -- but a collusive piece of litigation?

 8              MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, two points,

 9   Mr. Chief Justice, and first -- and I don't mean to

10   quibble, but the Attorney General did contest the

11   litigation at the outset.         What happened is, after a

12   judgment was issued against the State, then I think

13   there was an acquiescence in the --

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, it's hard for

15   the Attorney General to get funding from the legislature

16   for all he wants to do, and this is a way for him to get

17   it, to go to the legislature and say look, you don't

18   have a choice.

19              MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, sure,

20   Mr. Chief Justice, but I think what the Court did in

21   both Rufo and Frew is it accommodated those concerns,

22   and it accommodated the interest in finality that comes

23   from judgments, and the interests in allowing a

24   different set of State officials to suggest new programs

25   to make that suggestion to the district court.                And it


                                      44
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   accommodated those in a way that requires a showing at

 2   the outset that there has been a significant change in

 3   facts or a significant change in law.                  And on --

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Can I ask just a

 5   question that was confusing to me?                What standard for

 6   changed circumstances do you understand the Ninth

 7   Circuit to have applied?

 8              MR. SRINIVASAN:            The one that was outlined

 9   by this Court in Rufo.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Which is?

11              MR. SRINIVASAN:            A significant change of

12   facts or a significant change of law.                  And the --

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I am looking at page

14   72a of the Ninth Circuit opinion, and the standard they

15   use there is radically changed, not significantly

16   changed.

17              MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, on page 49a they

18   invoke the precise wording of this Court, cite Rufo for

19   that proposition, and also --

20              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So, if we have a --

21   if we are confused as to which standard they applied,

22   because at one point they say significantly changed and

23   at another point they say radically changed, what should

24   we do?

25              MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, I -- I would give

 1   effect to the articulation of the standard in the

 2   standard review question section of the opinion.       Of

 3   course you could remand if you felt that it was

 4   necessary, but I think the reason why the Ninth Circuit

 5   uses the language such as Your Honor found in 72a is

 6   that it has to be considered in the context of the

 7   nature of the violation and the nature of the relief

 8   sought.

 9              The violation was a systematic one; the

10   relief sought is a complete dissolution of the judgment

11   and ensuing order, and in that context I think it is

12   fair to say that what is significant is more significant

13   than what would be the case in -- for example, in Rufo,

14   where what was sought was a relatively modest

15   modification of the consent order concerning whether you

16   would have single bunking or double bunking.

17              Now on the question of whether there is in

18   fact a significant change or significant change of facts

19   or significant change in law, on No Child Left Behind,

20   Justice Scalia, to return to the question that you

21   asked, the reason that No Child Left Behind in our view

22   doesn't displace the standard for EEOA is that

23   Petitioner's standard is that as long as the State has

24   an approved No Child Left Behind plan, which is true of

25   all 50 States, that they necessarily satisfy the EEOA;


                                      46
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   and what that would mean is that even if a State didn't

 2   implement that plan, even if the State didn't -- didn't

 3   -- didn't have accountability measures that it in fact

 4   followed, that required school districts to achieve the

 5   annual measurement of progress that would be laid out in

 6   the plan -- notwithstanding all of that, a plaintiff

 7   would lack authority to come into the court and litigate

 8   his private cause of action under the EEOA and get a

 9   court order that requires the State to take appropriate

10   action --

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Right but --

12                MR. SRINIVASAN:           -- simply because the State

13   will have had an approved plan.

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I understand that.           You

15   could get the plan approved and then not fund it.                     But

16   at least the additional funding demanded by the district

17   court should be whatever additional funding is necessary

18   to comply with the No Child Left Behind Act.                     Right?

19                MR. SRINIVASAN:           I -- I don't think so.

20   Because --

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, then -- then it's not

22   as simple as you made it.          Of course, I agree with the

23   fact that if you get approved under the No Child Left

24   Behind Act and then don't fund it, of course that --

25   that won't satisfy your obligation.                     But if you have

 1   gotten approved, the test for whether you are satisfying

 2   your obligation should be how much money would it cost

 3   to implement the program that you have gotten approved

 4   under the No Child Left Behind Act.

 5                MR. SRINIVASAN:            The -- the No Child Left

 6   Behind Act doesn't -- it doesn't approve a particular

 7   program.    What it imposes are voluntarily accepted

 8   funding conditions, and that includes --

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:            It doesn't approve

10   programs?

11                MR. SRINIVASAN:            No --

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I thought the States had to

13   submit a program.

14                MR. SRINIVASAN:            What the EEOA concerns are

15   programs that are reasonably calculated to achieve

16   overcoming language barriers.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Right.           Right.

18                MR. SRINIVASAN:            What No Child Left Behind

19   concerns is, is there a testing program in place that

20   calls for certain improvements in testing over time.                     As

21   long as the plan describes the tests that will be taken

22   and the progress that will be achieved or sought to be

23   achieved over time, a plan will be approved.                      Now, even

24   if the State doesn't achieve the plan -- the progress

25   that is called for by No Child Left Behind --

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            So you are saying you can't

 2   calculate costs.

 3                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            Right.

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            You cannot calculate costs

 5   under the plan approved by the Secretary --

 6                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            I --

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- because all the plan is

 8   is testing.

 9                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            Right.           It's about tests.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Okay.

11                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            And even if you don't make

12   the progress -- and if I could finish this one point,

13   Mr. Chief Justice.      And it bears noting that the Nogales

14   the progress called for No Child Left Behind hasn't been

15   made in the last two years, according to the

16   superintendent's web site.            Even if you don't make that

17   progress, there is no way under Petitioner's approach to

18   vindicate the EEOA cause of action to obtain appropriate

19   action.

20                 Thank you.

 1                 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

 2              MS. SAHARSKY:             Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 3   please the Court:

 4              It's important to recognize what Petitioners

 5   asked for here at the rule 60(b)(5) stage.                     That was

 6   complete dissolution of the court's immediate orders.

 7   It was not to just limit those orders just to Nogales;

 8   it was not to improve -- or to approve improvements in

 9   Nogales as an interim measure.                As a result, the burden

10   was on them to show either full compliance with the

11   orders the district court had entered or material

12   changed circumstances that made compliance unnecessary.

13              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                But couldn't the district

14   court give them the relief to which they were entitled

15   even if it was less than what they sought?

16              MS. SAHARSKY:             Certainly.           But they didn't

17   demonstrate that -- entitlement to that relief either.

18   To the extended we are talking about the question of

19   whether conditions had changed in Nogales that there was

20   no longer an ongoing violation of Federal law, the

21   district court held an 8-day evidentiary hearing, and it

22   made factual findings showing that the problems had not

23   ceased in Nogales.      And as you noted, Justice Ginsburg,

24   this changed circumstances argument that is now heavily

25   relied upon by Petitioners was not the primary thrust of


                                         50
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   their argument before the district court.

 2               The primary thrust of their argument was

 3   that HB 2064, which is the State's scheme for ELL

 4   education, had some serious -- would -- would satisfy

 5   the judgment; and their other argument was that No Child

 6   Left Behind completely preempts -- that was the language

 7   they use -- completely preempts and renders obsolete the

 8   EEOA.

 9               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel, when you

10   were starting out I heard you articulate a third

11   standard, materially changed.             What is your

12   understanding of the standard applied by the Ninth

13   Circuit?   Was it materially changed, significantly

14   changed or radically changed?

15               MS. SAHARSKY:          I understand it to be

16   significant change, which, I don't see significant and

17   material as being all that different.                   I think that

18   the --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I don't either

20   but I see both of them being different from radically

21   changed.

22               MS. SAHARSKY:          Again, I think if you look at

23   the Ninth Circuit's opinion, particularly where it

24   starts out with the standard of review, it cites this

25   Court's precedents in Rufo and Agostini; it talks about


                                       51
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the need for significant changed circumstances.           I

 2   understand that there are portions of the Ninth

 3   Circuit's opinion that say -- that have the radical

 4   change language, and again, I -- I think that that

 5   language is -- just reflects the arguments that

 6   Petitioners were making, that they wanted complete

 7   relief from these remedial orders and that, you know,

 8   the underlying judgment here was a systemic violation.

 9   I mean, it's --

10              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Did the district court on

11   the 8-day hearing on remand make a finding that its

12   incremental funding determinations that it had made

13   earlier were an accurate way to measure compliance and

14   to insist on compliance under the new immersion program?

15              MS. SAHARSKY:          If I understand your question

16   correctly, and please correct me if I don't, but the

17   district court considered two different arguments.            The

18   first was under House Bill 2064 which considered to have

19   -- which continued to have this incremental funding.

20   It's that we have two problems with House Bill 2064,

21   which were the two-year cutoff and Federal funding

22   problem.

23              On the second question which -- the second

24   argument Petitioners made which said, everything is fine

25   in Nogales because we have money from other funds, the


                                      52
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   district court said no, there's -- there's been an

 2   ongoing violation of Federal.            Law you haven't met your

 3   burden of showing me that violation ceased because

 4   things aren't better in Nogales.              Do --

 5              JUSTICE ALITO:          Why does it matter that

 6   there is -- why focus on incremental funding for ELL

 7   programs exclusively?      What difference does it make

 8   where the money comes from -- where it comes from,

 9   putting aside federal money that can't be supplanted?               I

10   just don't understand that.

11              MS. SAHARSKY:          I think the reason the

12   district court was focused on that because that was

13   always the State's position that, in terms of the

14   statewide scheme, that that is how they were going to

15   fund ELL education.     Now it -- and so the State was

16   always, from 2000 up to the time of the district court's

17   rule 60(b) hearing, going down this path whereby it

18   would put in place an ELL program and then give this

19   amount of funding --

20              JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, that may have been

21   their -- that may have been their position originally,

22   but at the time of the 60(b) hearing, what difference

23   does it make whether the money came from funds that were

24   designated for ELL program, or from general State funds,

25   or from county funds?      What difference does it make


                                      53
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   whether the money was taken from some other program that

 2   the school was operating?

 3              Suppose they fund -- they take the money for

 4   the ELL programs from money that was previously used for

 5   music instruction, or art, or gym, or teaching German or

 6   anything else.    Now those may all be bad things, but

 7   what does that have to be with the EEOA?

 8              MS. SAHARSKY:            Well, the district court

 9   could have found that the plan had changed and that

10   funding could come from -- from different places.

11   That's right, if the State had changed its plans or that

12   Nogales otherwise would have sufficient funding from

13   circumstances that -- or from other source, that would

14   be one thing.    But the district court found that Nogales

15   doesn't have that funding from other sources.

16              For example, it can't use the federal

17   funding that it -- that the Petitioners claim could be

18   used to solve its problem under the EEOA.                 There are

19   specific conditions on federal grant programs that

20   forbid that.

21              It also could not raise any significant

22   amounts of funding through county tax overrides, which

23   was another source the Petitioners had said would --

24   would provide sufficient funding.                 So the question the

25   district court had to ask is, there has been an ongoing


                                        54
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   violation of federal law, has that violation of

 2   federal -- federal law ceased because the State has put

 3   in place, Nogales has put in place programs that are

 4   reasonably calculated to help these kids learn English?

 5              And the district court said Nogales has

 6   cobbled together these sources of funding.                     And it is

 7   doing the best they can.

 8              JUSTICE ALITO:            But the fact that you keep

 9   talking about the district court emphasizes my concern

10   about the decision of the Ninth Circuit, which is what

11   we are reviewing.    And as I read the decision of the

12   Ninth Circuit, they focused exclusively on incremental

13   costs associated with ELL programs and the educational

14   funding model that the State had at that time.

15              MS. SAHARSKY:            With respect, I don't think

16   that that was their exclusive focus.                     I understand that

17   it was a primary focus of that decision, and the reason

18   for that was because the primary argument --

19              JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, they say.            They were

20   required -- the Petitioners were required to demonstrate

21   either that there are no longer incremental costs

22   associated with ELL programs in Arizona or that

23   Arizona's funding model was so altered as to make

24   incremental costs issue relevant.                 That was their

25   explanation of the holding, 60 -- 63A of the Speaker's


                                        55
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   appendix.

 2                MS. SAHARSKY:          That's right.         And what I

 3   understand that to mean is that they were required to

 4   either show compliance with the judgment which was that

 5   they would put together a plan that funded ELL education

 6   based on incremental costs or that the State was going

 7   to go down a different path and come up with the funding

 8   some other way, and that would result in a program

 9   reasonably calculated to help ELL students earn English.

10                And the district court found there were

11   neither and the court of appeals found there were

12   neither.    And the court of appeals did go through the

13   alleged changed circumstances, and Nogales had issued a

14   91-page opinion that talked about the significant

15   resource constraints that still exist in Nogales and the

16   persistent achievement gaps that still exist in Nogales.

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I still have trouble

18   with the idea of district courts ordering State

19   legislatures to fund it.          Isn't the preferable approach

20   for the district court to say you have a violation, you

21   have to fix it, and I'm going check to see if you fixed

22   it at particular intervals?             And it's up to you, the

23   State, to determine how you are going to fix it.

24                And the State might change its mind.                 They

25   may start out by saying we have got all of this extra


                                        56
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   money and that's how we will fix it.                    Then there is a

 2   budget crisis, the kind that we are familiar with, and

 3   he says we can't the money, we are going to do it some

 4   other way, and here's the way.

 5                But that's kind of the judgment of the

 6   State, not for the district court.

 7                MS. SAHARSKY:         And I think the district

 8   court was appropriately differential to the State

 9   throughout this litigation.            You will note at the time

10   of the 2000 judgment that the district court didn't put

11   any remedial order in place.            And that's because at the

12   time of trial the State said, look, we are going to put

13   in place an ELL program that everyone in the State can

14   use and figure out how much it costs, what works and

15   what doesn't.   We are going to do a cost study, so

16   please let us do the cost study and we will come back to

17   the court.

18                And the district court said fine.                  And ten

19   months later that didn't happen.

20                Now, there was a change, as Petitioners

21   note, to a different theory of ELL education, structured

22   English immersion and the court said, okay, do your

23   program based on structured English immersion and just

24   tell me how much it costs, tell me how you rationally

25   fund it, and that will be fine.              The district court here


                                       57
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   did not want to be in the business of micromanaging

 2   State education.     Through this entire litigation the

 3   district court was --

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Why does it order

 5   then -- why did its order specify and be linked to the

 6   termination of the legislative session, and say you have

 7   12 days left in the session and that's how many days you

 8   have to enact this budget?

 9                 MS. SAHARSKY:          I think it's because the

10   State kept coming back to the district court and saying

11   that the legislature had asked for this cost study,

12   there was an interim bill, House Bill 2010, where the

13   legislature said we put in place another study that we

14   are going to perform.        And it's because the State

15   said -- constantly said the legislature is going to do

16   this cost study, figure out how much good programs cost,

17   the school -- the State board will be involved,

18   et cetera, that the district court entered its orders

19   looking to the time period in which it expected action

20   to occur.

21                 I mean, this happened over a nine-year

22   period.     The district court, to be clear -- I think this

23   is a very important point -- never said you need to do

24   any special kind of ELL program, bilingual, structured

25   English immersion, you need to have any certain number


                                         58
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   of teachers, nothing like that.             And it never said you

 2   need to put this certain amount of funding in place,

 3   $200, $300 per student, anything like that.

 4              And Petitioners at the rule 60(b)(5) stage

 5   faced a heavy burden to show if what they wanted to show

 6   was that the State was now going to go down this new and

 7   different path, because even at the time of the rule

 8   60(b)(5) hearing, the state Was on the same path.                It

 9   had just passed House Bill 2064, which just like at the

10   time of the 2000 judgment said we are going to put a

11   statewide program in place for ELL education --

12              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But the district -- the

13   district judge said that that 2064 did not have enough,

14   it raised it to 450 or whatever.              And the district court

15   said there are three things wrong with it, the two

16   years, using the federal funds to -- to supplant not

17   supplement, and that the $450 figure wasn't enough.

18              And the only way that $450 figure was going

19   to get changed was through legislation, right?

20              MS. SAHARSKY:          Could I answer that?         I think

21   the problem with the $450 figure is that the district

22   court was never told what the State was planning to buy

23   with that, what that $450 was for.                The State -- the

24   district court just said to the State, please tell me

25   what your programs are going to do and approximately how


                                      59

 1   much it costs to fund them.             And that 450 wasn't tied to

 2   any particular ELL programs.             That was the problem.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Ms. Saharsky, I have one

 4   late arriving question.         Do you think that the

 5   constitutional -- State constitutional provision at

 6   least there has to be equivalent funding in districts,

 7   do you think that would be called into play if the

 8   Federal Government under a federal program gave

 9   additional funds to a particular district?               Which I am

10   sure it does, those districts that have federal

11   facilities probably get additional -- additional money,

12   would all the rest -- under this constitutional

13   provision, would all the rest of the State have to belly

14   up to that -- to that same level?

15                MS. SAHARSKY:          No, as I understand it --

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I doubt it.

17                MS. SAHARSKY:          -- when it's talking about a

18   uniform --

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yeah.

20                MS. SAHARSKY:          -- and equal amount, it's

21   talking about the amount that the State gives to the

22   school districts.    It's not with respect to any federal

23   funding from other sources.

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, if federal funding

25   doesn't count, why would a federal decree applicable

 1   only to a particular school district count?

 2                 MS. SAHARSKY:         I think that the idea was

 3   that there needed to be -- the State determined that

 4   there needed to be -- it was going to solve the problem

 5   statewide not only because of the concern under the

 6   State constitutions, that it would provide for all ELL

 7   students.    And it was not that it would provide the same

 8   amount to each school district, but just the same amount

 9   per ELL student.    That the State had decided that it was

10   going to fill that responsibility because -- both

11   because of the Constitution and because it's responsible

12   for supervising education statewide.                     Thank you.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

14                Mr. Starr, you have three minutes.

15               REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

16                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

17                MR. STARR:       Thank you.

18                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It seems to me, Mr. Starr,

19   based on this last argument, that it actually is in your

20   favor if the order of the court as to one district

21   automatically requires additional expenditure for every

22   other district, that is simply one more measure that the

23   Court should use in finding an alternate remedy.

24                MR. STARR:       Yes, Your Honor.               The state

25   funding remedy here is extraordinarily intrusive and

 1   overreaching.    It is something that has not been done

 2   under the EEOA ever, and certainly the No Child Left

 3   Behind provision should inform now this particular

 4   remedy.   The remedy was originally, of course, designed

 5   to address the situation in Nogales, but it was

 6   expanded --

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It is no content to the

 8   equal child -- No Child Left Behind.                     There is no

 9   content to it.    All it requires is testing.

10                 MR. STARR:      It's part --

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           You can't say how much it's

12   going to cost.

13                 MR. STARR:      But, Your Honor, there is a very

14   elaborate plan that is submitted and then a

15   determination is made by the Federal Government about

16   funds under Title 1 and Title 3, but here is our

17   fundamental submission.         The Ninth Circuit simply

18   applied the wrong 60(b)standard.

19                 It, in fact, used this remarkable language,

20   but it also of radical change, but it also gave undue

21   weight.   It said it ten times to the fact that the

22   original judgment was on appeal, and then it simply did

23   not pay heed to the incredibly intrusive nature of a

24   statewide funding remedy in light of the fact that we

25   can now look at what has happened in Nogales.                    We see

 1   the changes that have, in fact, been there, and

 2   certainly the EEOA by its design in section 1712 of EEOA

 3   makes it very clear that the remedial reach of the EEOA

 4   is quite limited.    It's limited to particular

 5   circumstances.

 6                Here the EEOA has been transmogrified to

 7   apply statewide.    That has not been done before.                 It

 8   should not have been done in the first instance but

 9   certainly in light of the changed circumstances.

10                And the changed circumstances,

11   Justice Ginsburg, go back to structured English

12   immersion.   They did not begin with the passage of HB

13   2064.   Structured English immersion came in in the year

14   2000.   That is why the legislature then came in and put

15   these facts in evidence before the district court, which

16   made no factual findings statewide at all, ever.                   There

17   are no statewide factual findings in this record

18   whatsoever, none.    And therefore statewide funding

19   remedy should not have been permitted.                   Sixty (b)(5)

20   relief should be granted.           I thank the Court.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

22   The case is submitted.
