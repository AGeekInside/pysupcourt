 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   We'll hear

 4   reargument this morning in Case 08-205, Citizens United

 5   v. The Federal Election Commission.

 6              Mr. Olson.

 7             ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 8                 ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

 9              MR. OLSON:          Mr. Chief Justice and may it

10   please the Court:

11         Robust debate about candidates for elective

12   office is the most fundamental value protected by the

13   First Amendment's guarantee of free speech.                 Yet that is

14   precisely the dialogue that the government has

15   prohibited if practiced by unions or corporations, any

16   union or any corporation.

17              The government claims it may do so based

18   upon the Austin decision that corporate speech is by its

19   nature corrosive and distorting because it might not

20   reflected actual public support for the views expressed

21   by the corporation.      The government admits that that

22   radical concept of requiring public support for the

23   speech before you can speak would even authorize it to

24   criminalize books and signs.

25              This Court needs no reminding that the


                                         3

 1   government when it is acting to prohibit, particularly

 2   when it is acting to criminalize, speech that is at the

 3   very core of the First Amendment has a heavy burden to

 4   prove that there is a compelling governmental interest

 5   that -- that justifies that prohibition and that the

 6   regulation adopted, in this case a criminal statute, is

 7   the most narrowly tailored necessary to accomplish that

 8   compelling governmental interest.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Olson, are you taking

10   the position that there is no difference in the First

11   Amendment rights of an individual?                A corporation, after

12   all, is not endowed by its creator with inalienable

13   rights.   So is there any distinction that Congress could

14   draw between corporations and natural human beings for

15   purposes of campaign finance?

16               MR. OLSON:       What the Court has said in the

17   First Amendment context, New York Times v. Sullivan,

18   Rose Jean v. Associated Press, and over and over again,

19   is that corporations are persons entitled to protection

20   under the First Amendment.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Would that include --

22               MR. OLSON:       Now, Justice --

23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Would that include

24   today's mega-corporations, where many of the investors

25   may be foreign individuals or entities?

 1                MR. OLSON:        The Court in the past has made

 2   no distinction based upon the nature of the entity that

 3   might own a share of a corporation.

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Own many shares?

 5                MR. OLSON:        Pardon?

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Nowadays there are

 7   foreign interests, even foreign governments, that own

 8   not one share but a goodly number of shares.

 9                MR. OLSON:        I submit that the Court's

10   decisions in connection with the First Amendment and

11   corporations have in the past made no such distinction.

12   However --

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Could they in your view,

14   in the view that you are putting forth, that there is no

15   distinction between an individual and a corporation for

16   First Amendment purposes, then any mega-corporation,

17   even -- even if most of the investors are from abroad,

18   Congress could not limit their spending?

19                MR. OLSON:        I'm not -- I'm not saying that,

20   Justice Ginsburg.     I'm saying that the First Amendment

21   applies.   Then the next step is to determine whether

22   Congress and the government has established a compelling

23   governmental interest and a narrowly tailored remedy to

24   that interest.   If the Congress -- and there is no

25   record of that in this case of which I am aware.

 1   Certainly the government has not advanced it in its

 2   briefs:     That there is some compelling governmental

 3   interest because of foreign investment in corporations.

 4                 If there was, then the Court would look at,

 5   determine how serious is that interest, how destructive

 6   has it been to the process and whether the -- maybe the

 7   limitation would have something to do with the ownership

 8   of shares of a corporation or some --

 9                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Do you think Congress could

10   prevent foreign individuals from funding speech in

11   United States elections?

12                 MR. OLSON:       The -- the --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Private individuals,

14   foreigners who -- who want to --

15                 MR. OLSON:       That's, of course, a different

16   question.    I haven't studied it, Justice Scalia.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, it's not different.

18   I asked it because I thought it was related to the

19   question you were answering.

20                 MR. OLSON:       The fundamental point here is --

21   and let me start with this, and I think we should -- we

22   should start with this, and the government hardly

23   mentions this.

24                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Before you do, Mr. Olson

25   --

 1                 MR. OLSON:       The language of the First

 2   Amendment, "Congress shall make" --

 3                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Olson -- Mr. Olson,

 4   would you answer Justice Ginsburg's question yes or no?

 5   Can the -- leaving aside foreign investors, can the --

 6   can -- does the First Amendment permit any distinction

 7   between corporate speakers and individual speakers?

 8                 MR. OLSON:       I am not -- I'm not aware of a

 9   case that just --

10                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            I am not asking you that.

11   I meant in your view does it permit that distinction?

12                 MR. OLSON:       My view is based upon the

13   decisions of this Court and my view would be that unless

14   there is a compelling governmental interest and a

15   narrowly --

16                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            But if there is a

17   compelling government -- can there be any case in which

18   there is a different treatment of corporations and

19   individuals in your judgment?

20                 MR. OLSON:       I would not rule that out,

21   Justice Stevens.    I mean, there may be.                I can't imagine

22   all of the infinite varieties of potential problems that

23   might exist, but -- but we would eventually come back to

24   the narrow tailoring problem anyway.

25                 What the government has done here is

 1   prohibit speech.     I don't know how many unions there are

 2   in this country, but there are something like 6 million

 3   corporations that filed tax returns in 2006.

 4              JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, Mr. Olson, do you

 5   think that media corporations that are owned or

 6   principally owned by foreign shareholders have less

 7   First Amendment rights than other media corporations in

 8   the United States?

 9              MR. OLSON:         I don't think so, Justice Alito,

10   and certainly there is no record to suggest that there

11   is any kind of problem based upon that.                 And I come back

12   to the language of the First Amendment:                 "Congress shall

13   make no law."   Now, what this Court has repeatedly said

14   is that there may be laws inhibiting speech if there is

15   a compelling governmental interest and a narrowly

16   tailored remedy.   But there is no justification for

17   this.

18              I was going to say that 97 percent of the 6

19   million corporations that filed tax returns in 2006 had

20   assets less than $5 million -- assets, not net worth.

21   So we are talking about a prohibition that covers every

22   corporation in the United States, including nonprofit

23   corporations, limited liability corporations, Subchapter

24   S corporations and every union in the United States.

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But what are the -- you

 1   have used the word "prohibition," Mr. Olson.                     One answer

 2   to that is that no entity is being prohibited, that it

 3   is a question of not whether corporations can contribute

 4   but how.   They can use PACs and that way we assure that

 5   the people who contribute are really supportive of the

 6   issue, of the candidate.

 7               But so the -- the corporation can give, but

 8   it has to use a PAC.

 9               MR. OLSON:         I respectfully disagree.              The

10   corporation may not expend money.                  It might find people,

11   stockholders or officers, who wanted to contribute to a

12   separate fund, who could then speak.                     That in one -- to

13   use the words of one Justice, that is

14   ventriloquist-speak.       I would say that it is more like

15   surrogate speech.     If you can find some other people

16   that will say what you want to say and get them to

17   contribute money through a process that this just --

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Who is the "you"?         I mean

19   do you -- you -- those are the directors, the CEO, not

20   the shareholders?     We don't know what they think.

21               MR. OLSON:         Well, this statute is not

22   limited to cases where the shareholders agree or don't

23   agree with what the corporation says.                    As the Court said

24   in the Bellotti case, the prohibition would exist

25   whether or not the shareholders agree.                    But let me go

 1   back to your question.

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:           It -- it covers totally --

 3   totally owned corporations, too, doesn't it?

 4              MR. OLSON:       Yes.

 5              JUSTICE SCALIA:           I mean, if I owned all the

 6   stock in a corporation, the corporation still can't --

 7              MR. OLSON:       Yes.       And it includes membership

 8   corporations such as Citizens United that --

 9              JUSTICE BREYER:           And the individual

10   contribution also covers people who would like to give

11   $2500 instead of $2400, which is the limit.              And maybe

12   there are 100 million or 200 million people in the

13   United States who, if they gave 2500 rather than 2400,

14   nobody could say that that was really an effort to buy

15   the Senator or the Congressman.             So is that

16   unconstitutional, too?

17              MR. OLSON:       No -- well, what this Court has

18   said is that in connection with contribution limitations

19   there is a potential compelling governmental interest.

20              JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes.

21              MR. OLSON:       This is what Buckley says.

22              JUSTICE BREYER:           Yes.

23              MR. OLSON:       Then that -- in that -- but

24   expenditures, which is what we are talking about today,

25   do not concern the -- the question, the actual threat of


                                     10
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   quid pro quo corruption or the appearance of quid pro

 2   quo corruption.    And you know, Justice Breyer, what the

 3   Court said in that case is because it's not inhibiting

 4   someone from actually speaking, it's -- it's giving

 5   money to someone --

 6                JUSTICE BREYER:           So here the obvious

 7   argument is:    Look, they said the compelling interest is

 8   that people think that representatives are being bought,

 9   okay?    That's to put it in a caricature, but you

10   understand what I'm driving at, okay?                   That's what they

11   said in Buckley v. Valeo.          So Congress now says

12   precisely that interest leads us to want to limit the

13   expenditures that corporations can make on

14   electioneering communication in the last 30 days of a

15   primary, over-the-air television, but not on radio, not

16   on books, not on pamphlets, not on anything else.                   All

17   right?

18                So in what respect is there not conceptually

19   at least a compelling interest and narrow tailoring?

20                MR. OLSON:       Well, in the first place, I

21   accept what the Court said in Buckley, that expenditures

22   do not raise that concern at all.                 Congress has not made

23   that finding.   You are talking -- and you mentioned just

24   -- just a matter of radio and television, but in Buckley

25   v. Valeo the Court specifically said that that is the


                                       11

 1   most important means of communicating concerning

 2   elections --

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:             It's important --

 4               MR. OLSON:         And the Court used the word

 5   "indispensable."    So what -- and -- and what the Court

 6   said in Buckley v. Valeo is it compared a limitation on

 7   expenditures, independent uncoordinated expenditures,

 8   with the prohibition that the Court addressed when it

 9   had a statute before it that said newspapers couldn't

10   endorse candidates on the day of election, and the

11   Torneo case, where it required a right of reply to be

12   given.   And the Court said those restrictions, which

13   were unconstitutional, were considerably less, and that

14   the restriction in Buckley v. Valeo on expenditures --

15               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              I -- I agree -- I agree

16   that Buckley made the distinction between contributions

17   and expenditures, and it seems to me that the

18   government's argument necessarily wants to water down

19   that distinction.     But in response or just in

20   furtherance of Justice Breyer's point, you have two

21   cases, one in which an officeholder goes to a

22   corporation and says:        Will you please give me money?

23   They say:   We can't do that.

24               The other is in which a corporation takes

25   out an ad for the -- for the candidate, which relieves

 1   that candidate of the responsibility of -- of

 2   substantial television coverage.                Isn't that about the

 3   same?

 4              MR. OLSON:         Well, in the first place, if

 5   there is any coordination --

 6              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              And I -- and I think

 7   Buckley says no.

 8              MR. OLSON:         Buckley says --

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:              But, as a practical

10   matter, is that always true?

11              MR. OLSON:         Well, it may not always be true.

12   In the infinite potential applications of something like

13   that, Justice Kennedy, anything might possibly be true.

14   And Justice Breyer said, well, what if Congress thought

15   or what if Congress thought the people might think that

16   that was kind of somehow suspect?                 That is not a basis

17   for prohibiting speech by a whole class of individual --

18              JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, of course, it did --

19   was a basis for prohibiting speech by, in the sense of

20   giving contributions above $2,400, by 300 million people

21   in the United States.       But the point, which I think is

22   the one that Justice Kennedy was picking up, is are we

23   arguing here between you and my questions, is the

24   argument in this case about the existence of a

25   compelling interest?      Because Congress seemed to think


                                       13

 1   that there was certainly that; it's this concern about

 2   the perception that people are, say, buying candidates.

 3              Are we arguing about narrow tailoring?

 4   Congress thought it was narrow tailoring.              Or are we

 5   arguing about whether we should second-guess Congress on

 6   whether there is enough of a compelling interest and the

 7   tailoring is narrow enough?

 8              MR. OLSON:        You must always second-guess

 9   Congress when the First Amendment is in play.              And that

10   we are arguing -- we are not -- we are discussing --

11              JUSTICE BREYER:            Yes.

12              MR. OLSON:        -- both the compelling --

13              (Laughter.)

14              MR. OLSON:        -- both the compelling

15   governmental interest and the narrow tailoring, and

16   what -- what -- there is not a sufficient record.             The

17   reason --the government has shifted position here.             They

18   were, first of all, talking about the so-called

19   distortion rationale in Austin, the distortion rationale

20   which they seem to have abandoned in the -- in the

21   supplemental briefs filed in connection with this

22   argument, and they resorted to the corruption,

23   appearance of corruption.         There isn't a sufficient

24   record of this.   There isn't --

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But what about the

 1   district court's finding?         Wasn't there a finding before

 2   the three-judge court that Federal officials know of and

 3   feel indebted to corporations or unions who finance ads

 4   urging their election or the defeat of their opponent?

 5   There was a finding of fact to that effect, was there

 6   not?

 7              MR. OLSON:        The find -- yes.           I -- there is

 8   something to that effect in the district court opinion,

 9   but it doesn't cover all corporations.                 It didn't focus

10   in specifically on expenditures.

11              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So if -- so if they just

12   covered large corporations, so you take out the mom and

13   pop single shareholder --

14              MR. OLSON:        Well, that is 97 percent of the

15   corporation.

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Not 97 percent of the

17   contributions.   I mean, the contributions that count are

18   the ones from the corporations that can amass these huge

19   sums in their treasuries.

20              MR. OLSON:        I think that goes back to

21   Justice Kennedy's question, and my response, which

22   distinguishes between contributions and expenditures.

23   The point that Justice Kennedy was making in his

24   question is that under -- under some circumstances an

25   expenditure might coincide or resonate with what the


                                      15
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   candidate wishes to do, but the Court looked at that

 2   very carefully in Buckley v. Valeo and said that might

 3   not be the case.   It might, in fact, be these

 4   expenditures might be counterproductive when they are

 5   independent, they are not coordinated with the

 6   candidate, they are more directly expression by the

 7   party spending the money, they are not like a

 8   contribution, so they are more of an infringement on the

 9   right to speak.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel --

11               MR. OLSON:        And they are less of a threat of

12   corruption because there is less -- there is no quid pro

13   quo there, and if there is it would be punishable as a

14   crime.

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel, in your

16   discussion of Austin, you rely on its inconsistency with

17   Bellotti.   Bellotti, of course, involved a referendum

18   and Austin expenditures in an individual election.                    Why

19   isn't that a significant distinction?

20               MR. OLSON:        Well, it is -- it is -- what the

21   Bellotti Court said is that we are not deciding that

22   question.

23               And -- and Austin did address, you are

24   correct, expenditures, but it based it on a rationale --

25               JUSTICE STEVENS:             It more than said we are


                                       16

 1   not deciding.     It said they are entirely different

 2   situations.     You read that long footnote which has been

 3   cited six or eight times by our later cases.

 4                 MR. OLSON:       Yes.       And I also read the

 5   footnote 14 in the Bellotti case that cited case after

 6   case after case that said corporations had rights,

 7   protected rights under the First Amendment.                 I am not

 8   disagreeing with what you just said, Justice Stevens.

 9   The Court said it was -- it was dicta, because the Court

10   did not deal with --

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            But it has been

12   repeated -- that footnote has been repeatedly cited in

13   subsequent cases, most of which were unanimous.

14                 MR. OLSON:       Well, because it was -- and I

15   agree the Bellotti Court was not discussing that.                But

16   The Bellotti Court --

17                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            It did discuss it

18   precisely in that footnote and it said it's a different

19   case.

20                 MR. OLSON:       I understand and I don't

21   disagree with what you have just said, Justice Stevens.

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It didn't say it would come

23   out differently.    It just said, we're not deciding that

24   case, right?

25                 MR. OLSON:       That -- that is -- that's the


                                        17
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   point I'm trying to make.

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't mind citing that.

 3   Bellotti didn't decide that.

 4              MR. OLSON:       What Bellotti also said is --

 5   and I think this is also in many decisions of this Court

 6   -- the inherent worth of speech in terms of its capacity

 7   for informing the public does not depend upon the

 8   identity of the source, whether corporation,

 9   association, union, or individual.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Now that we've

11   cleared up that Bellotti didn't decide the question,

12   what is the distinction that -- why don't you think that

13   distinction makes sense?       In other words, a corporate --

14   you don't have a potential for corruption if a

15   corporation is simply speaking on a referendum that may

16   directly affect its interest.           If you are dealing with a

17   candidate, what the Court has said in the past is that

18   you do have that problem of corruption.

19              MR. OLSON:       Well --

20              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                In other words, why

21   isn't that distinction a way to reconcile Bellotti and

22   Austin?

23              MR. OLSON:       There is a distinction, but I

24   think the distinction goes back to, A, expenditures

25   versus contributions, number one; and then secondly, it


                                     18
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   goes back to what this Court said in conjunction with

 2   the impossibility of finding a distinction between issue

 3   ads and candidate ads.         The line dissolves on practical

 4   application.     The interest --

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Where did we say

 6   that?

 7                 MR. OLSON:       You said that repeatedly,

 8   including most recently in the Wisconsin Right to Life

 9   case.    And it first appeared in Buckley itself.                The

10   distinction is very hard to draw between the interest

11   that the speaker is addressing and whether it's a

12   candidate or an issue, because issues are wrapped up in

13   candidates.    The corporation interest and the interests

14   that its fiduciary officers are representing when it

15   speaks on behalf of the corporation --

16                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            I don't think you are

17   correct to say the Court said there was no distinction.

18   It said the distinction requires the use of magic words.

19   And that's what they said in Wisconsin Right to Life,

20   too.    Both of them said there is a distinction.

21                 MR. OLSON:       Well, but the words --

22                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            It's difficult to draw in

23   some cases, but nobody said there is no distinction that

24   I am aware of.

25                 MR. OLSON:       Well, what the Court -- to


                                        19
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   use -- to use the words of the Court, which occurred

 2   repeatedly, is that the distinction dissolves

 3   impractical application.       That, Justice Stevens, I think

 4   addresses the very commonsense point that when you are

 5   addressing an issue, whether you are addressing a

 6   referendum matter, whether it is a proposed legislation

 7   or a candidate that is going to raise taxes on the

 8   corporation, those distinctions dissolve.             It's all

 9   First Amendment freedom.

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:           I -- I -- I thought that

11   Buckley had narrowed the statute precisely to magic

12   words and still found it unconstitutional as applied to

13   corporations that made independent expenditures.

14              MR. OLSON:       Yes.

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:           Isn't that what happened in

16   Buckley?

17              MR. OLSON:       The $1,000 limit in Buckley was,

18   first of all, limited to the magic words "candidacy

19   expression"; then secondly, the Court -- and the -- and

20   the words of the statute were "any person," which

21   included corporations found, the statute as narrowed

22   unconstitutional and said --

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:           And some of the plaintiffs

24   were corporations.

25              MR. OLSON:       Some of the plaintiffs were


                                     20
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   corporations.

 2               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Yes, but that point wasn't

 3   even discussed in the opinion, was it?

 4               MR. OLSON:       It was not discussed in the

 5   opinion.

 6               JUSTICE STEVENS:            No.

 7               MR. OLSON:       But what was discussed in the

 8   opinion was the breadth of the definition of "person,"

 9   which did include corporation.             Corporations were

10   parties in the case.     And in that part of the Buckley

11   case, the Court repeatedly cites cases involving

12   corporations, including NAACP v. Alabama and New York

13   Times v. Sullivan, all cases involving corporations.

14               So while it wasn't specifically discussed,

15   it was a part of the decision of the Court that a $1,000

16   limitation was worse, more restrictive than the -- than

17   the restriction of editorials appearing on election day

18   or requiring a newspaper to give a right of reply.

19               The Court in Buckley in fact says, this

20   is -- with respect to that expenditure limitation, the

21   words of the Court were this is the most drastic of the

22   limitations imposed by the Federal Election Campaign

23   Act.   It goes to the core of First Amendment freedom.

24               JUSTICE BREYER:           If that is so -- this is a

25   point that is concerning me.            I don't know the answer


                                      21

 1   precisely.     But suppose you are right.                Suppose we

 2   overrule these two cases.           Would that leave the country

 3   in a situation where corporations and trade unions can

 4   spend as much as they want in the last 30 days on

 5   television ads, et cetera, of this kind, but political

 6   parties couldn't, because political parties can only

 7   spend hard money on this kind of expenditure?                   And

 8   therefore, the group that is charged with the

 9   responsibility of building a platform that will appeal

10   to a majority of Americans is limited, but the groups

11   that have particular interests, like corporations or

12   trade unions, can spend as much as they want?

13                Am I right about the consequence?                 If I am

14   right, what do we do about it?

15                MR. OLSON:        I think you are wrong about the

16   consequence.    There are 27 States that have no

17   limitations on either contributions or expenditures and

18   that -- the Earth is not --

19                JUSTICE BREYER:            No, I'm not -- I'm not -- I

20   am saying am I right in thinking that if you win, the

21   political party can't spend this money, it's limited to

22   hard money contributions, but corporations and trade

23   unions can spend unlimited funds?

24                MR. OLSON:        Well, if -- if the Court decides

25   in favor of the arguments that we are making here, I


                                        22
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   think what you are suggesting is that because there are

 2   other limitations that someone has not challenged in

 3   this case, that that would be somehow unfair and

 4   unbalanced.

 5                 JUSTICE BREYER:          No, I'm not suggesting

 6   that.   I am suggesting we will make a hash of this

 7   statute, and if we are going to make a hash of this

 8   statute, what do we do about it?                And that's why I want

 9   you to take a position on another important part of that

10   statute, and that is the part that says political

11   parties themselves cannot make these expenditures that

12   we are talking about except out of hard money.

13                 MR. OLSON:      What -- I want to address that

14   in this way, and I said when we were here before the

15   most fundamental right that we can exercise in a

16   democracy under the First Amendment is dialogue and

17   communication about political candidates.               We have

18   wrapped up that freedom, smothered that freedom, with

19   the most complicated set of regulations and bureaucratic

20   controls.   Last year the Federal Election Commission

21   that was supposed to be able to give advisory opinions

22   didn't even have a quorum for 6 months of the year 2008

23   when people would have needed some help from the Federal

24   Election Commission.

25                 What I am saying, in answer to your


                                       23

 1   question, Justice Breyer, there are, I suspect, all

 2   kinds of problems with Federal election laws where they

 3   apply to parties and where they apply to what candidates

 4   might do and so forth; but that has never been a

 5   justification.    We will uphold a prohibition on all

 6   kinds of people speaking because if we allowed them to

 7   speak someone else might complain that they don't get to

 8   speak as much as they would like.

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, with reference to

10   any incongruities that might flow from our adopting your

11   position, are you aware of any case in this Court which

12   says that we must refrain from addressing an

13   unconstitutional aspect of the statute because the

14   statute is flawed in some other respects as well?

15                 MR. OLSON:      No, I'm not, and that's -- I

16   think that was what I was attempting to say in response

17   to what Justice Breyer was asking me.

18                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Mr. Olson, are you

19   giving up on your earlier arguments that there are ways

20   to avoid the constitutional question to resolve this

21   case?   I know that we asked for further briefing on this

22   particular issue of overturning two of our Court's

23   precedents.    But are you giving up on your earlier

24   arguments that there are statutory interpretations that

25   would avoid the constitutional question?

 1              MR. OLSON:         No, Justice Sotomayor.        What --

 2   what -- there are all kinds of lines that the Court

 3   could draw which would provide a victory to my client.

 4   There are so many reasons why the Federal Government did

 5   not have the right to criminalize this 90-minute

 6   documentary that had to do with elections, but what the

 7   Court addressed specifically in the Washington Right to

 8   Life case is that the lines if they are to be drawn must

 9   not be lines that are ambiguous, that invite litigation,

10   that hold the threat of prosecution over an individual;

11   and in practical application that is what the --

12              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:               Mr. Olson, my difficulty

13   is that you make very impassioned arguments about why

14   this is a bad system that the courts have developed in

15   its jurisprudence, but we don't have any record

16   developed below.   You make a lot of arguments about how

17   far and the nature of corporations, single corporations,

18   single stockholder corporations, et cetera.              But there

19   is no record that I am reviewing that actually goes into

20   the very question that you're arguing exists, which is a

21   patchwork of regulatory and jurisprudential guidelines

22   that are so unclear.

23              MR. OLSON:         I would like to answer that.

24   There are several answers to it and I would like to

25   reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.              It is the

 1   government has the burden to prove the record that

 2   justifies telling someone that wants to make a 90-minute

 3   documentary about a candidate for president that they

 4   will go to jail if they broadcast it.                     The government

 5   has the obligation and the government had a long

 6   legislative record and plenty of opportunity to produce

 7   that record and it's their obligation to do so.

 8                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Mr. Olson --

 9                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            But the facial

10   challenge --

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           -- may I ask one question

12   you can answer on rebuttal?            No one has commented on the

13   National Rifle Association's amicus brief.                     None of the

14   -- none of the litigants have.              That's in response to

15   Justice Sotomayor's thought that there are narrow ways

16   of resolving the problem before us.                     On rebuttal, will

17   you tell us what your view on their solution to this

18   problem is?

19                 MR. OLSON:      I will, Justice Stevens.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Why don't you tell

21   us now.   We will give you time for rebuttal.

22                 (Laughter.)

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Don't keep us in suspense.

24                 (Laughter.)

25                 MR. OLSON:      Every line, including the lines

 1   that would be drawn in several of the amicus briefs, and

 2   they are not the same, could put the entity who wishes

 3   to speak before you again a year from now.               Because the

 4   movie might be shorter, it might be video on demand, it

 5   might be a broadcast, it might have a different tone

 6   with respect to a candidate.           Every one of those lines

 7   puts the speaker at peril that he will go to jail or be

 8   prosecuted or there will be litigation, all of which

 9   chills speech and inhibits individual --

10              JUSTICE STEVENS:            No, but to answer my

11   question, the line suggested by the NRA is the line

12   identified by Congress in the Snowe-Jeffords amendment

13   dealing with individual financing of speech which would

14   separate all of these problems.             What is your comment on

15   that possible solution to the problem?

16              MR. OLSON:       I would like to take advantage

17   of Justice Stevens' offer and respond to that during the

18   rebuttal, Mr. Chief Justice.

 1                   IN SUPPORT OF THE APPELLANT

 2                MR. ABRAMS:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 3   please the Court:

 4                The first case cited to you by Mr. Olson

 5   happened to be New York Times v. Sullivan, and I would

 6   like to begin by urging two propositions on you from

 7   that case.

 8                In that case the Court was confronted with a

 9   situation where the Times made three arguments to the

10   Court.   They said -- for us to win, they said, you

11   either have to revise, basically federalize, libel law

12   to a considerable degree, which they did; or, they said,

13   we only sold 390 copies in Alabama, so you could rule in

14   our favor by saying there was no jurisdiction; or, they

15   said, we didn't even mention Sheriff Sullivan's name, so

16   you could rule in our favor on the ground that they

17   haven't proved a libel case.

18                The Court did the first.                    It did the first,

19   which is the broader rather than the narrowest way to

20   address the question, and I suspect they did it -- don't

21   know, but I suspect they did it -- because they had come

22   to the conclusion that the degree of First Amendment

23   danger by the sort of lawsuits which were occurring in

24   Alabama and elsewhere was something that had to be faced

25   up to by the Court now, or --

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Abrams, Times v.

 2   Sullivan was not -- did not involve overruling

 3   precedents of this Court that had been followed by this

 4   Court and others.     So, I think the situation is quite

 5   different.

 6                MR. ABRAMS:        That's true, Your Honor.              It

 7   did involve overruling 150 years of American

 8   jurisprudence.   I mean, there was no law at that point

 9   that said that actual malice --

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             There was no -- there was

11   no decision of this Court, I mean --

12                MR. ABRAMS:        That's true, Your Honor.

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             We do tend to adhere to

14   our precedents --

15                MR. ABRAMS:        Yes.

16                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- especially a case like

17   Austin which was repeating the business about amassing

18   large funds in corporate treasuries.                     It was not a new

19   idea in Austin, and it was repeated after -- after

20   Austin.   But there was -- so Times v. Sullivan I think

21   is quite distinct.

22                The question that was posed here is, is it a

23   proper way to resolve this case, to overrule one

24   precedent in full and another in part?

25                MR. ABRAMS:        And what I'm urging on you,


                                        29

 1   Your Honor, is that by a parity of reasoning, although

 2   not precisely the same situation, that there are cases

 3   in which there is a -- an ongoing threat to freedom of

 4   expression which may lead -- if you were to agree to

 5   that, which may lead the Court to say, rather than

 6   taking a narrower route to the same result, that it is

 7   worth our moving away in this case from looking for the

 8   narrowest way out, and determining it now, rather than

 9   the next as-applied challenge.

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:           There are -- there are two

11   separate questions that -- that have been raised in

12   opposition to your position.           One is -- one is that we

13   should not resolve a broad constitutional issue where

14   there are narrower grounds, and that's the question you

15   are responding to.

16              An entirely separate question is the issue

17   of stare decisis, and you acknowledge that stare decisis

18   was not involved in New York Times v. Sullivan, but the

19   first question obviously was.

20              MR. ABRAMS:        And stare decisis of course is

21   a question much -- much briefed by the parties, and it

22   is one which involves of course a consideration not only

23   of the merits of the decision, but certain other

24   factors, the length of time the decision has been in

25   effect and the like.     The time in this case for the


                                     30
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   McConnell case, of course, is only 6 years.                  The time

 2   for the Austin case is 19 years, which is less than one

 3   ruling of this Court's just last term.

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But what the Court said

 5   in Austin it also said in the NRWC case, which was I

 6   think 8 years before Austin.            So Austin was not a new

 7   invention.

 8                MR. ABRAMS:      Well, Austin was the first time

 9   that corporate speech was barred -- corporate

10   independent expenditures were barred by a ruling of this

11   Court.   That had not happened prior to Austin, and the

12   Solicitor General's brief acknowledges that.                  Now --

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But there have been

14   limits on corporate spending in aid of a political

15   campaign since the turn of the 20th century.

16                MR. ABRAMS:      There had been limits on

17   corporate contributions since the turn of the century.

18   Corporate independent expenditures came much later and I

19   think that is something that I think is worth --

20                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Much later than 1947.

21                MR. ABRAMS:      Yes, Your Honor.             In 1947,

22   President Truman vetoed that bill, saying that it was a

23   dangerous intrusion into free speech.                  That has always

24   been an area of enormous controversy, not just in the

25   public sphere but in the judicial sphere.                  The early


                                      31

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   cases about Taft-Hartley were ones in which what the

 2   Court did was to basically say in one case after another

 3   that the statute did not govern the particular facts of

 4   the case so as to avoid --

 5                JUSTICE STEVENS:            But those were union

 6   cases, weren't they, rather than corporate cases?

 7                MR. ABRAMS:       Yes, they were three union

 8   cases.    And the case after that essentially was Buckley.

 9   And Buckley held unconstitutional the limits posed there

10   to independent expenditures.             All I'm saying is that

11   this is not a situation as if we have an unbroken amount

12   of years throughout American history in which it has

13   been accepted that independent expenditures could be

14   barred.   It has always been a matter of high level of

15   controversy, with courts at first and understandably

16   shying away from facing up to the issue directly and

17   then the first ruling on point.

18                JUSTICE STEVENS:            But have you read Justice

19   Rehnquist's dissent in the Bellotti case?

20                MR. ABRAMS:       I'm sorry, Your Honor.

21                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Have you read Justice

22   Rehnquist's dissent in the Bellotti case?

23                MR. ABRAMS:       Yes, I have.

24                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Which is somewhat

25   inconsistent with what you said.

 1               MR. ABRAMS:        Yes, it is.

 2               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And also

 3   inconsistent with his later view, correct?

 4               MR. ABRAMS:        Yes.

 5               Yes, Justice?

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Going back to the

 7   question of stare decisis, the one thing that is very

 8   interesting about this area of law for the last

 9   100 years is the active involvement of both State and

10   Federal legislatures in trying to find that balance

11   between the interest of protecting in their views how

12   the electoral process should proceed and the interests

13   of the First Amendment.

14               And so my question to you is, once we say

15   they can't, except on the basis of a compelling

16   government interest narrowly tailored, are we cutting

17   off or would we be cutting off that future democratic

18   process?   Because what you are suggesting is that the

19   courts who created corporations as persons, gave birth

20   to corporations as persons, and there could be an

21   argument made that that was the Court's error to start

22   with, not Austin or McConnell, but the fact that the

23   Court imbued a creature of State law with human

24   characteristics.

25               But we can go back to the very basics that


                                       33
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   way, but wouldn't we be doing some more harm than good

 2   by a broad ruling in a case that doesn't involve more

 3   business corporations and actually doesn't even involve

 4   the traditional nonprofit organization?                  It involves an

 5   advocacy corporation that has a very particular

 6   interest.

 7               MR. ABRAMS:       Your Honor, I don't think you'd

 8   be doing more harm than good in vindicating the First

 9   Amendment rights here, which transcend that of Citizens

10   United.

11               I think that, reading my friend's brief here

12   on the right, they come -- some of them at least come

13   pretty close to saying that there must be a way for

14   Citizens United to win this case other than a broad way.

15   In my view the principles at stake here are the same.

16   Citizens United happens to be sort of the paradigmatic

17   example of the sort of group speaking no less about who

18   to vote for or not who to vote for or what to think

19   about a potential ongoing candidate for President of the

20   United States.   But in lots of other situations day by

21   day there is a blotch to public discourse caused as a

22   result of this Congressional legislation.

23               And so we think it is not a matter of

24   cutting off what legislatures can do.                  They can still

25   pass legislation doing all sorts of things.                  They can do


                                      34
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   public funding.     They can do many other things that

 2   don't violate the First Amendment.                  If we are right in

 3   saying that independent expenditures, that category of

 4   money leading to speech that we are talking about today,

 5   if we are right that that is the sort of speech which is

 6   at the core of the First Amendment, then you would be

 7   doing only good, only good, by ruling that way today

 8   across the board.

 9         Thank you, Your Honor.

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Thank you, Mr.

11   Abrams.

13              ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELENA KAGAN

14               ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

15              GENERAL KAGAN:             Mr. Chief Justice and may it

16   please the Court:

17         I have three very quick points to make about the

18   government position.       The first is that this issue has a

19   long history.   For over 100 years Congress has made a

20   judgment that corporations must be subject to special

21   rules when they participate in elections and this Court

22   has never questioned that judgment.

23              Number two --

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Wait, wait, wait, wait.      We

25   never questioned it, but we never approved it, either.


                                        35

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   And we gave some really weird interpretations to the

 2   Taft-Hartley Act in order to avoid confronting the

 3   question.

 4                 GENERAL KAGAN:          I will repeat what I said,

 5   Justice Scalia:     For 100 years this Court, faced with

 6   many opportunities to do so, left standing the

 7   legislation that is at issue in this case -- first the

 8   contribution limits, then the expenditure limits that

 9   came in by way of Taft-Hartley -- and then of course in

10   Austin specifically approved those limits.

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't understand what you

12   are saying.    I mean, we are not a self -- self-starting

13   institution here.     We only disapprove of something when

14   somebody asks us to.       And if there was no occasion for

15   us to approve or disapprove, it proves nothing whatever

16   that we didn't disapprove it.

17                 GENERAL KAGAN:          Well, you are not a

18   self-starting institution.            But many litigants brought

19   many cases to you in 1907 and onwards and in each case

20   this Court turns down, declined the opportunity, to

21   invalidate or otherwise interfere with this legislation.

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But that judgment was

23   validated by Buckley's contribution-expenditure line.

24   And you're correct if you look at contributions, but

25   this is an expenditure case.              And I think that it


                                        36
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   doesn't clarify the situation to say that for


 2   100 years -- to suggest that for 100 years we would have


 3   allowed expenditure limitations, which in order to work


 4   at all have to have a speaker-based distinction,


 5   exemption from media, content-based distinction,


 6   time-based distinction.        We've never allowed that.


 7               GENERAL KAGAN:          Well, I think

 8   Justice Stevens was right in saying that the expenditure

 9   limits that are in play in this case came into effect in

10   1947, so it has been 60 years rather than 100 years.

11   But in fact, even before that the contribution limits

12   were thought to include independent expenditures, and as

13   soon as Congress saw independent expenditures going on

14   Congress closed what it perceived to be illegal.            So in

15   fact for 100 years corporations have made neither

16   contributions nor expenditures, save for a brief period

17   of time in the middle 1940's, which Congress very

18   swiftly reacted to by passing the Taft-Hartley Act.

19               Now, the reason that Congress has enacted

20   these special rules -- and this is the second point that

21   I wanted to make --

22               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Before you go to your

23   second point, may I ask you to clarify one part of the

24   first, namely, your answer to the question I proposed to

25   Mr. Olson, namely, why isn't the Snowe-Jeffords

 1   Amendment, which was picked on by Congress itself, an --

 2   and which is argued by the NRA, an appropriate answer to

 3   this case?

 4                 GENERAL KAGAN:         That was my third point,

 5   Justice Stevens.

 6                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Oh, I'm sorry.

 7                 (Laughter.)

 8                 GENERAL KAGAN:         So we will just skip over

 9   the second.

10                 My third point is that this is an anomalous

11   case in part because this is an atypical plaintiff.                 And

12   the reason this is an atypical plaintiff is because this

13   plaintiff is an ideological nonprofit and --

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So you are giving up

15   -- you are giving up the distinction from MCFL that you

16   defended in your opening brief?               There you said this

17   doesn't qualify as a different kind of corporation

18   because it takes corporate funds, and now you are

19   changing that position?

20                 GENERAL KAGAN:         No, I --I don't think we are

21   changing it.    MCFL is the law, and the FEA -- FEC has

22   always tried to implement MCFL faithfully.                 And that's

23   what the FEC has tried to do.             But if you --

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So I guess -- do you

25   think MCFL applies in this case even though the


                                       38
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   corporation takes corporate funds from for-profit

 2   corporations?

 3              GENERAL KAGAN:          I don't think MCFL as

 4   written applies in this case, but I think that the Court

 5   could, as lower courts have done, adjust MCFL

 6   potentially to make it apply in this case, although I

 7   think that would require a remand.               What lower courts

 8   have done -- MCFL was set up, it was written in a very

 9   strict kind of way so that the organization had to have

10   a policy of accepting no corporate funds whatsoever.

11              Some of the lower courts, including the D.C.

12   Circuit, which, of course, sees a lot of these cases,

13   have suggested that MCFL is too strict, that it doesn't

14   --

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Do you -- do you

16   think it's too strict?

17              GENERAL KAGAN:          I -- I -- the FEC has no

18   objection to MCFL being adjusted in order to -- to give

19   it some flexibility.     What the --

20              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So you want to give

21   up this case, change your position, and basically say

22   you lose solely because of the questioning that we have

23   directed on reargument?

24              GENERAL KAGAN:          Solely because?        I am sorry?

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Because of the


                                     39
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   question we have posed on reargument.

 2                 GENERAL KAGAN:          No, I don't think that that

 3   is fair.     We think -- we continue to think that the --

 4   the judgment below should be affirmed.                     If you are

 5   asking me, Mr. Chief Justice, as to whether the

 6   government has a preference as to the way in which it

 7   loses, if it has to lose, the answer is yes.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                What case of ours --

 9   what case of ours suggests that there is a hierarchy of

10   bases on which we should rule against a party when both

11   of them involve constitutional questions?                     Extending --

12   modifying MCFL would be, I assume, by virtue of the

13   First Amendment.     Overruling Austin would be by virtue

14   of the First Amendment.         So what case says we should

15   prefer one as opposed to the other?

16                 GENERAL KAGAN:          I think the question really

17   is the Court's standard practice of deciding as-applied

18   challenges before facial challenges.                     And this case

19   certainly raises a number of tricky as-applied

20   questions.    One is the question of how the -- the

21   statute applies to nonprofit organizations such as this

22   one.   Another is a question of how it applies to VOD

23   transmissions.     Yet another is the question of how it

24   applies to a 90-minute infomercial as opposed to smaller

25   advertisements.

 1                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But if you -- if you

 2   insist on the as-applied challenge, isn't that

 3   inconsistent with the whole line of cases that began in

 4   Thornhill v. Alabama and Coates v. Cincinnati?             What

 5   about the Thornhill doctrine?             It is not cited in the

 6   briefs, but that doctrine is that even a litigant

 7   without standing to object to a particular form of

 8   conduct can raise that if the statute covers it in order

 9   that the statute does not have an ongoing chill against

10   speech.    And there is no place where an ongoing chill is

11   more dangerous than in the elections context.

12                GENERAL KAGAN:          Well, I think even --

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So you are asking us to

14   have an ongoing chill where we have as-applied

15   challenges which are based on, as I indicated before,

16   speaker, content, time, and this is the kind of chilling

17   effect that the Thornhill doctrine stands directly

18   against.

19                GENERAL KAGAN:          You know, I think even in

20   the First Amendment context, Justice Kennedy, the Court

21   will not strike down a statute on its face unless it

22   finds very substantial overbreadth, many applications of

23   the statute that are unconstitutional, as opposed to

24   just a few or just some.         What I am suggesting here is

25   that the Court was right in McConnell and then confirmed


                                       41
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   in WRTL to find that BCRA, which is of course the only

 2   statute directly involved in this case, did not have

 3   that substantial overdraft.

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Let me ask you this.

 5   Suppose that we were to rule that nonprofit corporations

 6   could not be covered by the statute.                   Would that --

 7   would the statute then have substantial overbreadth?

 8                GENERAL KAGAN:         Well, I would urge you not

 9   to do that in that kind of sweeping way, because the

10   reason for the nonprofit corporations being covered is

11   to make sure that the nonprofit corporations don't

12   function as conduits for the for-profit corporations.

13                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But suppose we were to say

14   that.   Would the statute then not be substantially

15   overbroad?

16                GENERAL KAGAN:         Well, I don't think that the

17   statute is substantially overbroad right now.                  So if you

18   took out certain applications, I can't think --

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But I am asking you to

20   assume that we draw the nonprofit/profit distinction.

21   Then the statute, it seems to me, clearly has to fall

22   because, number one, we couldn't sever it based on the

23   language.

24                GENERAL KAGAN:         I see what you are saying.

25   Well, you could do a couple of things.                  You could do

 1   what Justice Stevens suggested.              Justice Stevens

 2   suggested -- I suggested to Chief Justice Roberts --

 3               JUSTICE STEVENS:            I don't think you -- I

 4   don't think you really caught what I suggested because

 5   you treated it as an enlargement of the MCFL example.

 6               GENERAL KAGAN:          I was going to go back.

 7               JUSTICE STEVENS:            But that is not what the

 8   National Rifle Association argues or what Snowe-Jeffords

 9   covers.   It covers ads that are financed exclusively by

10   individuals even though they are sponsored by a

11   corporation.

12               GENERAL KAGAN:          Yes, that's exactly right.

13   What you are suggesting, Justice Stevens, is essentially

14   stripping the Wellstone amendment from the --

15               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Correct and treating the

16   Snowe-Jeffords amendment as being the correct test.                    And

17   nobody has explained why that wouldn't be a proper

18   solution, not nearly as drastic as -- as being argued

19   here.

20               GENERAL KAGAN:          Yes, and there are some, you

21   know -- there are -- there are some reasons that that

22   might -- that might be appropriate.                    The Wellstone

23   amendment was a funny kind of thing.                    It was passed very

24   narrowly, but beyond that it was passed with a -- a

25   really substantial support of many people who voted

 1   against the legislation in the end, presumably as a

 2   poison pill.

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, if we -- if we go --

 4   if we go that route, what we are doing is creating an

 5   accounting industry, aren't we?             Corporations give huge

 6   amounts of money to the C-4 organization, and then

 7   somebody, perhaps the FEC, has to decide whether in fact

 8   that is a way of subverting the prohibition against the

 9   direct payment for the communication, right?                 Okay, so

10   Congress said, we don't want that.                 Congress said,

11   that's going to be a nightmare, and we decide Wellstone,

12   for whatever reasons.

13              Now don't we have to focus on whether

14   Congress can say that or whether it can't?

15              JUSTICE STEVENS:            But --

16              JUSTICE BREYER:            And I don't know why it

17   cannot say it.

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Congress also said if you

19   strike down the Wellstone amendment, we want the Snowe-

20   Jeffords amendment.

21              JUSTICE BREYER:            That's true.

22              JUSTICE STEVENS:            And why shouldn't we

23   follow that direction?

24              GENERAL KAGAN:          If you strike down the

25   Wellstone amendment, what is left is the Snowe-Jeffords

 1   amendment --

 2                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Right.

 3                 GENERAL KAGAN:         -- which allows nonprofit

 4   organizations of the kind here to fund these ads out of

 5   separate bank accounts, not PACs just separate bank

 6   accounts --

 7                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Correct.

 8                 GENERAL KAGAN:         -- which include only

 9   individual expenditures.

10                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Then why is that not the

11   -- the wisest narrow solution of the problem before us?

12                 GENERAL KAGAN:         Well, it is -- it is

13   certainly a narrower and I think better solution than a

14   facial invalidation of the whole statute.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Counsel, what do you

16   -- what do you understand to be the compelling interest

17   that the Court articulated in Austin?

18                 GENERAL KAGAN:         I think that what the Court

19   articulated in Austin -- and, of course, in the

20   government briefs we have suggested that Austin did not

21   articulate what we believe to be the strongest

22   compelling interest, which is the anticorruption

23   interest.   But what the Court articulated in Austin was

24   essentially a concern about corporations using the

25   corporate form to appropriate other people's money for


                                       45

 1   expressive purposes.

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Right.     So but you

 3   -- you have more or less -- "abandoned" is too strong a

 4   word, but as you say you have relied on a different

 5   interest, the quid pro quo corruption.                  And you -- you

 6   articulate on page 11 of your brief -- you recognize

 7   that this Court has not accepted that interest as a

 8   compelling interest.

 9                 So isn't it the case that as you view Austin

10   it is kind of up for play in the sense that you would

11   ground it on an interest that the Court has never

12   recognized?

13                 GENERAL KAGAN:         Well, a couple of points.

14   The first thing is, as you say, we have not abandoned

15   Austin.   We have simply said that in addition --

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Where --

17                 GENERAL KAGAN: -- to other people's money

18   interest that --

19                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Where in your --

20   where in your supplemental briefing do you say that this

21   aggregation of wealth interest supports Austin?

22                 GENERAL KAGAN:         I would not really call it

23   an aggregation of wealth interest.                 I would say that

24   it's -- it's a concern about corporate use of other

25   people's money to --

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Putting it outside,

 2   putting the quid pro quo interest aside, where in your

 3   supplemental briefing do you support the interest that

 4   was articulated by the Court in Austin?

 5              GENERAL KAGAN:            Where we talk about

 6   shareholder protection and where we talk about the

 7   distortion of the electoral process that occurs when

 8   corporations use their shareholders' money who may or

 9   may not agree --

10              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I understand that to

11   be a different interest.         That is the shareholder

12   protection interest as opposed to the fact that

13   corporations have such wealth and they -- they distort

14   the marketplace.

15              GENERAL KAGAN:            Well, I -- I think that they

16   are connected because both come --

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So -- so am I right

18   then in saying that in the supplemental briefing you do

19   not rely at all on the market distortion rationale on

20   which Austin relied; not the shareholder rationale, not

21   the quid pro quo rationale, the market distortion issue.

22   These corporations have a lot of money.

23              GENERAL KAGAN:            We do not rely at all on

24   Austin to the extent that anybody takes Austin to be

25   suggesting anything about the equalization of a speech


                                       47

 1   market.     So I know that that's the way that many people

 2   understand the distortion rationale of Austin, and if

 3   that's the way the Court understands i, we do not rely

 4   at all on that.

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So --

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So if we have to

 7   preserve -- if we are going to preserve Austin we have

 8   to accept your invitation that the quid pro quo interest

 9   supports the holding there or the shareholder protection

10   interest.

11                 GENERAL KAGAN:          I would say either the quid

12   pro quo interest, the corruption interest or the

13   shareholder interest, or what I would say is a -- is

14   something related to the shareholder interest that is in

15   truth my view of Austin, which is a view that when

16   corporations use other people's money to electioneer,

17   that is a harm not just to the shareholders themselves

18   but a sort of a broader harm to the public that comes

19   from distortion of the electioneering that is done by

20   corporations.

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Let's -- let's talk about

22   overbreadth.    You've -- let's assume that that is a

23   valid interest.     What percentage of the total number of

24   corporations in the country are not single shareholder

25   corporations?     The local hairdresser, the local auto

 1   repair shop, the local new car dealer -- I don't know

 2   any small business in this country that isn't

 3   incorporated, and the vast majority of them are

 4   sole-shareholder-owned.

 5                Now this statute makes it unlawful for all

 6   of them to do the things that you are worried about, you

 7   know, distorting other -- the interests of other

 8   shareholders.    That is vast overbreadth.

 9                GENERAL KAGAN:           You know, I think that the

10   single shareholders can present these corruption

11   problems.    Many, many closed corporations, single

12   shareholder corporations --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:            I'm not talking about the

14   corruption interest.       You -- you have your quid pro quo

15   argument, that's another one.              We get to that when we

16   get there.    But as far as the interest you are now

17   addressing, which is those shareholders who don't agree

18   with this political position are being somehow cheated,

19   that doesn't apply probably to the vast majority of

20   corporations in this country.

21                GENERAL KAGAN:           You are quite right,

22   Justice Scalia, when -- we say when it comes to single

23   shareholders, the kind of "other people's money"

24   interests, the shareholder protection interests do not

25   apply.   There --

 1              JUSTICE SCALIA:             So that can't be the

 2   justification --

 3              GENERAL KAGAN:            There --

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:             -- because if it were, the

 5   statute would be vastly overbroad.

 6              GENERAL KAGAN:            There the strongest

 7   justification is the anticorruption interest.

 8              JUSTICE ALITO:            Well, with respect to that

 9   what is your answer to the argument that more than half

10   the States, including California and Oregon, Virginia,

11   Washington State, Delaware, Maryland, a great many

12   others, permit independent corporate expenditures for

13   just these purposes?      Now have they all been overwhelmed

14   by corruption?   A lot of money is spent on elections in

15   California; has -- is there a record that the

16   corporations have corrupted the political process there?

17              GENERAL KAGAN:            I think the experience of

18   some half the States cannot be more important than the

19   100-year old judgment of Congress that these

20   expenditures would corrupt the Federal system, and I

21   think that --

22              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Congress has a

23   self-interest.   I mean, we -- we are suspicious of

24   congressional action in the First Amendment area

25   precisely because we -- at least I am -- I doubt that

 1   one can expect a body of incumbents to draw election

 2   restrictions that do not favor incumbents.              Now is that

 3   excessively cynical of me?           I don't think so.

 4                 GENERAL KAGAN:         I think, Justice Scalia,

 5   it's wrong.    In fact, corporate and union money go

 6   overwhelmingly to incumbents.             This may be the single

 7   most self-denying thing that Congress has ever done.                If

 8   you look -- if you look at the last election cycle and

 9   look at corporate PAC money and ask where it goes, it

10   goes ten times more to incumbents than to challengers,

11   and in the prior election cycle even more than that.

12                 And for an obvious reason, because when

13   corporations play in the political process, they want

14   winners, they want people who will produce outcomes for

15   them, and they know that the way to get those outcomes,

16   the way to get those winners is to invest in incumbents,

17   and so that's what they do.            As I said, in double digits

18   times more than they invest in challengers.             So I think

19   that that -- that that rationale, which is undoubtedly

20   true in many contexts, simply is not the case with

21   respect to this case.

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But under your position,

23   if corporations A, B, and C, are called to Washington

24   every Monday morning by a high-ranking administrative

25   official or a high-ranking member of the Congress with a

 1   committee chairmanship and told to tow the line and to

 2   tell their directors and shareholders what the policy

 3   ought to be, some other corporation can't object to that

 4   during the election cycle.         The government silences a

 5   corporate objector, and those corporations may have the

 6   most knowledge of this on the subject.

 7              Corporations have lots of knowledge about

 8   environment, transportation issues, and you are

 9   silencing them during the election.

10              GENERAL KAGAN:          Well --

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            When other corporations,

12   via -- because of the very fact you just point out, have

13   already been used and are being used by the government

14   to express its views; and you say another corporation

15   can't object to that.

16              GENERAL KAGAN:          Well, to the extent,

17   Justice Kennedy, that you are talking about what goes on

18   in the halls of Congress, of course corporations can

19   lobby members of Congress in the same way that they

20   could before this legislation.            What this legislation is

21   designed to do, because of its anticorruption interest,

22   is to make sure that that lobbying is just persuasion

23   and it's not coercion.      But in addition to that, of

24   course corporations have many opportunities to speak

25   outside the halls of Congress.

 1                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           One of the amicus briefs

 2   objects to -- responds to Justice Kennedy's problem by

 3   saying that the problem is we have got to contribute to

 4   both parties, and a lot of them do, don't they?

 5                 GENERAL KAGAN:         A lot of them do, which is a

 6   suggestion about how corporations engage the political

 7   process and how corporations are different from

 8   individuals in this respect.             You know, an individual

 9   can be the wealthiest person in the world but few of

10   us -- maybe some -- but few of us are only our economic

11   interests.    We have beliefs, we have convictions; we

12   have likes and dislikes.         Corporations engage the

13   political process in an entirely different way and this

14   is what makes them so much more damaging.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, that's not --

16   I'm sorry, but that seems rather odd.                   A large

17   corporation just like an individual has many diverse

18   interests.    A corporation may want to support a

19   particular candidate, but they may be concerned just as

20   you say about what their shareholders are going to think

21   about that.    They may be concerned that the shareholders

22   would rather they spend their money doing something

23   else.   The idea that corporations are different than

24   individuals in that respect, I just don't think holds

25   up.

 1                GENERAL KAGAN:         Well, all I was suggesting,

 2   Mr. Chief Justice, is that corporations have actually a

 3   fiduciary obligation to their shareholders to increase

 4   value.   That's their single purpose, their goal.

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               So if a candidate --

 6   take a tobacco company, and a candidate is running on

 7   the platform that they ought to make tobacco illegal,

 8   presumably that company would maximize its shareholders'

 9   interests by opposing the election of that individual.

10                GENERAL KAGAN:         But everything is geared

11   through the corporation's self-interest in order to

12   maximize profits, in order to maximize revenue, in order

13   to maximize value.    Individuals are more complicated

14   than that.   So that when corporations engage the

15   political process, they do it with that set of you know,

16   blinders -- I don't mean it to be pejorative, because

17   that's what we want corporations to do, is to --

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, I suppose some

19   do, but let's say if you have ten individuals and they

20   each contribute $1,000 to a corporation, and they say,

21   "we want this corporation to convey a particular

22   message," why can't they do that, when if they did that

23   as partnership, it would be all right?

24                GENERAL KAGAN:         Well, it sounds to me as

25   though the corporation that you were describing is a


                                      54

 1   corporation of the kind we have in this case, where one

 2   can assume that the members all sign on to the

 3   corporation's ideological mission, where the corporation

 4   in fact has an ideological mission.

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:           General Kagan, most -- most

 6   corporations are indistinguishable from the individual

 7   who owns them, the local hairdresser, the new auto

 8   dealer -- dealer who has just lost his dealership and --

 9   and who wants to oppose whatever Congressman he thinks

10   was responsible for this happening or whatever

11   Congressman won't try to patch it up by -- by getting

12   the auto company to undo it.            There is no distinction

13   between the individual interest and the corporate

14   interest.   And that is true for the vast majority of

15   corporations.

16               GENERAL KAGAN:          Well --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yet this law freezes all of

18   them out.

19               GENERAL KAGAN:          To the extent that we are

20   only talking about single shareholder corporations, I

21   guess I would ask why it's any burden on that single

22   shareholder to make the expenditures to participate in

23   the political person in the way that person wants to

24   outside the corporate forum?            So single shareholders

25   aren't suffering any burden here; they can do everything

 1   that they could within the corporate form, outside the

 2   corporate form.   They probably don't get the tax breaks

 3   that they would get inside the corporate form, but I'm

 4   not sure anything else is very different.

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Oh, he wants to put up a

 6   sign --

 7               JUSTICE STEVENS:            Ultra Vires would take

 8   care of about 90 percent of the small corporations that

 9   Justice Scalia is talking about.               They can't just --

10   they can't even give money to charities sometimes

11   because of Ultra Vires.       Giving political contributions

12   is not typical for corporate activity.

13               JUSTICE BREYER:           Is -- I -- I remember

14   spending quite a few days one summer reading through

15   1,000 pages of opinion in the D.C. Circuit.              And I came

16   away with the distinct impression that Congress has

17   built an enormous record of support for this bill in the

18   evidence.

19               And my recollection is, but it is now a

20   couple of years old, that there was a lot of information

21   in that which suggested that many millions of voters

22   think, at the least, that large corporate and union

23   expenditures or contributions in favor of a candidate

24   lead the benefited political figure to decide quite

25   specifically in favor of the -- of the contributing or

 2              GENERAL KAGAN:          Yes, that's --

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:           Now, it was on the basis of

 4   that, I think, that this Court upheld the law in BCRA.

 5   But we have heard from the other side there isn't much

 6   of a record on this.

 7              So, if you could save me some time here,

 8   perhaps you could point me, if I am right, to those

 9   thousand pages of opinion and tens of thousands of

10   underlying bits of evidence where there might be support

11   for that proposition?

12              GENERAL KAGAN:          Yes, that's exactly right,

13   Justice Breyer, that in addition to the 100-year old

14   judgment that Congress believes this is necessary, that

15   very recently members of Congress and others created a

16   gigantic record showing that there was corruption and

17   that there was the appearance of corruption.

18              And in that record, many times senators,

19   former senators talk about the way in which fundraising

20   is at the front of their mind in everything that they do

21   the way in which they grant access, the way in which

22   they grant influence, and the way in which outcomes

23   likely change as a result of that fundraising.

24              JUSTICE BREYER:           BCRA has changed all that.

 1   ask, it seems -- to your shareholder protection

 2   rationale, isn't it extraordinarily paternalistic for

 3   the government to take the position that shareholders

 4   are too stupid to keep track of what their corporations

 5   are doing and can't sell their shares or object in the

 6   corporate context if they don't like it?

 7               GENERAL KAGAN:          I don't think so, Mr. Chief

 8   Justice.   I mean, I, for one, can't keep stack of what

 9   my -- where I hold --

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You have a busy job.

11   You can't expect everybody to do that.

12               (Laughter.)

13               GENERAL KAGAN:          It's not that -- it's not

14   that I have a busy job.

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But it is

16   extraordinary -- I mean, the -- the idea and as I

17   understand the rationale, we -- we the government, big

18   brother, has to protect shareholders from themselves.

19   They might give money, they might buy shares in a

20   corporation and they don't know that the corporation is

21   taking out radio ads.       The government has to keep an eye

22   on their interests.

23               GENERAL KAGAN:          I appreciate that.            It's not

24   that I have a busy job, it's that I, like most

25   Americans, own shares through mutual funds.                    If you

 2   don't know where you are --

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So it is -- I mean,

 4   I understand.   So it is a paternalistic interest, we the

 5   government have to protect you naive shareholders.

 6               GENERAL KAGAN:            In a world in which most

 7   people own stock through mutual funds, in a world where

 8   people own stock through retirement plans in which they

 9   have to invest, they have no choice, I think it's very

10   difficult for individual shareholders to be able to

11   monitor what each company they own assets in is doing or

12   even to know the extent of the --

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              In that respect, it's

14   unlike the union, because the -- the worker who does not

15   want to affiliate with a union cannot have funds from

16   his own pocket devoted to political causes.                 But there

17   is no comparable check for corporations.

18               GENERAL KAGAN:            That's exactly right,

19   Justice Ginsburg.     In the union context, of course, it's

20   a constitutional right that the unions give back

21   essentially the funds that any union member or employee

22   in the workplace does not want used for electoral

23   purposes.

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Does that mean that

25   unions should be taken out, because there isn't the

 1   same -- the shareholder protection interest doesn't --

 2   there is no parallel for the union?

 3              GENERAL KAGAN:           You are right about that.

 4   But I -- the government believes that with respect to

 5   unions, the anticorruption interest is as strong, and

 6   that unions should be kept in.

 7              I think what your point suggests, that

 8   the -- that the union member point suggests why Congress

 9   might have thought that there was a compelling interest

10   to protect corporate shareholders in the same way that,

11   let's say, dissenting union members are protected by the

12   Constitution.   There is no State action, of course, so

13   there is no constitutional right in the corporate

14   context.

15              But Congress made a judgment that it was an

16   important value that shareholders have this choice, have

17   the ability both to invest in our country's assets and

18   also to be able to choose our country's leaders.

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  It's not investing

20   in our country's --

 1   what it is, so that I -- my notes are complete.

 2              GENERAL KAGAN:            I very appreciate that,

 3   Justice Kennedy.   I think I did cover point two, which

 4   was an explanation of some of the questions that the

 5   Chief Justice asked me about what interests the

 6   government was suggesting motivated these laws and are

 7   compelling enough such that this Court certainly should

 8   not invalidate these laws.

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I take it we have

10   never accepted your shareholder protection interest.

11   This is a new argument.

12              GENERAL KAGAN:            I think that that's fair.

13   Certainly Bellotti does not accept it.                  I would think --

14   you know, National Right to Work is an interesting

15   opinion, because National Right to Work accepts for a

16   unanimous court both the shareholder protection argument

17   and the anticorruption argument with respect to the

18   section 441b in particular.

19              Now, in later cases the Court has suggested

20   that National Right to Work was only focused on

21   contributions.   If you read National Right to Work, that

22   distinction really does not -- it's not evident on the

23   face of the opinion, and I think Chief Justice Rehnquist

25   never understood it that way.

 1              But -- so National Right to Work is a

 2   confusion on this point.        It --

 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, I guess other

 4   than that, and I think there may be some ambiguity

 5   there, but I wouldn't say NRWC is a holding on

 6   shareholder protection.        So to the extent that you

 7   abandoned the original rationale in Austin, and

 8   articulated different rationales, you have two, the quid

 9   pro quo corruption interest and the shareholder

10   protection interest --

11              GENERAL KAGAN:          Which we think is not in

12   Austin.

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Austin, I thought,

14   was based on the aggregation of immense wealth by

15   corporations.

16              GENERAL KAGAN:          Again, Austin is not the

17   most lucid opinion.      But the way we understand Austin,

18   what Austin was suggesting was that the corporate form

19   gave corporations significant assets, other people's

20   money that when the corporations spent those assets --

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Can you -- can you

22   give me the citation to the page in Austin where we

23   accepted the shareholder protection rationale?

24              GENERAL KAGAN:          I think it comes when the --

25   when the Court is distinguishing MCFL.                 And the message


                                      62
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   of that distinction of MCFL is the shareholder

 2   protection interest?     But --

 3              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Do the words

 4   "shareholder" -- I don't know, do the words "shareholder

 5   protection" appear in the Austin opinion?

 6              GENERAL KAGAN:          I honestly don't know,

 7   Mr. Chief Justice.     And -- and I don't want to --

 8              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 If they don't --

 9   let's assume they don't, then I get back to my question,

10   which is, you are asking us to defend the Austin or

11   support or continue the Austin opinion on the basis of

12   two rationales that we have never accepted, shareholder

13   protection and quid pro quo corruption?

14              GENERAL KAGAN:          I would say on the quid pro

15   quo corruption, of course you have accepted that

16   rationale --

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 In the context of

18   contributions, not expenditures.

19              GENERAL KAGAN:          That's correct.         And I think

20   what has changed since -- since that time is the BCRA

21   record that Justice Breyer suggested, which was very

22   strong on the notion that there was no difference when

23   it came to corporate contributions and expenditures,

24   that there actually was no difference between the two.

25   That they --

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Is that a yes?   Is

 2   that a yes?    In other words, you are asking us to uphold

 3   Austin on the basis of two arguments, two principles,

 4   two compelling interests we have never accepted, in

 5   expenditure context.

 6                 GENERAL KAGAN:         In this -- in this

 7   particular context, fair enough.                But, you know, I

 8   think --

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And to undercut Buckley in

10   so doing?

11                 GENERAL KAGAN:         Well, I don't think so,

12   because I do think Buckley was about individuals rather

13   than corporations, and Buckley was in 1976, not in 2009,

14   after the very extensive record that was created in

15   BCRA.

16                 I see my time is up.              I don't --

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           May I ask you one

18   question that was highlighted in the prior argument, and

19   that was if Congress could say no TV and radio ads,

20   could it also say no newspaper ads, no campaign

21   biographies?    Last time the answer was, yes, Congress

22   could, but it didn't.       Is that -- is that still the

23   government's answer?

24                 GENERAL KAGAN:         The government's answer has

25   changed, Justice Ginsburg.

 1               (Laughter.)

 2               GENERAL KAGAN:          It is still true that BCRA

 3   203, which is the only statute involved in this case,

 4   does not apply to books or anything other than

 5   broadcast; 441b does, on its face, apply to other media.

 6   And we took what the Court -- what the Court's -- the

 7   Court's own reaction to some of those other

 8   hypotheticals very seriously.            We went back, we

 9   considered the matter carefully, and the government's

10   view is that although 441b does cover full-length books,

11   that there would be quite good as-applied challenge to

12   any attempt to apply 441b in that context.

13               And I should say that the FEC has never

14   applied 441b in that context.            So for 60 years a book

15   has never been at issue.

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:           What happened to the

17   overbreadth doctrine?      I mean, I thought our doctrine in

18   the Fourth Amendment is if you write it too broadly, we

19   are not going to pare it back to the point where it's

20   constitutional.   If it's overbroad, it's invalid.           What

21   has happened to that.

22               GENERAL KAGAN:          I don't think that it would

23   be substantially overbroad, Justice Scalia, if I tell

24   you that the FEC has never applied this statute to a

25   book.   To say that it doesn't apply to books is to take

 1   off, you know, essentially nothing.

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But we don't put our

 3   -- we don't put our First Amendment rights in the hands

 4   of FEC bureaucrats; and if you say that you are not

 5   going to apply it to a book, what about a pamphlet?

 6                 GENERAL KAGAN:          I think a -- a pamphlet

 7   would be different.      A pamphlet is pretty classic

 8   electioneering, so there is no attempt to say that 441 b

 9   only applies to video and not to print.                  It does --

10                 JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, what if the

11   particular -- what if the particular movie involved here

12   had not been distributed by Video on Demand?                  Suppose

13   that people could view it for free on Netflix over the

14   internet?     Suppose that free DVDs were passed out.

15   Suppose people could attend the movie for free in a

16   movie theater; suppose the exact text of this was

17   distributed in a printed form.               In light of your

18   retraction, I have no idea where the government would

19   draw the line with respect to the medium that could be

20   prohibited.

21                 GENERAL KAGAN:          Well, none of those things,

22   again, are covered.

23                 JUSTICE ALITO:          No, but could they?        Which

24   of them could and which could not?                  I understand you to

25   say books could not.

 1               GENERAL KAGAN:          Yes, I think what you --

 2   what we're saying is that there has never been an

 3   enforcement action for books.            Nobody has ever

 4   suggested -- nobody in Congress, nobody in the

 5   administrative apparatus has ever suggested that books

 6   pose any kind of corruption problem, so I think that

 7   there would be a good as-applied challenge with respect

 8   to that.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:           So you're -- you are a

10   lawyer advising somebody who is about to come out with a

11   book and you say don't worry, the FEC has never tried to

12   send somebody to prison for this.                This statute covers

13   it, but don't worry, the FEC has never done it.                Is that

14   going to comfort your client?            I don't think so.

15               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But this -- this statute

16   doesn't cover.   It doesn't cover books.

17               GENERAL KAGAN:          No, no, that's exactly

18   right.   The only statute that is involved in this case

19   does not cover books.      So 441b which --

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Does cover books.

21               GENERAL KAGAN:          -- which does cover books,

22   except that I have just said that there would be a good

23   as-applied challenge and that there has been no

24   administrative practice of ever applying it to the

25   books.   And also only applies to express advocacy,


                                      67

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   right?     203 has -- is -- is -- has a broader category of

 2   the functional equivalent of express advocacy, but 441b

 3   is only express advocacy, which is a part of the reason

 4   why it has never applied to a book.                      One cannot imagine

 5   very many books that would meet the definition of

 6   express advocacy as this Court has expressed that.

 7                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Oh, I'm sorry, we

 8   suggested some in the last argument.                      You have a history

 9   of union organizing and union involvement in politics,

10   and the last sentence says in light of all this, vote

11   for Jones.

12                 GENERAL KAGAN:          I think that that wouldn't

13   be covered, Mr. Chief Justice.               The FEC is very careful

14   and says this in all its regulations to view matters as

15   a whole.     And as a whole that book would not count as

16   express advocacy.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, General.

 1   electoral advocacy the same way individuals do, that is

 2   with money voluntarily committed by people associated

 3   with the corporation, is grounded in interests that are

 4   so compelling that 52 years ago, before Buckley was

 5   decided, before FECA was enacted, before Buckley-style

 6   quid pro quo corruption was ever addressed, this Court

 7   explained that, quote:      "What is involved here is the

 8   integrity of our electoral process and not less the

 9   responsibility of the individual citizen for the

10   successful functioning of that process."

11              If the Court now wishes to reconsider the

12   existence and extent of the interests that underlie that

13   sentiment expressed for the Court by Justice Frankfurter

14   in the context of a prosecution of union officials for

15   running television ads supporting political candidates,

16   it should do so in a case in which those interests are

17   forthrightly challenged with a proper and full record

18   below.

19              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                One of the amicus

20   briefs, I'm not -- maybe it's professor Hayward, if I am

21   getting that right -- suggested the history of this 1947

22   provision was such that it really wasn't enforced

23   because people were concerned about the First Amendment

24   interests and that the courts to the extent cases were

25   brought did everything they could to avoid enforcing the


                                     69

 1   limitations.

 2              MR. WAXMAN:       Well, I don't recall who the

 3   professor was either, Mr. Chief Justice, but I do recall

 4   pretty well the history that was recounted -- I would

 5   say the history that was recounted by this Court in the

 6   Auto Workers case, in CIO, in the Pipefitters case,

 7   which is quite inconsistent with that.                We've never had

 8   this case -- until this Court's supplemental order, we

 9   never had a case that challenged directly, quote,

10   "Austin" and Austin-style corruption, which is a term I

11   think that is quite misleading.

12              When the sober-minded Elihu Root was moved

13   to stand up in 1894 and urged the people of the United

14   States, and urged the Congress of the United States, to

15   enact legislation that would address, quote, "a

16   constantly growing evil which has done more to shake the

17   confidence of plain people of small means of this

18   country in our political institutions than any practice

19   which has ever obtained since the founding of our

20   government," he was not engaging in a high level

21   discussion about political philosophy.

22              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But he was talking about

23   contributions in that context.            That's quite clear.

24              MR. WAXMAN:       He -- with all due respect,

25   Justice Kennedy, I don't think that there was any

 1   distinction whatsoever in that time between the

 2   distinction that this Court came to understand as a

 3   result of FECA, and its adjudication of FECA and that --

 4   really the prehistory of Taft-Hartley, between

 5   contributions expenditures.

 6               For this reason, Justice Kennedy, was that

 7   what Root said was the idea -- and I am quoting now from

 8   his speech which is also partly reprinted in this

 9   Court's opinion in McConnell -- the idea is to prevent

10   the great companies, the great aggregations of wealth

11   from using corporate funds directly or indirectly to

12   send members of the legislature to these halls in order

13   to vote for their protection and the advancement of

14   their interests as against those of the public.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Great aggregations of

16   wealth.   The brief by the Chamber of Commerce, the

17   amicus brief by the Chamber of Commerce points out that

18   96 percent of its members employ less than 100 people.

19   These are not aggregations of great wealth.            You are not

20   talking about the railroad barons and the rapacious

21   trusts of the Elihu Root era; you are talking mainly

22   about small business corporations.

23               MR. WAXMAN:       Justice Scalia, I take your

24   point and I think you have made this point forceful lily

25   many times before.    A unanimous court in National Right

 1   to Work Committee concluded that Congress was entitled

 2   to make the judgment that it would treat in order to

 3   address this root evil, a problem of such concern that

 4   it goes to the very foundation of the democratic

 5   republican exercise, that is, the notion of integrity in

 6   representative government.

 7               Now this -- this case, of course, is not a

 8   case --

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't understand that

10   answer.   I mean, if that's what you were concerned

11   about, what Elihu Root was concerned about, you could

12   have said all corporations that have a net worth of more

13   than, you know, so much or whatever.                   That is not what

14   Congress did.   It said all corporations.

15               MR. WAXMAN:       Right.         And Justice Scalia, if

16   a small corporation or even any corporation of any sort

17   wants to bring an as-applied challenge to 441b or a

18   State law analogue and say, you know, I am not the

19   problem that Theodore Roosevelt and Elihu Root was

20   addressed at; there isn't a compelling interest because

21   I only have three employees and $8,000 in my bank

22   account, that's fine.      But what is extraordinary, truly

23   extraordinary, given the sentiments that underlay the

24   Tillman Act and the Taft-Hartley Act is that we would be

25   having a discussion today about the constitutionality of

 1   a law that has been on the books forever when no party,

 2   no corporation, has ever raised the challenge.                  I well

 3   recall --

 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You say it's been on --

 5   it's been on the books forever.             But, No. 1, the

 6   phenomenon of -- of television ads where we get

 7   information about scientific discovery and -- and

 8   environment and transportation issues from corporations

 9   who after all have patents because they know something,

10   that -- that is different.         And the -- the history you

11   applied apply to contributions, not to those kinds of

12   expenditures.

13               MR. WAXMAN:      Justice Kennedy, first of all,

14   I -- I think it is actually true that patents are owned

15   by individuals and not corporations.                  But be that as it

16   may, there is no doubt -- I am not here saying that this

17   Court should reconsider Bellotti on first principles any

18   more than I am saying that it shouldn't consider Austin

19   on first principles.    Corporations can and do speak

20   about a wide range of public policy issues, and since

21   the controlling opinion was issued in Wisconsin Right to

22   Life, the -- the kind of campaign-related speech that

23   corporations can't engage in, in the pre-election period

24   is limited to the functional equivalent of expressed

25   advocacy and nothing else.

 2   about 100 years and 50 years is perplexing.              It sounds

 3   like the sort of sound bites that you hear on TV.              The

 4   -- the fact of the matter is that the only cases that

 5   are being -- that may possibly be reconsidered are

 6   McConnell and Austin.        And they don't go back 50 years,

 7   and they don't go back 100 years.

 8              MR. WAXMAN:          My point here is, Justice Alito

 9   -- and I don't mean to be -- to be demeaning this Court

10   with sound bites.     The point is that what -- Austin was,

11   to be sure, the very first case in which this Court had

12   to decide -- actually had to decide whether or not the

13   prohibition on corporate treasury funded campaign speech

14   could properly be limited and was supporting by a

15   compelling interest.       All I am suggesting -- and I hope

16   that if you take nothing else from my advocacy today it

17   will be this -- is that we have here a case in which the

18   Court has asked a question that essentially goes to the

19   bona fides, that is, the factual predicates of the

20   interests that have been viewed as compelling in Austin,

21   in MCFL, in McConnell itself, whether you call it the

22   corrosive effect of corporate wealth, whether you call

23   it, quote, "shareholder protection" --

24              JUSTICE ALITO:             And my point is that there

25   is nothing unusual whatsoever about a case in which a


                                        74

 1   party before the Court says, my constitutional rights

 2   were violated, and there is no prior decision of this

 3   Court holding that what was done is constitutional.                        And

 4   in that situation is it an answer to that argument that

 5   this has never been challenged before?                     The Court has

 6   never held that it was unconstitutional?                     It has been

 7   accepted up until this point by the general public that

 8   this is -- that this is constitutional?                     No, that is not

 9   regarded as an answer to that question.

10                 MR. WAXMAN:       Mr. Olson is -- was quite

11   right -- either Mr. Olson or Mr. Abrams, I find it so

12   difficult to tell the two apart.                 One of them was

13   saying, well, it's, you know -- yes, I think in response

14   to Justice Sotomayor's question, you know, about there

15   is no factual record here.            There is absolutely nothing

16   in this case.

17                 And the response was, well, it's the

18   government's burden.       The government has to prove that

19   any restriction that it imposes passes strict scrutiny.

20                 Fair enough, but the question has to be

21   raised.     The issue has to be raised.                  If the -- if

22   Austin, Justice Alito, or the compelling interests that

23   Austin and McConnell relied on were forthrightly

24   challenged in a case, the government would have the

25   option --

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, Mr. Waxman,

 2   the government did have that opportunity, and the

 3   government compiled a record.            And when the Citizens

 4   United abandoned that position -- you are quite right,

 5   they changed their course -- the government and the

 6   district court complained that it had to go to all this

 7   work to develop this record, and yet we hear nothing

 8   about what the record showed.

 9               MR. WAXMAN:       Well, that's because the

10   ultimate -- I assume I have your permission to answer.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Go ahead.

12               MR. WAXMAN:       The -- the only challenges that

13   were litigated in the district court -- and they largely

14   were related to disclosure -- were very direct

15   as-applied challenges that had -- that did nothing

16   whatsoever to implicate the foundation of McConnell or

17   Austin.   And all I'm saying is, if you want to re-

18   examine the predicates, the existence and magnitude of

19   interests that Congress has, going back a -- whether

20   it's 60 years or 100 years, and courts, whether it has

21   been the actual rationale of the decision or a predicate

22   of the rationale of the decision, you ought to do it in

23   a case where the -- where the issue is squarely

24   presented so that the government can do what it did in

25   McConnell and in another context in Michigan v. Grutter

 5                 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

 6                     ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

 7                 MR. OLSON:      Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 8   The words that I would leave with this Court are the

 9   Solicitor General's.       The government's position has

10   changed.   The government's position has changed as to

11   what media might be covered by congressional power to

12   censor and -- and ban speech by corporations.                  Now we

13   learn, contrary to what we heard in March, that books

14   couldn't be prohibited but pamphlets could be

15   prohibited.    We also learn --

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But that's not -- the --

17   the statute that we are involved in, in this case does

18   not cover those.

19                 MR. OLSON:      Unless they are engaged in,

20   quote, "expressed advocacy."             And the other way in which

21   the government has changed its position, if I listened

22   carefully, is what type of corporation might be covered.

23   The government now says that it wouldn't -- the -- the

24   FEC is now willing to recede from its regulations which

25   explicitly covered this corporation, and I don't know as


                                       77

 1   I stand here today what kind of corporations the

 2   government would choose to prosecute.

 3              Remember, the Federal Election Commission,

 4   which didn't even have a quorum and couldn't function at

 5   all for six months during the important election year of

 6   2008 --

 7              JUSTICE STEVENS:            If the FEC chooses to

 8   prosecute only those who do not -- who do not rely

 9   exclusively on individual contributions.

10              MR. OLSON:       Well, that's your question from

11   before.

12              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Yes.      I want to see he

13   gets it.

14              MR. OLSON:       And that -- (a), it wouldn't --

15   this corporation accepted a small amount, $2,000 out of

16   -- out of the funding of this, so that wouldn't solve

17   the problem for my corporation, my client's corporation.

18              JUSTICE STEVENS:            But it would solve it for

19   the advertising, and there are two things.               There is the

20   long Hillary document and the advertisements.               It would

21   cover those.

22              MR. OLSON:       If -- but the --

23              JUSTICE STEVENS:            And they are the only --

24   only ones that clearly violate the statute.

25              MR. OLSON:       My point is that the overbreadth


                                     78
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   in this statute -- that solves the problem by saying

 2   that corporations still can't speak, and if you don't

 3   have anything to do with them, you -- you -- they wear a

 4   scarlet letter that says "C."           If you accept one dollar

 5   of funding, then you had better make darn sure that when

 6   a check comes in for $100 from the XYZ hardware store in

 7   the neighborhood, that it wasn't a corporation that you

 8   used to -- to make a documentary about a candidate.

 9              The other way in which the government's

10   position has changed is we do not know --

11              JUSTICE STEVENS:            Does that mean you

12   disagree with the NRA's submission?

13              MR. OLSON:       I -- I submit that it does not

14   solve the problem.     It would lead exactly --

15              JUSTICE STEVENS:            If it solved the problem

16   as it would for the advertising, would it be an

17   appropriate solution?

18              MR. OLSON:       It -- I can't say that it -- if

19   it solved the problem, because it doesn't solve the

20   problem of prohibiting all corporate speech.           And I

21   think -- and I am submitting, Justice Stevens, that that

22   is unconstitutional.     I think what you are suggesting is

23   that some limitation that -- what -- what you were

24   suggesting is not a whole lot different than PAC.              It

25   would lead, I think Justice Breyer was saying, to an


                                     79

 1   accounting nightmare.      It would be --

 2              JUSTICE STEVENS:             But it is a nightmare that

 3   Congress endorsed in the Snowe-Jeffords Amendment.

 4              MR. OLSON:        Well, but the -- but the

 5   Wellstone Amendment sort of in a sense repealed it.

 6              JUSTICE STEVENS:             We have held the Wellstone

 7   Amendment literally cannot be applied.

 8              MR. OLSON:        Well --

 9              JUSTICE STEVENS:             We unanimously held that.

10              MR. OLSON:        I think what -- what the -- my

11   response is that that does not solve the problem of

12   inhibiting --

13              JUSTICE STEVENS:             You do not endorse the

14   NRA's position?

15              MR. OLSON:        No, we don't Justice Stevens,

16   and -- and, as I said, it would not exempt my clients.

17   The other -- the third way in which the government has

18   changed its position is its rationale for this

19   prohibition in the first place.              Is it corruption?        Is

20   it shareholder protection?          Is it equalization?

21              There was some dispute.                     I heard the

22   Solicitor General say that the equalization rationale

23   was something the government disavowed.                    It wasn't what

24   Austin said, the government -- the government said.                    And

25   I --

 1              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Justice Marshall said

 2   that he was not trying to equalize all voices in the

 3   political process.     He has a sentence that says, well,

 4   that's not what the rationale of this case is.

 5              MR. OLSON:        I don't -- I don't -- with all

 6   due respect Justice Ginsburg, the words that jump out at

 7   me are the words from page 665 that say the desire to

 8   counterbalance those advantages unique to the corporate

 9   forum is the state's compelling interest in this case.

10   That sounds to me like -- like equalization.

11              I don't know.          I am -- I am representing an

12   individual who wants to speak about something that's the

13   most important thing that goes on in our democracy.              I'm

14   told it's a felony.      I am not -- and I -- I don't know

15   what the rational basis is.           It's overbroad.   Now I hear

16   about this shareholder -- protecting shareholders.

17   There is not a word in the congressional record with

18   respect to the -- which was before the Court in the

19   McConnell case about protecting shareholders.           As the

20   Bellotti case pointed out, that would be overbroad

21   anyway because this statute applies to every --

22              JUSTICE BREYER:            Actually I read that

23   sentence that you just read as meaning the corporation

24   is an artificial person in respect to which the State

25   creates many abilities and capacities, and the State is


                                      81

 1   free also to create some disabilities and capacities.

 2   Not a statement about balancing rich and poor.

 3               MR. OLSON:      Well, it -- it -- it strikes me

 4   that it is, because it follows the words that say

 5   corporations are given unique advantages to aggregate

 6   wealth and that we must take away that advantage by

 7   equalizing the process.      I think that's the plain

 8   meaning but my point I guess is -- if I may finish this

 9   sentence.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Briefly.

11               MR. OLSON:      My point is that the government

12   here has an overbroad statute that covers every

13   corporation irrespective of what its stockholders think,

14   irrespective of whether it's big, and whether it's

15   general -- a big railroad baron or anything like that,

16   and it doesn't know, as it stands here today two years

17   after this movie was offered for -- to the public for

18   its view, what media might be covered, what type of

19   corporation might be covered and what compelling

20   justification or narrow standard would be applied to

21   this form of speech.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, counsel.

23   The case is submitted.
