 6            ORAL ARGUMENT OF LINDSAY C. HARRISON

 7                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                 MS. HARRISON:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 9   and may it please the Court:

10                 In 1996 Congress provided in 8 U.S.C.

11   1252(b)(3)(B) that courts may stay an alien's order of

12   removal pending appeal.         The question in this case is

13   whether Congress intended that temporary stays of

14   removal be governed by the normal standards applicable

15   to States or instead by the special standard that

16   Congress separately set forth for injunctions in

17   1252(f)(2).    There are three primary reasons why the

18   normal stay standard should apply.

19                 First, Congress used different words to

20   describe these different forms of relief, "stay" in

21   (b)(3)(B) and "enjoin" in (f)(2).                 Congress used

22   different words because it saw these forms of relief as

23   different.

24                 Second and related, a stay is in fact

25   different from an injunction.              It is a temporary vacatur


                                         3

 1   of a court or vacancy order pending review.                   It is not

 2   directed at a party and does not order a party to take

 3   action.

 4               Third, even an alien with a strong

 5   likelihood of success on the merits who will face

 6   certain persecution if deported cannot get a stay under

 7   the (f)(2) standard, a result Congress should not be

 8   presumed to authorize in the absence of a clear

 9   statement to that effect.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Counsel, I'm not

11   sure this matters very much, But do you know if -- are

12   stays usually granted in this type of case?                   Not this

13   type of case:     A removal case as opposed to an

14   application to reopen.

15               MS.     HARRISON:         In a removal case stays are

16   granted in eight circuits only if the individual meets

17   the traditional --

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   No, no, I understand

19   it.   I am just saying if you happen to know empirically

20   if most people who are facing removal get a stay.

21               MS. HARRISON:            I have seen no empirical --

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Okay.

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Did the government -- I

24   thought the government said that an empirical database

25   would be the Ninth Circuit, which has the more generous

 1   rule.

 2                 MS. HARRISON:          That's --

 3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            My understanding is that

 4   stays are granted in a very high percentage of those

 5   cases.     I would be curious to know, A, the percentage of

 6   the cases in which it's granted; and B, the percentage

 7   of those cases that are ultimately decided in favor of

 8   the government?

 9                 MS. HARRISON:          The data that I believe Your

10   Honor is referencing was the rate at which petitions for

11   review are filed, and not the rate at which stays are

12   granted or filed.

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, is it true that

14   there are more petitions filed in the courts with the

15   more generous standards?

16                 MS. HARRISON:          Again, I have not seen a

17   comprehensive study.        There are more petitions filed in

18   the Ninth Circuit, but there is no evidence of the cause

19   of that.    And -- and I think it's important that stays

20   are in fact denied under the traditional standard,

21   because what that demonstrates is that the traditional

22   standard effectuates Congress's purpose of passing

23   IIRIRA and eliminating the automatic stay and making it

24   in fact more difficult for an individual to obtain a

25   stay on appeal.     That -- the traditional standard does

 1   have real teeth and it does not result in an automatic

 2   stay.

 3              JUSTICE GINSBURG:               How many years ago was

 4   the automatic stay eliminated?               When did this -- the

 5   current law come into effect?

 6              MS. HARRISON:            At the same time in 1996.

 7   Congress both eliminated the automatic stay, and it

 8   replaced it with the language in 1252(b)(3)(B), which

 9   indicates that a stay is not automatic unless a court

10   orders otherwise.    And -- now, that language was nearly

11   identical to the language that had previously existed,

12   where a stay was automatic except for aggravated felons.

13   For aggravated felons, the statute provided that a stay

14   was not automatic unless a court otherwise directs.                        And

15   courts had interpreted that language to provide for

16   application of the traditional stay standards.

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Is it possible in

18   this case to kind of split the baby?                     You have a more

19   appealing fact case than is typical, because yours

20   involves a denial of a motion to reopen and doesn't

21   really go to the ultimate merits.                 Most of the petitions

22   I think do go to the ultimate merits, and it's easier to

23   see that (f)(2) may apply there as opposed to your case.

24              Now, is there a coherent way of saying that?

25   In other words, in your type of case, you apply the


                                         6

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   traditional stay standards, but in a case where the

 2   issue that is before the court is whether to order

 3   removal or not on the merits, the other approach

 4   applies.

 5               MS. HARRISON:          I think that the way to do

 6   that, Your Honor, is to apply (f)(2) where the alien is

 7   seeking permanent relief.          And where the alien is

 8   seeking to enjoin his or her removal, the (f)(2)

 9   standard makes a lot of sense, but the (f)(2) standard

10   doesn't contain any predictive language.                 It doesn't --

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, but that's

12   just really saying the way that you avoid that is to say

13   you win across the board.          I mean, it -- my

14   understanding is that in situations in which they are

15   going to be seeking an injunction to enjoin are quite

16   limited.   They are typically just seeking to vacate the

17   legal order.

18               MS. HARRISON:          And if you then apply the

19   (f)(2) standard across the board to stay requests, then

20   what that would mean is that the court of appeals is

21   deciding the merits twice:          It's deciding it at the

22   outset when determining whether or not the individual is

23   entitled to a stay; and then it's deciding it again when

24   the court decides whether the individual's entitled to

25   have the order of removal vacated.                 And that just


                                        7

 1   doesn't seem like what Congress had in --

 2              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  No, I think I

 3   understand that point when they're seeking to have the

 4   order -- the removal order vacated.                     But here you are

 5   seeking the reopening of the proceedings, which I guess

 6   is a little different, isn't it, than the underlying

 7   decision on the merits?

 8              MS. HARRISON:           Technically, the order of

 9   removal is the order denying the motion to reopen, so

10   they are one and the same, in this case and in any case

11   where the petition for review is of an order of removal,

12   which is what the statute provides for.                    And I think

13   that point is very important --

14              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Is that right?        How

15   can that be?   I mean, you have an order of removal, and

16   then you move to reopen the proceedings.                    Aren't they

17   two separate things?

18              MS. HARRISON:           Well, the statute provides

19   that an order denying a motion to reopen is itself an

20   order of removal, and that it's consolidated with the

21   original order of removal on appeal.                    So that they

22   become one and the same case, and the order denying the

23   motion to reopen is the order of removal.

24              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Where does it say

25   that?

 1              MS. HARRISON:           I do not believe that it is

 2   in 1252 itself, and I don't have the citation for you.

 3   I'm sorry, Your Honor.

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Okay.

 5              MS. HARRISON:           Back to the point that it's

 6   important to recognize that the (f)(2) standard contains

 7   no predictive language, it doesn't allow a court to say,

 8   is this individual likely to succeed on the merits?             It

 9   says can this individual show, by clear and convincing

10   evidence, that the entry or execution of the removal

11   order is prohibited by law, not likely to show, not we

12   are likely to find.

13              And so if courts were required to apply this

14   standard at the stay stage, they would be deciding the

15   very same question twice.          They would be deciding both

16   the merits question of whether the individual removal

17   order is prohibited by law and also the stay question of

18   whether it should be stayed pending --

19              JUSTICE SCALIA:              That wouldn't be deciding

20   it the same way twice.       Initially, they would just have

21   to decide whether -- whether the alien has shown by

22   clear and convincing evidence that he should win, and if

23   they decide no, he hasn't, then at the merits stage they

24   have to decide which one prevails by a preponderance of

25   the evidence.   So it's really a different call the

 1   second time.

 2              MS. HARRISON:          Well, Your Honor, the

 3   government has stated in its brief that it believes

 4   these two standards to be virtually identical.              And in

 5   the event that a stay was granted, it would certainly

 6   render the merits decision superfluous because, if a

 7   stay was granted and you could meet this higher burden,

 8   then perforce you could meet the lower burden.

 9              JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's true.

10              MS. HARRISON:          And so, in that situation,

11   (b)(3)(B) would be superfluous.

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:            What do you claim that

13   (f)(2) covers, if it doesn't cover these stays?

14              MS. HARRISON:          It covers any time an alien

15   seeks an injunction, now, both in the courts of appeals

16   and in a district court case.

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How can that be?

18              MS. HARRISON:          Well, the Catholic Social

19   Services case is one example where individuals were

20   challenging the procedures whereby their legalization

21   applications were adjudicated under the Immigration

22   Reform and Control Act.       And in that case, they sought

23   injunctive relief as a class to enjoin their removal

24   pending that case and permanently, in fact, because they

25   said they were entitled to legalization, which was an

 1   amnesty statute.

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, that's --

 3   that's kind of a systemic challenge, but you wouldn't

 4   have a situation where you get an injunction in far more

 5   typical individual cases, right?

 6                MS. HARRISON:         Well, if an individual in

 7   that case, Your Honor, attempted to enjoin his or her

 8   removal, then the (f)(2) standard would certainly apply

 9   to that individual.     And there's -- there's a reason why

10   an individual couldn't have brought that challenge as

11   opposed to a class.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Why would he seek to enjoin

13   his removal when he is subject to a much lesser standard

14   when he just seeks to stay the removal?                 I mean, does he

15   have a bad lawyer or what?

16                MS. HARRISON:         Well, in that case, it would

17   be in a district court, which doesn't have supervisory

18   authority over the court of appeals -- I'm sorry --

19   over the BIA's order.      And so the district court

20   presumably couldn't stay an order that it wasn't

21   reviewing.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Why wouldn't he go to the

23   court of appeals, is the next question.

24                MS. HARRISON:         Well, he perhaps might, but

25   if there was a delay in the procedure or if there was

 1   some reason why --

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:               That's a fluke.     I mean,

 3   that is a flukey situation.              And I find it hard to

 4   believe that (f)(2) was meant to address just that.

 5              MS. HARRISON:             Well, it would be in any

 6   case, even in the court of appeals, where an individual

 7   sought an injunction as opposed to a stay.                 For example,

 8   if it was a situation like the Singh case in the Ninth

 9   Circuit, where there was a stay of removal in place, but

10   the agency was deporting the individual anyway.                Then

11   the individual would need to obtain an injunction, and

12   in fact that was essentially what the Ninth Circuit

13   ordered, was a remand for the imposition of an

14   injunction against --

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Also a fluke.    We don't

16   expect the -- the executive to ignore a stay.

17              MS. HARRISON:             No, Your Honor.      I think --

18              JUSTICE SOUTER:               I think it's a fluke, too,

19   but you gave -- to my recollection, I forget where it

20   was -- I think you gave citations to three or four cases

21   in which that actually happened.

22              MS. HARRISON:             The Singh case, Your Honor,

23   is one of those cases.         There's also the Lindstrom case

24   from the Seventh Circuit.            And it does happen that,

 1   reason, that the stay is not effective, and in that case

 2   an injunction would be.

 3              And I think, in order to address the Court's

 4   concern that (f)(2) is a fluke, it's important to take a

 5   look at where it appears in the statute and its context.

 6   Now, originally, the statute contained only (f)(1),

 7   which says that you cannot obtain injunctions as a

 8   class, but that individuals can obtain injunctions.

 9   There was no (f)(2).

10              The bill went to conference and then

11   Congress added in (f)(2), I think to make very clear

12   that, although they had carved out this exception in

13   (f)(1) for individual cases, that it was not to be

14   granted as a matter of course, that even in particular

15   cases, which is the subtitle of (f)(2), the standard

16   should be very strict.      And so I think Congress saw

17   itself as closing a potential hole here, because it had

18   created this opportunity to obtain an injunction as an

19   individual without articulating a standard.            Then

20   Congress went about articulating standard in (f)(2).

21   And it's a very high standard.

22              Now, Congress did not cross-reference

23   (b)(3)(B), which is the stay provision, and in fact, in

24   the transitional rules, what Congress did was it only --

25   it only included a provision that was identical to


                                      13
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   (b)(3)(B).   It did not include (f)(2) in the

 2   transitional rules, which -- all of which demonstrate

 3   that Congress did not see (f)(2) and (b)(3)(B) as

 4   related; they saw them as separate with (f)(2) governing

 5   injunctions and (b)(3)(B) governing stays.

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Maybe I'm missing

 7   something but -- and, again, I don't know which way this

 8   cuts, but the dispute strikes me as very academic as a

 9   practical matter:    Judges looking at whether someone is

10   likely to prevail on the merits versus judges looking at

11   whether the person has shown by clear and convincing

12   evidence that he shouldn't be removed.                   The judge that's

13   going to find one in one case, depending on the

14   standard, and the opposite in the same case I can't

15   visualize.

16                MS. HARRISON:          Well, the key I believe, Your

17   Honor, is the equities.         Now, the (f)(2) standard does

18   not permit consideration of the equities in determining

19   whether removal is prohibited by law.

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It doesn't?   You're

21   talking about equities or irreparable harm?

22                MS. HARRISON:          Both, Your Honor.

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Both standards?

24                MS. HARRISON:          Yes.

25                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Same thing.   And you


                                        14
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   cannot consider that at all under (f)(2)?                 There's no

 2   way in which the removal would be prohibited as a matter

 3   of law under provisions that are concerned, for example,

 4   about whether the person would be tortured or something

 5   like that?

 6                MS. HARRISON:         Well -- well, Your Honor,

 7   under the (f)(2) standard, take, for example, someone

 8   who had applied for asylum, and it was denied on a

 9   procedural technicality, and the question is:                    Was the

10   entry of the execution -- entry or execution of the

11   removal order prohibited by law?

12                That -- the issue of whether the

13   technicality was a -- was a correct finding or was not a

14   correct finding permits no consideration of whether or

15   not that individual, if they are deported, is going to

16   face persecution, torture, death, et cetera.                 Only under

17   the -- the traditional --

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Because the

19   objection is on this procedural matter?

20                MS. HARRISON:         Correct.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But if the objection

22   is that I am going to be tortured so you shouldn't order

23   my removal, he would be able to -- the court under

24   (f)(2) would be able to consider that, wouldn't it?

25                MS. HARRISON:         I don't believe so, Your


                                       15

 1   Honor, unless the very question that was being decided

 2   is whether the individual had met the -- met the

 3   standard for relief under the Convention Against

 4   Torture.     But there are also cases where an individual

 5   is seeking asylum, and there are questions about whether

 6   -- whether the persecution is on the basis of a

 7   protected class.

 8                 Now, the question there is not whether or

 9   not the person is likely to suffer irreparable harm if

10   they go back, but, rather, what is the basis on which

11   they may be entitled to asylum?                And so the Court in

12   Bohegan --

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Don't they get to

14   pursue that even after they are sent back?                   There are

15   provisions that -- that their case does not abate just

16   because they have been removed?

17                 MS. HARRISON:          That is true, Your Honor.

18   However, their case may abate because they are killed,

19   they are put in jail, they are not in a position to come

20   back to this country.        And that is why consideration of

21   the equities in this context is so critical and why

22   Congress would not have eliminated the equities from the

23   consideration without a very clear statement-

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I guess that's

25   why -- I guess that goes back to my earlier question,


                                         16
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   which is, I see that if they are killed the case is

 2   probably not in very good shape.               But -- but the

 3   situations in which they are likely to face that sort of

 4   difficulties upon removal it would seem to me are

 5   situations where the removal would be prohibited by law.

 6                MS. HARRISON:         Well, Your Honor, that was --

 7   the court of appeals would only be allowed to consider

 8   that if the question presented was whether they had

 9   proven that they were likely to be killed if they were

10   returned to the country.         But that often is not what --

11   the question that the court of appeals is deciding.

12                It is deciding a procedural question.                It is

13   deciding whether the persecution was on the basis of a

14   protected class, those sorts of considerations, which

15   are not the same question as:             Is this person likely to

16   be killed if they are returned?

17                That's why -- that's why the -- this Court

18   has held that unless Congress demonstrates very clearly

19   that it intends to take away the court's ability to

20   consider the equities, that we don't interpret

21   Congress's --

22                JUSTICE STEVENS:           Excuse me, but I'm not

23   following.   I have the same difficulty that perhaps the

24   Chief Justice is trying to get at.                 In the case where it

25   appears to the -- the judge that the -- that the alien


                                       17
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   would be murdered when he is returned, wouldn't his

 2   deportation be prohibited by law?

 3               MS. HARRISON:          Well, not always, Your Honor,

 4   if the question that the court was considering wasn't

 5   whether in fact the individual was going to be killed if

 6   returned.   If the question the court is considering is

 7   whether -- whether a crime he has committed subjects the

 8   individual to deportation, then the fact that that

 9   individual is going to be killed when he is returned to

10   the country is not part of the (f)(2) calculus.

11               And -- and I don't believe that the

12   government has -- has argued that the equities would be

13   part of the consideration.          The government has argued

14   that for legal -- for factual questions you need to

15   prove them by clear and convincing evidence, and for

16   legal questions you need to prove you are entitled to a

17   judgment as a matter of law.

18               Where the equities fall into that calculus

19   is -- is unclear, and I think they would only fall under

20   that calculus if the very question presented to the

21   court was that one.     And -- and then, moreover, when you

22   say --

23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             When you say "equities,"

24   is the fact that he has applied or his wife has applied

25   for adjustment of his status, is that an equity?

 1                 MS. HARRISON:         No, Your Honor, I don't

 2   believe that that itself would be an equity.                 But the

 3   fact that he does have a wife and he does have a young

 4   child in this country would be a permissible

 5   consideration in the equitable analysis, in the analysis

 6   of -- of irreparable harm that would come to him and his

 7   family.   The -- the basis for his motion to reopen was

 8   not the denial of adjustment -- of his adjustment of

 9   status.

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            It was changing

11   conditions.

12                 MS. HARRISON:         That's right, Your Honor.

13                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Alleged changing

14   conditions.

15                 MS. HARRISON:         Yes, Your Honor.

16                 And I also think that -- that it's important

17   to emphasize this Court's clear-statement rule, which is

18   that the court doesn't take for -- lightly statutes that

19   do not very, very clearly take away the power of the

20   courts to grant the stay, to grant an injunction.                And

21   if it's not very clear from the face of the statute that

22   that is what Congress intended, that the court will not

23   interpret as having done so.

24                 I also think that it's important to

25   emphasize that when Congress wanted to be expansive in


                                        19

 1   getting rid of forms of equitable relief, it was.                   In

 2   1252(e)(1)(A), for example, which if you would like to

 3   look appears on page 11a of the appendix to the gray

 4   brief, that's the provision where Congress limited the

 5   forms of equitable relief available to aliens facing

 6   removal in expedited situations.              And there Congress's

 7   language was very clear that:            No declaratory injunctive

 8   or other equitable relief.         There is no language of that

 9   sort in (f)(2); the same with (f)(1).

10              In that provision Congress said no court in

11   -- in a class situation can enjoin or restrain the

12   removal of an alien.     Not in (f)(2).                In (f)(2) Congress

13   only used the word "enjoin" in its omission of other

14   equitable relief, and its omission of restrain are

15   instructive.

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So you think

17   references to equitable relief and restrain are clear

18   enough to cover the Court's authority to grant a stay?

19              MS. HARRISON:          I don't believe that restrain

20   is, Your Honor, because I think restrain -- it's unclear

21   whether Congress is talking about a stay versus a

22   temporary injunction or a restraining order.                   I think

23   other equitable relief does capture stays, because we

24   don't deny that a stay is a form of equitable relief.

25   It's simply not an injunction, because it's not directed

 1   at a party, and it doesn't order a party to do

 2   something.

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Just to refresh my

 4   recollection, what -- what is the major difference

 5   between the standards that -- or the findings that the

 6   judge must make, (a) to grant a preliminary injunction

 7   and (b) to grant a stay?

 8                MS. HARRISON:          That has to be the same, Your

 9   Honor, in the usual situation, because both arise at the

10   same stage in the proceedings where it makes sense that

11   the court would want to consider:                 What is the

12   likelihood that this person is going to succeed down the

13   road?    What -- what is the risk if I don't grant relief

14   at this stage?

15                But those two things are also treated

16   differently in the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure

17   in Rule 8 and also Rule 18, which governs only stays of

18   agency orders and not injunctions.

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            My -- my concern is that I

20   sense in this statute a congressional concern that stays

21   are too frequently granted.             And one thing we could do,

22   if we were to accept your view of the statute, is to

23   say:    And you must be very careful.

24                Well, the courts don't listen to that very

25   much.    And short of granting the -- accepting the


                                        21

 1   government's position, I don't know what you could do if

 2   there were a -- a submission and understanding that

 3   stays were being granted routinely and too frequently.

 4               MS. HARRISON:          Well, Your Honor, the -- the

 5   standard that Congress intended, the traditional one, is

 6   not a standard under which stays are -- are routinely

 7   granted.   They -- they have been denied in some of the

 8   very cases where the circuits decided whether (f)(2)

 9   applies or -- or whether the traditional standard

10   applies.

11               And this Court has given guidance, for

12   example, this term in Winter, that you have to -- not to

13   show some likelihood of -- of suffering or irreparable

14   harm, but you have to show a strong probability of

15   success on the merits, and you have to show a strong

16   probability of irreparable harm.               And so if down the

17   road it seems that courts are not faithfully

18   implementing that standard, then the Court could again

19   provide guidance to that effect.               But I don't think --

20               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That case -- this case

21   could come out the same.         If we remand and we say that

22   it's the traditional standards, this case might well

23   come out the same way.       The -- the court might say,

24   well, it doesn't make it under the traditional -- it

25   hasn't shown a likelihood of success on the merits.

 1                MS. HARRISON:         That's right, Your Honor.

 2   And -- and it very well could, and we feel we are

 3   entitled, obviously, to make that showing before the

 4   Fourth Circuit and have the Fourth Circuit apply the

 5   traditional test and make a decision under that test in

 6   the first instance.     But it is true that the State could

 7   be denied, and that there is no guarantee.              It is not

 8   automatic.

 9                And that's why I think before '96 Congress

10   used the same language for aggravated felons then that

11   it does now for everyone.          Because it knew that "unless

12   a court otherwise directs" doesn't mean automatic.               It

13   means that only where there -- there is a likelihood of

14   success and where the equities counsel in -- in favor of

15   the stay, it should be granted.

16                That's also how this Court interpreted that

17   similar language in Hilton in interpreting Federal Rule

18   of Appellate Procedure 239(c), which concerns a stay of

19   a grant of a writ of habeas corpus on appeal.             This

20   Court said that the traditional stay standard should

21   apply in that situation interpreting virtually the same

22   language that Congress then chose to use in this

23   provision, (e)(3)(B).

24                I would like to reserve the remainder of my

25   time.

 3             ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

 4                ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 5              GEN. KNEEDLER:          Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 6   it please the Court:

 7              The statutory text, context and background

 8   of section 1252(f)(2) all demonstrate that that section

 9   applies to orders granting a stay of removal pending a

10   court of appeals decision on a petition for review.

11   Indeed, if section 1252(f)(2) does not apply to such an

12   order barring removal, it is difficult to see what

13   function it would serve.

14              Now, Petitioner's counsel has suggested that

15   1252(f)(2) must be directed to what I think had been

16   referred to as fluke kind of district court orders, and

17   couldn't really be directed at the situation that we

18   have here. There are two very powerful responses to

19   that, if I may make them both.

20              The first is that subsection (f)(2), which

21   appear on page 14a of our brief refers, it says no court

22   shall enjoin the removal, et cetera, under this section,

23   meaning that the provision is specifically directed to

24   court orders that are entered as part of the proceedings

25   on judicial review of final orders under section 1252.

 1   It's not -- it's not principally directed at collateral

 2   orders that might arise in some other class action or

 3   some other sort of suit.

 5   gives, the two or three cases, properly examples under

 6   this section, in your --

 7               GEN. KNEEDLER:          Well, I think there were two

 8   different types of examples that she gave, if I may. I

 9   think the first one was a situation where a Department

10   of Homeland Security officer might have erroneously

11   carried out an order of removal not realizing that there

12   was a -- a stay entered.

13               JUSTICE SOUTER:            May I interrupt you just a

14   second?   When I meant examples, I meant the cited cases.

15   There were two or three cited cases.

16               GEN. KNEEDLER:          The -- the cited cases, we

17   don't think, are examples of this. (F)(2) was not at

18   issue in those -- in those cases.                The question in

19   several of them was whether the separate provision

20   1252(g), which this Court discussed in the American-Arab

21   case, whether that applied, and there was at least one

22   other case, it involved the transitional rules under

23   which (f)(2) doesn't apply.

24               But I think the more fundamental answer to

25   your point was the second point that I was -- that I was

 1   going to make. There are -- there are three provisions

 2   of section 1252 that make unmistakably clear that

 3   Congress did not intend any challenge to a final order

 4   of removal, any form of judicial review which would

 5   include an injunction to take place outside of 1252

 6   itself. And 1252(a)(1) provides the judicial review

 7   shall be pursuant to chapter 158 of -- and that's on

 8   page 1a of the brief -- shall be pursuant to chapter 158

 9   of title 28, the Hobbs Judicial Review Act.

10              And then (a)(5), which is on page 4a of our

11   brief, says notwithstanding any other provision of law,

12   a petition for review filed with an appropriate court is

13   the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of the

14   removal order.    Unless there be any doubt, the last

15   sentence the in that section says for purposes of this

16   entire chapter.    Any time there is a reference to

17   judicial review, it refers to any sort of statutory or

18   nonstatutory provision.

19              So any time an alien would try to get an

20   injunction in any form of judicial review, Congress has

21   expressed barred it not only by this, but then also by

22   subsection (b)(9).

23              JUSTICE BREYER:               On that particular point,

24   just specifically -- this is awfully complicated and you

25   have had to go through it pretty quickly, and so have I.

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   All right.

 2                So, it seems to me, looking at these three

 3   sections, as soon as you get to (a)(2), it says certain

 4   matter are not subject to judicial review, and it

 5   includes 1225(b)(1), which I take it is the case where

 6   somebody comes in, knocks at our door, and the

 7   immigration judge says good-bye and he says, no, no, I

 8   am entitled to be a refugee or asylum.

 9                Now, we look at that, it says in there it's

10   subsection (e) gives you judicial review of that. Now we

11   look at the thing you cited which is (5) -- (a)(5), and

12   you read it completely correctly, but you left out these

13   words "except as provided in subsection (e)."

14                So now we go to subsection (e). And lo and

15   behold, what is subsection (e) talking about, but just

16   the case I have mentioned. It talks about -- it talks

17   about judicial review for orders under 1225(b)(1).      Now,

18   those are the people who knock at the door and they want

19   asylum. And there is some procedures for them.

20                So, now we look at (e) to see what are the

21   procedures for them.      And lo and behold, right there in

22   (2), it says you can have a habeas corpus procedure as

23   to certain matters, whether he is an alien, whether he

24   has been admitted as a refugee, et cetera. So it says

25   there are some you can have habeas corpus.


                                       27
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                           Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 So I imagine a person who has been ordered

 2   removed under (e). All right.                Now it says you can have

 3   a habeas corpus and now the judge says good-bye. And

 4   they go to a reviewing court, which is going to be a

 5   habeas corpus court, and that court decides, the alien

 6   is right, I am going to issue an injunction.

 7                 Now, just in case he's thinking that, in the

 8   very next section (f), what we have are two provisions,

 9   (f)(1) that says if his case is a case involving mass

10   action against the whole thing, you can't enter an

11   injunction.

12                 And then we look at (2), and it says if his

13   is just a normal case, you can't enter an injunction

14   unless it meets this specific standard. So I looked at

15   that. And I admit this is pretty quick, and I thought

16   it's (e) and it's (f), and (f) is dealing with (e),

17   (f)(2). And it makes perfect sense. They don't want a

18   habeas corpus judge telling that immigration judge what

19   to do with the guy knocking on the door and saying "I

20   need asylum," unless they meet clear and present

21   danger -- clear and -- whatever it is, clear and

22   present -- yeah.

23                 Okay.    Now, I will admit I read that

24   quickly. And therefore, I am probably missing something.

25   And I don't expect you necessarily to be an expert, but

 1   can you do your best to tell me what I am missing or if

 2   you think I might be right?

 3              GEN. KNEEDLER:          Yes, if I could.        1225(b)(1)

 4   governs the special -- what is called expedited removal.

 5   It's a special procedure, as you identified, for people

 6   essentially knocking at the door, and it has very

 7   limited review, as you suggested.               Almost everything is

 8   unreviewable except possibility of asylum.

 9              But it's -- that is the only provision for

10   district court review. It's the, shall we say,

11   functional equivalent of a petition for review in the

12   court of appeals and everybody else. Congress just

13   decided to have two different -- two separate

14   procedures, and I think for 1225(b)(1) it's really a

15   carryover orders of exclusion prior to 1996.

16              JUSTICE BREYER:            What it says here

17   specifically is it says habeas proceedings.

18              GEN. KNEEDLER:          Yes, it does -- it does

19   say -- it does say habeas, but (f) -- there is no

20   suggestion that (f), either (1), which is general

21   application, or (f)(2) in particular is limited to

22   subsection (e). It -- it speaks of any injunction.

23              And that is instructive because the term

24   "injunction" is used in the Hobbs Judicial Review Act to

25   describe an interlocutory order by a court of appeals on


                                      29
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   judicial review that suspends the enforcement of an

 2   agency order pending judicial review.                      And we quote the

 3   Hobbs Judicial Review Act in our brief.

 4                 And as I mentioned before, that is very

 5   important to understand here, because Congress

 6   provided -- other than the habeas review for this

 7   special category, Justice Breyer, Congress provided that

 8   judicial review in the norm is in the court of appeals

 9   pursuant to the Hobbs Act. And if you look at the Hobbs

10   Act provision for interlocutory stays, it refers to

11   interlocutory relief as an injunction.                     It uses the

12   word --

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, let me add one other

14   thing, because all I am trying to do is find some work

15   for this section (f)(2) to do.                And I think I found

16   some.     And I think what you say is wait a minute, we

17   agree it's like habeas.          But and I think it would be

18   like an exclusion order rather than a removal order.

19                 And I did notice previously when it talks

20   about 1225, sometimes it uses the word "exclusion" and

21   sometimes it says "removal." But if you were that

22   district habeas judge and you get a thing saying

23   removal, you don't really vacate it.                      I think what you

24   had do is order an injunction against its enforcement.

25   Here I don't know --


                                         30
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              GEN. KNEEDLER:            I think the habeas court

 2   would have the authority -- would have the authority to

 3   vacate just as -- just as a court of appeals would have

 4   the authority to vacate.

 5              But my basic point is that both of them are

 6   forms of judicial review.           And if this heightened

 7   injunction standard applies to the form of judicial

 8   review that Congress has decided to leave in habeas,

 9   then there is no reason to imagine why Congress wouldn't

10   want the same injunctive standard to apply to somebody

11   who is seeking judicial review in the normal way, in the

12   court of appeals, especially since Congress used the

13   word "injunction" to describe this very sort of

14   interlocutory relief under the Hobbs Judicial Review Act

15   when -- when a person seeks judicial review in a -- in a

16   court of appeals.

17              And this conforms to the ordinary meaning of

18   the word which is "enjoin," which is to prohibited

19   something, to require a party to abstain from carrying

20   out an act. That's exactly what a stay of removal does.

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   Do you -- do you

22   agree with your friend that the basic difference between

23   your two positions is that under the stay factors you

24   are allowed to consider irreparable harm but are not

25   allowed to consider that under (f)(2).

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               GEN. KNEEDLER:          No, I think (f)(2) -- (f)(2)

 2   is -- is a necessary condition for granting relief.               It

 3   doesn't -- it doesn't eliminate the requirement that an

 4   alien show -- show harm from the -- from the removal.

 5   It's -- it's a condition --

 6               JUSTICE SOUTER:            What difference would it

 7   make?   I mean, if he can satisfy the clear and

 8   convincing standard, which is tantamount to saying that

 9   on final judgment I win, hands down, what need is there

10   to -- to go into irreparable harm?

11               GEN. KNEEDLER:          And that -- and that -- that

12   -- that may well be.      I think it may well be in the

13   typical case.   If I -- if I could just --

14               JUSTICE SOUTER:            But -- but -- but that's --

15   no, but in any case, if he's got to show by clear and

16   convincing evidence that he is going to have success on

17   the merits, I don't see any point in any case of going

18   into irreparable harm.       If he goes into irreparable harm

19   without the clear and convincing standard, he loses.              If

20   he satisfies the clear and convincing standard, there is

21   nothing for irreparable harm considerations to -- to add

22   to -- to the mix of factors.

23               GEN. KNEEDLER:          Well, as we understand the

24   reference to clear and convincing evidence, and

25   admittedly it's not entirely clear how Congress intended


                                       32
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that standard to apply in this context.                 As we

 2   understand it it is -- it is a standard of review

 3   slightly more favorable to the alien than the

 4   substantial evidence review standard, which is what

 5   would apply -- one final --

 6               JUSTICE SOUTER:            It's certainly more than a

 7   preponderance?

 8               GEN. KNEEDLER:          Yes.       But -- but in no

 9   event, even on review of the final order, is the court

10   reviewing for a preponderance of the evidence; the court

11   is reviewing the case on the administrative record under

12   the substantial evidence test, in which case the court

13   at final judgment cannot set aside the -- the agency

14   order, except -- unless it finds that no reasonable

15   factfinder could conclude that the order should stand.

16   That's the substantial evidence test.

17               JUSTICE SOUTER:            But the ultimate -- the

18   ultimate standard to which they look is a preponderance

19   standard.   In other words, the substantial evidence

20   standard is keyed to what a reasonable factfinder could

21   find reasonably, based upon substantial evidence.                 Is

22   the substantial evidence sufficient for such a

23   factfinder to find by a preponderance that this person

24   has failed to meet, or, put it the other way around,

25   that the factfinder has unreasonably failed to find that


                                       33
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the Petitioner has met the standard?

 2               So ultimately you are talking about a

 3   preponderance standard, which is -- which is the key,

 4   isn't that correct?

 5               GEN. KNEEDLER:          That -- that is -- the court

 6   -- you are correct in the sense that the court is

 7   reviewing to see whether substantial evidence supports

 8   the IJ's determination by a preponderance of the

 9   evidence.   But (f)(2) is written in terms of the sort of

10   showing that the alien must make to the court, and --

11   and not -- not what he would have made to the IJ.                   And

12   as -- and as we read it, as we try to apply the language

13   in the context of a stay, we thing that means that the

14   alien must show something a little bit short of -- of

15   the substantial evidence, that no reasonable factfinder

16   could find it, at least clear and convincing evidence

17   that as -- that the IJ was incorrect or that the alien

18   has a successful case.

19               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Are there other cases in

20   which clear and convincing -- the clear and convincing

21   standard applies to appellate courts?                   It seems to me

22   clear and convincing is more appropriate for a factual

23   determination at the trial court level.

24               GEN. KNEEDLER:          It -- it -- it ordinarily

25   is.   And that --and that's why the phrasing, as I was


                                       34
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   trying to discuss with Justice Souter, I think, is a

 2   little awkward.   Another possible way to think about it,

 3   and this may be what Congress was really driving at,

 4   when it was -- when it was saying clear and convincing

 5   evidence, it really meant a clear and convincing

 6   showing; that the -- that the courts shouldn't take this

 7   too casually.

 8                As we point out in our brief, the Second

 9   Circuit has a standard that the alien just has to show

10   more than a negligible likelihood of success on the

11   merits to prevail.      Well, that -- that's way below what

12   even the traditional standard would be.                   So it's

13   possible to read clear and convincing evidence as really

14   driving at clear and convincing showing, which is

15   language that is -- that is somewhat reminiscent of what

16   this Court has said for preliminary injunctions

17   generally.

18                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So I take it at

19   least in the Seventh Circuit these things are usually

20   granted?

21                GEN. KNEEDLER:           They're -- uh -- we do not

22   have empirical data, and I wish we did, on the

23   percentage, but they are -- in the Ninth Circuit in our

24   experience -- again we don't have percentages, but they

25   are granted quite frequently.

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But the standard is

 2   probable success on the merits, and that's not an easy

 3   standard.    Irreparable harm and probable success on the

 4   merits, both.

 5                GEN. KNEEDLER:           Well, if -- if the courts

 6   actually applied that standard, there would at least be

 7   some improvement in the stay standards, but the courts

 8   sometimes apply a sliding scale, where they say if there

 9   is -- you know, a serious question and a showing -- a

10   showing of substantial harm would be sufficient.                       Well,

11   this Court has twice reaffirmed in the last term, in the

12   last term --

13                JUSTICE BREYER:             What are we supposed to do?

14   What would you had do?         Suppose you are a district court

15   judge and at 2:00 in the afternoon on Friday a petition

16   comes in and it's from someone who says, "I'm going to

17   be on the 5:00 airplane to Hong Kong and I have a real

18   case here.     I think I am right."              And he has eight pages

19   attached and you read through that.                       And you say, "He

20   has a point.     Now how good this point is, I don't know.

21   So I would like to put this -- I would like to have

22   everybody in here on Monday, and then I could figure it

23   out."

24                Now, that probably happens.                      Now what is

25   worrying me about your position on this -- which,


                                         36

 1   although most -- I think every circuit is against you on

 2   this, except for this one.

 3               GEN. KNEEDLER:          And there are others.

 4               JUSTICE BREYER:            And it seems to me that

 5   would make it impossible for the district judge to do,

 6   because the district judge cannot honestly say that it's

 7   clear and convincing that this man is going to win.                    All

 8   he knows is he has a point and he would like to hear

 9   more about it and he doesn't want him on the airplane

10   three hours from now from Hong Kong.                    So I -- so how is

11   it supposed to work?

12               GEN. KNEEDLER:          Well, it would be the court

13   of appeals, not the district judge.

14               JUSTICE BREYER:            Right.

15               GEN. KNEEDLER:          But it -- we believe that

16   that -- that 1252(f)(2) allows a court to take the time

17   necessary to rule meaningfully on the stay application.

18   We do not believe Congress intended to divest the court

19   of the ability to rule on the merits.                   It has a

20   substantive standard that the alien has to make a clear

21   and convincing -- has to show by clear and convincing

22   evidence.   It presupposes that the alien has to make a

23   showing; therefore it presupposes that the court must be

24   able to evaluate that showing.              We also believe that it

25   presupposes that the government is permitted to respond

 1   to it.

 2                So we -- we do not object and have not

 3   objected in the lower courts to the courts taking

 4   sufficient time to -- to freeze the status quo by

 5   issuing a short stay if necessary to do that.

 6                Now, in the Eleventh Circuit, for example,

 7   which has operated under this heightened showing for

 8   some period of time, it tends to work out, because when

 9   a -- a -- a petition for review and stay application is

10   granted, the court contacts the Office of Immigration

11   Litigation which works with DHS to inform the court on

12   how soon the order might be issued, and then the court's

13   aware of how quickly it might act.

14                So -- so it wouldn't often be necessary for

15   the court to do it, but we did not challenge that

16   authority.

17                JUSTICE SOUTER:           But and -- and I applaud

18   the fact that you don't, but I don't know how you can do

19   it consistently with your view that "stay" in (b)(3)(B)

20   means the same thing as the "injunction" in (f) when

21   "injunction" in (f) is restricted as much as it is.

22                GEN. KNEEDLER:         Well, I --

23                JUSTICE SOUTER:           God bless you, but I don't

24   know how -- I don't know how under the statute, on your

25   reading of the statute, you -- you can do it.

 1              GEN. KNEEDLER:          There are two responses.

 2   One, we -- we think it is necessarily implicit in the

 3   statutory framework that Congress would have wanted the

 4   court to be able to rule on the interlocutory

 5   injunction, but the -- but the second point I think that

 6   -- that reinforces this proposition, again, if you go

 7   back to the Hobbs Judicial Review Act, it has a

 8   provision not only for interlocutory injunctions, which

 9   is what we're really talking about here, but a provision

10   for a temporary -- for a court to issue a temporary stay

11   upon a showing of irreparable injury to allow the status

12   quo to be maintained pending the court's ruling on the

13   interlocutory injunction.

14              JUSTICE SOUTER:            All right.       Then why

15   doesn't that provide the broader authority under

16   (b)(3)(B) stay provision that your friends on the other

17   side are arguing for?

18              GEN. KNEEDLER:          Well, it may -- that may

19   well be the right answer, is to read (b)(3)(B) --

20   (b)(3)(B)'s opening that -- which says a petition for

21   review does not in itself stay the order -- is very

22   similar to the language in the opening of 2349(b) which

23   is the interlocutory injunctive language of the Hobbs

24   Judicial Review Act.     It says the mere filing of the

25   petition doesn't stay or suspend the order.                It says


                                      39
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   stay or suspend the order, and it says stay, and then it

 2   says but a court may -- I forget the precise language --

 3   restrain or suspend the order reflecting pending

 4   judicial review; and it refers to that as an

 5   interlocutory injunction.

 6              But it says if the Petitioner shows that

 7   irreparable injury would occur before the court has a

 8   chance to rule even on the interlocutory injunction, it

 9   can issue what's called a temporary stay to maintain the

10   status quo until it can look at the -- at the -- at the

11   interim relief.

12              Well, if -- if that -- if that background

13   rule is not misplaced, that would allow for some

14   separation of the sort of emergency motion for a stay, a

15   hold fast sort of situation, for the court to be able to

16   evaluate the merits.      But when it gets to what the Hobbs

17   Act refers to as an injunction, then (f)(2) kicks in,

18   interlocutory injunction pending -- pending judicial

19   review.

20              So that would be -- that would be an

21   underlying statutory basis for allowing the court to --

22   to issue a temporary order to allow the -- to allow the

23   proceeding to go forward, but we think it should be done

24   in a timely way.   The Hobbs Judicial Review Act

25   contemplates a rather casual, up to 60 days that such a


                                       40
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   temporary stay should remain in effect.                  We think in

 2   many cases under the immigration laws the court should

 3   be able to act on the stay application more quickly than

 4   that.

 5                I did want -- I did also want to stress the

 6   -- the policy purposes that Justice Kennedy raised in --

 7   in an earlier question, and that is the -- the thrust-

 8   the whole thrust of the 1996 amendments to the

 9   Immigration Act was to expedite the removal of aliens,

10   particularly criminal aliens, but not all -- but all

11   aliens in fact.    And Congress did several things when it

12   did that.   It repealed the prior provision where that

13   said the mere filing of petition for review

14   automatically stayed the removal unless the courts

15   ordered -- ordered otherwise.              And it also repealed the

16   prior provision that said that the alien -- if the alien

17   left the country, including -- that was construed to

18   mean pursuant to deportation order, he could no longer

19   challenge the removal order outside the country.

20                Congress changed completely that and it said

21   you had can now challenge the order of removal from

22   outside the country, and it basically reversed the

23   presumption with respect to whether - whether the filing

24   of the petition for review stays -- stays the order of

25   removal.    Congress said, No, it does not unless the


                                        41
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   courts ordered otherwise.

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And you would expect the

 3   standard to be in the (b)(3)(B) provision.               It says that

 4   no automatic stay unless the court otherwise orders,

 5   period.    That's the end of it.

 6                So one wonders whether this would think that

 7   the normal standard for a stay would apply.              And then

 8   (f)(2) is separated by several pages and (f)(1) is

 9   dealing with something where we understand it.                 It says

10   no mass injunctions against the enforcement of a

11   provision.   But (2) is really puzzling what it relates

12   to, is it supposed to have some relationship to (1)?                1

13   says you can't enjoin the enforcement of a provision of

14   the law.

15                GEN. KNEEDLER:          Well, (f)(1) is directed at

16   -- in large part at programmatic challenges.              It

17   provides -- it prohibits courts from enjoining or

18   restraining the operation of part 4 of the INA which --

19   which is the provision that deals with deportation,

20   adjudication of deportation and exclusions and carrying

21   out those orders, which by the way we think is the

22   reason it says enjoin or restrain, because it's talking

23   about programmatic type actions, and restrain -- the

24   word restraint is sometimes used to be something in an

25   absolute prohibition, just -- just to limit it, whereas


                                        42
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   on "enjoin" is necessary under (f)(2) because it --

 2   because what is being enjoined or stayed is a vary

 3   discreet act.   You can have an injunction barring

 4   removal or -- or you don't.

 5              But I -- I think a further answer to your

 6   question, Justice Ginsburg, is that (f)(2) says under

 7   this section, which means that it is obviously referring

 8   to court orders entered in the course of -- of removal

 9   proceedings under section 1252, and when a court finally

10   gets to the merits in a petition for review in a court

11   of appeals, the court if it decides that there is a flaw

12   -- excuse me -- a legal flaw in the BIA or immigration

13   judge's decision, it vacates the decision and -- and --

14   and remands.

15              Injunctions are not necessary in that -- in

16   that kind of review, so-

17              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  So in this -- in

18   this case involving a denial of a motion to reopen, what

19   the court of appeals is supposed to do is to look ahead

20   and see if this person has shown by clear and convincing

21   evidence that they shouldn't be removed; and if they

22   haven't, then their -- their removal can't be blocked,

23   even for example if the court of appeals thinks, well,

24   yes, they should have gotten their motion to reopen.

25              GEN. KNEEDLER:           No, no.             The way -- the way


                                       43
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   I would understand it to operate is that the -- the

 2   alien would have to make a clear and convincing showing

 3   that he is entitled to have the motion to reopen

 4   granted.   Because if the motion to reopen is granted,

 5   that vacates the final order of removal and therefore

 6   there is no longer a final order of removal pursuant to

 7   which the alien could be removed.

 8               And I did want to respond to your suggestion

 9   that maybe the standard should be more lenient with

10   respect to motions to reopen.              With respect, I think

11   that's the opposite of what the rule should be, if

12   anything; because the final -- the review of the final

13   order of removal is the main show; and in that -- in

14   that situation, the alien is actually challenging the

15   order of removal.

16               In a case like this where the order of

17   removal was a long time ago, and the -- and the -- the

18   alien sought judicial review of that and that was

19   denied, the only thing before the court is the -- is the

20   motion to reopen.    And staying -- a judicial order

21   staying the denial of a motion to reopen is meaningless.

22   In order to get the relief preventing removal you need a

23   stay of removal, which really effectively directs DHS-

24   as we think it does in all cases -- directs DHS not to

25   execute the order of removal that was -- t hat was


                                        44

 1   already previously entered.

 2              And also the denial of a motion to reopen,

 3   especially like the one at issue in this case, where the

 4   question is whether the alien has shown -- has produced

 5   material evidence of changed circumstances, that is

 6   reviewed as this Court said in its decision in Abudu,

 7   under an abuse of discretion standard.                    So it would be

 8   very likely -- very unlike that an alien would prevail.

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    This provision

10   applies to us as well, I take it, right?

11              GEN. KNEEDLER:             Yes, we -- we believe it

12   would.

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    So if there is a

14   cert petition filed on behalf of an alien subject to

15   removal, and he asks for a stay of removal, we have to

16   decide whether he meets the clear and convincing

17   evidence standard.

18              GEN. KNEEDLER:             For -- for purposes of

19   granting a stay, yes.

20              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    We should have -- we

21   should have done this in this case, but I assume you

22   suspended removal of the Petitioner on your own?

23              GEN. KNEEDLER:             Well, the Court granted the

24   stay in connection with the -- with the granting of --

25   of certiorari in my case.

 1                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             May I ask just a

 2   technical point?

 3                GEN. KNEEDLER:          Yes.

 4                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             One of the -- the motion

 5   to reopen was based on changed circumstances in the

 6   Cameroon.    But there was also this independent

 7   application for adjustment of his status, which was

 8   turned down because it was a successive motion.

 9                GEN. KNEEDLER:          Yes.

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             My understanding is that

11   that adjustment could not have been asked for earlier

12   because his wife didn't come with -- until after.

13                GEN. KNEEDLER:          If I -- yes.        Well, he -- he

14   did seek -- he did seek, the first time around he sought

15   a remand for consideration of his adjustment of status

16   application, but one of the requirements to be eligible

17   for that is that a visa be available, and a visa was not

18   then available, and nothing in the Act requires that

19   deportation hearings be held up until a visa becomes

20   available.

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Yes, but now he would

22   qualify, except that it's a successive motion.                 So it

23   seems earlier he was premature and now he's too late.

24                GEN. KNEEDLER:          But -- but Congress was

25   quite explicit; it only wanted one -- one motion to


                                        46

 1   reopen, except in the case of asylum or withholding of

 2   deportation.   It wanted -- it wanted the proceedings to

 3   come to an end.   And that's -- the circumstances of this

 4   case powerfully reinforce what Congress --

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               May I just ask a

 6   question?

 7               GEN. KNEEDLER:            Yes.

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               This person is married to

 9   a citizen, has an American citizen child.                    Is there any

10   way that his status could be adjusted?                    It can't in this

11   procedural situation because it is a successive motion.

12               GEN. KNEEDLER:            He could -- he could apply

13   for an immigrant visa from abroad.                   Now there may be

14   situations in which -- in which by virtue of having been

15   removed, there is a bar to his getting that, but that is

16   subject to waiver.      So really what the alien's

17   adjustment status in the United States is discretionary

18   if there is a piece of available -- it is discretionary

19   from abroad.   All -- it's really a alternate venue

20   provision, where the alien applies from abroad.

21               JUSTICE STEVENS:              GEN. KNEEDLER, when we

22   entered this stage, did we violate (f)(2)?

23               GEN. KNEEDLER:            I -- I think it would be

24   analogous to what I was saying before, that the -- this

25   Court like a court of appeals has the authority to -- to

 1   freeze the status quo while it can decide the pertinent

 2   legal issue, and the pertinent legal issue before

 3   this --

 4                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Where -- where do we get

 5   that authority if (f)(2) means what you say?

 6                 GEN. KNEEDLER:         Well, as I explained, we do

 7   not -- we do not challenge the ability of a court to

 8   decided -- to freeze the status quo while ruling on the

 9   motion for stay.

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, what court would ever

11   do anything else?    I mean, why if you were granting a

12   stay, would you not want to do that so you can fully

13   consider the issues?

14                 GEN. KNEEDLER:         Well, but there's -- it's

15   not two stages; it's three.             The -- a stay of removal

16   is, under the Hobbs Act terms, an interlocutory

17   injunction.    That can last -- judicial review in the

18   Ninth Circuit can last four years, so if a stay is

19   granted, you could have an interlocutory injunction in

20   place for a long time.        The temporary stay is just while

21   the court is ruling, considering the interlocutory

22   injunction.

23                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           But this is a longer

24   temporary stay than you conceded a few moments ago.                I

25   mean, you were talking about Friday night to Monday

 1   morning, when you were -- when you were conceding the

 2   stay on the Hobbs analogy.           I don't know how many months

 3   it's been, but this is no Friday night to Monday morning

 4   stay.

 5                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                It's pretty close to

 6   it, though.

 7                 (Laughter.)

10   Kneedler.

13            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LINDSAY C. HARRISON

14                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15                 MS. HARRISON:         Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

16                 I'd like to start with the point that the

17   government contends that this Court or any court of

18   appeals could impose a stay to consider the stay motion.

19   And, respectfully, I don't believe that is consistent

20   with the text of (f)(2), and I think that the fact that

21   the government must stray from the text is a sign of how

22   absurd the results would be if (f)(2) were applied to

23   stays.

24                 Now, the reason they must stray from the

25   text is that the text says "notwithstanding any other


                                        49

 1   provision of law," which means notwithstanding the Hobbs

 2   Act and notwithstanding the All Risk Act, which is where

 3   I believe my brother was indicating this Court would get

 4   authority to impose such a stay.

 5              Now, I think the fact that there are cases

 6   where such a need would arise, as in Justice Breyer's

 7   hypothetical, is exactly why this Court applies a

 8   presumption against interpreting statutes as restricting

 9   the equitable authority of the courts, unless there is a

10   clear statement to the contrary, which --

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Yes, but you still have a

12   differential on the Friday to Monday night hypothetical.

13   You wouldn't apply, or would you, the same standard that

14   you would apply on Monday for the next -- on Monday for

15   the next year and a half?

16              MS. HARRISON:          Well, Your Honor, the (f)(2)

17   --

18              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Because you have the same

19   problem under your standard as the government does under

20   its.

21              MS. HARRISON:          Well, that's true.             You'd

22   have to show likelihood of success.                    But in -- in the

23   situation where you could consider the equities, if the

24   equities were strong enough and demonstrated in the stay

25   application, then it wouldn't be difficult for the court


                                      50

 1   to decide whether the balance of the factors justified

 2   implementing a stay in that situation.                 Under (f)(2),

 3   the court would have to decide the question outright.

 4   And, again, (f)(2) does not mean any predictive

 5   language; it just says, has the individual demonstrated

 6   and shown by clear and convincing evidence that removal

 7   is prohibited by law?     Under the traditional standard,

 8   there is a -- the court is allowed to consider whether

 9   the individual is likely to show success on the merits.

10              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You think that if you do

11   not prevail, and we say clear and convincing evidence is

12   the standard, that courts are not entitled to consider

13   equity?

14              MS. HARRISON:          Well, Your Honor, I heard my

15   brother as indicating that if you meet the (f)(2)

16   standard, then -- then the court can consider the

17   equities so as to deprive the individual of the stay,

18   but that if you cannot meet the (f)(2) standard, then

19   the question is closed and there is no consideration.

20              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            About your position, is it

21   your contention that if we grant -- if we determine

22   clear and convincing is the standard, that equities are

23   not relevant to that calculus?

24              MS. HARRISON:          Yes, Your Honor, in the event

25   that the individual does not meet (f)(2).                If the


                                      51
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   individual meets (f)(2), then I do believe the court

 2   would go on to consider the equities.                     But in the event

 3   that the individual has met the (f)(2) standard, the

 4   court could simply grant the petition on the merits, and

 5   there is no need to go about considering the equities

 6   because the individual has shown that -- by clear and

 7   convincing evidence -- that removal is prohibited as a

 8   matter of law.

 9               And that is the second point I want to get

10   to, which is Your Honor's question about, isn't this a

11   standard that sounds a lot more like it is directed at

12   district courts because -- I think you are right, Your

13   Honor, and I think it does sound like that standard

14   because I so think that was where it was intended to

15   apply.   And the phrase "under this section" does not

16   modify the word "enjoin"; it modifies the word "final

17   order of removal."      And to ascribe the government's

18   reading to it would require you to move that phrase from

19   where Congress placed it in the statute, to after the

20   word "enjoin."

21               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                   I guess General

22   Kneedler's point is that clear and convincing shifts a

23   little, depending on how long you've got to look at it.

24   If you've only got a day or a few hours before the

25   removal is going to take place, you can say this is


                                         52
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   convincing enough based on what I have had a chance to

 2   look at.   But -- and therefore you could enter, I guess,

 3   what may be called the temporary stay to get more

 4   briefing from the government or whatever.               But you may

 5   find out when you look at it a little more deeply that

 6   it's not clear and convincing.              What's wrong with that?

 7               MS. HARRISON:          Well, Your Honor, if the

 8   Court were to interpret clear and convincing as a more

 9   flexible standard, then I don't think -- you know, I

10   don't disagree with Your Honor's characterization of it.

11   But I still think that, regardless of how you interpret

12   clear and convincing, that the equities would not be

13   part of the calculus.

14               And I also think that the fact that clear

15   and convincing sounds like a standard Congress would

16   have addressed to district courts, the fact that (f)(2)

17   says "no" courts, not -- not just the "courts of

18   appeals," the fact that it references an "alien" and not

19   a "petitioner" are -- and the fact that it is addressed

20   to instances where the entry or execution is prohibited

21   by law as opposed to the order itself being unlawful are

22   all signs that Congress intended this provision to apply

23   both in the district courts and in the court of appeals.

24               And I would also note that (a)(5), which is

25   a provision the government pointed to, was not in the


                                       53
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   1996 statute it was added in 2005, and the

 2   constitutionality of that provision continues to be

 3   litigated.   And, moreover, there are habeas cases in the

 4   district courts that persist where (f)(2) has real

 5   application and where Congress's intent that an

 6   injunction, not a stay, but an injunction be very

 7   difficult to obtain --

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:            1225?

 9                MS. HARRISON:          Yes, sir.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:            Was I right or wrong?

11                MS. HARRISON:          I believe you are right, and

12   I believe that --

13                JUSTICE BREYER:            Are you sure?    Because --

14                (Laughter.)

15                JUSTICE BREYER: -- you didn't mention it.

16   If I am right, why didn't you mention it?

17                MS. HARRISON:          I did not mention it in my

18   opening, Your Honor, and that was my error.              I believe

19   habeas is one example -- and habeas in the expedited

20   removal context, where the provisions would apply.               And

21   -- and I think, as this court made clear in Saint Cyr,

22   Congress did intend for some habeas actions to persist

23   in the '96 IIRIRA statute.           And in those cases, (f)(2)

24   would apply, would have real impact.

25                And I would also note that if the Court were


                                        54

 1   to accept the government's interpretation of the term

 2   "enjoin," that it only applies in stays and that doesn't

 3   have application elsewhere, then you would be required

 4   to interpret Congress's use of the word "enjoin" to be

 5   not really inclusive of stays but as coterminous with

 6   the word "stay."     But Congress didn't use the word

 7   "stay" it (f)(2).     It used the word "enjoin."                 And the

 8   fact that that word choice was different from the word

 9   it used in (b)(3)(B) I think is a clear indication that

10   Congress had something different.                  It didn't

11   cross-reference stay and didn't use the word "stays,"

12   and it articulated a standard that seems more

13   appropriate for district courts adjudicating permanent

14   injunctive relief than courts of appeals hearing a

15   temporary application for a stay.

16              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                But the standard you

17   think should apply under (b)(3)(B) is a standard that

18   describes as applicable to temporary injunctions.                      The

19   word -- there is substantial likelihood of success on

20   the merits and irreparable harm -- that is the standard

21   preliminary injunction, not preliminary stay.                    The

22   preliminary injunction standard.                 So the two words

23   certainly overlap.

24              MS. HARRISON:             Yes, Your Honor.          There is

25   overlap, and the standard that is applied by the courts,

 1   if there is no statute to the contrary, is the same.

 2   But here Congress expressed an intention to treat

 3   injunctive relief differently and articulated a standard

 4   that was higher than injunctive relief.

 5                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           May I just ask this one

 6   real quick:    Do you understand -- is your understanding

 7   that the government's interpretation of the statute that

 8   our stay in this case violated the statute?

 9                 MS. HARRISON:         Yes, Your Honor.

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you, Ms.

11   Harrison.

12                 General Kneedler, Ms. Harrison, the Court

13   entered a very expedited briefing and arguments schedule

14   in this case that unfortunately fell over the holiday

15   season, and we appreciate very much that this must have

16   imposed a burden on you had and your colleagues.                     Thank

17   you.

18                 The case is submitted.
