 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Case 11-1231, Sebelius v. Auburn

 5   Regional Medical Center.

 6                  Mr. Kneedler.

 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

 8                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                  MR. KNEEDLER:      Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                  Under Part A of the Medicare program, the

12   Federal government pays out more than $230 billion

13   annually to more than 30,000 institutional providers,

14   including more than 6,000 hospitals.                The total amount

15   to which each of these providers is entitled is

16   determined by a fiscal intermediary on the basis of a

17   cost report.

18                  The statute provides that a provider may

19   obtain a hearing before the Provider Reimbursement

20   Review Board, only if he appeals the intermediary's

21   determination with -- within 180 days.

22                  For the almost 40 years of the existence of

23   the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, the Secretary,

24   pursuant to her broad rulemaking authority, has

25   prohibited the board from extending that period, and


                                       3

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   instead required dismissal of the appeal, except as 


 2   specifically provided in the Secretary's own 


 3   regulations. 


 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Mr. Kneedler, 


 5   there's a little bit of at least facial incongruity in

 6   your position.

 7               Congress sets in place the 180-day limit.

 8   Then you say, oh, well, that, we can go beyond that.

 9   The Secretary puts in the 3-year limit, and you say

10   that's it -- you know, that's the dead drop-off.              I

11   would have thought what Congress says is entitled to

12   greater weight than what the Secretary says.

13               MR. KNEEDLER:      Well, the 180-day limitation

14   here is not a limitation applied to suits filed in

15   court, in which the court is the relevant tribunal, and

16   the court has -- has itself construed the statute's

17   regulating access to the courts or the appellate courts

18   as a matter -- a matter of internal judicial

19   administration.

20               This deadline governs an appeal within the

21   Department of Health and Human Services, and that is

22   something that Congress has delegated the responsibility

23   to the Secretary to construe the relevant statutes and

24   to adopt the relevant regulations pursuant to her broad

25   rulemaking authority.


                                    4

 1               So in -- in this setting, it is the board

 2   that is the relevant tribunal, and the rules governing

 3   the board's jurisdiction are established --

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Excuse me.

 5               MR. KNEEDLER:      Excuse me.

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         You don't mention Union

 7   Pacific in your brief.    How can you be calling what

 8   you're doing setting your jurisdictional limits?        Didn't

 9   we say, in Union Pacific, that agencies can't do that?

10   You can't define your own jurisdiction.

11               MR. KNEEDLER:      Well, I --

12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Now, you may or may not

13   be able to establish claim processing rules.        That, I

14   think, is a totally different question.         But why do you

15   continue to use it as jurisdictional language?

16               MR. KNEEDLER:      Well, I was responding to --

17   first of all, the -- the Secretary's regulations have,

18   from the outset, referred to these limitations as

19   limitations on the board's jurisdiction.        This is --

20   this is set forth in the -- in the regulations

21   promulgated --

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Well, in that respect, I

23   think the amici is right.      You can't -- if they're

24   jurisdictional, we've clearly said that equitable

25   tolling doesn't apply under any circumstances.


                                    5

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1                MR. KNEEDLER:      Right.      And we -- and we

 2   clearly believe that equitable tolling does not apply.

 3   That would be fundamentally inconsistent.

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         So what is good cause,

 5   if not some form of equitable tolling?

 6                MR. KNEEDLER:      There is nothing incompatible

 7   between a good cause -- a limited good cause extension

 8   and a jurisdictional rule.

 9                For example, in -- in the several cases that

10   this Court has considered finding provisions to be

11   jurisdictional, the time for taking an appeal and the

12   time for petitioning for certiorari are both

13   jurisdictional, but both allow extensions for good

14   cause.   In fact, this Court's decision in Bowles

15   involved the extension for good cause.

16                So the question here for the Secretary --

17   and, again, this is just a narrow question of good

18   cause.   It in no way suggests that equitable tolling

19   would be -- would be permitted.

20                The narrow question is whether the Secretary

21   permissibly construed the statute to allow a comparable

22   good cause exception, where -- where something akin to

23   an act of God would prevent the provider from actually

24   appealing within the requisite period of time, just like

25   the district court can extend the appeal period.


                                     6

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The -- the Court's

 2   decision in Henderson against Shinseki, that also

 3   involved an intra-agency appeal, and yet, we said that

 4   equitable tolling was permissible.

 5               MR. KNEEDLER:       Well, I mean, there are a

 6   number of differences there.            I think, technically, it

 7   was not intra-agency.     It was an appeal from

 8   the Board of Veterans Appeals to the Court of Veterans

 9   Appeals, which is a separate body.               It is not something

10   under the jurisdiction of the VA.

11               The VA was not given rulemaking authority

12   over that, unlike here, where the board is under the

13   Secretary's jurisdiction, and, in fact, she has adopted

14   regulations that have been in place for 40 years, which

15   have expressly barred any extensions and treated that

16   limitation as jurisdictional.

17               Also, very much unlike Henderson, this

18   statute is not one comparable to a statute regulating

19   benefits for veterans, to which there has always been a

20   solicitude by Congress and the courts --

21               JUSTICE KAGAN:        But, Mr. Kneedler, do you

22   think you could do the same thing in the veterans'

23   benefits context?   Because in Henderson, of course, we

24   dropped a footnote saying that we weren't deciding

25   whether equitable tolling was available.              All we were


                                     7

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   saying was that this was a claims processing rule and

 2   not a jurisdictional rule.

 3                 Could the Secretary of Veterans Affairs then

 4   go on and say, okay, it's a claims processing rule, but

 5   still, we get to decide how much equitable tolling we

 6   want, and we're going to adopt a regulation, much like

 7   the one in this case, saying you can't come in after 3

 8   years?   Could you do that in Henderson?

 9                 MR. KNEEDLER:      Well, I think, in Henderson,

10   there would have been the problem that the rule, as I

11   understand it, was a rule to -- for appealing to the

12   Court, which was outside the -- the Secretary's

13   rulemaking authority; whereas, here, this is a body

14   within HHS over which the Secretary has rulemaking

15   authority.

16                 But, yes, we -- we think that the Secretary

17   clearly had -- and she has very broad legislative

18   rulemaking authority under this statute -- has the

19   authority to adopt strict limitations, as she has done

20   on that --

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Could she -- could she

22   have adopted equitable tolling?

23                 MR. KNEEDLER:      I -- we don't think that she

24   could have.   We think that, as we say in our brief,

25   quite aside from the Secretary's regulation, we believe


                                      8

                                 Official


 1   the sort of open-ended equitable tolling that the court

 2   of appeals has imposed on this program for the first

 3   time in 40 years is fundamentally inconsistent with a

 4   need for repose, especially given the sophisticated

 5   nature of these providers, as this Court noted in the

 6   Your Home nursing home case --

 7               JUSTICE KAGAN:       I guess the question I was

 8   trying to ask, Mr. Kneedler, was do you think it's a

 9   general principle of administrative law that, when there

10   is a claims processing rule that -- that relates only to

11   internal agency process, that the agency gets to decide

12   how much, if any, equitable tolling to allow?

13               MR. KNEEDLER:      Yes.     We -- we certainly do

14   believe that.

15               For -- for -- in the first place, most

16   agency time limits are established by the agency itself,

17   pursuant to regulation.     So if there had been no

18   statutory 180-day limitation period here and the

19   Secretary had adopted a regulation imposing that, then

20   whether -- and the extent to which that provision would

21   be open to extensions for good cause, for some degree of

22   equitable tolling, whatever the factors, would be up to

23   the Secretary in construing her own regulation --

24               JUSTICE ALITO:       Now, you refer to these --

25   to the providers as sophisticated, and that certainly is


                                    9

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   true.   But are they really in a position to double-check

 2   the calculation when -- if it were true -- and I know

 3   you don't agree with this -- if it were true that

 4   information needed to make the calculation was

 5   intentionally withheld, concealed?

 6                MR. KNEEDLER:      Well, as you say, we do

 7   not -- we do not agree with that.           And the findings by

 8   the district court in this case, which was the same

 9   district judge who sat in the Baystate case, disagreed

10   with that -- with that conclusion.

11                JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, I understand that.

12   But if that were the case, would their sophistication

13   allow them to double-check this?           Or is this just

14   something that is dependent on data that they cannot

15   access?

16                MR. KNEEDLER:      Well, it -- it may be more

17   difficult.   This was a situation which required the

18   matching of data between CMS and the Social Security

19   administrative -- massive data files of 11 million

20   Medicare claims, I think 6 million SSI claims.

21                And when you have two agencies matching

22   something, there will be errors.           And the -- the

23   providers did not know --

24                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Assume for the sake of

25   your answer that the error was intentional.           Don't try


                                    10

 1   to go to the facts, but assume the error was

 2   intentional.    Now, answer Justice Alito's question.

 3                  MR. KNEEDLER:      There -- it --

 4                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         There -- that might be a

 5   contradiction in terms.

 6                  MR. KNEEDLER:      There may be -- there may be

 7   situations in which the provider would not know that,

 8   but the need -- but the need for finality under this

 9   program, we think, requires an across-the-board rule.

10   Otherwise, a provider could come in -- as this Court

11   suggested in the Your Home case, circumstances --

12                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         If this is a claim

13   processing rule, under what theory could you shield

14   yourself against fraudulent conduct -- fraudulent

15   concealment?    Under what theory of law would an agency's

16   rule be fair and -- and non-arbitrary --

17                  MR. KNEEDLER:      Well --

18                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- that shielded it from

19   fraudulent acts.

20                  MR. KNEEDLER:      First of all, we do not

21   believe this is an ordinary claims processing rule.            We

22   believe that this is a jurisdictional limitation imposed

23   by the -- by Congress, interpreted by the Court to allow

24   this narrow exception.       So we do not believe that --

25                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Why do you keep fighting


                                      11

 1   the -- the question?

 2               MR. KNEEDLER:         But with -- yes, we do

 3   believe that the Secretary, in the interest of -- of

 4   finality, can impose that sort of limitation.            There's a

 5   presumption of regularity in the -- in the operation

 6   of -- administration of Federal programs.            There are

 7   criminal sanctions.

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            You keep fighting the

 9   hypotheticals.   There is an intent to save money and an

10   intent not to use the figures that are specified by

11   statute, and that is concealed.            In that set of

12   circumstances, if this were a claim processing rule,

13   would you be authorized to treat -- not to -- not to

14   permit the action?

15               MR. KNEEDLER:         Yes.     We -- we believe the

16   Secretary would be -- would be required to, and we think

17   may well be compelled to.         But let me point out, if

18   there was that sort of extraordinary circumstance, then

19   either Congress or the Secretary could provide a special

20   remedy in that situation.

21               If there was an inspector general's report

22   that showed widespread fraud in something, I think

23   Congress or the Secretary could be expected to respond

24   to that in an appropriate way.            The question is whether

25   the hard and fast rules that have been adopted should


                                      12

 1   be -- should be open to general equitable tolling

 2   principles.

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Mr. Kneedler, you -- what I

 4   find incompatible in your argument is you -- you assert

 5   that this is a jurisdictional limitation.

 6                 MR. KNEEDLER:      Insofar as the board is

 7   concerned.    The board has said and the Secretary has

 8   said that the board -- this is jurisdictional, and the

 9   board has no equitable powers to --

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Can you think of any other

11   instance in which we have found something to be a

12   jurisdictional limitation and allowed the person or

13   agency, subject to that limitation, to extend it?            I --

14   I had always thought that once you say it's

15   jurisdictional, it means you have to abide by it.

16                 MR. KNEEDLER:      As I said, in -- in Bowles,

17   the Court was dealing with the jurisdictional time limit

18   for an appeal, but there was a comparable -- there is a

19   comparable statutory provision for the Court to extend

20   that period for good cause.           It remains jurisdictional.

21   That was the point in Bowles.            It was -- there was a

22   question of whether the --

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, if there is another

24   statutory provision, then that -- then that statutory

25   extension is part of the jurisdictional limitation.

 1   That's fine.

 2                  But when you just have a jurisdictional 180

 3   days, without any statutory provision for extension, if

 4   it's jurisdictional, I thought that's the end of the

 5   game.

 6                  MR. KNEEDLER:      Right.       And -- and the -- the

 7   question is -- some time limitations have been

 8   understood to contain explicit -- excuse me, explicit or

 9   implicit authorizations for the tribunal concerned.              And

10   this --

11                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         Undoubtedly.    But have any

12   jurisdictional time limitations?

13                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       I mean, you don't need that

14   label, do you, Mr. Kneedler?              You could do just as well

15   with a claims processing label.             Maybe you could do

16   better, as Justice Scalia is suggesting, with a claims

17   processing label, as long as, with that label, comes the

18   general rule that the agency gets to determine the

19   extent of discretion as to late filings.

20                  MR. KNEEDLER:      Right.       This is a

21   mandatory -- this is a mandatory -- even if

22   nonjurisdictional, it is a mandatory limitation.             And

23   the question is whether the statute contains an implicit

24   authorization, whether the Secretary could permissibly

25   construe it to allow for this narrow good cause


                                      14

 1   exception comparable to the one for extending the

 2   time --

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:         The problem with taking

 4   that approach, of course -- and I assume why you assert

 5   that it's jurisdictional, is that there is a long 


 6   history of both the board and the Secretary regarding 


 7   this as jurisdictional. 


 8                MR. KNEEDLER:      Yes, that is --


 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:         They have said it. 


10                MR. KNEEDLER:      -- that is -- that is

11   correct.   But we -- but I think it's also important to

12   recognize that the -- that this statute was enacted, the

13   regulations were adopted before this Court's recent

14   jurisprudence identifying some things as jurisdictional,

15   some things as claim processing, primarily focusing on

16   the judicial situation.

17                Here, we have a statute governing procedures

18   in an administrative agency and regulations adopted at a

19   time before that -- that bifurcated way of looking at

20   things arose.

21                JUSTICE BREYER:         All right.   But that --

22   that's why I wonder what the basic underlying principle

23   is.   I mean, I would have thought -- but I'm not sure

24   what you think, that -- that the way to look at these

25   cases is, using ordinary principles of statutory


                                    15

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   interpretation, would a reasonable legislator, having

 2   enacted these words, intend to give the agency a degree

 3   of leeway in interpreting the statute?

 4               Now, if that's the basic question, it helps,

 5   but isn't determinative whether you classify this as a

 6   claims processing rule or a jurisdictional rule.              Those

 7   are conclusions.   But, really, it's the question of

 8   leeway that the Congress intended to -- to delegate to

 9   the agency that is determinative.

10               If the answer to that question is yes, your

11   rule stands, regardless of label, and if the answer to

12   the question is no, it fails regardless of label.

13               MR. KNEEDLER:       That's --- that's correct.

14   And I want to make clear that under, whatever the answer

15   to that precise question, the Respondents in this case

16   lose because whether -- if it's an absolute rule to

17   which there can be no exception or the Secretary's

18   regulation allowing a limited exception is valid, in no

19   case would the sort of open-ended tolling regime that

20   the court of appeals imposed be permissible.

21               If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of

22   my time.

 1                  COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE

 2                MR. MANNING:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 3   please the Court:

 4                Congress in two ways signaled its intention

 5   to treat the time limitation prescribed by Subsection

 6   (a)(3) as absolute; that is, as not subject to waiver

 7   and not subject to equitable tolling.

 8                First, Congress chose to locate that

 9   provision in the very part of the statute that defines

10   the board's jurisdiction, that is to say, in the part

11   that determines the class --

12                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         It didn't talk about the

13   board.   It talks about what a party can do, not what the

14   board can or cannot do.

15                MR. MANNING:     You're entirely -- entirely

16   right, Justice Sotomayor.       It talks about the -- the

17   right of the provider to get a hearing in the provision

18   of the statute that -- that determines the class of

19   cases that the provider may hear.

20                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         That's not the

21   prototypical limitation that -- that Congress uses when

22   it intends a jurisdictional limit on a court.

23                MR. MANNING:     No, it's not, Your Honor.     But

24   in several cases, this Court has held that similar

25   statutes that are framed in terms of the party's right


                                    17

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   to invoke the power of the tribunal, that those are

 2   jurisdictional statutes.     The Court has never addressed

 3   the question whether they can be -- they must be framed

 4   in terms of the power of the board or in terms of the

 5   right of the party to invoke the power of the board.

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         We have talked about

 7   what the -- the fact that there almost is a presumption

 8   of a claims processing rule, rather than jurisdictional,

 9   unless Congress is clear about that.

10               What policy supports an argument that we

11   should be reading limitations of this kind as

12   jurisdictional, particularly when, on the same day the

13   statute was passed, the agency, invoking its regulatory

14   powers, treated it like a claim processing?        Whatever

15   your colleague argues, a good cause exception, the

16   3-year exception, everything else is -- is really

17   treating it like a claim processing rule, not as

18   jurisdictional.

19               MR. MANNING:     Justice Sotomayor, you're

20   entirely right, that the test that this Court has

21   prescribed in this area of law is focused on

22   congressional intent.    In Arbaugh, this Court said that

23   the touchstone is congressional intent, that -- that the

24   design of this Court's rules is to put the ball in

25   Congress' court.


                                   18

 1               This Court has put a thumb on the scale

 2   against jurisdiction because of the hard consequences

 3   that follow from deeming a procedure jurisdictional.                In

 4   this case, the agency's regulation, no matter how old it

 5   is, is invalid because Congress signaled a clear

 6   intention to treat this as jurisdictional in two ways:

 7   One, by putting it in the -- in the provision of the

 8   statute that defines the board's jurisdiction.               But,

 9   secondly, Congress, in this statute, created two

10   different kinds of deadlines, one for providers and one

11   for beneficiaries.

12               Both set almost identical deadlines for

13   administrative appeals.       It's 6 months for

14   beneficiaries, 180 days for providers.               But there is a

15   fundamental difference in the way Congress treated these

16   two sets of deadlines, and the fundamental difference is

17   that Congress explicitly gave the Secretary authority --

18   discretion, to extend the deadline for beneficiaries.

19   It gave no such discretion to extend the -- the deadline

20   for providers.

21               And the same story plays out in the 60-day

22   limits that govern judicial review.               Discretion --

23               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            This -- this agency not

24   more than 3 years extension, that was adopted after

25   notice and comment, and Congress amended this statute


                                     19

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   several times thereafter, but it left this -- this

 2   3-year outside limit intact.            So if Congress really

 3   wanted there to be no leeway at all, then it should have

 4   done something about that regulation.

 5               MR. MANNING:      Justice Ginsburg, you're

 6   entirely right.   Congress has amended the statute, in

 7   fact, eight times since the Secretary promulgated her

 8   regulation establishing a good cause requirement.            But

 9   this Court has, in recent years, been more careful about

10   finding acquiescence than it did at one time.

11               In the Solid Waste Authority of Northern

12   Cook County, what this Court said is that before it will

13   find that Congress has acquiesced, there must be

14   evidence that Congress was aware of the regulation and a

15   clear signal that Congress meant to embrace or put in

16   place this regulation.

17               And this is a sound policy because Congress

18   leaves regulations in place for all sorts of reasons

19   because somebody is using a parliamentary tactic,

20   because Congress doesn't have one opinion or the other

21   about whether the -- the regulation is right, because

22   Congress didn't think of the problem.

23               So, in recent years, this Court has insisted

24   upon a high degree of proof before it will find

25   acquiescence, and that degree is not present here.

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   There is no evidence that Congress was aware of this

 2   regulation, much less that it approved of it.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:         Well, but you have three --

 4   the point that you make is right, that -- that you have

 5   specific language in the beneficiary part and not here;

 6   but you have the other way, the point that Justice

 7   Ginsburg made, the fact that the language here is --

 8   is -- doesn't say file within 180 days.           It says, you

 9   may have a hearing if you file within 180 days.           It

10   doesn't say what happens if you don't.           It's open, the

11   language.

12                And the -- the subject matter is not a

13   court.   The subject matter is a rather technical agency

14   review board.   And normally, I would think, you would

15   think, and members of Congress would think that the

16   agency knows best as to how to run its own operation

17   and -- and don't interfere too much in details, and this

18   is a sort of detail.

19                So those are the things against you, it

20   seems to me, though the thing you cite is certainly for

21   you.

22                MR. MANNING:     Quite -- quite right, Your

23   Honor.   And -- and typically, an agency has discretion

24   to set its own procedures, as the government argues.

25   And -- and the government is quite right to cite Vermont


                                    21

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   Yankee.    And I would add Chevron, that -- that the

 2   government promulgated its regulation in a

 3   Chevron-eligible format.       But Chevron only applies if

 4   the statute is not clear, and here, we say that Congress

 5   addressed the precise question in issue.

 6                 It's very difficult when one reads the

 7   beneficiary provisions and provider provisions, which

 8   are quite different.     One provides discretion, and one

 9   doesn't.   And what Respondents would have --

10                 JUSTICE BREYER:         One was passed long, long

11   ago and was part of the Social Security Act or

12   something, the one you're talking about, and was passed

13   many years before the second one was passed.

14                 And when they're sitting in Congress

15   writing -- you know, they don't know everything that was

16   passed in history.

17                 MR. MANNING:     You're exactly right, Justice

18   Breyer.    But Congress, in Section 299O of the 1972 Act,

19   that enacted -- that created the PRRB, amended and

20   reenacted the provision from the 1965 legislation that

21   prescribed the -- the beneficiary review provisions.          It

22   incorporated, by reference, provisions that gave the

23   Secretary express discretion to extend those deadlines.

24                 And so, in the same statute, what Congress

25   did was it set up two systems, one for beneficiaries and


                                     22

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   one for providers.    One prescribed discretion, one

 2   didn't.

 3                 What the Respondents are asking this Court

 4   to do is to read these two sets of provisions, which are

 5   worded very differently, to mean the same thing, to mean

 6   that the Secretary has discretion whether Congress gives

 7   it or doesn't.

 8                 And I submit that that's a good reason to

 9   treat this as a step one case.           The Secretary does not

10   merit deference in this case because the statute is

11   clear.    And to return to Justice Sotomayor's question

12   about the phrase -- and your question about the

13   phraseology of Subsection (a), this Court held in Bowles

14   v. Russell that Section 2107 is jurisdiction

15   notwithstanding that it --

16                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         That was, in part, the

17   point I raised earlier, which is we look at what the

18   history is to help inform our use of labels.           The

19   history here -- you can't ignore it -- is that, from its

20   inception, whether it's trying to disclaim it now or

21   not, the agency has not treated it as jurisdictional.

22                 It's used the word --

23                 MR. MANNING:     Well --

24                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         -- but it's treated it

25   as a claim processing rule by creating these exceptions.

 1               MR. MANNING:        Well, you're right,

 2   Justice Sotomayor.     But my question -- the question that

 3   that raises is this:      From the very beginning, this

 4   agency has -- all three of the agencies -- the

 5   Secretary, CMS, and the board -- have all described this

 6   provision as jurisdictional and non-waivable.           At the

 7   same time, they have tried to create this exception.

 8               In the -- in the 2008 regulations that

 9   narrowed the good cause exception, the Secretary

10   acknowledged that there was a question about whether the

11   good cause exception was consistent with the

12   characterization of the time limitation as

13   jurisdictional, acknowledged that there was a split of

14   authority on that, and suggested that the courts would

15   have to resolve it.      This is not --

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            There is -- there is a

17   lot of discussion and confusion between jurisdiction,

18   mandatory claim processing rules, nonmandatory claim

19   processing rules.    I could go on and on about the

20   labels.

21               But let's go back to the point Justice Kagan

22   made earlier, which is, assuming we were to treat this

23   as a mandatory claim processing rule, where does that

24   get you?

25               Now, the agency says that means no equitable


                                      24

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   tolling.   Assuming I'm willing to accept that, is 


 2   equitable tolling the same as fraudulent concealment, 


 3   which has been treated in the law, not as a -- as a 


 4   necessary part of equitable tolling, which has to do 


 5   with what the plaintiff could have done or not done, but

 6   with what a defendant has done or not done?

 7                MR. MANNING:     Justice Sotomayor, this Court

 8   has said that, if a time limitation is jurisdictional,

 9   that limitation is absolute.            That includes no equitable

10   tolling.

11                In Irwin, this Court included among the

12   grounds for equitable tolling the intentional

13   concealment of information that was necessary to --

14                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Why don't you -- why

15   don't you take another minute to finish your answer?

16                MR. MANNING:     Certainly.

17                So if it's jurisdictional,

18   Justice Sotomayor, then even if the -- even if the CMS

19   intentionally withheld this information, the time limit

20   would be absolute and would not be extendable.

21                On the other hand, I believe that if the --

22   the statute is not jurisdictional, it's subject to

23   equitable tolling; under Irwin, the presumption of

24   equitable tolling applies.        And, it's very difficult to

25   see how the Secretary is warranted in narrowing


                                    25

 6                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. ROTH 


 7                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 


 8                 MR. ROTH:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 


 9   please the Court. 


10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Do you agree with that

11   last statement?

12                 MR. ROTH:     Well, I --

13                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Do you think an agency

14   is not permitted to have mandatory claim processing

15   rules?

16                 MR. ROTH:     Excuse me, Your Honor?

17                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Do you believe an agency

18   is not capable of having mandatory claim processing

19   rules, that it limits the application of equitable

20   principles?

21                 MR. ROTH:     The -- the agency could have

22   mandatory claims processing rules to the extent -- with

23   the leeway that was provided by Congress.

24                 Here, the leeway ends when you have -- when

25   you have issues, like Your Honor was talking about, with


                                      26

 1   intentional concealment, when you have actions by the

 2   Secretary, misconduct by the Secretary, that caused the

 3   statute of limitations time to be missed.

 4                 One would have to assume that the -- that

 5   the Congress has -- has delegated to the fox to

 6   determine who is in charge of the henhouse.          So there is

 7   a limitation, Your Honor, on how far the agency can go,

 8   and it cannot go as far as to shield itself from

 9   judicial review of its own misconduct.

10                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Would our review be an

11   APA review, whether the -- the rule is arbitrary or

12   capricious?

13                 MR. ROTH:    Well, I think that -- that the

14   APA review would start under -- under step one.          And we

15   believe that the statute is clear on this point, that

16   under step one of Chevron, that this has not been

17   delegated to the agency to determine what the judicial

18   review should be available in the context of agency

19   misconduct, Your Honor.

20                 And, in fact, Your Honor, there is -- 1395oo

21   provides no support for the government's proposition

22   that Congress intends undetectable and undisclosed

23   agency misconduct to deprive hospitals of the payments

24   Congress promised --

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Of course, nobody -- nobody

 1   intends that when they -- when they adopt an absolute 


 2   rule.   I mean, you -- you can create a horrible with 


 3   respect to any absolute jurisdictional rule.            That's 


 4   easy to do.   So the mere fact that -- that a horrible 


 5   could occur does -- does not at all persuade me that --

 6   that a rule is not absolute.

 7                 MR. ROTH:    Well, the horrible that we're

 8   talking about here, Your Honor, is agency misconduct.

 9   And it's been a longstanding principle of law that

10   defendants should not benefit from their own misconduct.

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          And why -- why do you say

12   that?   I mean, the record that we have says that the CMS

13   failed to use the best available data.            It doesn't say

14   anything about deliberate concealment.

15                 MR. ROTH:    Your Honor, the -- this case

16   arises on -- comes to this Court after a motion to

17   dismiss was granted, and so that the -- that the -- the

18   Court would have to take as true the allegations in the

19   complaint.

20                 And the allegations in our complaint in

21   paragraph -- in paragraph 30 -- 38, Your Honor, raise

22   this question.   And that can be found -- let's see -- do

23   you have -- in the Joint Appendix --

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Well, in -- in any event,

25   the Baystate case, which is what revealed all of this,


                                     28

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   in -- in that case, the district judge there didn't

 2   say -- he said they didn't use the best available data.

 3   He didn't find any deliberate concealment.

 4                 MR. ROTH:    That's correct, Your Honor, and

 5   because the -- that issue was not before the court and

 6   it was not necessary for the court to make that finding

 7   for purposes of addressing that case.

 8                 I'm at the Joint Appendix at 2829, which is

 9   paragraph 38 of our complaint.           And paragraph 38 in our

10   complaint presented one aspect of this concealment,

11   which was a misleading aspect of the agency's actions

12   here, where the agency said that matching on the basis

13   of Social Security numbers was the best way to deal with

14   this -- this matching of the data that my colleague from

15   the government was -- was discussing.

16                 And it ends up that the -- that it turns out

17   years later that, in fact, the Secretary didn't match on

18   the basis of Social Security numbers.             And that made an

19   enormous difference with respect to how that -- how the

20   disproportionate share hospital benefit would be

21   calculated.

22                 So -- so the reason the district court in

23   the Baystate case didn't have to make findings about

24   fraud or similar fault or delve that much into the

25   agency action was because that case came to the court


                                     29

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   through the traditional appeals process without

 2   having -- and so a finding as to the actions of the

 3   Secretary and -- and characterizing those actions, as

 4   whether they're misconduct or not was, not necessary to

 5   addressing the case as it was before the district court

 6   in that -- at that time.

 7               The -- but -- but we are talking -- while we

 8   are talking about the disproportionate share hospital

 9   payment, Your Honor, let me simply -- let me simply

10   mention that what we are talking about here are safety

11   net hospitals.   We are talking about those hospitals

12   that provide services to -- to a high percentage of poor

13   people, and -- and Congress had found that those

14   patients are more expensive to treat.

15               JUSTICE KAGAN:         But, Mr. Roth, on -- on the

16   legal question here, I think Justice Breyer is right,

17   that this all comes down to congressional intent, how we

18   read this statute.    If you -- one response to reading

19   the briefs in this case is that you and Mr. Manning

20   present opposite views of the statute, and -- and both

21   of you say the statute is clear as to your opposite

22   view.

23               In other words, Mr. Manning says the statute

24   clearly prohibits equitable tolling, and you say the

25   statute clearly requires equitable tolling.        And both of


                                     30

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   you have kind of decent arguments.

 2                And one response to that might be to say,

 3   Mr. Kneedler is right, that the statute is just

 4   ambiguous and that it can be read a bunch of different

 5   ways, and both of you have presented good arguments, but

 6   in the end, it really all goes to show that there is a

 7   lack of clarity here, and then it's up to the agency to

 8   decide.

 9                MR. ROTH:     Well, of course, Your Honor,

10   the -- the statute is clear and equitable tolling is

11   permitted.

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Of course -- of course, one

13   can always make an argument on the other side, and the

14   mere fact that an argument is made on the other side

15   does not prove that it's not clear.               That's what lawyers

16   do.   They make arguments on the other side.

17                MR. ROTH:     But here, Your Honor, the -- when

18   you look at the factors that underpin the government's

19   position here that somehow the government can decide

20   that it can preclude this Court from reviewing agency

21   misconduct -- you heard the government talk about the

22   need for finality.    Well, the need for finality is not

23   something that's articulated in the -- in the Medicare

24   Act except to the extent in a statute that's protective

25   of providers.   There is not a --


                                     31

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:          Are there examples?   I

 2   mean, it seems to me that, even if you lose this -- I

 3   mean, I mentioned the three arguments against you, the

 4   other -- the ambiguity of the language and so forth.             So

 5   if it ends up, even though it's not just a lawyer's

 6   argument, it isn't really that clear, and they do have

 7   some authority, you then have the second string, which

 8   is you say their rule is unreasonable because it has an

 9   absolute 3-year cutoff, instead of a little flexibility

10   there for fraudulent concealment.

11               So -- so do you have statutes, are there

12   statutes that say 3 -- or are there cases that say 3

13   years is not enough, that -- that you have to have more

14   than 3 years?   I thought 3 years is a pretty long time.

15   I mean, I guess they can't go back to fraudulent

16   concealment pre-Civil War -- you know, I mean, there's

17   some period that must be reasonable to cut everything

18   off, and what is that period?           What do the cases say?

19   If it isn't 3 years, what is it?

20               MR. ROTH:     Well, Your Honor, the Secretary

21   has addressed this question in the context of -- of

22   fraud or similar fault by providers, and they said there

23   should be no time limit at all.

24               JUSTICE BREYER:          That's their view there,

25   and their view here, which is a different kind of thing,


                                    32

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   is that 3 years is enough.         The question is, is that 


 2   reasonable?   And do you have any authority that says 


 3   it's unreasonable? 


 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         I thought the 3 years 


 5   provision applied only to the Secretary, that she gives

 6   herself 3 years to go back and sort things out, but only

 7   gives you 180 days; is that right?

 8                 MR. ROTH:    The Secretary -- well, depends

 9   what sort -- if the "sort it out" means recovering

10   overpayments, the Secretary has an unlimited amount of

11   time to recover overpayments that are the fault or

12   similar -- fraud or similar fault on a provider.

13                 If it is not fraud or similar fault on a

14   provider, the reason the Secretary can't go back more

15   than 3-plus years is because the statute permits it.             42

16   U.S. Code 1395gg, which is not cited in the government's

17   brief, that says that, at the end of the third year

18   after payment, that the payment becomes final, as long

19   as the provider and the beneficiary was without fault

20   with respect to the payment.

21                 So that 3-year limitation that the

22   government touts in 1885 was not a subject of an

23   administrative determination that they made.           That was

24   simply they were -- they were following a statute.              And

25   when you look in the Medicare Act for evidence of a


                                     33

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   statute that -- that should limit -- impose finality in

 2   some way, that statute is the only one, and it's

 3   protective of providers.

 4                And what the Secretary has done here is it

 5   enacted -- it promulgated a regulation, and the 


 6   regulation provides for an unlimited time period to 


 7   recover in the face of --


 8                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But Justice Scalia was 


 9   not correct in what he just said.            The 3 years is for 


10   the provider.    The 3 -- under the Secretary's

11   regulations, the provider gets an additional 3 years,

12   but no more; isn't that right?

13                MR. ROTH:     Well, the 3-year is both -- it --

14   it goes both ways, Your Honor, that -- that, under the

15   reopening rule, that providers have up to 3 years to

16   come in to ask for relief.

17                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Yes.     But it's not 180

18   days for them.   It's 180 days, plus an extension up to 3

19   years.

20                MR. ROTH:     It's -- well, but after the --

21   after the 180-day period there is no right to judicial

22   review.   With the reopening -- if there would be a

23   denial of the reopening request, that denial of the

24   reopening request, as this Court said in Your Home,

25   would not be subject to judicial review.


                                     34

 1                 So the extension of time there, Your Honor,

 2   it would -- would be available, but would not have

 3   recourse; and without recourse to judicial review, when

 4   you have an issue here like secretarial misconduct, that

 5   means there will be no review at all, because --

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG: But are you challenging -- I

 7   mean, there is a rule that says that -- there is a

 8   regulation that, for fraud, it's -- the time is

 9   unlimited.    But that -- that regulation, the government

10   says, applies only to the provider, not to the -- the

11   government.

12                 Are you challenging the agency's reading of

13   the word "party" in that regulation?

14                 MR. ROTH:    Well, we -- again, this came to

15   the Court on a motion to dismiss, but we think that

16   the -- the Secretary's interpretation of that ruling has

17   changed from when it was -- when it was promulgated in

18   1974, when during the rulemaking process, they

19   specifically changed that rule to get -- to eliminate

20   the reference only to a provider, and it's to any party.

21                 And so that rule ought to be applied in a

22   way that provides equilibrium, that it would apply both

23   against secretarial misconduct --

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Did you -- did you make

25   that argument in this case?           I wasn't aware that you had


                                     35

 1   challenged the interpretation of -- of the fraud

 2   regulation.

 3                 MR. ROTH:     We -- we speak at some length in

 4   the brief, under this -- under this rubric of the

 5   one-way ratchet.    This is the one-way ratchet that we

 6   were talking about, Your Honor, in that, with respect to

 7   the reopening rule, the -- the Secretary has provided an

 8   unlimited amount of time.         So finality is not an issue

 9   with respect to correcting -- correcting these payments

10   that arise from the fraud -- fraud or similar fault of

11   the provider.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Counsel, I'm about 5

13   minutes behind.    The gg provision that you said the

14   government didn't cite -- you mentioned a provision that

15   ended, anyway, with gg.

16                 MR. ROTH:     Yes, Your Honor.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Is that in your

18   brief?

19                 MR. ROTH:     No.     No.    That is --

 2               MR. ROTH:    No.     Sorry, Your Honor.         We do 


 3   not have -- this is not before the Court. 


 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              It's a little bit 


 5   much to chide the Solicitor General for not citing it

 6   when nobody cited it.

 7               MR. ROTH:    That is true, Your Honor, and

 8   that -- that is correct.     But in citing 405.1885 and the

 9   reason that we're bringing it up, Your Honor, for the

10   first time on rebuttal is that in the -- in the

11   government's reply brief, they went out of their way to

12   try to characterize the reasonableness of the Secretary,

13   you can trust the Secretary here because the Secretary

14   has said, look, after 3 years, we consider there to be

15   finality, and we don't go back after the -- after the --

16   after the providers -- you know, except for fraud or

17   similar fault, as if this had been a gift, an

18   interpretation from the Secretary.

19               It wasn't, Your Honor.              That's why we are

20   raising it here, Your Honor, because, under the 1395gg

21   provision, they can't go back, and that's why they have

22   their reopening regulation and that reopening regulation

23   is an order from Congress.

24               And what we have here, Your Honor, is that

25   you have this concept at least arising from Congress;


                                    37

                                  Official


 1   when you look at the 1395gg, you look at the appeals

 2   statute in 1395oo, is that you have an expectation from

 3   Congress that the providers within their 180 days will

 4   be able to know exactly what happened and why they were

 5   underpaid.   And here, of course, that underpayment was

 6   concealed.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Is that reopening -- is

 8   that reopening provision, the mysterious gg, is -- is

 9   that subject to equitable tolling, too?

10                MR. ROTH:    The -- well, the --

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:         And if not, why not?

12                MR. ROTH:    Well, 1395gg simply says that

13   a -- that a -- that a provider and a beneficiary will

14   not be subject to overpayment recoveries, if they were

15   without fault.

16                And what we -- and whether it would be

17   susceptible for equitable tolling is not before the

18   Court at this point, but that rule at least is applied

19   equally on both sides.

20                In other words, if -- if the -- if a

21   provider was underpaid because of its own fault, this

22   case isn't about any -- any relaxation of that rule.

23   Providers are on the hook for that.

24                On the other hand, where a provider is

25   underpaid because of the secretive conduct, the


                                    38

 1   undisclosed and undetectable conduct of the Secretary,

 2   that is the -- that's an area where we would find that

 3   the very concept of equitable tolling is inherent in

 4   1395oo.

 5                Remember, the trigger point in 1395oo is

 6   notice.   That is -- and, again, that goes against this

 7   concept that it is jurisdictional.                 It's a claims

 8   processing statute.      And here, Your Honor, the notice

 9   was defective.   When they issued --

10                JUSTICE KAGAN:         Mr. Roth, I'm not certain

11   about the extent of your argument, so let me -- let me

12   try something.

13                Now, are you saying that any time Congress

14   passes a statute saying -- you know, there is 30 days to

15   do this, there is 60 days to do this, in the agency

16   context now, as to administrative process, that Congress

17   necessarily means that equitable tolling applies and

18   that the agency cannot limit that equitable tolling?

19                MR. ROTH:      Yes, Your Honor, that, if the

20   issue is the -- is the agency's own misconduct, that

21   Congress would -- to -- to read that Congress intended

22   in a situation under the -- like this under the Medicare

23   Act, where we're talking about a procedural right to

24   that -- to enforce a substantive right.

25                In other words, we have here providers who


                                      39

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   have provided services.        And under their agreement with

 2   the Secretary, they provide services, and they get paid

 3   for those services.

 4                 If there were an attempt to limit that

 5   payment, to cut off that payment because of agency

 6   misconduct, because of the expiration of a -- of a

 7   statute of limitations, we don't believe Congress ever

 8   intended that its payments would be cut off because of

 9   agency misconduct that caused a provider to miss -- to

10   miss a deadline that caused the expiration of a statute

11   of limitations.

12                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I'm not sure how we can

13   limit this to agency misconduct.             Suppose there is a

14   computer glitch in a program, completely good faith, and

15   the computer just spits out the -- the wrong

16   information, and nobody knows about it.                 That's not

17   misconduct.

18                 MR. ROTH:     That's not misconduct.

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And -- but --

20                 MR. ROTH:     We would agree, Your Honor.

21                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But you would say no

22   equitable tolling in that case?

23                 MR. ROTH:     Well, that's not -- that -- this

24   case -- that -- that is a mistake.                 That's an error.

25                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I mean, that would be good

 1   cause.    It seems to me that would be good cause under

 2   the -- under the Secretary's rules.

 3                 MR. ROTH:    That has never been good cause

 4   under Secretary's ruling, but -- potentially.              But that

 5   is not what -- that would be the level -- that would not

 6   be misconduct.   That would not trigger equitable

 7   tolling, as opposed to the facts of this case.

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, I don't know -- I

 9   don't know why it wouldn't.

10                 MR. ROTH:    What's that?

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           You mean to say that if

12   that happened, under the Secretary's rule, the Secretary

13   would abuse its discretion in extending the time for 3

14   years?

15                 MR. ROTH:    For -- excuse me?         For

16   recovering -- for the --

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.

19   appeal?

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.

21                 MR. ROTH:    Well, they don't have to extend

22   the time, Your Honor.      They can simply provide by

23   administrative payment to -- to fix the problem.             They

24   don't have to circle it through -- through an appeals

25   process, if the government found out.             And, in fact,

 1   Your Honor, there is another regulation.             It's 


 2   unfortunately --


 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, I just find it 


 4   hard -- hard to see why this is -- you're saying that 


 5   the equitable tolling rule -- the agency does have the 


 6   3-year rule. 


 7               MR. ROTH:     Right. 


 8               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It is limited to 


 9   misconduct? 


10               MR. ROTH:     Yes, Your Honor.           But the facts

11   that you're talking about --

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            So you're arguing for --

13   in a way, for a narrower rule than what the

14   government --

15               MR. ROTH:     Well, Your Honor, let me say that

16   the facts that you're talking about are addressed

17   explicitly in 42 CFR 405.980.            And what the government

18   has said in that regulation is that, when there has been

19   clerical error, claims can be reopened indefinitely.

20   That's another indefinite time period.

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, suppose it's just

22   what the Baystate court said it is.              It isn't deliberate

23   concealment, but it is failure to use the best available

24   data.

25               And I take it the argument you just presented


                                    42

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   is equitable tolling is tied to misconduct.         So just

 2   failure to use the best available data, not deliberate

 3   concealment, wouldn't make it.

 4               MR. ROTH:    Well, in this case, Your Honor --

 5   well, simply, if it was knowing use of bad data, in

 6   other words, if the government, as in this case, was

 7   aware that there was better data to be had, that would

 8   rise to the level of the kind of conduct that could be

 9   subject to equitable tolling; whereas, simple mistakes

10   are already addressed for the Secretary's

11   regulations --

12               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          So what -- what

13   circumstances trigger equitable tolling, in your view?

14               MR. ROTH:    Well, equitable tolling is

15   certainly triggered under the circumstances of this

16   case, Your Honor, because --

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Yes, but suppose that the

18   fact-finding turns out that the -- that there is no

19   deliberate concealment, but there is merely a failure to

20   use the best available data.

21               MR. ROTH:    Well, if we don't -- if we don't

22   have that extra level of -- of that -- of that level of

23   concealment, Your Honor, I don't think that we would

24   have the misconduct that this Court has cited in the --

25   in the Bowen case, and before that, in -- in Irwin and


                                   43

 2   to the level of which -- at which equitable tolling

 3   would apply.

 4                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          So you would have to

 5   prove that before we know whether there is equitable

 6   tolling.

 7                  MR. ROTH:    We -- we -- well, we've made that

 8   allegation in our complaint, Your Honor.            And we believe

 9   that -- that assuming those allegations to be true for

10   purposes of this hearing, which --

11                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Yes, but I'm asking you,

12   if you get past that hurdle, then we never -- we won't

13   know that there is equitable tolling until we have tried

14   out the question of the character of --

15                  MR. ROTH:    Absolutely, Your Honor.        If we --

16   if we get past this -- this -- this -- and there would

17   be a remand, it would -- the burden then would be on the

18   hospitals at that time to, in fact, show that equitable

19   tolling could apply.

20                  The issue in this Court is whether it should

21   foreclose permanently the availability of equitable

22   tolling, even in the face of allegations of agency

23   misconduct -- excuse me --

24                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       I guess I'm not sure I

25   understand this, Mr. Roth.          Are you saying that, in all

 1   of our cases about the presumption in favor of equitable

 2   tolling, when we talk about equitable tolling, we are

 3   only talking about misconduct or fraud cases -- you

 4   know, as opposed to the case where it's just a person

 5   cannot possibly know the -- the information that would

 6   back up a claim and that we regard that as a good

 7   excuse?

 8               MR. ROTH:       No, Your Honor.            Whether it was

 9   Henderson or -- or other cases, those cases recognize --

10   those cases have focused on what happened to the

11   claimant, and the claimant missed a deadline.                 Holland,

12   it was a deadline that was missed.                 There wasn't

13   misconduct on the other side.

14               JUSTICE KAGAN:          Right.

15               MR. ROTH:       And those were subject to

16   equitable tolling.

17               JUSTICE KAGAN:          Well because I thought that

18   most of your argument was built on the presumption in

19   favor of equitable tolling that we've recognized in

20   those cases --

21               MR. ROTH:       Correct.

22               JUSTICE KAGAN:          -- and whether it applied to

23   the agency context.      But now, you're saying that in the

24   agency context, it's -- it's a different kind of

25   equitable tolling that we are talking about, a more

 1   limited kind?

 2                 MR. ROTH:    Well, the -- what -- the

 3   equitable tolling rule that the Court has found in those

 4   other cases would certainly come into play.             This case

 5   goes farther.    This case even goes farther than Bowen v.

 6   City of New York because it has affirmative misconduct

 7   by the Secretary.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:         So what about -- then let's

 9   get back to the question I really meant to ask before --

10   you know, assuming they have some authority here to

11   write a rule, you want to say a 3-year absolute rule is

12   not reasonable in this situation.            So what is?

13                 MR. ROTH:    Well --

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:         I mean, you want to go back

15   to the Civil War?    I mean, let's imagine you really have

16   the strongest possible case.             All the records burned up,

17   and it took 5 years for scientists to reproduce the

18   records by putting charred pieces of paper together.

19   Okay?   So you couldn't possibly bring your claim until

20   they finished.   That's a pretty equitable claim.            5

21   years okay?   10?   What is the -- 100?           I mean, what?

22                 MR. ROTH:    Well, Your Honor, in this

23   instance, the -- the question of how to limit a

24   circumstance where a provider is not getting paid --

25   gotten paid the amount promised by Congress, one way


                                     46

 1   to -- to limit that is by time.

 2               But recall here, Your Honor, that the

 3   Secretary could eliminate this issue entirely by simply

 4   being more transparent.      This issue arises --

 5               JUSTICE BREYER:          But what I hear you saying

 6   is go back to the Revolutionary War.              If it took 100

 7   years to put the papers together, you're saying no time

 8   limit at all is -- is the only reasonable solution

 9   because there are too many weird cases or unusual cases

10   or misconduct cases.    You've got to have some exception

11   in there forever.

12               MR. ROTH:     Well, if --

13               JUSTICE BREYER:          Is that right?       If that is

14   your position, I just want to know.

15               MR. ROTH:     That is -- that is the position

16   because, in order to -- to prevail in equitable tolling,

17   we would have to show that the providers here were

18   diligent, and that's a self-limiting factor.

19               JUSTICE BREYER:          Okay.       And by the way, do

20   we -- are you supposed to, in such circumstances, give

21   the agency's own determination some weight?

22               MR. ROTH:     The agency's own determination?

23               JUSTICE BREYER:          Yes.    They'll come in and

24   say, I don't care what the cause is, there isn't cause

25   here because we weren't that awful.              And now, does the

 1   judge give them some weight?

 2                  MR. ROTH:    If the Secretary here decided to

 3   attack head-on this concept of equitable tolling and

 4   deal with this question of finality straight up and

 5   say -- you know, here -- here is how we think that --

 6   that finality should be -- should be handled, even in

 7   the -- even in the context of secretarial misconduct,

 8   by, for example, saying within the 3-year period any

 9   provider who feels that we've misrepresented data, come

10   in, you can come in and look at our data, but after 3

11   years, the time limit is over, I think that's a rule

12   that could exist, Your Honor.

13                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, subject to

14   arbitrary and capricious review under Chevron?

15                  MR. ROTH:    It -- subject, of course, to

16   arbitrary and capricious review on that.                But the

17   point --

18                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Why in your case, even

19   assuming that there might be equitable tolling, here, is

20   it -- is it 10 years later?            And there was this Baystate

21   case going on.    You -- you didn't file immediately after

22   that litigation was instituted.            You waited until those

23   plaintiffs won their case.

24                  You waited till there was a decision of the

25   lower court.    So it seems to me you -- you said there's

 1   a requirement of diligence.          Why -- why didn't you have

 2   to file when you were first on notice, which you would

 3   have been from the complaint filed in the Baystate case?

 4               MR. ROTH:     Well, the complaint was filed,

 5   Your Honor, in Baystate after we brought our

 6   administrative appeal.     We brought our administrative

 7   appeal soon after the board -- the administrative board

 8   rendered its decision.     That was the first public

 9   pronouncement that there were flaws with the data.

10               There were some providers who had an inkling

11   that some days might have been missed here or there, but

12   there was no sense in the provider community that that

13   arose from a systematic effort by the government to

14   miscount and then fail to disclose that it, in fact,

15   miscounted and had misrepresented how it had counted the

16   days.

17               So, Your Honor, diligence, of course, will

18   be an issue if we -- on remand if we get -- if we get

19   that opportunity.   But this -- but the -- but the case

20   here arose after the board issued its decision in the

21   Baystate -- in the Baystate case.

22               And there was a -- and there was a

23   discussion earlier about whether the board has viewed

24   its own jurisdiction as limited in some way.         And the --

25   the fact of the matter is that -- that the board here --


                                    49

 1   and I focus on the Bradford case in particular.      In the

 2   Bradford case, the board itself made a determination

 3   that equitable tolling should apply in another time

 4   limit within the -- within the Medicare Act.

 5               That case then goes up to appeal in the

 6   Western District of Pennsylvania, and the -- and the

 7   court says, you know what, we think equitable tolling

 8   should apply, reversing the Secretary, who had reversed

 9   the board's finding that equitable tolling should apply.

10   And in that case, the -- the Secretary didn't leave it

11   there.

12               They petitioned for -- for the court to

13   revisit its determination, which the court did and

14   affirmed its decision with respect to the application of

15   equitable tolling.

16               At that point, the Secretary abandoned -- it

17   didn't seek an appeal.      It allowed the case to go back

18   to the board, and it -- and it -- and it allowed the

19   case to go forward, with that deadline having been

20   equitable tolled.    So when the government portrays this

21   as somehow some kind of consistent view, it's not.

22               This board has engaged in equitable

23   determinations going back for those 37 years that the

24   good cause regulation has been in place because it is

25   that good cause regulation that -- that forced the --

 1   the board to have to deal with these equitable questions

 2   about whether -- whether or not the -- whether or not

 3   the -- the claim should be considered timely, even

 4   though the deadline had to be -- had to be extended.

 5                The -- the facts that we have here, Your

 6   Honor, is that this is really an unprecedented case.

 7   This is an unprecedented case in Medicare, that we have

 8   the agency that says it was doing one thing in a Federal

 9   Register document and actually did something different,

10   that then spent years trying to avoid, as was laid out

11   in the Southwest Consulting amicus brief, avoid having

12   those facts come to -- come to -- come to the attention

13   of the providers.

14                There will not be floodgates that result

15   from this, either at the board or at the Federal court

16   level, because there are -- there will always be, in

17   Medicare, a lead case.     This is what we saw in the Cape

18   Cod case.   There, you had a case that resulted in what

19   looked to be billions of dollars of payments to every

20   single hospital in the country as a result of one

21   district court decision and one court of appeals

22   decision.

23                So allowing equitable tolling to address the

24   misconduct of the Secretary in this kind of case will

25   not -- will not -- will not flood the judiciary or the


                                    51

 1   agency, and it will not -- it will not require an

 2   expenditure of money --

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          How many -- how many

 4   cases are there like this pending, either at the agency

 5   level or in court now?

 6               MR. ROTH:     Well, I think that, when the

 7   government says there are 80 cases that are pending

 8   involving 4,000 cost years and 450 hospitals, those

 9   probably mostly, if not entirely, or for the most part

10   relate to -- to this case.       And depending on how this

11   case unfolds, those cases will all presumably fall into

12   line, just as in the Cape Cod case.

13               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Excuse me.   Is the

14   miscalculation still going on?         I mean, this involved --

15               MR. ROTH:     Well, there was a change --

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          -- claims 12 years ago.

17               MR. ROTH:     Right.

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          But did they continue

19   from that time forward to the present?

20               MR. ROTH:     Well, there was a change in the

21   law in 2004 that now give providers access to the data,

22   so they can look at the underlying access to the data

23   instead of -- instead of the government presenting --

24   preventing them from being able to get access.

 3             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

 4                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 5                MR. KNEEDLER:      Thank you, Mr. --

 6                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Mr. Kneedler, just for

 7   point of clarification, the 3-year good cause extension

 8   that's permitted under the government's regulations,

 9   would that include -- would good cause -- or could a

10   claim be raised that fraud by the agency is the good

11   cause?

12                MR. KNEEDLER:      I -- I think that's unclear

13   under the current regulation.           The current regulation is

14   written in terms of good cause for something that

15   prevents the actual filing of the appeal, like a fire or

16   destruction of records or something.

17                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          That's what I thought. So

18   it's not as if the government is saying --

19                MR. KNEEDLER:      No, no.          But that hasn't been

20   tested as to whether it could.          But that's not the only

21   avenue.   In fact, the predominant avenue for raising

22   claims of -- of new and material evidence, which at

23   bottom this is, evidence that -- that there was not the

24   best evidence used in this match, is the reopening

25   regulation, and that's the regulation that was addressed


                                    53

 1   by this Court in the Your Home case.              There, the Court

 2   made clear that it was a matter of grace, not statutory

 3   compulsion, that the Secretary allowed for any reopening

 4   at all of past cost reports.

 5                 This sort of claim of new evidence, for

 6   whatever reason it wasn't available, could be raised

 7   under that.   But this Court held in -- in Your Home,

 8   that a denial of a reopening was not even appealable to

 9   the board at all or subject to judicial review for

10   reasons of finality and certainty, that, at some point,

11   the cost years have to be closed.

12                 And the Court specifically pointed out that

13   to allow administrative and judicial review of a denial

14   of reopening would circumvent the very 180-day

15   limitation that we have at issue here.

16                 What Respondents are trying to do is to come

17   up with another way of circumventing that 180-day

18   limitation by superimposing, for the first time in 40

19   years, an open-ended equitable tolling regime in this

20   situation.    The Respondents here are seeking to

21   recalculate payment years back to 1987.              The only reason

22   it goes back no further is that's when the DSH payments

23   began.

24                 DSH payments, by the way, go to 80 percent

25   of hospitals.   It's not some limited category.             And what


                                     54

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   is being claimed here is -- is a mismatch of a 


 2   legislative type.    It's not some concealment from an 


 3   individual provider. 


 4                With respect to the allegations in the 


 5   complaint, I'm not in a position to spend time refuting

 6   them here.   We have a footnote in our reply brief that

 7   refers to the government's summary judgment motion in

 8   which the allegations of misconduct are -- are

 9   addressed.

10                I would like to say that -- that whatever

11   label one attaches, jurisdiction, claims processing,

12   mandating, it's absolutely clear that, from the outset

13   of this program, the Secretary understood and

14   implemented the 180-day time limit as limiting the

15   board's authority.    It says an appeal shall be dismissed

16   if it's not filed within 180 days.                No extension shall

17   be granted if requested after -- after 3 years.

18                That 3 years -- Respondent has conceded a

19   regulation that provides for coming in within 3 years to

20   address matters of fraud or anything else would be

21   valid.   That's what this regulation does.               And we think

22   there is no plausible argument at this late date in the

23   Medicare program to suggest that a 3-year limitation

24   on -- on revisiting of closed cost reports is arbitrary

25   and capricious under -- under this Court's decisions.


                                     55

 1               And if we're wrong, as I said, about the 


 2   validity of the Secretary's narrow good cause 


 3   regulation, which simply parallels what's in 


 4   jurisdictional provisions -- for example, notices of 


 5   appeal -- if the Secretary has no authority to do even

 6   that, then the result is the same, there is no broad

 7   equitable tolling.

 8               Just one side comment on this Bradford

 9   opinion, that did not involve the 180-day limitation.

10   That involved a regulatory provision.              The Secretary's

11   consistent position has been, as we cite in the brief,

12   that the 180-day limitation is not subject to any

13   equitable extensions at all because the board is not an

14   equitable body.   And the Medicare program, like the tax

15   program in Brockamp, is not one in which equities are

16   taken into account.      You need absolute rules.

17               Allegations of fraud or concealment are easy

18   to make, but they can -- they can lead to widespread

19   delayed litigation, as the Baystate litigation shows,

20   requiring calling of witnesses -- in this case, 20 years

21   ago -- what happened 15 or 20 years ago.              You would have

22   a hospital-by-hospital determination of when did the

23   hospital know or have reason to know what happened.

24               And we think that that's -- could be chaotic

25   in a program like this.
