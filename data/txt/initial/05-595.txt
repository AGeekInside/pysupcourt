 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We'll hear argument

 7                            ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

 8                 MR. CHANOS:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may

 9   it please the Court:

10                 Crawford v. Washington should not apply

11   retroactively to cases on collateral review because it

12   fails to meet the exacting standards for retroactivity

13   established by this Court in Teague versus Lane.                 In

14   addition, respondent is not entitled to relief under

15   AEDPA.   Teague held that new rules of criminal generally

16   should not apply to cases on collateral review unless

17   they fall within one of two narrow exceptions.                 The

18   second exception, at issue here, is for those new

19   watershed rules of criminal procedure without which the

20   likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously

21   diminished, rules that alter our understanding of the

22   bedrock procedural elements essential to a fair

23   proceeding.    Crawford is not a watershed rule of

24   criminal procedure.

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Could you give an

 1   example, General Chanos, of one that is other than

 2   Gideon?    Is there any other one, or --

 3                 MR. CHANOS:        The only example that this

 4   Court has pointed to in its 25 years of retroactivity

 5   jurisprudence is Gideon versus Wainwright.

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And none other occurs to

 7   you?

 8                 MR. CHANOS:        None other occurs to me at this

 9   time.     None of the cases that this Court has ruled are

10   not retroactive would I find to be retroactive or

11   watershed, and I certainly don't find Crawford to be

12   watershed.    Crawford is not watershed because it is not

13   a rule without which the likelihood of an accurate

14   conviction is seriously diminished and it is not a rule

15   which altered our understanding of the bedrock

16   procedural elements essential to a fair proceeding.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I take it from your

18   presentation you think we do have to go through the

19   Teague analysis.    We can't just rely on 2254(d)(1)?

20                 MR. CHANOS:        No, Chief Justice Roberts.           I

21   believe that you could go straight to 2254(d)(1) and bar

22   relief under 2254(d)(1).

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well then, what do

24   you do about 2254(e)(1), or I guess (e)(2), which seems

25   to suggest at different rule if a case is made

 1   retroactive?

 2              MR. CHANOS:         Well, 2254(e)(2) provides a

 3   cause and prejudice opportunity in the event that the

 4   state court denies relief on a procedural basis rather

 5   than a substantive basis and the petitioner can show

 6   cause and prejudice under 2254(e)(2)(A).                 The Federal

 7   court could then look at the petitioner's claim because

 8   no merits determination had been made by the state court

 9   and, finding the cause and prejudice elements under

10   2254(e)(2), the Federal court would not be precluded

11   from making a merits determination since the -- and

12   conceivably applying a rule that had been made

13   retroactive active under Teague -- because the state

14   court had not made a substantive merits determination.

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Now, my point was

16   that looking at (d)(1), it says is the decision contrary

17   to established law.     And I would have thought that if

18   it's a new decision it's clearly not contrary to

19   established law.

20              MR. CHANOS:         Correct.

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But on the other

22   hand, you look at (e)(2) and it says here's what you do

23   if you're applying a new decision that's that been made

24   retroactive.   So I would have thought that meant you

25   can't say simply because it's a new decision it won't

 1   apply.

 2              MR. CHANOS:        Our reading of 2254(d)(1) is

 3   that Congress intended to have the federal courts give

 4   the state courts deference to the extent that the state

 5   courts made a substantive determination.                 If the state

 6   courts made no substantive determination, there's no

 7   requirement for deference by the Federal courts, which

 8   under 2254(e)(2)(A)(i) the Federal court conceivably

 9   find that there was cause and prejudice under

10   2254(2)(a)(i) under the standards enumerated in those

11   subparagraphs (a) and (b) and could then make a merits

12   determination.

13              There would be nothing that would preclude

14   the Federal court from making a merits determination so

15   long as the state court had not already made a merits

16   determination.

17              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Well, suppose the state

18   has, which is going straight to AEDPA.                 Does that mean

19   that Teague is out entirely, even the first category,

20   that is a decision, a substantive decision that would

21   mean that what defendant did was not a crime?

22              MR. CHANOS:        Yes, Justice Ginsburg.            It

23   would mean under -- under a plain meaning reading of

24   2254(d)(1), if the state court made a determination on

25   the merits, it would bar subsequent Federal review


                                       6

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   whether it was a substantive, a substantive claim or a

 2   procedural claim.     However, in Atkins v. Kentucky there

 3   would be nothing that would prevent the petitioner from

 4   going back to the state court and arguing cause and

 5   prejudice, and then if the state court were to make a

 6   procedural determination on the second petition that

 7   was -- that were to deny the petitioner his claim, he

 8   could take that to the Federal court.                     The Federal court

 9   could then look at that because it was only a procedural

10   determination by the state court on the second habeas

11   claim and the Federal court at that point could look

12   back at the substantive rule as established law because

13   on the second claim they have the right, if he's only

14   denied a procedure -- on a procedural basis, there's

15   nothing that would preclude the Federal court on his

16   second claim from looking back at what would then be

17   established law.

18              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               What is the source of the

19   rule in Teague?     Could Congress overturn the rule in

20   Teague if it wanted to and say that nothing is

21   retroactive or that everything is retroactive?

22              MR. CHANOS:           My understanding is that the

23   rule in Teague is -- the source is not the U.S.

24   Constitution.     It's a judicially created rule that began

25   with Linkletter and developed into Teague and its


                                          7

 1   progeny.     And yes, I believe Congress could pass

 2   2254(d)(1) and alter the habeas procedures, as they have

 3   in enacting 2254(d)(1).

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Habeas is an equitable --

 5                 MR. CHANOS:        I'm sorry?

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Habeas is equitable relief

 7   and the Court has a lot of discretion in identifying the

 8   boundaries of equitable relief, doesn't it?

 9                 MR. CHANOS:        Yes, Justice Scalia.

10                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             I assume that's how we got

11   to Teague.

12                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Let me ask this question

13   as to the basic issue of whether you should be relying

14   on Teague or the statute.            If you're relying just on the

15   statute, how would it apply to a case which was correct

16   under established law at the time that the state court

17   made its ruling, but before the case reached the

18   appellate court, in which there was a change in our

19   interpretation?    What if this case -- if Crawford had

20   been decided while the case was on appeal?

21                 MR. CHANOS:        While under the Court's

22   retroactivity jurisprudence Griffith would control,

23   under 2254 it would not.           22(d)(1) would control.

24                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            So it really makes a

25   difference whether we rely on Teague or whether we rely


                                          8

 1   on the statute if we disagree with you?

 2                 MR. CHANOS:        It make difference.       It makes a

 3   difference.

 4                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, I assume there would

 5   be a Rule 60(b) motion or the equivalent of it in state

 6   court.

 7                 MR. CHANOS:        Yes.

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             If indeed our law had

 9   changed; don't you think?

10                 MR. CHANOS:        Absolutely.

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             I mean, it's inconceivable

12   that the problem wouldn't be solved in some fashion by

13   the state court that rendered the decision.

14                 MR. CHANOS:        I believe that the petitioner

15   would be able to make a subsequent habeas petition at

16   the state court level and if they were somehow denied

17   relief on a procedural basis, there would be nothing

18   that would preclude the Federal court from granting them

19   relief thereafter.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             That's a odd position to

21   take, to   proliferate proceedings that way.              I mean, I

22   thought your argument, AEDPA argument, was:               Too bad,

23   the Federal court is out of it, but the state court is

24   most likely, recognizing that this Court has said what

25   this man did wasn't a crime, to grant him relief.                 But


                                          9

 1   if you're making this two-step and saying, but somehow

 2   we can change the substantive proceeding into a

 3   procedural proceeding, that seems to me odd, to

 4   proliferate proceedings that way.

 5              MR. CHANOS:        Justice Ginsburg, what we're

 6   saying is that Congress in enacting 2254(d)(1) was

 7   stating that the Federal courts should give deference to

 8   the state court decision so long as it is a merits

 9   decision and so long as it complies with existing

10   clearly established law and is not unreasonable.

11              And if that occurs, then Congress under

12   2254(d)(1) was saying give state courts deference under

13   those circumstances.

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:            You're saying not just

15   "clearly"; "then clearly established law."

16              MR. CHANOS:        That's exactly.

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:            That is, at the time of the

18   state court decision. *END STENO

19              MR. CHANOS:        Exactly, absolutely, at the

20   time of the state court decision.               In fact, if you look

21   at the language of 2254(d)(1) it says "resulted in a

22   decision that was contrary to or an unreasonable

23   application of clearly established Federal law.               It

24   doesn't say "is contrary to clearly established law."

25   It says "was contrary to."

 2                JUSTICE STEVENS:              The word was is somewhat

 3   ambiguous.    It could either mean at the time of the

 4   trial court's decision or at the time of the final

 5   judgment on appeal.

 6                MR. CHANOS:          Well, in either case, it is

 7   referring to the --

 8                JUSTICE STEVENS:              I know you win under

 9   either view, but --

10                MR. CHANOS:          Yes, exactly.

11                JUSTICE STEVENS:              -- it could mean either of

12   those two things.

13                MR. CHANOS:          Our, our position would be that

14   it would be up to when the decision became final.

15   Whatever the law was up to the time that the decision,

16   the state court decision became final, that is what was

17   clearly established law.

18                I'll continue with our Teague analysis

19   because we believe that the claim is barred under either

20   analysis.    The --

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Crawford did use the term

22   bedrock?

23                MR. CHANOS:          Yes.       Yes.          And what

24   Crawford -- what we believe Crawford was saying -- well,

25   Crawford said that the Sixth Amendment right to

 1   confrontation is bedrock.          It didn't say that that

 2   decision altered our understanding of the bedrock

 3   procedural elements essential to a fair trial.                    That is

 4   the standard.   Not whether or not the Sixth Amendment is

 5   bedrock.

 6                In fact, if you look at the case of Gideon

 7   versus Wainwright and Betts versus Brady, in Betts

 8   versus Brady this Court had held the Sixth Amendment

 9   right to counsel was not applicable to the states

10   through the 14th Amendment.            Gideon overruled Betts

11   versus Brady and said that the Sixth Amendment right to

12   counsel was applicable to the states under the 14th

13   Amendment.

14                That alters our understanding of the bedrock

15   procedural elements that are essential to a fair trial.

16   In one case, we're saying rights of counsel is not one

17   of those bedrock procedural elements.                   Is not,

18   therefore, applicable to the states under the 14th

19   amendment, Betts versus Brady.              In the next case we're

20   saying right to counsel is it implicit in the

21   Constitution.   It is an essential to the fairness of a

22   proceeding, and it is therefore applicable to the states

23   under the 14th Amendment.

24                That truly alters our understanding of the

 1   trial.

 2                 In contrast, when you look at Crawford

 3   vis-a-vis Ohio versus Roberts, the -- there's a real

 4   distinction there.      In both cases, we know that the

 5   right to confrontation is essential and Federal and one

 6   of those bedrock elements that are essential to a fair

 7   proceeding.    Therefore Crawford doesn't alter our

 8   understanding of what elements are or are not essential

 9   to -- bedrock elements essential to a fair proceeding.

10   Instead it modifies the contours --

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            You make the same analysis

12   if you say the right is not necessarily the right of

13   confrontation but the narrower right of

14   cross-examination.

15                 MR. CHANOS:        Would I make the same analysis?

16                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Because that is central to

17   Crawford.

18                 MR. CHANOS:        Yes.       Yes.          Crawford doesn't

19   tell us that the rights to confrontation or the right of

20   cross-examination is a new right as Gideon tells us.

21   Instead Crawford tells us --

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, there is a new

23   emphasis on cross-examination.

24                 MR. CHANOS:        It alters, it modifies the

25   manner in which we implement that right.                       Under Ohio

 1   versus Roberts there was plenty of cross-examination

 2   that was occurring.       The standard under Ohio versus

 3   Roberts was unavailability and inadequate indicia of

 4   reliability.     There was a reliability screen in place,

 5   and it was clear under Ohio versus Roberts that the

 6   right to confrontation was an essential bedrock right,

 7   essential to a fair trial.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Exactly.         But you know, how

 9   you play the game depends upon at what level of

10   generality you describe the right.                   And I agree with you

11   if you describe the right as the right to

12   cross-examination, that -- that was -- reinstituted by

13   Crawford, which said that the confrontation right is a

14   right to confrontation -- to cross-examination, which

15   didn't exist before.        I mean, you could dispense with

16   that right of cross-examination if there were indicia of

17   reliability.

18                MR. CHANOS:         Well, there were --

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:             I'm not sure that you can

20   so -- in such a facile fashion decide what is a bedrock

21   principle.     Frankly, I don't know any formula that

22   would -- that would describe it.                 I really think it is

23   a -- you know it when you see it.

24                MR. CHANOS:         Well, Justice Scalia --

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:             It is like obscenity.

 1              (laughter.)

 2              MR. CHANOS:          I understand.            The other point

 3   that --

 4              JUSTICE SOUTER:              That gets, if you follow

 5   Justice Scalia's argument, that gets you to, I think to

 6   the argument you have made.             And that is all right, we

 7   have got to look at it pragmatically.                    I mean, what are

 8   the consequences of following a reliability model rather

 9   than a cross-examination model?               And your argument is

10   consequences that are not necessarily more favorable to

11   defendants, in fact -- or more productive of ultimately

12   reliable determinations, in fact.                 And that I take it is

13   your basic point.

14              So I think you've answered what for all of

15   us is a problem.    And that is we don't have a clear

16   analytical definition of bedrock; but if we look to

17   consequences, you have got an argument.                   Your friends

18   don't think it is a good one, but that's your point.

19              MR. CHANOS:          The other point is that there's

20   a second component to watershed which is it must be a

21   rule without which the accuracy of a proceeding is

22   seriously diminished.       There was cross-examination under

23   Ohio versus Roberts.       There -- in Crawford, the language

24   of Crawford isn't a sweeping indictment of -- of

25   Roberts.

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, there wasn't

 2   cross-examination by defense counsel.

 3                 MR. CHANOS:       I'm sorry?

 4                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           In this case there wasn't

 5   cross-examination by defense counsel.                    Or am I

 6   incorrect?

 7                 MR. CHANOS:       There was cross-examination of

 8   the mother, there was cross-examination of the police

 9   detective -- there was cross-examination of --

10                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Oh, oh.         No, I mean of the

11   witness.

12                 MR. CHANOS:       Not of Autumn -- not of Autumn

13   Bockting.    But the important point that I want to make

14   before I reserve the balance of my time is that the

15   question isn't simply, is Crawford accuracy-enhancing?

16   The question is is it a rule without which the accuracy

17   of a proceeding is seriously diminished.                    In other words

18   must all --

19                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           -- accuracy-enhancing then?

20                 MR. CHANOS:       I'm sorry?

21                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           It's a question about how

22   much more accuracy-enhancing, if at all?

23                 MR. CHANOS:       That, and it is really an

24   analysis of Roberts.       Is, is that judicial determination

25   of reliability under adequate indicia of reliability, so

 1   fundamentally flawed that all of the decisions that

 2   were, that were arrived at pursuant to its authority

 3   must be undone, and new trials must occur with respect

 4   to those decisions because it is so fundamentally

 5   flawed.   And our point is that it is not.                 It does not

 6   rise to that level of inadequacy and Crawford is

 7   therefore not a rule without which the accuracy of a

 8   proceeding is seriously diminished.

 9                 Mr. Chief Justice, may I reserve the balance

10   of my time?

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Thank you General

12   Chanos.

13                 Mr. Gornstein, we will hear now from you.

14     ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN, ON BEHALF OF

15       THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING

16                               PETITIONER

17                 MR. GORNSTEIN:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may

18   it please the Court.

19                 Crawford does not satisfy either of the two

20   requirements for a retroactive watershed rule.                  The

21   application of Roberts rather than Crawford did not so

22   seriously diminish the likelihood of accurate

23   convictions as to require the wholesale reopening of

24   convictions that were final before Crawford was decided,

25   with all the societial costs that entails.

 1               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Since you barely

 2   cite AEDPA, I think you assume we need to reach the

 3   Teague question before the AEDPA question.

 4               MR. GORNSTEIN:           Mr. Chief Justice, we do not

 5   have an interest in the AEDPA question because it does

 6   not apply to Federal convictions, the 2254(d)(1), and

 7   there is no Federal conviction analog to 2254(d)(1), so

 8   we are not telling you that you should or should not

 9   reach it.   We just don't have an interest in that

10   question.

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  It is law that is

12   applied in Federal court, though.                 I assume you have an

13   interest in that.

14               MR. GORNSTEIN:           Well, we have a general

15   interest in the way law is applied in Federal court but

16   we do not ordinarily opine on issues just on that basis

17   and we haven't in the past opined on AEDPA issues unless

18   they have some Federal analog carryover effect.                  And we

19   did not here.

20               Now with respect to the reliability prong of

21   the Teague analysis, there are three reasons that the

22   Roberts rule did not so seriously diminish the

23   likelihood of accurate convictions as to call for

24   retroactive application of Crawford.

25               The first is that Roberts had a built-in


                                        18
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   reliability screen.      Hearsay could not be admitted under

 2   Roberts unless a determination was made that there were

 3   particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.

 4                The second reason that Roberts did not

 5   seriously diminish the likelihood of accurate

 6   convictions is that there were other procedural

 7   components that operated in tandem with Roberts to

 8   promote accuracy.     They included the right to

 9   cross-examine the witness through whom an hearsay

10   statement was introduced, the right to introduce your

11   own evidence to challenge the reliability of the hearsay

12   statement.   Defense counsel could point out to the jury

13   all the weaknesses in the hearsay statement and the

14   defendant could count on the common sense of the jury to

15   weigh the reliability of the hearsay statement in light

16   of all the evidence in the case.

17                JUSTICE ALITO:          Can't you make that argument

18   about any, about cross-examination in general?                It is

19   debatable whether -- how good cross-examination is in

20   determining the truthfulness of a witness's testimony.

21   Now, our Constitution decides the issue one way, but any

22   infringement of cross-examination could be susceptible

23   to the same argument that you are making.

24                MR. GORNSTEIN:          Yes.       And I don't think that

25   this is a self-sufficient argument for that reason.                   It


                                        19

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   is just one component of the argument about why there

 2   was reliability.     The fact that there was a Roberts

 3   screen on reliability is an additional factor that

 4   distinguishes my example from what you said.

 5              And the fact is that there was a right to

 6   cross-examine live witnesses here.                   So there was a right

 7   to cross-examine the police officer through whom this

 8   hearsay statement was made.              It is not a case where

 9   there was an across-the-board denial of any

10   cross-examination.

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:               Well I guess you're asking

12   us to say Crawford, get one, take one, it is really not

13   that important.    If that's so, I suppose we shouldn't

14   have overruled Roberts.

15              MR. GORNSTEIN:             No, I think Crawford that is

16   an important decision.         But if you made retroactive

17   every one of your important decisions, you would be

18   reversing the rule of Teague.               What Teague says that is

19   there is not -- that the purposes of habeas corpus are

20   largely exhausted once somebody has received a trial in

21   accordance with then existing law.

22              Because of the importance of finality to the

23   system -- and there are only going to be two very --

24   there's only a very narrow window for watershed rules,

25   of rules that, the accuracy of proceedings beforehand

 1   are so seriously diminished that there is an

 2   unacceptably large risk that systematically, innocent

 3   people were being convicted, and that this is a rule

 4   that approaches Gideon in its fundamental and sweeping

 5   importance.    Those are the only circumstances in which

 6   the Court is going to go back on finality.

 7                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How many times have we

 8   dealt with a quote, "new rule," with the argument made

 9   that it was watershed and therefore should be

10   retroactive?    This is not the first time.

11                 MR. GORNSTEIN:          No, I think that there have

12   been -- I don't know the exact number, but maybe 11 or

13   12, about half of which are ones, are proposed new rules

14   and half of which are ones where the rule was already

15   established previously and the question was whether it

16   was going to be made retroactive.                  And I cited in the

17   brief there are three or four death penalty cases where

18   the Court had already established before each one of

19   them there was a right not to be -- the death penalty to

20   be arbitrarily imposed.          And in each case there was a

21   new rule that built on that basic rule in an important

22   way; but in each case, the Court said it was not the

23   kind of rule that was going to be applied retroactively.

24   And so, too, here.

25                 The third reason I wanted to give about why


                                         21
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   there was not a serious diminishment in accuracy that is

 2   in at least one respect, the Roberts rule actually

 3   promotes more accuracy than the Crawford rule, and

 4   that's with respect to non-testimonial hearsay.                In the

 5   case of non-testimonial hearsay, under Roberts, that

 6   could come in only if determination had been made there

 7   were particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.

 8   Whereas under the Crawford rule, that kind of

 9   non-testimonial hearsay comes in without any reliability

10   check under the Constitution at all.

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But that's not this case.

12              MR. GORNSTEIN:          Well there was actually in

13   this case the mother's testimony about what the daughter

14   said to her.

15              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I'm talking about the

16   daughter's testimony.

17              MR. GORNSTEIN:          Yes.       The daughter's

18   testimony about what she said to the mother illustrates

19   the difference, because that came in through the mother.

20   It only came in because there was a particularized

21   guarantees of trustworthiness to that statement; whereas

22   under Crawford in future trials, statements to the

23   mother -- which are not testimonial -- they will come in

24   through the mother without any screen for reliability

25   under the Constitution at all.             So in that respect, the


                                      22
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   defendant here got more by virtue of the Roberts rule

 2   than by -- than he would have had by virtue of the

 3   Crawford rule.

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is that the case in Federal

 5   courts, too?

 6              MR. GORNSTEIN:          Well, it is a matter of

 7   interpreting -- what protection is left is only going to

 8   be by virtue of the residual hearsay rule.               So there

 9   will have to be some determination made about whether

10   there are sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness.

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:            I mean, it is conceivable

12   that Federal courts would interpret the hearsay rule to

13   require precisely that anyway.

14              MR. GORNSTEIN:          But Justice Scalia --

15              JUSTICE SCALIA:            In which case you shouldn't

16   be making this argument because it applies only to state

17   courts.

18              MR. GORNSTEIN:          No.      I think it applies

19   equally to Federal courts because it is free to the

20   Federal court system to devise a rule that would allow a

21   looser standard of entry than the Roberts standards, and

22   if it did, that would be constitutional.               So there is an

23   interest in that kind of argument in the Federal system.

24              I wanted to move on to the bedrock aspect of

25   the inquiry, which is a separate second inquiry that had


                                      23
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   threshold that has to be crossed if you are going to

 2   find something to be watershed, and the only rule that

 3   the Court has found to be bedrock is Gideon.              And this

 4   rule, Carawford does not approach Gideon in its

 5   fundamental and sweeping importance, and there are a

 6   couple of reasons for that.

 7               First, the right to counsel pervasively

 8   affected all aspects of the criminal trial whereas this

 9   focuses on one limited -- the admissibility of one

10   limited category of evidence, testimonial hearsay, and

11   adopts a somewhat new rule for that than had existed

12   before.

13               The second thing is that under, the right to

14   counsel is deemed so essential to a fair trial that

15   depriving someone of that right can never be discounted

16   as harmless error, whereas Crawford errors can be

17   harmless.   There are a significant number of cases where

18   they are found to be harmless.              So you cannot say that a

19   violation of the Crawford rule always and necessarily

20   results in an unfair trial, whereas you can say that

21   about the right to counsel.

22               Finally, the Gideon rule established for the

23   first time a right to free counsel in all felony

24   criminal trials.   Before Crawford was established, there

25   was a right to cross-examine.             It simply was a different

 1   right.     You had a right to cross-examine the live

 2   witnesses and you had a right to screen out

 3   uncross-examined statements unless they met the

 4   reliability standard of Roberts.                 And the change that

 5   was made was one in which the Roberts rule was thrown

 6   out, and you can no longer get in uncross-examined

 7   statements with a determination of reliability.

 8                 But that is a modification or an incremental

 9   change in an existing right that previously existed to

10   cross-examine, and instead -- unlike the Gideon rule,

11   which established the right to counsel for the first

12   time.

13                 If the Court has nothing further.

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

15   Mr. Gornstein.

17                ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCES A. FORSMAN

18                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

19                 MS. FORSMAN:         Thank you very much, Mr. Chief

20   Justice.    Members of the Court:

21                 This man was sentenced to life in prison

22   based upon accusations that have never been tested by

23   the only constitutionally reliable test that is now

24   acceptable in this Court.            There is no question that the

25   statements that were admitted through the police officer


                                         25
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   were testimonial.     There is no question that if

 2   Mr. Bockting were tried today, that those statements

 3   would not have come in.

 4              The government has argued that the

 5   reliability screen, so-called, that came from Roberts

 6   was sufficient, and it was only an incremental change

 7   when the Crawford decision was decided.                  The fact of the

 8   matter is that this Court found that the reliability

 9   screen that the government has discussed was

10   fundamentally flawed.

11              And in this case, comparing the right to

12   counsel to the right to cross-examination is easy.                    It

13   is easy because it would not have mattered how many

14   lawyers Mr. Bockting had.           It would not have mattered if

15   he had the finest lawyers in the country.                 It would not

16   have mattered if he was Duke Power Company and had every

17   lawyer at the highest hourly rate representing him.                    If

18   he was unable to cross-examine his accuser, just as in

19   Crawford -- in Crawford, there was even an audiotape of

20   what the wife said.      There was an audiotape.             There was

21   a police officer who listened to what she said.                 And

22   this Court found that wasn't good enough.

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Well, we didn't say in

24   Crawford, I don't think we said in Crawford -- I ought

25   to know, I suppose.

 1               (Laughter.)

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:            -- that the new rule

 3   produced greater accuracy.          We said that it was the view

 4   of the framers of the Constitution that

 5   cross-examination, confrontation in that sense, was

 6   necessary for greater accuracy.

 7               Now in our evaluation of what constitutes a

 8   landmark decision, are we bound to the framers' view of

 9   things?   I mean, you know, maybe -- I'm not sure that if

10   you apply a proper interpretation of indicia of

11   reliability under Roberts, I'm really not sure whether

12   it wouldn't be more accurate than confrontation, but

13   that wouldn't matter to me, because confrontation is

14   what the Constitution required and what the framers

15   thought were necessary.

16               Am I bound, for purposes of the rule we're

17   arguing about here, to what the framers think?

18               MS. FORSMAN:         No, Your Honor, you are not

19   bound to what the framers think.               However, I think that

20   you went far beyond simply saying that this was like

21   quartering soldiers in discussing the confrontation

22   clause and the right to confrontation.                  The opinion goes

23   into at length why the Roberts rule was so fundamentally

24   flawed.   You talked about the kinds of decisions that

25   were produced, although this Court said that this Court


                                       27

 1   had pretty much tacked to the same direction as the

 2   framers' view.

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:               I think that discussion of

 4   the, you know, the contrary decisions that had been

 5   produced under Roberts was just for the purpose of

 6   justifying the overruling of a case that -- you know --

 7   that was not that old.         It hadn't worked out as well as

 8   we maybe expected it would.              But I don't think it was

 9   for the purpose of showing that it always produces

10   unreliable results.

11              MS. FORSMAN:            And I don't think that our

12   burden would to be show that it always produces

13   unreliable results.       I think that this Court has clearly

14   taken the position that the only constitutional

15   reliability is the right to cross-examination.             However,

16   throughout your retroactivity jurisprudence, you have

17   been able to distinguish easily between issues such as

18   the exclusionary rule, the right to a cross-section of

19   the community on a jury, and the right to

20   cross-examination.      I would point out to you, the

21   decisions that made Bruton, for instance, retroactive,

22   because the right to cross-examination went so directly

23   to the integrity of the fact-finding process.

24              I think that one of the major difficulties

25   in the argument being taken by the State --


                                         28

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           That's in an instruction,

 2   like Toomey versus Ohio.          The judge is corrupt.       It is

 3   just structural.    You can't say that about Crawford, or

 4   can you?

 5                 MS. FORSMAN:        I don't mean to say, Your

 6   Honor, that it is structural.              I think the issue of

 7   whether something is structural error or harmless error

 8   has to do with whether or not it is measurable, not

 9   whether it's bedrock, not whether it's watershed, not

10   whether it leads to better accuracy.

11                 We know that, because in Teague, although

12   Gideon was the only case explicitly referenced, there

13   was also three other examples mentioned in Teague.

14   There was a trial tainted by mob violence.               There was a

15   trial flawed because of the intentional introduction of

16   perjured testimony.      And there was a trial flawed by the

17   introduction of testimony with regard to a coerced

18   confession.

19                 We know that two out of those three examples

20   are actually subject to harmless error analysis.               So

21   this Court has never tied the issue of the elements of

22   Teague or even the elements of the pre-Teague

23   jurisprudence to the issue of whether something is

24   structural or harmless.         It is the issue, as it was in

25   the more recent decision of Gonzalez-Lopez, of the right


                                        29
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to choice of counsel decision.              They are what the Court

 2   looked to to determine the issue was, is it harmless, is

 3   it quantifiable.   And in this case, courts are

 4   accustomed, appellate courts are accustomed to looking

 5   at the introduction of this kind of evidence and

 6   determining whether or not it is harmless.

 7              The State has not taken a position before

 8   this Court that the Ninth Circuit was erroneous in

 9   determining that this evidence was prejudicial, and

10   therefore affected the outcome.

11              So the issue of accuracy as defined by the

12   State and by the government, the problem with that

13   argument and the easiest way to see the problem in that

14   argument is if you look to Gideon.                 Certainly we

15   wouldn't argue that the insertion of counsel into a case

16   may not result in what the State is defining as a more

17   accurate result.   The insertion of counsel into a case

18   may well cause the exclusion of evidence.                 In fact, in

19   many instances that is exactly what counsel does.

20              So their definition of accuracy if applied

21   to the Gideon case would mean that Gideon would flunk

22   that definition, and wouldn't be the case that has been

23   so repeatedly referenced by this Court as an example of

24   the kind of case that should be made retroactive.

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Ms. Forsman, what about

 1   the cases we're had so far on this second Teague

 2   category?    As far as I know -- well, we haven't found

 3   anything to be retroactive on collateral review so far,

 4   so this would be the first time.

 5                MS. FORSMAN:         It would be, Your Honor, and

 6   it is appropriate that this be the first time.                   As I

 7   previously referenced, those cases fell -- there are 12

 8   of them, by the way.       There were 12 decisions post

 9   Teague applying the Teague analysis in which this Court

10   did not find retroactivity.             The Solicitor General is

11   correct.    Some of those were cases in which on

12   collateral review, the petitioner was seeking to

13   actually create a new rule and apply it retroactively.

14                But if we look to cases such as the

15   retroactivity application of Batson, for instance, what

16   this Court has found is that the Batson rule, the

17   cross-section of the community on a jury, that the

18   purpose of that rule was not created for the purpose of

19   protecting against unjust convictions or ensuring the

20   integrity of the fact-finding process.                   That was not the

21   purpose of the Batson rule, this Court found that it

22   wasn't the purpose of the Batson rule, and that

23   therefore, it would not fall under the Teague exception.

24                That is not so when you talk about the

25   purpose of the cross-examination rule.

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What about the decision

 2   that said Ring v. Arizona was not retroactive on

 3   collateral?

 4                 MS. FORSMAN:        Again, in Schriro versus

 5   Summerlin, the issue there was an issue with regard to

 6   ultimate accuracy of a jury versus a judge.              Again, this

 7   Court found that the evidence was -- the evidence was

 8   equivocal with regard to whether or not a judge findings

 9   or jury findings were more accurate.

10                 Now you might say, well, that sounds a

11   little bit like Roberts.          The problem with that is that

12   it isn't like Roberts, because under Roberts, the

13   cross-examination right, which is something that we held

14   so dear and connected so directly to the right to

15   counsel, having counsel without the right to

16   cross-examination, isn't much of a right.

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           The problem with your

18   case -- maybe it's our problem because it was our

19   rule -- is that we're asked to adopt an across-the-board

20   calculus as to the rule.          In some cases, as I think you

21   will have to concede, under the Roberts jurisprudence,

22   the fact finding was more accurate.

23                 In your case, what you are telling us is

24   that the fact finding is far less accurate.              But I think

25   you are stuck unless you can give us some reason that we


                                        32
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   depart with it.     With a rule-made jurisprudence, we have

 2   to look at the rule in the whole universe of cases, not

 3   just your case.     It seems to me that was the problem you

 4   had in arguing in this area, and maybe you can suggest

 5   some way out.     I don't see it.

 6               MS. FORSMAN:           I can, Your Honor.      The reason

 7   that I can is that the judge does not have the ability

 8   to see the cross-examination statement either.               So if we

 9   start with the premise, when making this reliability

10   determination, we would have to throw out all of the

11   statements in Crawford and all of the previous cases

12   which hold so dear the right to cross-examination and

13   say, but a judge can make a reliability determination

14   without ever hearing the statements cross-examined, can

15   make them in that vacuum without ever testing the

16   reliability of the statements with the -- with

17   cross-examination.

18               And I don't know how you would be able to

19   square that with the strong statements that are made in

20   Crawford.   And the strong statements that are made in

21   the cases, for instance, in the case finding that Bruton

22   should be retroactive, because it goes to the integrity

23   of the fact- finding process.               Unlike all of the other

24   cases that you've talked about since Teague, the

25   integrity of the fact-finding process is what is at

 1   issue here.    Do you have confidence in a result which is

 2   based upon an accuser's statements being admitted

 3   without ever having been cross-examined?

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But Ohio versus

 5   Roberts was not overruled because of a judgment that it

 6   was not doing a good enough job in assessing reliability

 7   of these statements.        It was overruled because of a

 8   judgment that the Founders wanted there to be

 9   cross-examination.

10                 MS. FORSMAN:         That's -- Your Honor, that is

11   the base of the decision.            It harkens back to what the

12   Founders believed.      However, the rule in Roberts was

13   described variously from "amorphous to unpredictable,

14   proof manipulable," to saying that the basis for the

15   right to confrontation and cross-examination comes from

16   a basic mistrust of, even to the levels of a judge in

17   terms of accepting the testimony without the advantage

18   of an actual adversary proceeding.

19                 This case, of course, illustrates the dire

20   need for cross-examination because the accuser in this

21   case testified inconsistently at the preliminary hearing

22   in this case and then was excused before

23   cross-examination was allowed.                The accuser in this

24   case, who was sent to a counselor by the district

25   attorney, when she went to the counselor refused to


                                         34

 1   knowledge that the incident happened, according to the

 2   testimony of the counselor.

 3              And because the court -- and the record is

 4   very scant on what happened here -- the court, the trial

 5   court for instance, under Roberts made only a couple of

 6   findings and he said the testimony was consistent -- he

 7   didn't look at the fact that it had been inconsistent on

 8   at least two other occasions -- and said it was

 9   chronological, at least according to what the police

10   officer said.

11              And so there were only a couple of findings

12   by the trial court at all with respect to                   --

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    You had the

14   opportunity to challenge those findings under the

15   Roberts regime in state court?

16              MS. FORSMAN:            We did.         We did, and that --

17   and that issue was not reached by the Ninth Circuit

18   because after we had argued the case in the Ninth

19   Circuit the Crawford decision was decided; and it was at

20   that point that the Ninth Circuit picked up on the

21   Crawford, and they didn't decide the issue of whether or

22   not Roberts would have meant that this testimony was

23   unreliable anyway.

24              JUSTICE BREYER:               You can still argue -- what

25   hearsay exception did it come in under?

 1                 MS. FORSMAN:        It came in under a Nevada

 2   statute which was patterned after Roberts.                  It came in

 3   under a Nevada statute --

 4                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Adequate indicia of

 5   reliability.

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Adequate indicia of

 7   reliability?

 8                 MS. FORSMAN:        Yes, adequate -- basically,

 9   indicia of reliability.         It didn't go into -- it didn't

10   go into too much more detail than that.                  It just simply

11   required that, a witness under ten, the court must find

12   that the, that the statement is reliable and the

13   statements are reliable, and then --

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Is that universal in

15   Nevada?   I mean, is they are no more hearsay rule in

16   Nevada, that you just evaluate hearsay straight out in

17   every case?

18                 MS. FORSMAN:        No.      No.      That was a statute

19   that was adopted specifically for child witnesses.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            This is for children

21   under ten, isn't it?

22                 MS. FORSMAN:        Children under ten.

 1   who was six years old and was hardly articulate, it

 2   seems from the little we have of this record.                    So the

 3   Nevada statute I think was very specific to children and

 4   was not --

 6   was.     It was   adopted for witnesses under ten.                This

 7   child actually was quite articulate in the preliminary

 8   hearing and was able -- was able to talk about the fact

 9   that she remembered talking to the police officer, that

10   she remembered -- but then, but then in terms of trying

11   to recall the incident, she was unable to recall the

12   incident, and she was unable to recall it in any of the

13   same detail that the police officer testified to.

14                 So it wasn't -- you know, it wasn't a

15   circumstance in which you had a child who simply

16   couldn't speak or a child who couldn't describe what had

17   occurred.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:             So if you lose this case,

19   you can go back to the Ninth Circuit and say, well, even

20   under Roberts it shouldn't have come in?

21                 MS. FORSMAN:          I believe that's correct, Your

22   Honor, because the Ninth Circuit did not reach that

23   issue.

24                 JUSTICE SOUTER:             Would you comment,

25   Ms. Forsman, on your opponent's argument based on

 1   2254(d)?

 2              MS. FORSMAN:         Yes.       I think the easiest way

 3   to explain our position on that is that what has been

 4   articulated here is that a retroactive -- a rule made

 5   retroactive by this court would be applicable to

 6   Mr. Bockting if he had not raised this issue or had been

 7   somehow procedurally defaulted along the way.              In other

 8   words, in order to be able to get the advantage that was

 9   discussed by both the state and the government of the

10   other sections of the statute which clearly recognize,

11   as to the extent that it's relevant the sponsor of the

12   legislation did, that you still have the power to make

13   rules retroactive, but the only way that Mr. Bockting

14   would be able to get advantage of that rule would be if

15   the state court had never ruled on the merits of his

16   claim or had made some sort of procedural ruling that

17   meant that he was defaulted on the claim.              So instead of

18   Mr. Bockting, who has raised this question of being able

19   to cross-examine his accuser from day one in the trial,

20   he cannot have that rule applied retroactively to him.

21   If instead he now, he goes back later and the court

22   says, no, this is a successor petition, you can't, you

23   can't get it, you can't come into our courtroom, the

24   door is slammed on you, according to the state now

25   there's no ruling on the merits of his claim, and that's


                                      38
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   why that section of the statute would permit the

 2   retroactive rule to apply.

 3               2254(d)(1), while it has the language

 4   clearly established, and the court asked some questions

 5   about that, I think it must be remembered that when that

 6   statute is being addressed, it's being addressed in

 7   state court -- or in Federal court, on Federal habeas.

 8   And so at the time that the petitioner is in Federal

 9   court, then the rule has been clearly established.

10               The 2254(d) --

11               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                That's not -- the

12   state has to result -- the state -- it's adjudicated on

13   the merits in state court and results in a decision that

14   was contrary to clearly established Federal law.

15               MS. FORSMAN:        Correct.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So it seems to me

17   that the question is what was the law, what was the

18   clearly established law at the time of the state

19   decision.

20               MS. FORSMAN:        2254(d)(1), I think the only

21   way that you can read that section compatibly with the

22   four other sections which are quoted in our appendix 2

23   of our brief, the only way that you can do that is to

24   recognize, although this Court will recall that it has

25   described AEDPA as not quite a silk purse of legislative


                                      39
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   drafting, but the only way to make those sections

 2   compatible is to say, listen, what was going on when

 3   2254(d)(1) was written was we were talking not about the

 4   timing of the new rule, what we were talking about is

 5   who is it decided by, because before AEDPA was adopted

 6   it wasn't apparent that it must be a decision by you, by

 7   this Court, that established by the rule.                  So that's the

 8   first part.

 9                 And the second part is that it's not dicta.

10   It is an actual holding of this Court that is to be

11   looked to to determine whether or not the state court

12   was wrong.     And so the only way to read that is to say,

13   listen, there has to be some meaning to retroactivity,

14   and what does retroactivity mean?                  Retroactivity means

15   like a nunc pro tunc order, that when you've determined

16   that a new rule is retroactively applicable -- and

17   certainly between AEDPA and the Teague exceptions, which

18   you did say in Horn versus Banks, by the way, should be

19   analyzed differently -- although it has not been tossed

20   up to you directly as it has in this case, the meaning

21   of the 2254(d)(1), you have repeatedly advised that

22   Teague is still alive and well and that when you look to

23   the application of whether a rule should be applied

24   retroactively you look to the Teague exceptions, so we

25   also look --

 1                 JUSTICE ALITO:         Is there any language in

 2   2254(d) that could incorporate the Teague exceptions?

 3                 MS. FORSMAN:        There is not language in

 4   2254(d)(1).    The language -- the reason that we know

 5   that Congress was cognizant of Teague is that there is

 6   language throughout AEDPA, particularly in the sections

 7   that we've quoted to you, that are lifted directly from

 8   Teague.

 9                 JUSTICE ALITO:         What would we say if we were

10   to say that 2254(d)(1) accommodates the Teague

11   exceptions, that Congress meant to put them in but just

12   forgot to do it?    How would we account for the language?

13                 MS. FORSMAN:        I think that what you would

14   say is that

15   Congress would not have deprived you of the power to

16   make a rule retroactively applicable and would have not

17   then created the ludicrous situation which the state

18   suggests would occur here, which is instead of the

19   motivation in Congress in having someone like

20   Mr. Bockting raise the issue from the very beginning in

21   one unitary proceeding, as opposed to going back, which

22   is what they've suggested he must do in order to get the

23   advantage of a retroactive rule, is that Congress was

24   cognizant of that and in order to make all of the

25   statute -- all of the provisions of the statute have


                                        41
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   meaning and not render certain provisions, including the

 2   sections that we quoted, superfluous, that you must

 3   interpret that to mean that the -- that the -- that

 4   2254(d)(1) is not a timing statute.                     It's what law do we

 5   look to.   That must be what they meant.                    Otherwise, the

 6   rest of it just doesn't make any sense.

 7               JUSTICE ALITO:          Isn't that making the tail

 8   wag the dog, because there's language in the provisions

 9   on successive petitions that refers to Teague, that you

10   would read the Teague exceptions into 2254(d)(1) when

11   there's nothing in the language there that can be

12   interpreted to refer to them?

13               MS. FORSMAN:         No.      I don't believe that's

14   the tail wagging the dog, because I don't think that

15   that was the intent of 2254(d)(1).                 I think the

16   intent -- again, I think the intent of 2254(d)(1) was in

17   order to define what kinds of decisions the state court

18   decisions should be measured against.                    There must be

19   some kind of meaning to retroactivity, and retroactivity

20   means that you are making this decision now and you're

21   making it retroactive to the time.                 It is not going to

22   be many things, as we know not only from your decisions,

23   but as we know from the very small core of decisions

24   that Teague left open.       And it is those decisions where

25   we must worry whether or not an innocent man has been


                                       42
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   convicted.    It is those rules that protect against

 2   those -- an unjust, an unwarranted, a wrongful

 3   conviction.    It is only those rules that go to

 4   reliability, that go to the integrity of the

 5   fact-finding process, that you are going to let through

 6   that veil.

 7                 So if it is only that small core of rules

 8   that you reserved in Teague, only that small core of

 9   rules, and we know it won't be many at this point, then

10   if you read that compatibly with AEDPA, it is not and,

11   as we know, it is not going to open the floodgates.

12   There is a very defined period of time in which people

13   can bring actions for relief.              Under your Dodd decision

14   decision, there is only one year, not from the time that

15   you make -- if you were to make, for instance, this

16   decision retroactive, not from today, but it is one year

17   from Crawford that petitioners have the opportunity to

18   be able to come into court within that statute of

19   limitations with regard to the date on which a new rule

20   is adopted.

21                 It is from that date forward.              So there is a

22   defined population.      In appendix 1 of our brief, you

23   will see all of the decisions that we could find that

24   have actually applied Crawford and there were 49 of

25   them.   And what you'll find is that of the decisions --


                                        43

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   and the state and the government have not disputed

 2   this -- of the 49 decisions which we were able to find

 3   at the time of the writing of that brief, only five

 4   actually resulted in relief.            There's no question it

 5   would result in relief here because there is no

 6   contention before you that the Ninth Circuit's

 7   determination of harmfulness -- there is no

 8   determination before you; they haven't challenged that

 9   to you.

10                So it would result in relief for

11   Mr. Bockting.   But because it's harmless error or it's

12   not testimonial or there was a previous opportunity to

13   cross-examine, of the 49 decisions only 5 were found to

14   have to result in relief.

15                And that is as it should be.                The state

16   argues that watersheddedness, if that's a word, is that

17   watersheddedness must mean that it affects many, many

18   decisions.   Now, that can't mean what Teague means.

19   Teague can't mean that my burden is to show you that

20   many decisions will be overturned.                 That's the exact

21   opposite of what Teague was decided for.

22                Watersheddedness has to do with the

23   alteration of our understanding.               It is difficult for me

24   to understand how the change of course as described by

25   then Chief Justice Rehnquist, that the change of course


                                       44

 1   that Crawford represented in the way that we look at the

 2   right to confrontation cannot be, cannot be seen as

 3   precisely the alteration in the understanding of this

 4   bedrock principle again directly from the language of

 5   Crawford.

 6                 We ask you, Your Honors, to make the rule of

 7   Crawford retroactive and to affirm the determination of

 8   the Ninth Circuit.

 9                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Ms. Forsman, can I ask you

10   a personal question?        Were you a moot court finalist?

11                 (Laughter.)

12                 MS. FORSMAN:         I was not.

13                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            I attend a moot court at

14   Notre Dame in about your year and it was an awfully good

15   moot court.

16                 MS. FORSMAN:         Thank you, Your Honor.

21                 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE J. CHANOS

22                      ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

23                 MR. CHANOS:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

24   I only have a few points.

25                 First of all, counsel's argument with regard


                                         45
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   to the interpretation of 2254(d)(1) clearly established

 2   language is inconsistent with the statement made --

 3   statements made by this Court in Lockyer and in Williams

 4   v. Taylor.   In Lockyer, the Court stated Section

 5   2254(d)(1)'s clearly established phase referred to the

 6   holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court's

 7   decisions as of the time of the relevant state court

 8   decision, citing Williams v. Taylor.                    In other words,

 9   clearly established federal law under 2254(d)(1) is the

10   governing legal principle or principles set forth by the

11   Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its

12   decision.

13                 With regard to counsel's point about

14   this case in particular, Bockting, I agree that there

15   are broader issues beyond this particular fact

16   situation.   However, I want the Court to feel

17   comfortable that when this Court sent this case back

18   down to the Nevada Supreme Court and told the Nevada

19   Supreme Court to follow Ohio -- Idaho versus Wright, the

20   factors in Idaho versus Wright to determine

21   trustworthiness, talk about spontaneity and consistent

22   reputation -- repetition, mental state of declarant, use

23   of terminology unexpected of a child of similar age, and

24   lack of motive to fabricate.            Particularized guarantees

25   of trustworthiness must be so trustworthy that


                                       46
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   adversarial testing would add little to its reliability.

 2               Following that admonishment from this Court,

 3   the Nevada Supreme Court found those statements to be

 4   reliable and to satisfy the standards of Ohio -- Idaho

 5   versus Wright.

 6               Finally, I would just point out that

 7   although Caldwell is indeed an important rule, and may,

 8   in fact, be a fundamental rule, so was Batson in Teague,

 9   as was Caldwell in Sawyer, as was Ring in Summerlin, as

10   was Duncan in DiStefano as was Mills in Banks.                 Yet this

11   Court failed to apply retroactive status to any of those

12   important fundamental rules saying none of them rose to

13   the level of Gideon versus Wainwright.                 The same should

14   be true with your decision here with respect to

15   Crawford.

16               Finally, as Justice Harlan stated in the

17   case of McKay, talking about where this Court's

18   retroactivity jurisprudence has come from, no one,

19   not --

20               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                You can finish your

21   sentence.

22               MR. CHANOS:       Thank you.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Particularly if it

24   is Justice Harlan you're quoting.

 2   No one, not criminal defendants, not the judicial

 4   judgment providing that a man shall tentatively go to
