 6               ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY T. FALZONE

 7                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 8               MR. FALZONE:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 9   and may it please the Court:

10               Section 514 did something unprecedented in

11   American copyright law.        It took millions of works out

12   of the public domain, where they had remained for

13   decades as the common property of all Americans.               That

14   violated the Copyright Clause and the First Amendment.

15               Let me turn first to the Copyright Clause.

16   In Eldred, this Court held Congress gets to pick the

17   date on which a copyright expires, and it can extend

18   that date before we reach that date.

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           You said that Congress

20   can set a time limit.      In this case, we're dealing with,

21   let's say, Aaron Copeland, who gets the benefit of

22   copyright, and Congress says:           No, we think Shostakovich

23   should be treated just like Copeland.               Yes, we took care

24   of our own when we weren't part of the world community,

25   but now we are.

                                     3

                                   Official


 1                  And so, all that Congress is doing is giving

 2   Shostakovich works the same limited time as Aaron

 3   Copeland.   And why does that violate the limited-time

 4   prescription?

 5                  MR. FALZONE:      The problem is Congress is now

 6   setting a second limit long after the first one has come

 7   and gone.

 8                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         But the person -- the

 9   person we're talking about, the work we're talking

10   about, never got the first limit.                 There was no -- there

11   was no time, there was no time when that work could have

12   been protected.     So, why isn't it consistent with the

13   Copyright Clause to say, you are entitled to limited

14   time protection?     We're not talking about a case where

15   you've had the protection, enjoyed it, and then it

16   expired, and then Congress says we'd like -- we like

17   your work so much we're going to give you another term.

18                  What's affected here are people who were

19   unprotected.     And Congress says we think that they

20   should have a limited time.

21                  MR. FALZONE:      So, let me just clarify one

22   thing.   Many of the works that were restored here did

23   get some time, 28 years, and were not renewed.

24                  But to get back to your question about the

25   works that got none --

 1                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         They didn't get the

 2   equivalent of what a U.S. author -- but let's take the

 3   large category, because it's the ones that you feature.

 4   You're talking about Shostakovich, Stravinski, and I

 5   say, well, what's wrong with giving them the same time

 6   that Aaron Copeland got?

 7                  MR. FALZONE:      Congress has been setting the

 8   limited time at zero since 1790.              In the 1790 Act,

 9   Congress set the limit at zero for a wide array of

10   works, those that did not comply with formalities, those

11   that were written by foreign authors --

12                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         That's not a limited

13   time.   That's saying you have no time.

14                  MR. FALZONE:      Well, but saying you have no

15   time is itself picking the limit because the language of

16   the Copyright Clause forces Congress to pick a limit

17   that constrains copyright by marking its end.              And when

18   -- if a limit does not mark the end once reached, then

19   there is no limit; there is no end.

20                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         But it has to have a

21   beginning, too.     And that's -- for these people who were

22   unprotected, because we didn't recognize their

23   copyright, there's no beginning.

24                  MR. FALZONE:      No, there does not need to be

25   a beginning.     It is within Congress's discretion.

                                      5

 1   Remember, this is permissive.            Congress may grant

 2   exclusive rights, but it can also say your limit is

 3   going to be zero; we decide that you're not going to get

 4   any exclusive rights.

 5                  And every Congress since 1790, every time it

 6   went to add subject matter, every time it went to extend

 7   the duration of copyright, respected that choice to give

 8   no time.     And, in fact, the time -- the decision to make

 9   foreign authors ineligible is a decision that Congress

10   has never gone back on.         None of the exceptions the

11   Government points to remove anything from the public

12   domain that was placed there based upon a lack of

13   national eligibility.       Two hundred years of history is

14   crystal clear about --

15                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         I can understand your

16   argument that the public domain is untouchable.               I'm not

17   sure I get that from the Constitution.            That says to

18   secure to authors for a limited time the exclusive

19   right.     That -- that's talking about what you can secure

20   to authors.     So, I don't see why using the words of the

21   Constitution, to secure to authors for a limited time,

22   Congress can't say:      We want every author to have a

23   limited time.

24                  MR. FALZONE:      Well --

25                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         The foreign works that we

                                      6

 1   didn't give -- we're not treating them any better.              They

 2   don't get a different startup date, but they get the

 3   same end date as our own authors.

 4               MR. FALZONE:         Right.       The -- the operative

 5   language is the limited times restriction, and the limit

 6   it requires Congress to pick is the date at which all

 7   protection ends for good.            And Congress has picked zero

 8   since 1790 and respected that decision, and that is no

 9   accident.

10               Because the -- the -- if you want to know

11   what "limited times" means, if it means anything, it

12   means if -- for instance, if Congress is not required to

13   respect an expiration date long after it's passed or its

14   decision to deny a work any protection in the first

15   place --

16               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            We're not talking about

17   expiration dates.     So, I'd like you to concentrate --

18               MR. FALZONE:         Sure.

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            That's not -- that's not

20   -- none of these -- none of these copyrights have been

21   extended beyond their expiration date.              They just

22   weren't protected.

23               MR. FALZONE:         Well, taking works that got no

24   protection, if Congress is not required to respect its

25   decision to deny a work any protection in the first

 1   place, we can never know whether we've reached the end

 2   or not.    And, in fact, that's the problem with the

 3   Government's theory.       Its theory says all Congress has

 4   to do is attach a nominal expiration date to any given

 5   copyright.     Well, if that's true, there is -- if that's

 6   all you need, there's nothing stopping us --

 7                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         But is it -- that is --

 8   that is not --

 9                  MR. FALZONE:      -- from reaching back and

10   giving De Tocqueville a hundred years.

11                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         That is most distinctly

12   not before this case.       So, please let's not talk about a

13   copyright that has been protected, has expired, and

14   Congress wants to revive it.

15                  We are concentrating on what Congress did to

16   bring us into compliance with the worldwide system, and

17   it's saying:     We're giving a limited time to these

18   authors.

19                  MR. FALZONE:      Well --

20                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         They never had a limited

21   time before.

22                  MR. FALZONE:      Well, I -- I was talking -- De

23   Tocqueville never got any time, because he was a foreign

24   author.    Ben Johnson never got any time, but on the

25   Government's theory, we could give him a hundred years

 1   right now.

 2                  This statute did work differently.             It

 3   certainly restored copyrights into the existing period.

 4   That's correct.     That is an accurate description of this

 5   statute.     But that is not a limit that's contained

 6   anywhere in the Government's interpretation of limited

 7   times.

 8                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Did anyone in the same --

 9   the same -- published the same year as De Tocqueville, a

10   U.S. author, that would have a copyright protection

11   today?

12                  MR. FALZONE:      I'm sorry.         I didn't hear you.

13                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          I gave the example of

14   Aaron Copeland versus Shostakovich.               Let's go back to De

15   Tocqueville.     Who has a copyright who published in,

16   what, 18 -- what was it?

17                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:          Forties.

18                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Yes.

19                  MR. FALZONE:      The answer is nobody.         But

20   here is the problem.       If Congress wanted to reach that

21   work, here's all it has to do on the Government's theory

22   and even under the mechanism of section 514:                All it

23   needs to do today is extend existing terms a hundred

24   years, and then reach back and restore into that

25   existing term.     So, on the Government's theory and even

                                      9

 1   by the mechanism on which this statute operates, the

 2   government could reach back and protect De Tocqueville.

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Under your -- under

 4   your theory, let's say you have a copyright that expires

 5   on October 5th, okay?     On October 4th, Congress could

 6   extend that for 25 years.

 7               MR. FALZONE:       Yes.

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Right?   But on

 9   October 6th, they couldn't go back and extend it 1 day.

10               MR. FALZONE:       That's exactly right because

11   the limit the Copyright Clause requires us to pick is an

12   end date with permanent consequence.               End dates are

13   about finality.   If that end date doesn't have permanent

14   consequence, if it doesn't have finality, we can never

15   know if we've reached the end or not.               The limit the

16   Framers knew was the limit of the Statute of Anne.

17               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But it seems -- but it

18   seems to me that that was rejected in our most recent --

19   an earlier case on copyright.

20               MR. FALZONE:       In Eldred?

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.

22               MR. FALZONE:       No, no.          Eldred said Congress

23   can move the limit back before we reach it.                But Eldred

24   most certainly did not say that Congress is free to

25   ignore the limit once we hit it, because if you can do

                                   10

 1   that, then you never know if you've reached the limit or

 2   not.     The limit the Framers knew was the one in the --

 3                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Counselor, there was no

 4   limit here, meaning these foreign works were never given

 5   the opportunity to be copyrighted.                Isn't that a

 6   substantial difference from the hypothetical that you're

 7   trying to proffer?     You're -- the hypothetical -- and I

 8   think that's what Justice Ginsburg was responding to --

 9   is you had a copyright, it expired, and now Congress

10   wants to revive it.      Isn't that different from not

11   having had the opportunity at all and being given a term

12   to exploit your work and protect it?

13                  MR. FALZONE:      The answer is no, it's not

14   different; and Congress treated those situations exactly

15   the same in all 19 amendments over the span of 200

16   years.

17                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          The problem --

18                  MR. FALZONE:      It gave equal respect.

19                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          I -- I know, but it

20   didn't do it when it set up the copyright system.

21                  MR. FALZONE:      Oh, it did.

22                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          In 1790, counsel, there

23   were three States that didn't give copyrights.                   There

24   were other States, and you make a big deal in your brief

25   about common law protection, but common law protection,

                                     11

 1   particularly in New York, which you relied on, only

 2   extended to unpublished works.           Once a work was

 3   published, it was no longer protected under the common

 4   law.   That was true of most States.            And some States

 5   gave copyright protection to residents of their own

 6   State but not to residents from other States.

 7                So, it took a whole body of public works and

 8   gave them copyright protection the day they decided to

 9   pass the copyright law.       So, what are you doing telling

10   us that there has never been a historical experience

11   with Congress taking public works out of the public

12   domain?

13                MR. FALZONE:      Well, let me be clear about

14   what happened in 1790.      The 1790 Act did not remove

15   anything from the public domain.            The text is clear,

16   because insofar as it applied to works already printed,

17   it presupposes existing copyrights explicitly in the

18   text of the Act.

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Read those words to me.

20                MR. FALZONE:      So, I'm looking at section 1

21   of the 1790 Act, and at the beginning it talks about

22   "after the passing of this act, the author and authors

23   of any map, chart, book or books already printed within

24   these United States, being a citizen ... thereof, or

25   resident within ... or his or hers executors,

 2   transferred to any other person the copyright of such

 3   map, chart, book or books" --

 4                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Wait a minute.        Who have or

 5   have not transferred to any other person.                  So, you don't

 6   have to have a copyright.

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              You just --

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Right?

 9                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              -- well, you have to

10   have a --

11                MR. FALZONE:      You do have to have a

12   copyright.   So, it says "author or authors" and "hath"

13   is the singular, and "have" -- "have not" is the plural

14   for that.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Read it again.        Who have --

16                MR. FALZONE:      Sure.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- or have not transferred

18   to any other person.

19                MR. FALZONE:      Right.          The copyright of such

20   map.   It presupposes the existence of a copyright.

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Oh.     Oh, the copyright.     I

22   got you.

23                MR. FALZONE:      Yes.          "The copyright" is the

24   key language.   So, the text makes it clear they

25   presupposed existing copyrights.

 1                  And let me speak to --

 2                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          I -- your reading of

 3   that passage is different than mine.              I think it's a --

 4   it's saying if -- whether you have or you haven't.

 5                  MR. FALZONE:      But let me speak to the point

 6   you raised about common law protection for published

 7   works.   You said New York provided no common law

 8   protection for published works.              With respect, that's

 9   not correct.     The Naxos v. Capitol Records case, highest

10   court of New York, says New York common law provided

11   protection for published works right up to the point

12   where the Federal Act cut it off.

13                  And if you look -- and if -- if the question

14   is whether the first Congress intended to take anything

15   out of the public domain in 1790, the answer is you

16   simply cannot reach that conclusion, because everything

17   contemporaneous with the first Congress, the history of

18   the common law in Britain, decided by Millar v. Taylor

19   and Donaldson v. Beckett, recognized common law rights

20   in published works.      The Federalist Papers spoke about

21   Millar, and everything contemporaneous --

22                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          If we disagree with your

23   proposition, does your argument fail?              If the historical

24   work does not point to what you claim?

25                  MR. FALZONE:      You mean the 1790 Act or the

 1   19 after it?

 2                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           In 1790.   If Congress

 3   did what I believe it did --

 4                  MR. FALZONE:      No, I --

 5                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           -- would your argument

 6   fail.

 7                  MR. FALZONE:      No, not necessarily, because,

 8   of course, that was the first Copyright Act, and

 9   Congress established a baseline.              It had to start

10   somewhere.     What we see 19 --

11                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           It could have started in

12   the place you want Congress to have started now?

13                  MR. FALZONE:      Well, no, but then --

14                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           It said, moving forward,

15   there's a Federal copyright.              It didn't have to take

16   things out of the public domain.              We're arguing about

17   whether they did or didn't.              But assuming they did.

18                  MR. FALZONE:      Oh, I will assume they did.

19   They had to start somewhere.              They wanted uniformity.

20   They created a statute that provided it.

21                  When you look at every amendment, 19 times

22   in 200 years after that, Congress respected the

23   permanent consequence of the limits it chose, even when

24   those limits were a work gets no time whatsoever, based

25   on formality and noncompliance, based upon national

                                     15

 1   eligibility, based upon expiration of 28 years.            It was

 2   consistent each time it added subject matter or extended

 3   terms.

 4                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Can you tell me a little

 5   bit about the phrase and the argument about the public

 6   domain?   Is, in your view, that just a synonym for when

 7   the time has ended?     Or is there something more

 8   substantive to it that -- is it your position that the

 9   public somehow owns what's in the public domain?            I'm --

10                MR. FALZONE:       Well -- so, to be precise, our

11   position is once Congress calls the limit, that is, once

12   it says this work is unprotected, whether it's the

13   expiration of 28 years or a decision to give it no

14   protection, it's creating affirmative rights in every

15   member of the public.      Yes, they own it.        And this Court

16   has recognized --

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But -- but how does the

18   phrase -- so, the public domain is simply a conclusion

19   to express that, the operation of that principle?            The

20   public domain doesn't have any more substantive meaning

21   other than to just express the conclusion that there's a

22   limited time?

23                MR. FALZONE:       Well, it -- in this case, when

24   I refer to the public domain, it's the collection of

25   things for which Congress had said protection is done,

                                    16

 1   it's over, we've hit the limit, it's done.             So things

 2   that went --

 3                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:          Once again, it's just a

 4   conclusion for the argument.

 5                  MR. FALZONE:      I think that's the operative

 6   concept here.     That's right.

 7                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          I think you gave an

 8   analogy to the statute of limitations, and I thought you

 9   were quite right about that.             You can extend the statute

10   of limitations before it's expired, but once it's

11   expired, it's over.

12                  The problem with you using that as an

13   analogy is that there was a beginning.             Time ran out,

14   and you're trying to deal with a situation here where

15   you say, you know, the time was limited for the U.S.

16   work, but it's unlimited, that you -- you cannot treat

17   the foreign work -- you cannot give it a limited time,

18   the same limited time that you would give a U.S. work.

19   You're saying these people had no time, and they may

20   never get time.

21                  MR. FALZONE:      They had no time because

22   Congress decided that their works were going to be

23   ineligible, and a limit of zero is one Congress has been

24   setting since 1790 and respected consistently.

25                  If the Chief Justice gives me a limited time

 1   for oral argument, I might say no, thanks, I have

 2   nothing to say.

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But it isn't -- it isn't

 4   quite --

 5               MR. FALZONE:        And we all know I can't come

 6   back tomorrow.

 7               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           -- quite so because there

 8   are these examples of the people who couldn't get

 9   copyright because of wartime both after -- after both

10   World War I and World War II, and -- so, those people

11   were allowed to get the protection that they couldn't

12   get because of the war.

13               MR. FALZONE:        That's correct.     That's what

14   those statutes did.     They were never challenged.        And

15   make no mistake, our position is, insofar as they

16   removed anything from the public domain, they are

17   unconstitutional.

18               But even if the Court doesn't want to go

19   that far, I think the wartime statutes and the other

20   small handful of exceptions the Government points to fit

21   quite well into a very limited exception for eligible

22   authors who show nothing more than the familiar concept

23   of excusable neglect, which has operated -- and, again,

24   in very narrow situations -- to relieve people of the

25   consequences of deadlines.

 1                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             What about new

 2   categories?    You know, architecture.             Congress decides

 3   we're going to extend copyright protection to

 4   architectural design, and they say:               And we're going to

 5   go back 5 years.    So, any new architectural design

 6   conceived or constructed, whatever, within the last 5

 7   years gets protection, and it goes on for another 15.

 8                 MR. FALZONE:      Right.       So -- so -- of course,

 9   to be clear, that's not what Congress actually did when

10   it protected architectural works.

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             No, no, I know.

12                 MR. FALZONE:      It looked forward.         Right.

13                 But that -- so, in that case, the -- the

14   Federal scheme, if it had not previously regulated

15   architectural works, it had not -- there had been no

16   decision as to what the limit was going to be.                  And so,

17   you may pose a different question.

18                 Here, we're talking about works that were

19   affirmatively within the Federal scheme --

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             No, no, I'm just

21   trying to -- I'm trying to test the limit of your public

22   domain --

23                 MR. FALZONE:      Sure.

24                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             -- argument.     Does

25   it extend to new categories of copyrightable works?

                                    19

 1               MR. FALZONE:      I think the answer is the

 2   retrospective portion of that statute flunks progress of

 3   science but -- but passes limited times.

 4               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Would you -- would you

 5   spend a little bit of time on your other argument?              I

 6   take it to be a separate argument apart from the, you

 7   know, time limit argument, the argument that the problem

 8   here is that this law does not promote the progress of

 9   science and useful arts and, therefore, does not comply

10   with the Copyright Clause.        Why doesn't it --

11               MR. FALZONE:      That's right.

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Why doesn't it promote the

13   progress of science and the useful arts?

14               MR. FALZONE:      So, the -- the progress of

15   science corresponds roughly to the creation and spread

16   of knowledge and learning.        A statute that does nothing,

17   like this one, does nothing but take old works out of

18   the public domain without any impact on prospective

19   incentives, cannot stimulate the creation of anything.

20   And as for things that already exist, it cannot

21   stimulate the spread of them.           All it can do is restrict

22   the spread of things that could once circulate freely.

23               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           You don't think that

24   there are some foreign authors who didn't or wouldn't

25   come into the U.S. market because they couldn't protect

 1   their works here and kept their works in other markets

 2   that -- in which it was protected?

 3                MR. FALZONE:      Well, I don't -- I don't --

 4                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           And it doesn't encourage

 5   them to sort of make investments?

 6                MR. FALZONE:      No.       Not -- this statute does

 7   not and cannot do that, because it --

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Why not?

 9                MR. FALZONE:      Because it --

10                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Foreign authors who

11   decided not to exploit their works here wouldn't be

12   induced to think about coming into this market because

13   now they can protect their works?

14                MR. FALZONE:      Well, whether they came into

15   this market or not has no effect on whether they can

16   protect their works or not.            They were unprotected

17   whether they came into this market or not.              They would

18   be protected --

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           You're not answering my

20   question.   You don't think that this law induces those

21   foreign authors to come here and promote their work?

22                MR. FALZONE:      I -- I don't see how it could.

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Well, one way it

24   could, I suppose, is that it shows that Congress is

25   interested in making sure that American authors overseas

 1   have reciprocal protection, an issue that could come out

 2   in a variety of contexts.       And if I'm sitting there

 3   writing a great novel, I will have the confidence that

 4   my government will ensure that I get protection when it

 5   becomes a bestseller in China.

 6               MR. FALZONE:      Yes.

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Right?     Well, that's

 8   -- that's an incentive.

 9               MR. FALZONE:      Yes.      And you were assured of

10   that incentive in 1988, when we joined the Berne

11   Convention without removing anything from the public

12   domain, because when you sit down to write that book

13   today, that work will absolutely be protected in all of

14   the Berne and WTO countries.          So, the incentive effect

15   was achieved and achieved in full in 1988.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             No, I'm talking

17   about -- but the same issue can come up again, you know,

18   whether it's in the area of formalities or whatever.

19   There may be another problem where there's a dispute

20   between other countries and our country.                And I will

21   know that, in the past, the United States has taken

22   action looking out for -- for the interests of American

23   authors.

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             That's an incentive.

 1   Now, it may be, as I think it was described in a court

 2   of appeals decision, a "meager" incentive.              You may be

 3   more interested in other protection.              But it's -- we

 4   haven't really required much more than that.

 5                MR. FALZONE:      Perhaps.         I mean, there's

 6   nothing in -- in the record before Congress here to

 7   reflect the fact they made any such conclusion.

 8                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Let me put it -- I think

 9   it's the same point -- another way.              Let's assume I'm a

10   multibillionaire, and I receive an award as a great

11   patron of the arts because I have furthered the arts by

12   giving several million dollars to someone who has

13   already composed an opera or who has already written a

14   book.   Wouldn't -- wouldn't I be furthering, be viewed

15   as furthering, the arts?

16                MR. FALZONE:      Potentially, but the problem

17   here, if I can move a little bit to the First Amendment,

18   is the mechanism Congress chose to use here.              They chose

19   to create that reward by taking away core public speech

20   rights from the American public and transforming them

21   into somebody's private property.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:           But that's what the

23   copyright law permits, the -- excluding things from the

24   public domain so long as, in the process of doing it,

25   you're furthering the arts.

 1                MR. FALZONE:      Well -- but let me focus on

 2   the First Amendment problem.           An ordinary copyright

 3   statute does not revoke the public's Federal right to

 4   copy and use works in the public domain.           That is

 5   exactly the thing Congress refused to do 19 times over

 6   200 years.   And that's the huge departure from

 7   traditional contours of copyright protection that

 8   triggers First Amendment scrutiny here.           And when you go

 9   to ask the First Amendment question, you can't ignore

10   the mechanism Congress chose to use here, which is to

11   take away public speech rights and turn them into

12   somebody else's private property.

13                That was the explicit motivation of the

14   people who came before Congress and asked them to pass

15   this statute.   That is the justification the

16   Government --

17                JUSTICE KENNEDY:          But now you're saying that

18   there is a substantive component to this public domain

19   argument, that the public does own something.           And

20   that's different from what I thought you answered

21   earlier when you said it's just conclusory for a limited

22   time.

23                MR. FALZONE:      In that case, I misspoke.       The

24   public -- the public domain is owned collectively by the

25   public.   And, in fact, decisions of this Court going

                                   24

 1   back to the 19th century refer to it as public property.

 2   And I think that --

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:           I'm curious to go back a

 4   second.   I thought Justice Sotomayor's question was:

 5   Imagine Smith in Germany.        He has written a book.        It's

 6   there, already exists, but it has no copyright

 7   protection in the United States.            So, after this, would

 8   he be more willing to send it to the United States?               And

 9   I take it your answer is no.            The reason is because I

10   can go and buy a copy and sell it in the United States

11   even without this law.      Is that right or wrong?

12                MR. FALZONE:      I think -- I think that it

13   could possibly incentivize him to bring a work to the

14   United States, depending on how the statute worked --

15                JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, see, that's what --

16   -- isn't that the question?            The question is, now that

17   Smith has the same protection in the United States that

18   Germany gave him, doesn't that give him an incentive to

19   send his book to the U.S.?         I'm thinking about that one.

20   I thought:   Not much, because I can go buy it today

21   without this law and bring it to the United States and

22   sell as many as I want.       But nonetheless --

23                MR. FALZONE:      I think that's right.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:           What is -- that's not

25   right?

 1                  MR. FALZONE:      No, I think -- I think you're

 2   correct.     I think you're correct.              I think that's --

 3                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, don't just jump on my

 4   answer as being correct if it's not.

 5                  (Laughter.)

 6                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Counsel --

 7                  JUSTICE BREYER:           All right.     Then the

 8   answer --

 9                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           It might be his

10   incentive to buy it or not, but the question is the

11   author's incentive to sell it here.                 Those are two

12   different incentives.        Whether -- you know, he could go

13   anywhere and buy a cheaper book if he chose to take the

14   trip or get on the Internet and find it.                 He could do

15   that now.     Copyrighted materials here go at a different

16   price than they do elsewhere.              That's not the issue.

17   The issue is the author's incentive.

18                  MR. FALZONE:      The -- the problem here is

19   these authors are long gone.              You can't incentivize

20   them.     These works are so old they're long gone.                 You

21   can't incentivize anything that's -- that's happened so

22   long ago.     So -- and if you could --

23                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Well, if you can't

24   incentivize them, they're not going to claim their

25   rights.

 1                MR. FALZONE:        I'm sorry.

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             They're not going to

 3   come and claim their rights.              Part of this law is that

 4   they have to declare that they're interested in

 5   protecting their copyright here.

 6                MR. FALZONE:        No.       Actually, that's

 7   optional.   It's optional for them to file a notice of

 8   intent to enforce.     It's optional for them to declare.

 9   But the real problem is --

10                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Optional for them, but

11   once they do, that's when they can sue a prior user.

12                MR. FALZONE:        That's right.       If -- well, it

13   depends who they want to sue, but yes.              That -- they

14   certainly have broader rights once they file the notice

15   of intent to enforce.       But the --

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Of course, the assumption

17   of this -- of this line of questioning, I suppose, is

18   that the mere marketing in the United States of stuff

19   that has already been created promotes the progress of

20   the useful arts.     I'm not sure it promotes the progress

21   of the useful arts.      It makes more money for the guy who

22   wrote it, but it doesn't incentivize anybody --

 8          ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,

 9                 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

10               GENERAL VERRILLI:          Mr. Chief Justice, and

11   may it please the Court:

12               I'd like to begin by picking up on a point

13   that my friend made in response to Justice Ginsburg

14   suggesting that with respect to foreign works what

15   Congress has done is set the copyright term at zero.                 I

16   don't really think that's a fair description of the

17   situation, and it obscures what Section 514 actually

18   does and what Congress is all about here.

19               Since 1891, Congress has concluded as a

20   matter of copyright law that foreign works are entitled

21   to the same protection as domestic works.              The problem

22   with respect to the authors that section 514 covers is

23   not that Congress set the copyright limit at zero; is

24   that as a matter of foreign relations, we did not have

25   treaties with these individual countries.              And what 514

                                   28
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   does is remedy that problem.           What 514 says is, with

 2   respect to a defined set of foreign authors, they get

 3   the remainder of the copyright term that they would

 4   otherwise have gotten, and nothing more, had they lived

 5   in countries where we had -- with which we had copyright

 6   relations at the time they published, or had they

 7   complied with the formalities that we used to enforce

 8   but no longer do to perfect and renew copyrights.

 9   That's what it does.

10               It doesn't grant anybody a perpetual term.

11   It does not renew a copyright term that has run its full

12   course and create a new one.           It rectifies that problem

13   which doesn't -- doesn't reflect anything about a

14   congressional judgment setting the copyright term at

15   zero for foreign works.

16               JUSTICE ALITO:         Could Congress grant

17   copyright protection to works that had lost that

18   protection due to the expiration of the period that was

19   provided for under then -- under previous law?

20               GENERAL VERRILLI:           We think that the --

21   there isn't an ironclad limit that can be derived from

22   the text of the Copyright Clause or from history that

23   would say that Congress is forbidden in any circumstance

24   from doing that.   We do think that there are significant

25   limits in the text of the Copyright Clause that would

                                   29

 1   restrict any ability Congress might have to do that.

 2   But one thing I think is important here is that section

 3   514 is not a statute in which Congress did that, and

 4   we'd respectfully suggest that any assessment by this

 5   Court of whether Congress had that power should await a

 6   concrete context in which Congress exercises it, if it

 7   ever does.

 8                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          What is it that you're

 9   -- that you're referring to?

10                  GENERAL VERRILLI:         Excuse me, Justice

11   Sotomayor.

12                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          You said there are

13   limits.

14                  GENERAL VERRILLI:         Yes.

15                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          What --

16                  GENERAL VERRILLI:         Well, one limit I think

17   is a quite important one is that the Copyright Clause

18   says that you can only grant copyright in authors, to

19   authors.     And as a work gets older and older when you're

20   talking about Shakespeare and Ben Johnson, there really

21   at that point isn't an author in which you could vest

22   the copyright.     And creating any copyright for a

23   long-expired work like that would really, I think, raise

24   the problem that the Framers were addressing by

25   restricting copyright to authors, which -- which was to

 1   avoid the creation of patronage monopolies in which

 2   publishers who weren't the authors could claim the

 3   exclusive rights of copyright.

 4                JUSTICE ALITO:        But doesn't this -- doesn't

 5   section 514 provide copyright protection for works that

 6   were created by people who are long since dead?

 7                GENERAL VERRILLI:         Yes, it does.

 8                JUSTICE ALITO:        So, I don't understand the

 9   limit that you were just suggesting.

10                GENERAL VERRILLI:         Well, because they --

11                JUSTICE ALITO:        Do they have to be dead for

12   some period of time before --

13                GENERAL VERRILLI:         No, but --

14                JUSTICE ALITO:        -- Congress is unable to

15   give them back their copyright?

16                GENERAL VERRILLI:         What 514 does, Justice

17   Alito, is provide copyright protection to works of

18   foreign authors whose works still have copyright

19   protection in their own country, whether they're dead or

20   alive.   So long as the work has protection in the

21   country, then 514 provides copyright protection.

22                And the reason it does so is to ensure our

23   compliance with the Berne Convention.           And so, the why

24   here is very important and, I think, provides the answer

25   to Justice Scalia's question about how 514 contributes

 1   to the progress of arts and sciences.              What 514 does --

 2   514 is, in essence, the price of admission to the

 3   international system.       We decided, the policymaking

 4   branches of our government, the executive and the

 5   Congress, decided that we needed to be -- and it was in

 6   the national interest -- to be part of the international

 7   copyright system and to join the Berne Convention to

 8   accomplish that.     The reason we did so was because our

 9   intellectual property is subject to very serious levels

10   of piracy in many foreign countries because of

11   under-enforcement.

12               By joining Berne, what we did was commit

13   ourselves to the international standards.              And by

14   enacting Section 514 to implement the Uruguay Round

15   Agreements in 1994, what we did was say to the world

16   that we are going to ensure compliance in this country.

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:              General Verrilli, I do not

18   find that an appealing argument.              It seems to me

19   Congress either had the power to do this under the

20   Copyright Clause or it didn't.              I don't think that

21   powers that Congress does not have under the

22   Constitution can be acquired by simply obtaining the

23   agreement of the Senate, the President, and Zimbabwe.

24               (Laughter.)

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:              I do not think a treaty can

 1   expand the powers of the Federal Government.            I mean,

 2   this is either okay under the copyright clause or it

 3   isn't.   Now --

 4                GENERAL VERRILLI:           We completely --

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- it would be nice to know

 6   the reason for it, but you would still have to establish

 7   that it's within the power of the Federal Government --

 8                GENERAL VERRILLI:           We completely agreement

 9   with that, Justice Scalia.

10                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Okay.

11                GENERAL VERRILLI:           There's no textual limit

12   in the Copyright Clause that would preclude Congress

13   from enacting this statute.

14                The Petitioners have also raised the First

15   Amendment argument.    We don't think First Amendment

16   scrutiny applies here.      To the extent it did, the why

17   would matter there, and there's definitely a substantial

18   interest on the part of Congress in -- in ensuring

19   compliance with Berne and getting protection for our

20   works in Berne.

21                Now, in Eldred, the Court did say, I think

22   quite clearly, that there is no requirement under the

23   Copyright Clause that a new financial benefit granted to

24   an existing -- that a new financial benefit cannot be

25   granted to an existing work --

 1                JUSTICE BREYER:           No, but it was -- in Eldred

 2   the main difference is that in Eldred, there was a law

 3   that might, at least in principle, have elicited a new

 4   book.   And in this case, by definition, there is no

 5   benefit given to anything at all that is not already

 6   created.

 7                GENERAL VERRILLI:           I disagree.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:           By -- how?   How does it

 9   give any benefit to anything that isn't already created?

10                GENERAL VERRILLI:           Because it creates

11   additional incentives for authors today and going

12   forward, because they know that there's a much greater

13   likelihood that whatever intellectual property they

14   create will be better protected in foreign countries as

15   a result of our joining the Berne Convention.

16                JUSTICE BREYER:           How does this provision do

17   that?   I think maybe there are other provisions, but I

18   thought this provision is talking solely about books,

19   for example, that are already created.

 7   argument that you could comply in other ways that are

 8   less restrictive.    And whether that's true or not, is

 9   that -- there what you're saying is -- if I parody it,

13   pay more money for things already in existence or will

14   simply be unable to get them if they're orphans, on the

15   one hand, so that other countries will impose similar

16   kinds of restrictions upon their music lovers, music

17   goers, libraries and -- so that they pay more for our

18   works that are already in -- that are already produced,

19   or simply can't use them because they can't find who

20   owns them.

21                Now, that's in parody form, for

22   succinctness, what I think the argument is on the other

23   side --

24                GENERAL VERRILLI:            Right, but --

 1   copyright law -- with your exception of when the country

 2   was founded -- no copyright law has served that kind of

 3   purpose.   That's served often by tariffs --

 4                GENERAL VERRILLI:             But --

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:             -- but not by copyright

 6   law.

 7                GENERAL VERRILLI:             But there's another way

 8   of looking at that, Justice Breyer, of course, which is

 9   that the -- but for the fact that these individual

10   authors lived in countries that didn't have copyright

11   relations with the United States, they would have the

12   protection of our copyright law, and they would have the

13   term of copyright --

14                JUSTICE BREYER:             Not necessarily.     There are

15   three categories.     One is the category of the people who

16   you couldn't, because of the country; that's Egypt, I

17   think, and Russia.     The second is the category of the

18   people -- of sound recordings, and their third is the

19   category, which is not the null set, of people who did

20   not comply with certain registration requirements.                    For

21   example, I believe that the widow of Samuel Brittan

22   failed to renew her copyright.              And there are probably

23   many that failed to renew the copyright after 28 years,

24   and the reason that they didn't is because they didn't

25   think there was much money in it.                 And those are the

 1   very works that the libraries want to get ahold of and

 2   put in their databases.

 3                GENERAL VERRILLI:            And there is no textual

 4   limit in the Copyright Clause that says that Congress

 5   cannot provide the same limited term to those categories

 6   of works that it provides to other works.               There just is

 7   no textual limit.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:            That's true but for one

 9   text.   They say that text has to do with progress.               And

10   when they read it historically in light of Macaulay, in

11   light of the Statute of Anne, in light of going back to

12   Venice and the copyrights, in light of going back to

13   letters between Madison and Jefferson -- that term has

14   always meant produce at least one new thing.               And here

15   there is not one new thing.

16                GENERAL VERRILLI:            And -- yes.

17                JUSTICE BREYER:            All right.

18                GENERAL VERRILLI:            Yes, there is.    First,

19   with respect to section 514, it's part and parcel of

20   joining Berne, and Berne gives protection not only to

21   the previously created works but to newly created works,

22   and it creates additional economic incentives in

23   foreign -- by assuring better protection in foreign

24   countries for newly created works.               So, it creates many,

25   many more than one new work.

 1                  And I think it's also quite reasonable,

 2   Justice Breyer, to read the incentive structure here in

 3   a way parallel to the way the Court did in Eldred, which

 4   is to say that, just as in Eldred the Court assumed that

 5   there was an implicit guarantee to an author making a

 6   creation that that author would get the benefit not only

 7   of the existing term of copyright but any extension, I

 8   think here, with respect to American authors, it's an

 9   implicit guarantee that they get the benefit not only of

10   the foreign protection in existence at the time but any

11   expansion of foreign protection through adjoining

12   treaties, and article 8 -- and section 514 implementing

13   article 18 of Berne is the price of admission to that

14   treaty --

15                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             General, there is

16   something at least at an intuitive level appealing about

17   Mr. Falzone's First Amendment argument.                One day I can

18   perform Shostakovich; Congress does something, the next

19   day I can't.     Doesn't that present a serious First

20   Amendment problem?

21                  GENERAL VERRILLI:         I don't think so, Mr.

22   Chief Justice, and I do think -- for a host of reasons.

23   One is I think that it's -- it's just not so simple, and

24   I think the question that I think Your Honor asked my

25   friend was what about when Congress expands the scope of

                                     38

 1   exclusive rights for existing works?                 Well, Congress has

 2   done that many, many times, and musical composition is a

 3   really good example of that.              In 1831, Congress created

 4   exclusive right in the publishing and vending of musical

 5   compositions, but not in their public performance.                  So,

 6   from 1831 on, once I bought the sheet music, the public

 7   performance was, to borrow the Petitioners' way of

 8   thinking, in the public domain.              You could do it any

 9   time you wanted without having to get --

10                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             All right.    Well,

11   that's --

12                  GENERAL VERRILLI:           -- a license to pay any

13   money.   But --

14                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             That's -- one answer

15   is that Congress has done this before.

16                  GENERAL VERRILLI:           But then, in 1897,

17   Congress granted an exclusive right in the public

18   performance of musical compositions --

19                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Right.

20                  GENERAL VERRILLI:           -- and made it applicable

21   to all existing copyrights.              And so --

22                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Okay.    Well, do you

23   have an argument other than that they've -- they've done

24   this before?

25                  GENERAL VERRILLI:           Well, that they've done

 1   it many times before, and it's a process -- I think it

 2   reflects -- and -- and the point is that no one has

 3   thought with respect to any of those significant

 4   adjustments of the boundaries, that it was an occasion

 5   for First Amendment scrutiny.           And I think that's

 6   because of the wisdom of the Court's opinion in Eldred,

 7   that these are --

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But we have -- but

 9   it's pertinent under the First Amendment in other areas,

10   right?   It's a different analysis if your claim is the

11   government should open up a park as a public forum, than

12   if it's been a public forum for 200 years and the

13   government decides to close it down.               Maybe they can do

14   it, but it's a different question.

15                So, why isn't this a different question,

16   from whether they can extend copyright protection that's

17   already there?

18                GENERAL VERRILLI:          I think -- because I

19   think there is -- once the Court gets into the business

20   of First Amendment analysis, there's no stopping point,

21   because all of the adjustments of the boundaries could

22   have the same kind of effect, I think, as the musical

23   composition example shows.

24                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, what about --

25   what about Jimi Hendrix, right?             He has a distinctive

 1   rendition of the national anthem, and all of a --

 2   assuming the national anthem is suddenly entitled to

 3   copyright protection that it wasn't before, he can't do

 4   that, right?

 5                  GENERAL VERRILLI:         What copyright does, by

 6   definition, is provide exclusive rights in expression;

 7   and so, if the First Amendment is triggered whenever

 8   copyright provides exclusive rights in expression that

 9   it didn't used to provide, then heightened scrutiny will

10   apply any time Congress exercises its copyright power.

11   And what the Court said in Eldred --

12                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             So, he's just out of

13   luck?   And that's just one example of many, where you

14   take existing works and you have a derivative work or

15   something that is distinctive to you.                So, those people

16   are just out of luck?

17                  GENERAL VERRILLI:         Well, of course, under

18   section 514, they're not out of luck because it has

19   significant protections and accommodations for

20   derivative works.     The question of whether there should

21   be heightened First Amendment scrutiny, we think, Eldred

22   answers, that -- that the First -- the Copyright Clause

23   already contains very significant accommodations of

24   First Amendment interests, the idea/expression

25   dichotomy, fair use.       And -- and that is going to

 1   provide -- maybe -- maybe Jimi Hendrix could claim fair

 2   use in that situation.

 3               And those are at the core of the traditional

 4   contours of copyright.       So, if Congress were to try to

 5   extinguish fair use, I'd say yes, we'd have a First

 6   Amendment issue there.       If Congress were to try to

 7   provide exclusive right in the ideas that are expressed,

 8   as opposed to the expression itself, yes, we'd have a

 9   First Amendment issue there.             If Congress were to, say,

10   use the copyright power to engage in viewpoint

11   discrimination --

12               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Well, it seems to me what

13   you're saying, and I'm glad you gave this answer because

14   originally I thought I was going to put in my notes the

15   First Amendment doesn't apply to the copyright area --

16   and that just can't be.

17               What you're saying is, is that this law will

18   pass intermediate scrutiny.             It's an important

19   governmental interest, and it's substantially related to

20   that.

21               GENERAL VERRILLI:             We don't think it would

22   have any problem passing intermediate scrutiny, but we

 2                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:          But can you -- can you

 3   cite me to some -- some authority which says the First

 4   Amendment doesn't apply to a copyright --

 5                 GENERAL VERRILLI:          No.     We don't say it

 6   doesn't apply, but Eldred --

 7                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:          The First Amendment test

 8   doesn't apply.    There has -- there has to be a -- a

 9   test.   Now, maybe -- say it isn't immediate scrutiny but

10   something else.    But -- but certainly the First

11   Amendment is implicated.

12                 GENERAL VERRILLI:          Yes.     And what Eldred

13   said, as I read it, Justice Kennedy, is that unless

14   Congress alters their traditional contours of copyright,

15   then rational basis scrutiny, rather than any heightened

16   form of First Amendment scrutiny, applies.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Even under -- even

18   under rational basis scrutiny, it seems to me that you

19   run into Justice Breyer's concern that the government

20   interest is vanishingly small when it comes to promoting

21   progress under the Copyright Clause, so that the

22   interest weighed on the other side of the -- the

23   restriction of free speech rights -- it's hard to say

24   that that's necessarily going to tip the balance in

25   every case.

 1                 GENERAL VERRILLI:           I think it is going to

 2   tip the balance, Mr. Chief Justice, because the -- I --

 3   the reason Congress enacted section 514, at the urging

 4   of executive branch officials who were charged with

 5   trying to ensure that we could integrate ourselves into

 6   the international system of copyright protection, was

 7   that if we didn't have this provision, then we were not

 8   going to be taken seriously; our works were not going to

 9   be protected in these foreign countries; and that it

10   would defeat the purpose of joining Berne in the first

11   place.

12                 JUSTICE BREYER:           It couldn't have been.

13   That must be somewhat overstated, mustn't it?             Because

14   the only concern is not about protecting new works in

15   the foreign countries.       The concern, as I understand it,

16   was that we've had things in copyright for many years,

17   and we want retroactive protection there.             The countries

18   that didn't give it, like Japan, were not kicked out of

19   the Berne Convention.

20                 Rather, we pursued them in the WTO for many

21   years, and I guess somebody might pursue us.             And then

22   you get into an argument about whether there are other

23   ways.    Now, is that strong enough to overcome what these

24   briefs are full of?

25                 I'll give you an example.           Save The Music is

 1   charged with looking for Jewish music in the periods

 2   '30s, '40s, and '50s.       Other organizations might find a

 3   treasure trove of literature that was -- that was

 4   copyrighted in Czechoslovakia or in Warsaw, and they

 5   want to put it on the Web, and they want people to

 6   listen to it.     But they have no more idea of how to

 7   track down the person on that, and they aren't protected

 8   by any notice requirements because they aren't reliance

 9   parties.

10                  We're told by Barbara Ringer, former

11   registrar, that there are millions of such instances

12   where people would like to go back and would like to put

13   music, literature, film, et cetera, in a form that

14   people can use it today, and there's no way to do it

15   without their becoming scofflaws or without their having

16   millions of dollars to hire infinite numbers of trackers

17   and lawyers.     Now, that's the argument that's made on

18   the other side, as the interest in communication that's

19   important.

20                  What do you say?

21                  GENERAL VERRILLI:         So, two points:   First,

22   with respect to the interest in what foreign countries

23   will do, I think it's incorrect to assume that this will

24   be tit-for-tat, that if we don't enforce article 18, the

25   only thing other countries won't do is enforce article

                                     45

 1   18 with respect to our works, as opposed to believing

 2   that we're not an --       an effective partner and not

 3   enforcing their copyright laws for the whole corpus of

 4   our works.

 5                  Second, Justice Breyer, that problem that

 6   you identified just exists as a feature of copyright

 7   law.   Copyright law exists for a certain time.                With

 8   respect to those works, it's going to create that issue.

 9   The problem here is just the result of a fortuity that

10   those works might have been published in a country that

11   at the time they were published didn't have copyright

12   relations with the United States.                 And what section 514

13   does is address that fortuity by putting those authors

14   in the same position they would have been in had their

15   country had copyright relations with the United States.

16   And so, I don't think that's a principled objection on a

17   constitutional basis to section 514 --

18                  JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, here we have ASCAP.

19   We have ASCAP.     I agree with you that it is a general

20   problem.     It may be diminished in the United States, but

21   it still exists.     And I guess the argument here is,

22   well, don't make it millions of times worse.

23                  GENERAL VERRILLI:           Well, it doesn't make it

24   millions of times worse.         It applies to a small number

25   of -- but a significant number of countries --

 2   Barbara Ringer said a million.            She numbers it in the

 3   millions.   Do you want to say, too?

 4                GENERAL VERRILLI:           No, we don't -- we don't

 5   have any reason to doubt the -- the aggregate number.

 6                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           That's presupposing that

 7   they're all going to give notice.

 8                GENERAL VERRILLI:           Well, with respect to

 9   reliance parties, that's certainly true.            They would

10   have to give notice.     It is the case, Justice Ginsburg,

11   that if you're not a reliance party, then there would be

12   an infringement even without notice.            So, I do think

13   there's something to that point.            But, again, I just

14   think that's a result of the fortuity of the countries

15   not having copyright relations with the United States.

16   It's not about the -- it's not anything integral as a

17   matter of constitutional principle of the statute,

18   and --

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           -- library, the day this

20   law was passed, had to go and pick out all the books it

21   had that were subject to copyright and throw them out,

22   or do what with them?

 3   take --

 4                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          I'm not sure.    How did

 5   they protect themselves from infringement?

 6                  GENERAL VERRILLI:          Yes.    I don't think that

 7   they had -- I don't think there is an act of

 8   infringement by having a library book on the shelf, and,

 9   of course, there are protections for libraries built

10   into the Copyright Act in all events.

11                  And I do -- if I could in my remaining time,

12   I want to go back to the history that we started with,

13   because I do think it is important that there is no --

14   as a matter of text, I think it's clear -- there is no

15   unyielding requirement that you cannot restore copyright

16   to works in the public domain.             I think the history

17   really does bear that out.

18                  I think Justice Sotomayor had the history

19   exactly right, that in 1790, you had three States with

20   no copyright statutes.        Of the 10 States with copyright

21   statutes, you had 7 that did not provide copyright to

22   maps and charts, which the Federal statute did.               And I

23   think this is the key point:             Of the States that did

24   enact copyright statutes to -- in the 1780s, in advance

25   of the 1790 Federal Act, at least four, and depending on

 1   how you counted, as many as eight provided copyright

 2   protection only to works printed after the date of the

 3   State statute.   They did that at the urging of the

 4   Continental Congress in 1783.

 5               So, I don't think there's any doubt that

 6   when Congress enacted the Copyright Act in 1790, it made

 7   a conscious choice to take a different approach, to

 8   grant copyright protection to existing works, including

 9   many, many, many works that were freely available for

10   exploitation in those States --

11               JUSTICE ALITO:           Doesn't that show at most

12   that retroactive protection can be granted when there is

13   an enormous interest in doing so, namely, the

14   establishment of a uniform copyright system at the

15   beginning of the country?          Because if Congress had not

16   done that and had said -- the alternative would be to

17   say things can be copyrighted going forward, then you

18   would have different copyright laws in all of the

19   States.

20               GENERAL VERRILLI:            I think -- I don't think

21   so, Justice Alito.     I think they could have followed the

22   model nationally of prospective copyright only and

23   extinguishing the prior copyright --

24               JUSTICE ALITO:           Right.

25               GENERAL VERRILLI:            -- and -- but they didn't

 1   make that choice.    They made a different choice.           Now,

 2   my friend suggests that the 1790 Act was just a

 3   transition.    But, of course, the same thing is really

 4   true in an important sense of section 514.             It's part of

 5   a tradition -- of a transition of the United States into

 6   the international system, which has required an

 7   adjustment of our rules in order to bring us into

 8   conformity with the international system.

 9                 And beyond the example, of course, of the

10   1790 -- and by the way, with respect to that language in

11   the 1790 copyright -- who hath or hath not have

12   copyright -- that's just a rerun of an argument that the

13   Court rejected in Wheaton v. Peters.             In Wheaton, the

14   Court said that that language in the 1790 Act was

15   referring to pre-publication common law copyright, not

16   post-publication common law copyright.

17                 Beyond that, it seems to me pretty clear

18   that what that language was referring to -- of course,

19   Congress presupposed the existence of copyrights.             There

20   were all these State statutes that created some

21   copyrights.    But what Congress did was act far more

22   broadly.

23                 And -- so, I do think -- and then when one

24   looks at the examples of patents -- and I think the

25   Oliver Evans example and that case is an important

                                    50
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   example.    Early in our history, Congress creates a new

 2   patent term to an expired patent.                 President Jefferson

 3   signs it.     Secretary of State Madison issues it.              Chief

 4   Justice Marshall upholds it as a circuit justice, and

 5   the Court upholds it against a charge that it's

 6   impermissibly burdening people who act in reliance on

 7   the expiration of the prior patent.

 8                  There wasn't a word in this Court's decision

 9   in that case about any potential constitutional

10   infirmity with doing that.           And one would think if this

11   was such a significant and viable principle of

12   constitutional law, that someone would have brought it

13   up in those cases.     In fact, the striking thing about

14   reading the Evans decision is that the Court clearly

15   looks at this all as a matter of legislative policy

16   judgment.     It says, you know, yes, you're right, it

17   might have been an argument, a good argument in favor of

18   creating some reliance interest here, but that's a

19   judgment Congress should have made if anybody was going

20   to make it.     It didn't -- and there is no reading of the

21   -- there's no required reading of that statute that has

22   to protect the reliance party.

23                  So, I don't -- I just think when you look at

24   the patent protection, when you look at the 1790 Act,

25   when you consider the fact that when Congress expands

                                     51
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   exclusive rights, as it did for example with respect to

 2   musical compositions but did in the 1976 Act with

 3   respect to lots of exclusive rights, it does so with

 4   existing copyrights.

 5                And all of that points up the wisdom of what

 6   this court said in Eldred, that within very wide

 7   margins, these are matters for legislative choice.

 8   These are policy calls that require the balancing of a

 9   complex set of interests, the drawing of a complex set

10   of lines made even more complex by virtue of the fact

11   that we are now trying to make a transition into full

12   participation in an international system, which is of

13   vital importance to protecting one of our most valuable

14   economic exports, intellectual property.

15                Thank you.

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Thank you, General.

18             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY T. FALZONE

19                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

20                MR. FALZONE:      Thank you.         I have -- I have

21   four points to make:      First one, refusing to provide any

22   protection for a work is setting the term at zero.              The

23   point of the limited times restriction is it -- excuse

24   me -- it forces Congress to tell us when the end has

25   come.   And if Congress is forever free to change its

                                   52

 1   mind, then we can never know if the end has come.

 2                Point number two, this statute does not and

 3   cannot promote progress, that is, the creation and

 4   spread of knowledge and learning.                 When we joined Berne

 5   in 1988, we got all of its prospective benefits or, as

 6   the Government put it, secured the highest available

 7   level of multilateral copyright protection for U.S.

 8   artists, authors, and their creators.                 This statute is

 9   not about that.     It's simply about rewarding people who

10   made things long ago.       It's --

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           At the time we joined

12   Berne, there was an appreciation that we deferred the

13   article 18 issue.     There wasn't any -- anyone who said

14   that we satisfied it.

15                MR. FALZONE:        No.     There was an express

16   finding -- explicit finding written into the statute,

17   that -- and Congress found explicitly that we could

18   comply with all Berne obligations without removing

19   anything from the public domain.

20                Now, third point --

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Well, there were many

22   people who read article 18 in a different way, and

23   Congress was later persuaded that that was right.

24                MR. FALZONE:        Congress never revisited that

25   finding.   So, no, they found what they found in 1988,

                                     53
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   and they never revisited it.

 2                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          They -- they found that

 3   compliance with article 18 was appropriate for us to

 4   become a full member of the international copyright

 5   community.

 6                MR. FALZONE:      Congress did not make that

 7   finding, and I don't think you can even glean that from

 8   the testimony that was presented to Congress.           The

 9   problem here is the -- the right to use works in the

10   public domain has defined the freedom of speech that the

11   public has known since 1790.           The 1790 Act made these

12   freedoms clear by placing works unambiguously and

13   clearly in the public domain, including all foreign

14   works.   So, even since before we had a First Amendment,

15   that has defined the freedom of speech that the public

16   knew.

17                And that right has also made sure that the

18   copyright sequence provides ever-increasing protection

19   for public speech rights.        It gives partial protection

20   for some public speech interests during any initial

21   period of protection, but that blossoms into complete

22   protection for all public speech interests, once we

23   reach the limit Congress picks, once they place the work

24   in the public domain.

25                The burden on speech that this statute

                                   54
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   imposes is remarkable.       Let's start with the performance

 2   right, which is central to my clients.               There can't be

 3   any doubt, as I think Chief Justice Roberts got at, that

 4   the performance has a huge amount of original expression

 5   bound up in it.    It's the reason it's different to see

 6   King Lear at the Royal Shakespeare Company; it's the

 7   reason it's different when John Coltrane plays a jazz

 8   standard.   Huge amount of expression.

 9                But even if you put performances aside, this

10   Court has recognized in case after case that there is a

11   critical speech interest in publishing the work of

12   another author, in showing a film created by another, or

13   for that matter, performing the work of another.               So,

14   the -- the burden here is it took speech rights of 250

15   million Americans and turned them into the private

16   property of foreign authors, all on the bare possibility

17   that might put more money in the pocket of some U.S.

18   authors.

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           All this rides on

20   accepting your argument that zero is a limited time.

21                MR. FALZONE:       No.      Not on the First

22   Amendment side.    Not at all.          No, no, no.

23                No.   That is -- the First Amendment argument

24   is completely independent of that.               Even if you find

25   Congress could do this on the Copyright Clause, we still

                                    55

 1   have that First Amendment problem, and the -- there is

 2   no way the Government can pass intermediate scrutiny

 3   here.

 4               This was not required by Berne.             The

 5   Government does not even contend Section 514 was

 6   required by Berne, nor could it, because that would

 7   violate Congress's explicit findings they made in 1988.

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Would you say it was

 9   would required by TRIPS?

10               MR. FALZONE:        No.     Because TRIPS just

11   implements Berne.     So that the problem here is this

12   statute was not passed --

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Is it not so that if we

14   don't comply with Berne 18, then we are subject to being

15   sanctioned by some World Trade Organization --

16               MR. FALZONE:        There was very vague testimony

17   about the unsupported possibility that could happen, and

18   that's why the Government falls back on this interest of

19   avoiding a dispute.

20               Here is the problem:             If the government can

21   get around First Amendment limits by signing a treaty,

22   and then the flexibility to take away public speech

23   rights is defined by some complaint proffered by some

24   treaty partner, then the First Amendment is defined only

25   by the perceptions, the complaints, and, frankly, the

                                    56
