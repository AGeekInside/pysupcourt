 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              We'll hear argument

 4   next today in Case 10-218, PPL Montana v. Montana.

 5                 Mr. Clement.

 6                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 7                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8                 MR. CLEMENT:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10                 The State's claim to back rent here is truly

11   remarkable.   When these dams were built back in the day,

12   PPL's predecessors, Petitioner's predecessors, secured

13   all the necessary property rights and easements.               As

14   part of that process, particularly for the dams that

15   created reservoirs, there was an elaborate process of

16   getting flood easements and, in many cases, paying

17   substantial amounts of money.            In that process, nothing

18   was hidden; it was open and notorious.               Indeed, the

19   State assisted by lending the utilities its eminent

20   domain power to deal with holdouts.

21                 But now, a hundred years later, the State

22   comes in with a holdout claim of its own and suggests

23   that it's entitled to massive compensation based on the

24   small strip of riverbed that lies underneath these

25   flooded reservoirs and the dams.            The Montana Supreme

                                                                        4
 1   Court allowed that claim to succeed to the tune of tens

 2   of millions of dollars of back rent.             Now, it did --

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, is your point that

 4   there should be a Federal rule of laches or estoppel, or

 5   are you just building up to the fact that this is

 6   traditional, well-recognized doctrine and there's been

 7   -- and there's been a sudden change?

 8               MR. CLEMENT:      That's exactly where I was

 9   going, Justice Kennedy.      I was suggesting that the

10   Montana Supreme Court could only approve this result,

11   which clearly did unsettle settled expectations, by

12   deviating from well-settled principles of Federal

13   navigability law.

14               Now, the mistakes were a little bit

15   different for each of the rivers at issue.            As to the

16   Clark Fork and the Upper Missouri, the critical error I

17   believe with the Montana Supreme Court decision was its

18   failure to focus on the river segments that are directly

19   at issue and instead focus on the river as a whole.

20               With the Madison, the errors are different,

21   because, as the Madison, there's no evidence that any

22   stretch of that river was navigable at statehood.            So,

23   there the problem was principally that the court relied

24   on modern-day evidence of recreational use to substitute

25   for true historic evidence of commercial navigation at

                                                                         5
 1   statehood.

 2                  JUSTICE ALITO:       On the issue of whether we

 3   should look to the segments or to the river as a whole,

 4   what authorities can we consult?             You rely heavily on

 5   U.S. v. Utah, and that certainly is a relevant

 6   precedent; but there's disagreement about what it means,

 7   and the only authority that I see that U.S. v. Utah

 8   cited was The Montello, which seems to cite nothing

 9   whatsoever.    So, where do we -- is that the end of the

10   trail?   Is there anyplace else we can look?

11                 MR. CLEMENT:      Well, I -- I mean, it's close

12   to the end of the trail.        I mean, you can go back to The

13   Daniel Ball, but that's not going to help you any more

14   than The Montello.     I think, though, that the critical

15   cases really are Utah, but I also think there are other

16   cases that this Court has had.            Oklahoma v. Texas would

17   be an example where this Court has looked at a

18   discernible segment of a river.            Brewer-Elliott is

19   another one.

20                 And I think the starting point for the

21   Court's analysis in every one of these cases has been to

22   look at the segment of the river that's at issue, that

23   has been put at issue.       Now, if you have a sovereignty

24   battle between the State and the Federal Government, a

25   lot of times it's the segment of the river within a


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                           6
 1   State, or in Brewer-Elliott it was the segment of the

 2   river adjacent to an Indian reservation.

 3                JUSTICE ALITO:         Well, all of this, I take

 4   it, derives from the rule that pre-exists -- pre-existed

 5   the adoption of the Constitution, that the sovereign

 6   owned the navigable rivers within its borders.             Is there

 7   some body of common law that addresses this, that would

 8   shed some light on whether that means the whole river or

 9   it means segments?

10                MR. CLEMENT:       There really isn't,

11   Justice Alito, because we get our common law from

12   England.   In England, actually, the common law was

13   different.   At England, the navigable waters ended at

14   the ebb and flow of the tide.             So, every internal stream

15   within Great Britain was viewed as nonnavigable, and the

16   property belonged to the riparians.

17                JUSTICE ALITO:         So, what -- what is the

18   origin of the rule that the original 13 States owned the

19   navigable rivers or parts of the rivers but not the

20   parts that weren't.      That was some feature of American

21   colonial law?

22                MR. CLEMENT:       Sure.      I mean, it was -- it

23   was adopted as part of -- the sort of -- just the idea

24   of creating the sovereign republic of the United States.

25   We borrowed our common law.          I think initially nobody

                                    Official

                                                                  7
 1   focused on these navigable segments.

 2                And it's important to recognize this issue

 3   really doesn't even arise in the eastern United States,

 4   because until about 1850 this idea that States could own

 5   the riverbeds if they were nonnavigable never really

 6   occurred to anyone.      So, in most of the eastern States

 7   as a matter of State law, whether a river is navigable

 8   or nonnavigable, the riparian owns to the middle of the

 9   streambed.

10                So, after 1851, this Court recognizes --

11   makes clear to the States that they actually have a

12   choice.   And so, the States that come into the Union

13   after 1851, many of them, including Montana, adopt the

14   rule that, well, unless these -- if these streams are

15   nonnavigable, then we take the river stream.       And so,

16   that's where the question comes up.

17                So, maybe the reason there isn't a great

18   deal of precedent on this is explained by the fact that

19   this is an issue that largely arises in the western

20   United States.   But that's why I think it's such a

21   mistake to kind of look a gift horse in the mouth, so to

22   speak, and not focus on Utah, because Utah is a

23   situation that seems irreconcilable with the Montana

24   Supreme Court decision and the State's basic theory,

25   because there the special master and this Court

 1   recognize a nonnavigable segment right in the middle of

 2   two navigable portions of stream.

 3               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Could you define "de

 4   minimis" for me?

 5               MR. CLEMENT:        Well, I -- I'm -- I'm happy to

 6   try, but I think -- I'm not going to give you --

 7               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            If we can't --

 8               MR. CLEMENT:        Well, here -- I'm not going

 9   to --

10               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            -- what's the guidance

11   or limit that we set for States?

12               MR. CLEMENT:        I've thought about this a lot,

13   Justice Sotomayor, and I'm not here to give you a sound

14   bite that's a bright-line definition of "de minimis."              I

15   think "de minimis" almost by its nature takes its -- its

16   meaning from the context of the inquiry.            But let me --

17   let me offer at least three guideposts that I think are

18   helpful.

19               One, as a practical matter, I think this

20   Court can look to its own cases dealing with islands in

21   navigable stream, and those cases are on page 17 of the

22   Government's brief.      And this Court's cases say, if

23   there's a small island in navigable stream, under an

24   acre, of negligible value, we basically ignore it.

25   Later cases, though, came along and dealt with islands


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                            9
 1   that were much larger, and the Court analyzed those

 2   separately from the navigable stream and said the United

 3   States actually retains ownership to the larger islands,

 4   and they don't go.     So, that's one place to look.

 5                  The second place to look, I think, is also a

 6   practical judgment based on the nature of the lawsuit.

 7   And here the State itself has come in and identified

 8   stretches of riverbed that they think are significant

 9   enough to generate $50 million in back rent.                 And I

10   think they, having identified those riverbed stretches

11   as being worth $50 million, are hard pressed to then

12   turn around and say, oh, but they're de minimis, just

13   ignore them.

14               The third rule I would point to is that I

15   think topography has something of a role to play here.

16   If you look at the special master's report in Utah or

17   some of the other cases that have decided the point at

18   which the navigability stops, they've pointed to

19   features of the river as defining a discernible segment

20   like a tributary coming in or the geology of the -- of

21   the bed over which the river runs.                 If it shifts from

22   kind of a silty loam to hard rock in a canyon, that's

23   something that you can point to.

24               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            I know you've told me

25   that you think Montello is not pertinent because it


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                         10
 1   involved a different issue.         But assuming that it were

 2   pertinent, because I'm not quite sure how its discussion

 3   doesn't fit the needs here, one of the factors you

 4   haven't mentioned in terms of de minimis is the portage

 5   and its use with respect to commerce.             And by that I

 6   mean, it appeared to me in Montello, what the Court was

 7   saying was the history of use of this river showed that

 8   these obstructions didn't stop the flow of commerce,

 9   that what people did was, it appeared, some extreme

10   things.    They got off -- they got their goods off one

11   boat, walked it a certain distance or drove it by wagon

12   another distance, and then put it on another boat or the

13   same boat that they had lessened the load on and moved

14   it over.    And so, it doesn't talk about the distance of

15   that portage; it talks about the impact on commerce.

16                 MR. CLEMENT:     Right.

17                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         And so, why isn't that a

18   factor in the de minimis issue?

19                 MR. CLEMENT:     Well, I mean --

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         If there were a history

21   here.

22                 MR. CLEMENT:     Sure, but, Justice Sotomayor,

23   I think -- I mean, there are sort of two portages that

24   are floating around in The Montello, and I think it's

25   important to distinguish between the two.            There's kind


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official

                                                                            11
 1   of the classic overland portage between the Fox River

 2   and the Wisconsin River.

 3                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         There was a canal in

 4   there, wasn't there?

 5                  MR. CLEMENT:     Well, afterwards.      But

 6   originally that was an overland portage.            And so, that's

 7   really not at issue, but that's kind of the -- you know,

 8   the classic portage I have in mind is an overland

 9   portage.

10               Now, they're also talking about the extreme

11   efforts, and you could call them portages.           I don't

12   think you need to.     But there's also talk about the

13   extreme efforts to enable navigation on the Fox before

14   improvement.

15               But that's nothing like what's at issue here

16   because those were efforts basically to use the riverbed

17   to -- and they had to do some extraordinary things:              get

18   ox to pull the boat, lift them up over some rocks.             But

19   they never really left the bed of the river there.

20   Where they left the bed of the river was the portage

21   over to the Wisconsin.

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Well, in Montello, they

23   took the cargo off some boats --

24               MR. CLEMENT:        Oh, absolutely.

25               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            -- and moved it overland

 1   to another spot before they put it back on a boat.

 2               MR. CLEMENT:     Sure, but my understanding of

 3   what was going on there -- and maybe I misunderstood it,

 4   but I understand what they're talking about there is a

 5   portage where you take the cargo out of the boat in

 6   order to lighten the draft of the boat so it's not

 7   sitting as deeply in the river, and that allows the

 8   lighter boat to be carried over the --

 9               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         We can both look at the

10   opinion, but I think there is one spot where the Court

11   says that in some areas they had to change boats.

12               MR. CLEMENT:     Well -- and that may be, but,

13   I mean, again, I don't think we're talking about

14   anything like the distances that we're talking here, and

15   I also --

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         I don't disagree with

17   you, but I -- what I'm asking is, if we had a history of

18   navigation of cargo that went to the beginning of one of

19   these rivers -- and I'm not a sailor, so my terms -- the

20   cargo is taken off and driven by wagon or some other

21   mode to another spot and picked up again.         Is that a

22   different situation than one where that doesn't happen?

23   That because this -- this length of portage is so long

24   that it is both economically and physically impossible

25   to transport cargo in that way.         Is that a different

 1   case for the question of navigability?

 2                 MR. CLEMENT:      Well, sure, because these are

 3   all matters of degree, and those would be two different

 4   cases.     But here's what I would point you to, which is,

 5   if at the point that you have to take the cargo off of

 6   the boats, and then you then have to leave the channel,

 7   you don't just do a little cut around some de minimus

 8   amount, but you leave the channel and go overland, at

 9   that point, I think, that portage demonstrates the

10   non-navigability of the bypassed stretch.                 And then I

11   think --

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, maybe it

13   demonstrates the non-navigability of the particular

14   stretch, but we would still speak of the transfer of

15   commerce as being along the river.

16                 MR. CLEMENT:      Well, I don't --

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               The sort of case --

18   the analogy I was thinking of is if I say I fly from

19   Washington to Tokyo; and someone says, no, you didn't,

20   you flew to San Francisco, then you walked however many

21   yards from one gate to another, and then you flew to

22   Tokyo.   And I would say, well, yes, there's a gap there

23   when I -- you know, part of the distance where I wasn't

24   flying, but people would still say you flew from D.C. to

25   Tokyo.   Now, why isn't this just like that, that the

 1   commercial path, the commercial waterway people think of

 2   as the Missouri?    And, yes, occasionally you've got to

 3   get out, and, you know, we can debate how long the

 4   portage is, but it doesn't interrupt the notion that

 5   that whole pathway would qualify as a navigable

 6   waterway.

 7                 MR. CLEMENT:      Well, two things,

 8   Mr. Chief Justice.     One is I do want to make clear that

 9   we very much dispute factually that there ever was this

10   kind of commercial portage over the Great Falls.              And

11   the really -- you know, there's very little evidence for

12   the record.   The State's own evidence identifies Fort

13   Benton 30 miles below the Great Falls as the head of

14   navigation on the Missouri.          So, there is very much a

15   factual issue here.

16                 But to answer the legal question you're

17   asking, first of all, I'm not sure I would have the same

18   instinct about the common parlance if you had to go from

19   JFK to LaGuardia in a cab.          And I'm even less sure that

20   you would have the same notion if you had to drive from

21   San Francisco to LA to switch planes.              And I think the

22   distance here really does matter.             And I would submit

23   the way you think about this, the way I would think

24   about this, is that the very need to bypass, especially

25   a substantial bypass where you leave the river channel,

                                                                         15
 1   is evidence that that part of the channel, that part of

 2   the river, is nonnavigable.

 3                JUSTICE ALITO:       I don't see why --

 4                MR. CLEMENT:     And then the question that's

 5   left is whether that's de minimis.

 6                JUSTICE ALITO:       I don't see why portage is

 7   relevant at all.   What's the basis for the rule that the

 8   sovereign owns the navigable rivers?             I assume it's

 9   because they are viewed -- they were viewed as highways

10   for transportation and commerce.           And to the extent that

11   there's an obstruction that cannot be traversed by a

12   boat, then there isn't going to be any commerce or

13   transportation along that area.

14               Now, there might be an argument that the

15   sovereign should own the land next to the river so that

16   you could portage around it, but what -- what would be

17   the justification for saying the sovereign owns the

18   portion of the river that can't be traversed at all by

19   boat?   I just don't understand it.

20               MR. CLEMENT:      Well, I'm with you on that,

21   Justice Alito, and I think, you know, logically, if you

22   think what's the highway of commerce here, if there

23   really was this 18-mile overland portage route, that

24   would be the highway of commerce, but the 17-mile

25   bypassed stretch of the Missouri and the Great Falls

 1   Reach would not be a highway of commerce.             And I think

 2   that gets back to the expectations of the property owner

 3   that ultimately underlie these title questions.

 4                  I mean, if you have boats going by a river

 5   in your backyard, I mean, you have -- you're on sort of

 6   notice that you don't own the riverbed.             But if you're

 7   in a part of the river that's -- that's so unnavigable

 8   that it has to be bypassed and you've never seen a boat

 9   in your experience ever, then I think you have very

10   different expectations, and your expectations would be

11   the same as somebody who --

12               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Seventeen miles is very

13   long.

14               MR. CLEMENT:        It is --

15               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             I think the Thompson is

16   only 2.8.

17               MR. CLEMENT:        Well --

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             That's really close to

19   Montello, where it talked about, about 2 miles for some

20   portage areas.

21               MR. CLEMENT:        Well, with respect, if I could

22   take both points, I mean, you're absolutely right.

23   Seventeen miles is very long.             I mean, for the New

24   Yorkers, you know, the East River is 16 miles long, the

25   whole river.    The Anacostia River is 8-1/2 miles long.

 1   So, this bypass stretch --

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            But I'm not a

 3   Midwesterner, and rivers of 200 miles are normal there,

 4   I understand.

 5                MR. CLEMENT:       Well, these -- this is still a

 6   big stretch and I do think, like I said, longer than

 7   some entire rivers.      But the Thompson Falls -- I mean,

 8   the 2 miles of the Thompson Fall, I don't know exactly

 9   where that number comes from.             It's kind of an

10   artificiality.    I mean, there -- again, the State's own

11   evidence, look at JA 57, says that navigation stopped at

12   Thompson Falls.    There wasn't a portage around.

13               But the other point is I would also ask you

14   to look at the 1910 court decree because, as I said at

15   the outset, you know, these companies didn't just put

16   these dams up overnight as, you know, kind of -- as a

17   lark.   They went through elaborate efforts to secure the

18   property rights.    That's what generated that 1910 court

19   decree about the Clark Fork River.

20               The Clark Fork River court decree in 1910

21   addresses a stretch of river specifically that's not

22   just the falls but those 6 miles of the reservoir that's

23   created.   And the court holds that that entire region

24   and, indeed, the entire Clark Fork in Sanders County is

25   nonnavigable.    So, the stretches that are nonnavigable

 5                ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

 6       ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

 7                   SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

 8                MR. KNEEDLER:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10                The Montana Supreme Court committed three

11   basic errors with respect to all three rivers that

12   require a remand for further proceedings to actually

13   weigh and make factual findings concerning the evidence

14   of the -- of the relevant reaches of the river for

15   purposes of navigability for title.               We're not talking

16   about navigability for interstate transportation or

17   admiralty or regulatory jurisdiction under the Rivers

18   and Harbors Act or the Clean Water Act.               We're talking

19   about navigability for title.

20                JUSTICE KAGAN:        And why does that make a

21   difference, Mr. Kneedler?        Why do you think that there

22   are separate tests for title than for regulatory

23   authority?

24                MR. KNEEDLER:       Well, in The Montello, for

25   example, the question was whether there was admiralty or


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

                                                                              19
 1   regulatory jurisdiction over the use of vessels on the

 2   -- on the upper reaches of the river, and that depended,

 3   in the Court's view, on whether that stretch was part of

 4   an interstate or international highway of commerce.                And

 5   so, it would make sense to look at the whole river in

 6   determining whether there's a highway, and maybe in

 7   deciding whether there's a highway, you would look to a

 8   bypassed stretch.   You would look at the highway, the

 9   land highway, to decide whether it's useful in

10   interstate commerce.

11               For title purposes, though, the question is,

12   what happens to the stretch of the river right in front

13   of the riparian owner's land?           As Mr. Clement said, that

14   reflects the expectations of the property owner; that if

15   there are no ships or boats going back and forth, that

16   that property is -- adheres to the riparian land more.

17   I also think it pertains to the control or use of the

18   beds of the rivers themselves.          If the river --

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               I think, though, if

20   you start drawing these lines, they become very

21   difficult, in some rivers anyway, to -- to apply.              I'm

22   sure there are seasonable fluctuations.              They may be

23   navigable in some seasons, but not in others.              The line

24   at which you pass from navigability to non-navigability

25   may be difficult to ascertain.

 1                 It seems to me, once you start chopping the

 2   highway of commerce up, it does create all those

 3   difficulties.

 4                 MR. KNEEDLER:       Well, first of all, we're

 5   not -- we're not talking about chopping the river up

 6   into narrow slices.      I mean, I think there has to be a

 7   discernible and substantial segment of the river.

 8   Often -- often, it will be self-evident from the

 9   topographical features of the area.                Are there -- are

10   there major falls and rapids over an extended period of

11   time?

12                 But also, the points you're raising are -- I

13   think are inherent, because in deciding where

14   navigability stops under any test or in any

15   circumstance, you could have the difficulties that you

16   have described.

17                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          So, what's de minimis?

19                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Could 2.8 be de minimis

20   in one situation and not, and how do we tell courts

21   below --

22                 MR. KNEEDLER:       I think it -- I think it may

23   well be.   I think it -- I think a -- an important -- I

24   agree with the points that Mr. Clement made as

25   guideposts.   I think another one -- and this pertains

 1   to --

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         If there's no falls but

 3   there are riparian waters that don't permit navigability

 4   over 2.8, then that's still navigable?           I'm not sure --

 5                MR. KNEEDLER:      No, I -- I think it has to be

 6   -- I'm speaking of a situation where the -- where the

 7   river is not navigable in fact.          And that's the test,

 8   navigable in fact, not navigable in law.          So, if a -- if

 9   a boat cannot pass in front of the riparian land, then

10   that would be nonnavigable.        I agree that --

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:       And it shouldn't matter

12   whether it's 2.8 miles or 1 mile, right?

13                MR. KNEEDLER:      Well, I --

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:       I mean, if the land is

15   nonnavigable -- if the river at that point is

16   nonnavigable, it's nonnavigable.

17                MR. KNEEDLER:      For title purposes, yes.

18                JUSTICE SCALIA:       That's what we're talking

 2   going on here is who controls the riverbed, I think it

 3   would be unworkable to have a passage or a portion of a

 4   river where you had 20 -- 10-foot strips across the

 5   river that are riparian owner-owned, and the State owned

 6   everything else, or if you had stripes across a river.

 7   So, I think -- I think the test also has to take into

 8   account --

 9                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But how would the boat get

10   up there?    Does it just jump over the 10 feet?

11                MR. KNEEDLER:       Well, in The Montello, the --

12   there is -- there is evidence that the boat was lifted

13   by -- men got out of the boat and lifted the boat up

14   over the falls.

20               JUSTICE BREYER:          Okay.         Now we have to

21   define what's an extended strip.

 4                JUSTICE BREYER:       Okay.         So, how much are we

 5   wrecking if we just say, look, the bit that's

 6   nonnavigable is different from the bit that's navigable?

 7                MR. KNEEDLER:      Well --

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:       Period.        Doesn't matter if

 9   it's 5 feet of land or not.        What are we wrecking?

10                MR. KNEEDLER:      I think it does matter

11   whether it's 5 feet, because the -- because an important

12   point here is that -- who can make sensible use or

13   control the relevant stretch of the river.              If it's 5

14   feet or 10 feet and you had strips that stayed

15   private --

16                JUSTICE BREYER:       A quick question which you

17   could probably answer just by saying we decided not to.

18   But I was somewhat curious.        It's really the United

19   States v. Montana in this, who owns the land, and it's a

20   question of Federal law.      It's going to be highly

21   factual no matter what this happens.              Made for this

22   Court's original jurisdiction.          And -- and normally in

23   original jurisdiction, we appoint a master, it's worked

24   out, and we review the master's report.

25                We can't do that here because it's a case --

 1   why didn't you go into, or why couldn't you go into, a

 2   quiet title action in Federal court?

 3                MR. KNEEDLER:        We could, and we have not

 4   given consideration to that, but that might be -- that

 5   might be a possibility.        The United States is not a

 6   party to this case and couldn't be -- and couldn't be

 7   bound by the judgment.

 8                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Could it have intervened

 9   somehow, because the -- the United States has come here

10   rather reluctantly, as you recommended against granting

11   cert in this case.     When this was in the Montana courts

12   and it was a question of what is the Federal law,

13   because Federal law is going to control -- everybody

14   agrees that -- could the United States have come into

15   the proceedings in the Montana State court?

16               MR. KNEEDLER:         Ordinarily, the United States

17   would not intervene in a State court proceeding, or if

18   it did, it would remove the case to Federal court.                So,

19   that -- that would be -- that would be a -- an

20   additional consideration as to whether to get into this

21   suit.   The United States would typically bring its own

22   quiet title action in -- in Federal court.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Your answer a moment

24   ago gives me pause.      You said the United States would

25   not be bound by this litigation but could bring its own

 2               MR. KNEEDLER:         Well, we would be bound by

 3   this Court's decision, obviously.             But I was just

 4   speaking of the law of -- the law of judgments.             And if

 5   this Court remands back to the trial court with general

 6   directions but doesn't adjudicate particular stretches

 7   definitively, then, you know, I think we -- that's the

 8   situation that we would -- that we would be in.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And if we -- if it were

10   remanded, the United States would still stay out of it

11   because it's going to be in the State --

12               MR. KNEEDLER:         I assume so.     Obviously, that

13   would be a -- that would be a further consideration.

14               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Am I to take that "de

15   minimis" to you means small enough so that they get the

16   boat physically over the portage?

17               MR. KNEEDLER:         Physically --

18               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Whether they carry it --

19               MR. KNEEDLER:         No, I think if they --

20               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            -- drag it.

21               MR. KNEEDLER:         I think if they can take it

22   through the river, it's not an interruption at all.            But

23   if -- if you have -- if you have something that can't be

24   transversed by a boat at all and it's long enough that

25   it could sensibly be thought of as a -- as a separate

 2   would be --

 3                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Go back to carrying

 4   their boat on their shoulders, which apparently in The

 5   Montello they did.     What's the answer to --

 6                  MR. KNEEDLER:      They didn't carry the boat

 7   out of the river.     These were Durham boats that were

 8   70-feet long and -- and weighed quite a bit.            Now, maybe

 9   there were small canoes that could have been done.              I --

10   I think a small portage -- again, I don't think it's the

11   length of the portage; I think it's the interruption of

12   the -- of the navigable portion of the river that --

13   that is -- that is relevant, and if it's large enough to

14   constitute a -- a sensible administrable parcel, that

15   that should be enough.

16                 I did want to take one moment to discuss the

17   Madison River because there, as Mr. Clement discussed,

18   the considerations are somewhat different.

19                 I mean, first of all, the court made a

20   similar mistake there by discussing the river as a whole

21   and a log float in the middle stretch of the river, but

22   not focusing on the relevant stretches where the dams

23   are located.    But it also put a lot of emphasis on

24   current recreational use by drift boats and whatnot,

25   without a proper foundation to determine whether that

 1   was relevant for title purposes at statehood, because

 2   the relevant question is whether whatever boats are used

 3   now are ones that would have been used as -- this is the

 4   language from The Daniel Ball -- as "the customary modes

 5   of travel and transportation" at the -- at the time of

 6   statehood.   It had to be general --

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               It's kind of odd.

 8   Maybe this is -- maybe this is Justice Alito's earlier

 9   question.    It's kind of odd that the more navigable the

10   river is, the more claim the State has.               The less

11   navigable -- where you're talking about sports boats and

12   drift fishing -- then it's Federal.

13                MR. KNEEDLER:       Well, that's -- that's a

14   product of the -- of the equal footing doctrine.                 And

15   the Court has long said that the State gets the beds of

16   navigable waters.

21                MR. GARRE:     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

22   and may it please the Court:

23                This case is about who owns the riverbeds

24   underlying the rivers at issue.           It's not about flood

25   lands; it's about the riverbeds.            And under this Court's


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official

 1   precedents, it's settled that title to the riverbeds

 2   conveyed to the State under the Constitution if they are

 3   navigable.

 4                It's been understood in Montana for more

 5   than a century that these rivers are navigable.             The

 6   rivers were meandered as navigable.              PPL's deeds -- and

 7   this is at page 172 of the appendix to the opposition

 8   brief -- specifically exclude the riverbeds.             The test

 9   for navigability that this Court has applied for

10   140 years, going back to The Montello and The Daniel

11   Ball, is whether the river served as a continuous

12   highway of commerce.

13                In The Montello, the Court recognized the

14   fact that few of the nation's great rivers did not

15   include some, quote, "serious interruptions to

16   uninterrupted navigation."        And the -- and the Court's

17   answer to that geographic fact was not to say then let's

18   carve out the interruptions and say those aren't

19   navigable.   The Court's answer was to say unbroken

20   navigation is not required to establish navigability.

21                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Under your theory, if

22   there's a fall like this of 17 miles, and a train is

23   50 miles away and traverses that 17 miles, that

24   portage --

25                MR. GARRE:    Under this Court's precedents --

 1               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          -- is good enough to

 2   make that area navigable?

 3               MR. GARRE:     -- you have to show that the

 4   commerce traveled along the river under the customary

 5   modes of trade and travel.

 6               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Outside of your fur

 7   traders and your gold miners, has that happened in any

 8   other situation -- your alleged gold miners and fur

 9   traders?   Has that happened on -- on the -- in the Great

10   Falls?

11               MR. GARRE:     If you take the Great Falls, the

12   history of portage from 1864 to 1868 was lively commerce

13   of millions of dollars, in today's value, billions of

14   dollars of gold, from Helena to Fort Benton back east.

15   This is covered in detail by the Solicitor General

16   briefs that we've appended here.

17               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Could you -- could you

18   do me a favor and you tell me again -- I'm having real

19   trouble with the competing evidence in this case with

20   respect to every one of the three areas in dispute, and

21   I have some serious questions about whether the court

22   properly granted summary judgment.               Your brief seems to

23   suggest that I can't do -- we can't do anything about

24   that because it wasn't a part of the question presented.

 1                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Your adversary says that

 2   it's a fair question if we determine there's an illegal

 3   approach -- error in the legal approach of the court

 4   below.   I'm assuming that also means on their weighing

 5   of evidentiary matters.        So, why shouldn't we address

 6   the summary judgment issue?

 7                MR. GARRE:      The question presented is

 8   whether the Montana Supreme Court or whether a court --

 9   a court -- what the constitutional test would be for a

10   court in this situation.        It's not even limited to the

11   Montana Supreme Court here.          It presents a legal

12   question.

13               With respect to summary judgment, the

14   problem for PPL is not that it didn't present enough

15   paper; the problem is, is it litigated the case under a

16   wrong legal theory.      It litigated the case that the --

17   that the Missouri, for example, was not navigable

18   because you couldn't take a boat down the falls.           This

19   Court's precedents for more than 140 years asked the

20   question of whether the river served as a continuous

21   highway of commerce.      We presented evidence,

22   summarized --

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:          For what purpose?   Were

24   they -- were they -- were we answering the question for

25   the same purpose, or were we asking it for purposes of


                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   whether Federal regulation could extend to the whole

 2   river?   For that purpose, it's easy to say if the whole

 3   river is, you know, used for commerce, the Federal

 4   Government can regulate even those portions of the river

 5   that are nonnavigable, that have -- but that have to be

 6   portaged around.   But that's a different question from

 7   who -- who owns title to the -- to the bed under the

 8   portions that have to be portaged.

 9                MR. GARRE:    Your Honor, PPL recognizes that

10   The Daniel Ball supplies the test for navigability for

11   title.   This Court recognized that in the Utah case, the

12   vanguard title case that they hold out.          So, the only

13   question is, did The Montello apply The Daniel Ball test

14   or did it apply something else?          And the first paragraph

15   of the Court's decision in The Montello said it applied

16   The Daniel Ball test.

17               Courts -- this Court and lower courts for

18   more than a century have understood The Daniel Ball and

19   The Montello to supply the test for navigability of

20   title.   What they're asking this Court to do is upend

21   more than 140 years of precedent.           And the amicus brief

22   filed by the States in this case gives -- gives the

23   Court a sense of the disruption that this would cause.

24               JUSTICE ALITO:        What do -- what do you

25   understand to be the reason for the rule that the States


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   own the navigable rivers?

 2               MR. GARRE:       The reason for the rule was the

 3   public trust doctrine which -- which sought to keep

 4   these rivers free for the public to use for navigation,

 5   for fishing, and for other uses.             And this court's

 6   precedents --

 7               JUSTICE ALITO:          What do fishing and

 8   navigation have to do with -- for -- what does fishing

 9   have to do with navigability?

10               MR. GARRE:       Well, it gets back to the -- the

11   public trust doctrine, Your Honor.                 Fishing doesn't

12   have -- fishing is a purpose of the public trust

13   doctrine, which is why it was understood --

14               JUSTICE ALITO:          Let me put it this way:

15   Why -- why should -- why does the State own a navigable

16   river but not a nonnavigable river?

17               MR. GARRE:       Because the navigable rivers

18   were the arteries of commerce in this country, and at

19   the time of the founding, it was understood -- and this

20   gets to the core issue of federalism in this case --

21   that the States ought to be the ones that control the

22   navigable rivers --

23               JUSTICE ALITO:          Yes, and if that's the

24   reason --

25               MR. GARRE:       -- not the Federal Government.

 1               JUSTICE ALITO:       If that's the reason for the

 2   rule, than what is the justification for State ownership

 3   of a portion of the river that is not navigable?

 4               MR. GARRE:    I think this gets back to the

 5   question of whether you can just chop up the rivers into

 6   navigable and nonnavigable bits.          And we're talking --

 7   this Court, Justice O'Connor observed in her dissent in

 8   the Phillips Petroleum case that navigability wasn't

 9   decided inch by inch.    What the other side is asking you

10   to adopt here is a test of navigability that's at least

11   mile by mile, if not acre by acre, which is completely

12   different than this Court has ever assessed

13   navigability.

14               JUSTICE ALITO:       The rule that you're arguing

15   for might be an established rule that we should follow,

16   but as a matter of theory, I don't understand what the

17   justification is for State ownership of a nonnavigable

18   portion of the river if the reason for the underlying

19   rule is so that people will not put up obstructions on

20   the river so that they -- it can be maintained as an --

21   as an avenue of commerce.      I can see that you -- why the

22   State would own that, because otherwise riparian owners

23   could put up fences and obstructions and charge tolls

25   navigable, I don't see what it has to do with -- with

 1   commerce or transportation.

 2                MR. GARRE:      What -- what the Framers were

 3   concerned about -- and this is also reflected in the

 4   Northwest Ordinance 2 -- was ensuring that the navigable

 5   rivers, the major arteries of commerce in this country,

 6   remained open.    And so, they -- they applied a much

 7   more -- much broader conception of navigability than

 8   is suggested --

 9                JUSTICE SCALIA:         But -- but they're closed

10   where they're -- they're impassable for ships anyway.

11   They're closed.   What do you mean, remain open?

12                MR. GARRE:      And so, that was the argument --

13                JUSTICE SCALIA:         You've -- you've got falls.

14   You got waterfalls.      You got rapids.           What does it mean

15   to -- to be sure that that river remains open to

16   commerce?   Commerce is impossible over it.

17                MR. GARRE:      And so, that was the argument

18   that the district court adopted in The Montello case,

19   and this Court emphatically rejected it.              And by the

20   way, the portage in The Montello case was 5 miles long.

21   That's reflected in the -- the record in that case

22   before this Court.

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Garre, what is -- you

24   say that you're not taking just -- you look at the whole

25   river as a whole.    You're saying that, no, that isn't

 1   your position?

 2               MR. GARRE:     No, it's not.

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           And it is also not inch

 4   by inch.   So, what's -- when is segmentation

 5   appropriate?

 6               MR. GARRE:     I think the relevant stretch or

 7   segmentation is really a litigation term.           Our position

 8   is this Court's test:     continuous highway of commerce.

 9   You would take the part of the river at issue in a case,

10   take that part and look -- ask the question, was that

11   part of a continuous highway of commerce or not?

12               So, if you found yourself in Cataract Canyon

13   in the Utah case, you'd ask yourself that question, and

14   you would say, no, this is not part of a continuous

15   highway of commerce, because no one argued either that

16   the canyon was portaged or that goods were traveling

17   down the Colorado River through the canyon and out into

18   Arizona.

19               If you ask yourself that question in this

20   case, along the Great Falls, you would say yes, because

21   the evidence was unrebutted that millions of dollars of

22   gold was traveled up from Helena to Fort Benton along

23   the -- the Missouri River with the aid of a portage and

24   that that was unquestionably a highway of commerce.

 1   rivers up into navigable and nonnavigable pieces.             How

 2   would that impact the public trust doctrine?             The -- the

 3   brief filed by the National --

 4                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          So, you just -- so, you

 5   are disagreeing with the United States, which has given

 6   us its view of what the Federal law is.             It doesn't

 7   coincide with Montana's.

 8                  MR. GARRE:    The United States has sided

 9   completely with Montana.        The answer it gives for what

10   is a short interruption in its brief is an interruption

11   that doesn't warrant separate consideration.            That's on

12   page 17 of its brief.       That's the epitome of a circular

13   test, and --

14                JUSTICE BREYER:         Just out of -- I mean, to

15   waste your time for a second, why do the feds own the

16   land underneath the -- and why -- under the nonnavigable

17   parts?   And why do the feds own the land under a

18   nonnavigable stream?

19                MR. GARRE:      I think if -- if you applied the

20   proper test here, you would conclude that the river --

21                JUSTICE BREYER:         I mean, little creeks

22   somewhere which you'd think, gee, those belong to the

23   State, but turns out the feds own the land underneath

24   the little creek; is that right?

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:         Yes.

 3               MR. GARRE:      -- didn't transfer under the

 4   equal footing doctrine.       Oftentimes, those were subject

 5   to separate conveyances.       So, they might come into

 6   private property.    I think --

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:         I see.         So, the rule is, on

 8   the nonnavigable streams, it depends on what the

 9   conveyance was at the time of statehood, and those are

10   individual matters, and sometimes --

11               MR. GARRE:      Right.

12               JUSTICE BREYER:         -- you'll see the feds own

13   them and sometimes the States.

14               MR. GARRE:      And what was --

15               JUSTICE BREYER:         Is that right?

16               MR. GARRE:      Yes, I think that's right.

17               JUSTICE BREYER:         Okay.

18               MR. GARRE:      And what was critically

19   important to the -- to the Framers was that the States

20   would have control over the navigable waterways.                This

21   Court has described that as an essential attribute of

22   State sovereignty.

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                But we're talking

24   about the land at the bottom of the -- the river.                What

25   is it that the State can't do on the navigable waterways

 1   that it wants to do?

 2               MR. GARRE:      Well, owner -- the ownership --

 3   along with ownership goes the right to control whether

 4   facilities can be built on them, bridges or pipelines.

 5   It goes -- along with that goes the rights to mineral

 6   leases --

 7               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But as -- but as the Chief

 8   Justice is indicating, I think, this concerns who owns

 9   the bed; and that's different from navigable waters of

10   the United States.

11               And some of the answers you gave to

12   Justice Alito about -- that the purposes and the reasons

13   for navigable waters of the United States are quite

14   different, really, than for the considerations we have

15   about riparian ownership.        Navigable waters of the

16   United States can be controlled by the United States for

17   many purposes, but that is concurrent with a separate

18   document -- doctrine for underlying ownership of the

19   bed.

20               MR. GARRE:      Right.

21               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And it's not clear to me

22   that the test for navigable waters is the same in each

23   case as to the whole river.

24               MR. GARRE:      I think that the test that we're

25   articulating is The Daniel Ball and The Montello test --


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official

 1   continuous highway test.     I think with respect to the

 2   riverbeds, it's always been understood that with control

 3   of the riverbeds along navigable waters, States have a

 4   right to control fishing and navigation and other

 5   aspects.

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:       But, now, Montello was a

 7   case -- to follow up this same question.           Montello, I

 8   take it, was not a title case.         Montello was a

 9   regulation of the stream case.         So, I can understand

10   perfectly well why that language in Montello applies for

11   the reason Justice Kennedy just said.           Now, I grant you

12   that they -- in later title cases, this Court has taken

13   the same words and written them.          But is there an

14   instance in the later title cases where that language

15   has played a controlling role?

16               MR. GARRE:    Well, the --

17               JUSTICE BREYER:       What case should I look at

18   to see that it was really meant that that -- this --

19   see, start where Justice Scalia was and then say what

20   Justice Kennedy just said --

21               MR. GARRE:    There's certainly --

22               JUSTICE BREYER:       -- and then thinking,

23   well -- I'm thinking, well, Montello was a case that

24   involved a different purpose, and now the later cases,

25   although they quoted the language, it didn't have a

 1   role.   Am I right or not?

 2                MR. GARRE:    This case has recognized always

 3   that The Daniel Ball and The Montello is the test for

 4   navigability for title as well as admiralty.           It has

 5   never drawn the kind of distinction that PPL and the

 6   United States ask you to draw here.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:       The question is, has it

 8   held that?   Do you have a case where it would have made

 9   a difference?

10                MR. GARRE:    Not -- not of this Court.

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Okay.

12                MR. GARRE:    And the lower courts have relied

13   upon The Daniel Ball and The Montello in plenty of

14   circumstances adjudicating title.           I think the Court has

15   to think about what the world would look like if the

16   Court adopted PPL and the United States' views.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Well, if this is such an

18   understood and traditional rule, why -- why didn't

19   Montana make its rights known earlier when these private

20   owners bought the land?      Indeed, the State gave them

21   condemnation power to flood adjacent lands so that they

22   could build their dams.

23                MR. GARRE:    Again --

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:       And you say while all this

25   was going on, well, of course, everybody knew that

 1   Montana owned this land.

 2                And now they come back, what, a hundred

 3   years later, and they not only want to get the land

 4   back, they want to tax them for their use of it over --

 5   over all these hundred years.

 6                MR. GARRE:      PPL's deeds --

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:         That's extraordinary.

 8                MR. GARRE:      Your Honor, PPL's deeds

 9   specifically exclude the riverbeds at issue in this

10   case.   So, PPL can have no claim to those lands and, in

11   fact, in its supplemental brief says that the United

12   States owns the lands.       We're not talking about the

13   flood lands here; we're talking about the -- between the

14   low-water marks.   Those lands were surveyed and

15   meandered at statehood to show that they did not convey

16   to private parties.

17               Montana courts have recognized for more than

18   a century that these waters are not navigable.

19   Everybody understood that they were navigable.         The

20   reason why this issue only arises now is because of a

21   1999 decision of the Montana Supreme Court that said

22   that the State -- made clear that the State had a

23   fiduciary obligation to seek compensation for the use of

24   the riverbeds.   So, that -- that then teed up the

25   question of whether the State could actually charge rent

 1   for the riverbeds.    The State in this case --

 2                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       And what about other

 3   landowners on the riverbeds?             If Montana wins this case,

 4   will they be paying rent as well?

 5                 MR. GARRE:    They're not using the riverbeds,

 6   Your Honor.    The reason why the facilities here are

 7   using the riverbeds is because they actually sit on it.

 8   There are other instances where private landowners have

 9   easements and leases, like mineral leases with the

10   State, under the -- because of the accepted

11   understanding that the State does own those lands.            And

12   this is not at all unusual.

13                 If you look at the State's brief, Washington

14   and Oregon have thousands of these types of permits

15   because it's established that if the water is navigable,

16   then the State owns the riverbeds, and there are

17   consequences that flow over this.            But this really isn't

18   a fight between the State and the private landowners.

19   It's -- it's a fight between the State and the United

20   States, because if this case --

21                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       Just if I could understand

22   then, you think that this is a one of a kind landowner;

23   there are no other landowners in Montana who are in the

24   situation of PPL?

25                 MR. GARRE:    No, I think there are other


                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   landowners who have asserted -- who want rights to use

 2   -- to get minerals along rivers or have piers or

 3   bridges, and in those situations, they get permits from

 4   the State to use it.      But I think what's going to happen

 5   is, if this Court declares that every mile or so that is

 6   an interruption is nonnavigable, then title is going to

 7   transfer to the United States because, under this

 8   Court's precedent in Utah, the Court held that if waters

 9   were not navigable, the United States would have --

10                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Is there a mile stretch

11   anywhere on this river?

12                MR. GARRE:    A mile stretch?

13                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Yes.     Is there a mile

14   stretch in which the boats stop?

15                MR. GARRE:    Well --

16                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         There's some water in

17   the middle, and they --

18                MR. GARRE:    There are two areas at issue

19   here:   the Great Falls stretch --

20                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         I know the two at issue.

21   But you're saying, if we rule the way we do, we're going

22   to slice it up and so does the Attorney -- the Solicitor

23   General's office say, we're going to slice it up half

24   mile or half acre by half acre.          I'm not sure how that

25   happens.   I go back to Justice Kennedy's question, which


                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

 1   is, does a boat stop midstream?

 2               MR. GARRE:      So, the test would be any non-de

 3   minimis interruption.      That's the one that PPL and the

 4   United States are urging here.           There are thousands of

 5   dams in the country.     There's the Niagara Falls, which

 6   for more than a century, it's been understood that the

 7   State owns it, not because it's an international

 8   boundary; that's a line plucked out of a decision.              Read

 9   the decision --

10               JUSTICE BREYER:         All right.    So, how do I

11   find that out?    If I start with a practical premise of

12   not wanting to interrupt expectations, I also believe

13   that it's the most common thing in the world for

14   electric power companies to put hydroelectric facilities

15   where there are waterfalls or rapids, and that's true

16   all over the country.      So, what's the status quo with

17   the -- you know, somebody could count up how many

18   hydroelectric plants there are on waterfalls.

19               And what's the general view?           Have those

20   hydroelectric companies been thinking that they are

21   leasing or buying from the feds or from the States?             I

22   mean, I don't know what's happened in the past.           And I

23   have looked at the briefs.         I can't get a very good

24   picture.

25               MR. GARRE:      The best evidence I think we

 2   the brief filed by 26 States, which explains that if

 3   this Court adopts the kind of segmentation approach, any

 4   interruption that is -- that is not de minimis has to be

 5   carved out, it's going to wreak havoc in States across

 6   the country, especially in the western States.             Again,

 7   getting back to --

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:        When you say "wreak havoc,"

 9   do you mean to say that the States have leased those

10   strips with the waterfalls which are impassable to

11   hydroelectric companies, and the leases will have to be

12   renegotiated or something like that?

13               MR. GARRE:      I'm not referring to specific

14   leases on that.    I'm talking about things like public

15   access for fishing, for example.            The States have cited

16   the Steelheader case in Oregon.           And this is what's

17   going to happen:    Either the public -- private

18   landowners are going to claim people coming along my

19   banks to fish, they don't have access to these waters.

20   If they were navigable -- understood as navigable waters

21   owned by the State, it's clear that they had would have

22   access.   There's going to be clashes.            There's going to

23   be --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:         I thought you say it

25   doesn't belong to the private individuals.            I thought

 1   you said it belongs to the United States if it doesn't

 2   belong to the State.

 3                MR. GARRE:    I think -- what this Court has

 4   said is if it's not navigable, the United States has it.

 5   But there would be the question --

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Well, there you are.     And

 7   you think the United States is going to keep off these

 8   fishermen?

 9                MR. GARRE:    The question is whether there'd

10   be a separate conveyance from the United States.

11   There's certainly going to be plenty of private

12   landowners, I think, who are going to claim private

13   ownership.   So, there is going to be some sorting out to

14   do.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:       But you think they're

16   wrong, right?

17                MR. GARRE:    Well, no.        They're -- if -- if

18   the river is not navigable, then the lands didn't convey

19   under the equal footing doctrine.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Right.

21                MR. GARRE:    There'd be a separate question

22   of whether they conveyed by some other Federal patent,

23   land patent, or the like.       And there are -- certainly

24   are plenty of those.    But I think what's clear is --

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Mr. Garre, you -- you

 1   have said this is genuinely a controversy between the

 2   State and the United States, but the United States is

 3   not a party to this -- to this litigation.             And we know

 4   from the briefing before us, the United States takes a

 5   different position than Montana.             It doesn't agree with

 6   you.    But if this case -- how can a case be decided

 7   without any input from the United States when you say

 8   that's the true dispute; it is between the State and the

 9   nation?

10                MR. GARRE:     Well, the United States is here.

11   It has given its views.       It's true that it didn't

12   participate below, and that is a little bit unusual.

13   What's weird is that the United States has never

14   actually asserted ownership to the riverbeds in this

15   case.   But I think --

16                JUSTICE KAGAN:        Does PPL pay rent to the

17   United States?

18                MR. GARRE:     Not with respect to the

19   riverbeds.   There's a statement in the brief that

20   suggests that they pay rent.             That's with respect to the

21   upland, the flooded lands, for example, along the

22   reservoir.   The United States has never charged rent for

23   the use of the riverbeds themselves between the

24   low-water marks.

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Would you help me with

 1   this?   Navigable waters of the United States for

 2   purposes of Federal jurisdiction over many activities

 3   such as boating is one concept.             Navigable waters of the

 4   United States for purposes of State ownership of the bed

 5   serves different purposes.

 6                 Are the -- are the boundaries and the

 7   definitions of what is navigable co-extensive and

 8   parallel and -- and precisely the same in each case?

 9   Or, on the other hand, are there some cases where a body

10   of water, say the falls, is navigable waters of the

11   United States but not navigable waters of the United

12   States for purposes of bed ownership by the State?

13                 MR. GARRE:    I mean, certainly --

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           And -- and if there is a

15   difference, can you tell me a case?               And I think

16   Justice Scalia basically was asking this earlier.

17                 MR. GARRE:    There are two -- well, there's

18   three distinctions between the test for title --

19                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.

20                 MR. GARRE:    -- and the test for regulatory

21   purposes --

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Yes.

23                 MR. GARRE:    -- none of which bear on the

24   dispute in this case.      One is for title.           You look at

25   the time of statehood.      You don't look at the river at a


                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                          50
 1   later time.    The next is, is that, for purposes of

 2   title, you look at the river in its natural state.             You

 3   don't look at improvements.         And the third is, for

 4   purposes of title, the kind of commerce you consider is

 5   actually more expansive than the type you could consider

 6   for regulatory purposes.

 7                 This case, the focus has been on the rivers

 8   at the time of statehood, their use as highways of

 9   commerce without improvements, which is in the heartland

10   of the test for title for navigability under The Daniel

11   Ball and The Montello.

12                 None of the distinctions that this Court has

13   ever recognized would bear on this, nor would it make

14   any sense, I think, to say that the rule that we

15   identified in The Montello as -- that has -- for more

16   than a century, has been established as the test for

17   title for navigability somehow has to be applied

18   differently in this case in a way that would require

19   breaking up the rivers.       And I think --

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           But it is conceded, is it

21   not, that -- if we rule for the power companies in this

22   case, there still may be a situation in which these

23   waters can be navigable waters of the United States for

24   other purposes, other than ownership of the bed?            Or am

25   I wrong on that?

 1                MR. GARRE:    No, I think the United States'

 2   position is say they're navigable for Federal purposes

 3   but not for State purposes.        And I think -- and they've

 4   taken what I think is a pretty remarkable position.

 5                If you look at the briefs that we've

 6   appended to our brief, the United States' in the Montana

 7   Power Company case, the United States is saying that the

 8   very same stretch of the Missouri along the Great Falls

 9   is navigable because it served as a continuous highway

10   of commerce, and the falls did not prevent the river

11   from being used as a continuous highway; and, therefore,

12   it's navigable under The Montello and The Daniel Ball,

13   which is the theory that they recognize.

14                And now they're here saying, well, that was

15   only for regulatory purposes, not for title purposes.

16   But it's the same test in both cases, and that's the

17   test that the nation has understood for more than

18   50 years.

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              No, but I'm not sure

20   it has the same consequences.           It seems to me that

21   regardless of who prevails in this case, the State will

22   be able to exercise regulatory jurisdiction over the

23   waters.   You know, you can't fish during these seasons,

24   or there are different limits on how many fish you can

25   take.   And so will the Federal Government.             It will be


                         Alderson Reporting Company

                                                                           52
 1   able to apply Federal law to the river regardless of who

 2   owns parts of the river, regardless of who owns the land

 3   underneath.

 4                 MR. GARRE:    And so, this Court has always

 5   recognized the States' authority to make those decisions

 6   as an essential attribute of their sovereignty.                And

 7   that's why the States --

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Without regard --

 9   but I would say without regard to whether they happened

10   to own the land under the -- under the river or not.

11                 MR. GARRE:    No, when they -- when they own

12   the land under the river, that -- the ability to control

13   access along those rivers -- river and fishing and the

14   like is an essential attribute of State sovereignty.

15   So, just saying that, well, the Federal Government and

16   the State can regulate together is, I think, an

17   important intrusion on State sovereignty as this Court

18   has always understood under the equal footing doctrine

19   and the public trust doctrine.

20                 And you also have the problem of competing

21   regulation of these rivers when you go from mile to

22   mile, interruption to interruption, potentially

23   thousands along rivers.       And that's laid out in the

24   brief by the environmental groups here, the National

25   Wildlife Foundation and Trout Unlimited and other


                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   groups, that talk about the problems with fragmented

 2   regulatory jurisdiction.

 3               And you also get into the question of public

 4   access for fishing, too.     The rivers are used for

 5   commerce, but the public trust doctrine was always used

 6   to protect access to rivers for fishing, too.       And so,

 7   if you look at a place like the Great Falls or the

 8   Thompson Falls, these are among the most sought-after

 9   fishing rivers in the world.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:       You're willing to concede

11   on behalf of the State that if we find that the State

12   does not have ownership of the bed, the State does not

13   have regulatory jurisdiction for all of these purposes

14   that you're now describing?

15               MR. GARRE:    Absolutely not, Justice Scalia.

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:       Well, then your argument

17   doesn't carry much weight.

18               MR. GARRE:    Well --

19               JUSTICE ALITO:       The State can continue to

20   regulate all those things whether or not it owns the

21   bed.

22               MR. GARRE:    And so, every time this Court

23   has said that the ability to do that is an essential

24   attribute of sovereignty, it must not have meant it

25   because the United States could do it, too.       I mean, it


                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   is important to the States because having the sovereign

 2   capacity over those riverbeds as navigable waters under

 3   the public trust doctrine is critical to the States'

 4   authority.

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Well, you have sovereignty

 6   over the land owned, owned by other private persons.

 7                MR. GARRE:    And -- and I think it gets back

 8   to the public trust doctrine, the equal footing

 9   doctrine, what this Court has said in the Utah case and

10   other cases about the role of States in regulating

11   navigable rivers and owning title to the riverbeds

12   underlying those rivers.

13                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              We haven't talked

14   much about the Madison.      What -- what is your best piece

15   of evidence with respect to the Madison for the

16   proposition that it was navigable at statehood?

17                MR. GARRE:    Well, there was some evidence of

18   use by fur trappers and the like.           It was not extensive

19   because this area was relatively sparse.               I think --

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, fur trappers

21   are going to go -- they don't need a lot of -- a lot of

22   water to ply their canoes up the river.

23                MR. GARRE:    Well, and this Court has

24   recognized that things like pirogues and bateaux were

25   sufficient to establish the continuous highway of


                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   commerce.

 2                I think the point on the Madison is the

 3   susceptibility for use as a navigable river.                 And the

 4   main point that we made below is that where their own

 5   expert recognized that PPL's dams had impeded the flow

 6   of water over of the river, that if those dams impede

 7   the flow of water over the river but yet today there are

 8   thousands of drift boats similar to the boats that would

 9   have used it at the time of statehood, then it's good

10   evidence that it was susceptible for use.

11               But I think the Madison is in a different

12   category than the Missouri and the Clark Fork.

13               I do want to answer the question about the

14   17 miles.   The Desplaines River in the Economy Light

15   case, there was an 18-mile portage.                 That's made clear

16   at page 18a of our addendum, where the Government

17   recognized that.   In Montello, it was a 5-mile portage.

18   In -- there are other examples of portages.

19               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Five miles, was that --

20   was that the canal?      What subsequently became the canal

21   area?

22               MR. GARRE:       I -- I think that's right.              It's

23   in the testimony in that decision.                 But, certainly,

24   17 miles -- and the other thing is, is that in the

25   amicus brief, on page 27 of the Tubbs brief, she


                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official

                                                                         56
 1   suggests that the actual portage before statehood was

 2   only 8 miles.   I don't think you could draw a

 3   constitutional line between 5, 7, or even 10 miles and

 4   17 miles.

 5                We think the line the Constitution draws is

 6   whether -- asks whether the river was -- served as a

 7   continuous highway of commerce, notwithstanding any

 8   interruption along that way.

 9                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          I think that then the

10   simplest rule is, is the river from shore to opposite

11   shore -- any portion of it -- did boats traverse it?

12   That would be I think what Justice Alito was asking.

13               MR. GARRE:      But it's not even the rule that

14   PPL was asking for, because they acknowledge that some

15   interruptions would be navigable.            They call it "non-de

16   minimis."   It's not clear how you get there.

17               If you go between the low-water marks,

18   there's only a part of the way that you could actually

19   bring a boat up, but, yet, it's established that the

20   State owns the entire riverbeds between low-water mark

21   to low-water mark.

22               After traversing the Missouri and the very

23   falls at issue in this case, Meriwether Lewis described

24   that he didn't think the world could furnish a finer

25   example of a navigable river through a mountainous

 1   country than the Missouri.          That assessment made by the

 2   President's own agent, charged with assessing the

 3   suitability of the Missouri for commerce, was consistent

 4   with more than 140 years of this precedent --

 5                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Did he write that during

 6   his 30-day -- 32-day portage?

 7                 (Laughter.)

 8                 MR. GARRE:     Your Honor, it was an 11-day

 9   portage.   At the time of statehood, it was a 1-day

10   portage.   I think what's significant is he wrote it

11   after that portage.      And yet, he recognized there was

12   not a finer example of a navigable river through

13   mountainous country.      That assessment was consistent

14   with this Court's precedents for more than 140 years.

15   It's consistent with the actual use of the Missouri as a

16   continuous highway of commerce along the very stretch at

17   issue here.

18                 We don't believe that PPL or the United

19   States has provided a legal reason for this Court to

20   overturn the judgment of the Montana Supreme Court that

21   the Missouri or the other rivers at issue in this case

25              REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

 1                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 2               MR. CLEMENT:     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 3               A few points in rebuttal:           First, it's --

 4               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Can you point to some

 5   portages that are de minimis?          Point me -- I don't care

 6   where they are in the United States.            Give me a list of

 7   some that are de minimis.

 8               MR. CLEMENT:     I mean, I don't have any de

 9   minimis portages for you.      The portages he's talking

10   about, as far as I can tell, the 5-mile and the 8-mile,

11   are portages between rivers, and that has nothing to do

12   with whether the bypassed stretch of a river would be

13   nonnavigable because it's de minimis, because if you

14   portage between two rivers, you're not bypassing

15   anything.

16               Where I can talk about sort of portages

17   being de minimis, if you look at the special master's

18   report in the Utah case, there are a few places in the

19   Cataract Canyon where he talks about portages, and he

20   talks -- you know, in parts where they got boats to.

21   But the key point is, whenever the Court has talked

22   about portages in the context of navigability, they've

23   pointed to them as suggesting non-navigability, and in

24   certain circumstances said, well, you had to portage a

25   little bit, but that's not enough to make the stretch

                                                                               59
 1   nonnavigable.

 2                JUSTICE KENNEDY:             And what were your -- what

 3   were your other four points you were going to give us?

 4                MR. CLEMENT:       Well, I was going to give you

 5   a couple, Your Honor.       I'd start with the deeds.            You

 6   know, the State wants to make something of the fact that

 7   the deeds stop at the river.              But that's true throughout

 8   the State.   And the question then becomes, what rule

 9   governs the ownership of the riverbeds?                 And that's

10   where navigability versus non-navigability.                So, the

11   deeds don't prove anything.          That's just the way the

12   deeds were written.

13                The next point:         Justice Kagan, you asked

14   about, you know, do the other owner -- other people on

15   the river have anything to fear.             And the answer as far

16   as I heard was, well, these are different.                They sit on

17   the riverbed.   Well, two things, Your Honor:               So do some

18   of the piers, and that's why people have filed amicus

19   briefs and are very concerned.

20                But more to the point, these things have not

21   moved under the riverbed recently.                 They've been sitting

22   there for a hundred years, and the State lent its

23   eminent domain power to us to help us build these dams.

24   These dams were critical to developing energy and

25   development in this area.         And now a hundred years

                                                                        60
 1   later, they want compensation for the little river

 2   strip under that.

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:       Could the United States

 4   demand compensation?

 5                MR. CLEMENT:     We pay the United States

 6   compensation right now.      The difference is the United

 7   States isn't going in afterwards and trying to put a

 8   hold-up to us and saying they want $50 million for this.

 9   We pay rents to FERC for some of these lands.          Actually,

10   the State gets 37.5 percent of that back.

11               JUSTICE SCALIA:        For the riverbed?   For the

12   riverbed land --

13               MR. CLEMENT:      Well, look at footnote 3 of

14   the Government's brief.      I mean, again, the problem here

15   is if you want people to have deeds that really parse

16   out whether it's riverbed or upland, they don't because

17   everybody defaults to the bottom line -- the background

18   rule.   The background rule is if it's a nonnavigable

19   river, the riparian owners, whether it be the United

20   States or private property owners, get to midway, or if

21   they own both on both sides, they get the whole thing.

22               I think on "de minimis," we talk about it a

23   lot, but I would point out that the one thing we know

24   that's not de minimis from Utah is 4.35 miles, because

25   that's what the Court analyzes separately in the portion


                         Alderson Reporting Company

                                                                             61
 1   of Cataract Canyon.

 2                Every stretch at issue here, every dam at

 3   issue here, is more than 4.35 miles.                Fully five of the

 4   dams are on the 17-mile Great Falls stretch, which they

 5   agree is impassable.      The other five are reservoir dams

 6   that create reservoirs that extend over 4.35 miles.

 7                So, there's nothing de minimis in the best

 8   evidence that is the $50 million in compensation.                I

 9   think the $50 million in back rent also shows that

10   although this is a dispute between Montana and the

11   United States, my client is caught in the middle of it,

12   and they're obviously concerned about it, too.

13               I want to talk about what's disputed and

14   what's undisputed.     What is undisputed is the 17 miles

15   is impassable.   That's enough, as I say, to give us

16   judgment as a matter of law for the five dams on that

17   stretch.   What is hotly disputed, despite my friend's

18   representation, is whether or not there was through

19   commerce through this bypass route.                He suggests it's

20   undisputed that gold went from Helena down to Fort

21   Benton down to St. Louis.         And that, of course, is not

22   disputed, but it went on roads.            It didn't go on the

23   upper -- on the upper Missouri.

24               And if you want to know who's got the better

25   of this argument, I ask you to think about this

 1   question:   The United States Army built a 600-mile

 2   overland road from Fort Benton, the traditional head of

 3   navigation on the Missouri, to Walla Walla, Washington.

 4   Now, if the State is right and the upper Missouri and

 5   the Clark Fork were navigable, all they had to do is --

 6   is have a 60-mile road to connect the two.              They were

 7   never navigable.
