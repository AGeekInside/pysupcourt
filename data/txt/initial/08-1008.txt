 7             ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT L. NELSON

 8                ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               MR. NELSON:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               Since the inception of the Rules Enabling

12   Act, this Court has repeatedly held that within their

13   scope of operation, rules promulgated under that Act

14   govern the practice and procedure of Federal courts in

15   diversity and Federal question cases alike.

16               This case concerns whether a New York State

17   law prohibiting New York State courts from certifying a

18   class applies in a Federal diversity action and

19   displaces the otherwise applicable Federal class

20   certification standards set forth in Federal Rule of

21   Civil Procedure 23.

22               Whether the case is viewed as presenting a

23   question under the Rules Enabling Act as construed in

24   Hanna v. Plumer, or instead more generally as an Erie

25   question, the answer is the same.             The State rule does


                                       3

 1   not govern.    That result is underscored by the Class

 2   Action Fairness Act, which extended Federal diversity

 3   jurisdiction to cases of this type precisely so that

 4   Federal procedural standards would apply.                In the --

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But this is a procedural

 6   standard that has a manifestly substantive purpose,

 7   which is to restrict recoveries of penalties.               In that

 8   sense, it's like a cap on damages.                And if you're right,

 9   then the purpose that New York had would be completely

10   undermined, because what lawyer would bring a $500 case

11   in State court when she could bring a $5 million case in

12   Federal court?

13                 MR. NELSON:     Well, to begin with, I ­- I

14   don't think that it's a substantive rule because it

15   reflects a policy.    The policy here, as described by the

16   New York Court of Appeals in the Sperry case, is that

17   the -- the legislature believed that class actions were

18   not necessary in this category of cases.

19                 I think that is ultimately a procedural

20   policy.   It's not a limitation on --

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          They didn't want to have

22   class actions.

23                 MR. NELSON:     They certainly did not want to

24   have class actions, Justice Ginsburg.

25                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          And how is it different

 1   from Cohen v. Beneficial, the security for costs?

 2   Procedural in one sense, but with a definite substantive

 3   purpose in mind; that is, to restrict derivative

 4   actions.

 5                  MR. NELSON:     Well, the Cohen case I think is

 6   different in this respect, although when Cohen was

 7   decided shareholder derivative actions together with

 8   class actions were under Rule 23.

 9                  Those things have now been divorced, and

10   shareholder derivative actions differ from class actions

11   in the Rule 23 sense in a fundamental way.             In Rule 23,

12   the class is composed solely of individuals who each

13   have a substantive right to pursue that recovery under

14   the relevant law.     In a derivative action, the plaintiff

15   is actually asserting a substantive right to -- to

16   really assert a claim on behalf of someone else, the

17   corporation.

18                  And what the Court said in Cohen and

19   elaborated more in the Kamen case in 1991 is that that

20   question is really a matter of the law of

21   shareholder-corporate relations, the circumstances in

22   which a shareholder may bring a derivative suit, and

23   isn't really answered by the Federal rules.             And in

24   Cohen in particular, what the Court focused on --

25                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          You could say just as


                                       5

                                   Official


 1   well here that the question isn't addressed by the

 2   Federal rules.    If New York wants to say this kind of

 3   claim can be brought only as an individual action, not

 4   as a class action, why shouldn't the Federal

 5   court say that's perfectly fine; this class of cases

 6   can't be brought as a class action; we respect the

 7   State's position on that.        Why should we as a Federal

 8   court in a diversity case create a claim that the ­-

 9   that the State never created?

10               MR. NELSON:       Well, the reason is that Rule

11   23 actually does address the issue, and it's the same

12   issue that the -- that the State rule tries to address,

13   which is whether the matters may be certified as a

14   class.

15               Not only does Rule 23(b) provide explicitly

16   that the court may certify an action if the Rule 23(b)

17   (1), (2), or (3) criteria are met, but this Court also

18   emphasized in the Califano v. Yamasaki case that under

19   Rule 1, the Federal rules apply to all actions in the

20   Federal courts.   And what that means, as the Court put

21   it in Yamasaki, is that a class action is available,

22   potentially, if the 23 standards are satisfied, in any

23   action within the Federal courts, unless Congress has

24   exercised its power to override a Federal rule, which,

25   as the author of Federal law, Congress is always


                                      6

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   empowered to do.

 2                  The difference as to -- as to the State is

 3   that the State has no power to displace Federal law, and

 4   Rule 23, promulgated under the Rules Enabling Act, is

 5   Federal law.

 6                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          This Court in its recent

 7   decisions has been sensitive to not overriding State

 8   limitations, and so has read the Federal rule to avoid

 9   the conflict.

10                  Gasperini is one such case with regard to

11   Rule 59, interpreted so that you do not collide with the

12   State policy, and the same thing with Semtek with Rule

13   41(b).   The Federal rule is interpreted so as not to

14   conflict with the State policy.

15                  MR. NELSON:     Well, I would -- I would

16   actually first go back to what the Court said in Walker,

17   and I don't think it's -- Walker v. Armco, and I don't

18   think it's disavowed that that the Federal rule is given

19   its plain meaning, and when a collision is unavoidable,

20   the Court -- the Court recognizes conflict.

21                  Gasperini, I think, is -- is different, with

22   due respect to someone who probably knows more about it

23   than I do.     But as I read Gasperini at least, I see the

24   Court there saying that what is going to be applied in

25   the Federal court is what it saw as a substantive


                                       7

 1   standard limiting damages.           That is to say, damages are

 2   excessive if they are in excess of -- manifestly exceed

 3   what is ­-

 4                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          But there wasn't a cap on

 5   damages in Gasperini.       It wasn't a cap.          It was --

 6                 MR. NELSON:     It wasn't -- excuse me.             I'm

 7   sorry.   Go ahead.

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:          It was that we want the

 9   courts to exercise a role in checking these damages so

10   they won't be excessive.

11                 MR. NELSON:     Well, the -- the Court in

12   Gasperini said what it saw was a substantive principle

13   of New York law, was that damages could not exceed

14   reasonable compensation for the -- for the plaintiff's

15   injuries.    Now, that -- that is not a cap in the sense

16   of $1 million, $5 million, $50,000.               But it's a cap in

17   the sense of providing the substantive standard by which

18   the court determines excessiveness.

19                 And as for Rule 59, the reason the Court saw

20   no conflict there is Rule 59 simply provides the

21   procedural mechanism within which a defendant makes a

22   motion to seek a new trial on the grounds of

23   excessiveness of damages.

24                 But it -- but excessiveness of damages is,

25   to go back to a point that was made in the previous


                                      8

 1   argument, like fairness.     Fairness in relation to what?

 2   Excessiveness of damages has to be judged according to

 3   what the State law is on what damages one is entitled to

 4   recover.

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Under -- under your

 6   theory, are all of the statutes set forth by the

 7   Respondents in their appendices invalid in Federal

 8   court?

 9               MR. NELSON:     No, Your Honor, certainly not.

10   Especially given that their appendix -- half of it

11   consists of Federal statutes, which of course are valid

12   because Congress -- Congress can --

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, not half.

14               MR. NELSON:     Well, a significant number.           I

15   -- I think it's -- it's a goodly number.

16               Now, as to the State statutes, I think the

17   State statutes are very different.              Some of them may or

18   may not be valid, but they operate very differently from

19   the State statute at issue here.

20               They focus on particular rights of action.

21   Some of them set forth limits on recovery that really

22   are set forth as damages caps, and all of them are tied

23   specifically to the substantive cause of action created

24   by State law.

25               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          So suppose in this case


                                    9

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   the New York legislature, instead of having a statute

 2   that covered penalties generally, minimum recoveries

 3   generally, wrote into each statute, each penalty

 4   statute, each minimal recovery statute, that this suit

 5   must -- may not be brought as a class action -- instead

 6   of having     an encompassing statute that covered all of

 7   them, wrote into each individual statute that

 8   limitation.

 9                 MR. NELSON:      I would agree that that

10   presents a very different question.                I'm not -- I'm

11   still not certain that I -- that I think that the State

12   court can do that, because I don't think that a

13   limitation on whether an action can be brought as a

14   class establishes substantive rights within the meaning

15   of the Rules Enabling Act.

16                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           So you -- are you telling

17   me that even if New York had provided for a specific

18   penalty for a specific matter, the Federal court could

19   disregard that and make it a class action, even if the

20   State that created the right said, this is a right for

21   an individual only?

22                 MR. NELSON:      Well, I -- again, I think

23   that's what the best answer to that question would be,

24   because the -- the right in a class action is still an

25   individual right; it's simply the -- the question is


                                      10

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   simply whether multiple claims of multiple parties can

 2   be aggregated in a single action.          That doesn't expand

 3   the right that the -- that the State legislature has

 4   created for the individual.

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Are you saying that even

 6   if it -- then you are telling me it doesn't make any

 7   difference whether they do it across the board, as they

 8   did here, or in each penalty statute it says no class

 9   action.

10               MR. NELSON:     Again, what I'm saying is it

11   certainly may make a difference in the sense that the

12   Court doesn't have to go nearly that far to resolve this

13   case.

14               If that case were presented, I'm simply

15   saying that -- that I still don't think that that

16   necessarily establishes a substantive right within the

17   meaning of the Rules Enabling Act.

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Well, does it or not?    I

19   mean, it presented you -- here's a case that says:             You

20   can sue for this penalty but only in an individual

21   action.

22               MR. NELSON:     Yes.       As I've said, I think the

23   best answer to that question is:          That does not

24   establish a substantive right.         It establishes a

25   procedural right with respect to --


                                   11

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So you are saying that

 2   even if New York didn't use this shorthand, even if they

 3   incorporated it into each penalty statute, your answer

 4   would be the same --

 5               MR. NELSON:        Yes, my answer would be the

 6   same, but this -- the result here doesn't turn on that

 7   answer being correct.

 8               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            I'm sorry.

 9   Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical was you are entitled to

10   $100 as a statutory penalty but only if it's an

11   individual claim.     If you -- if this is brought as a

12   class action, you don't get the statutory penalty.             I

13   thought that was the substance of her question.

14               Now, are you saying that also is merely

15   procedural and -- and pre-empted by Rule 23?

16               MR. NELSON:        I think -- I think it's

17   procedural in the sense that it establishes -- if it

18   establishes a right, the right it establishes is

19   procedural and procedural rights don't override the --

20               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Counsel, you get $100 or

21   you don't get $100.     How can you be any less substantive

22   than getting the $100 or not getting the $100?

23               MR. NELSON:        Whether you -- when ­ when

24   what determines whether you get it is the form of the

25   action that you have brought in a Federal court and


                                      12

 1   whether it has been brought aggregated with other --

 2                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Then under your view,

 3   there is absolutely nothing, no law that the State could

 4   pass that would not conflict with Rule 23 --

 5                MR. NELSON:      No.

 6                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          -- as it -- as with

 7   respect to class actions?

 8                MR. NELSON:      I mean, one thing that the

 9   Court could do is that it could establish a cap that

10   applied with respect to --

11                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          You mean the State could

12   do.

13                MR. NELSON:      I'm sorry, yes.           I misspoke.

14   The State could certainly establish a cap that applied

15   whether an action was brought as a class action or an

16   individual action.    In other words, for any related

17   series of transactions, the overall damages to which

18   this defendant can be subjected, whether in a

19   multiplicity of individual actions or in a class action

20   is X.   That, I think, would clearly be substantive.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Well, it has to

22   apply to individual actions as well?

23                MR. NELSON:      I think -- I think if -- if the

24   application of the -- of the statute depends on

25   whether -- whether the action is brought as a Rule 23


                                     13

 1     action in Federal court or not, to me that's -- that is

 2     placing consequences on a procedural issue, and is not a

 3     matter of substance.

 4                  But, again, I want to emphasize that this

 5     statute is very different from that.              This statute is a

 6     statute that is not even limited to rights of action

 7     under New York State law.         This is an action that --

 8                  JUSTICE SCALIA:          Have they applied it?

 9     If I recall your brief correctly, you say that the New

10     York courts have applied it to causes of action arising

11     under other State laws.       Is that right?

12                  MR. NELSON:      I -- I actually haven't found

13   one that applies it to actions arising under other State

14     laws.   I have -- I found actions that apply it to

15   actions arising under Federal law.               And the principal one

16     --

17                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          There is no New York

18     Court of Appeals decision to that effect?

19                  MR. NELSON:      That is correct.         They are

20     rules -- there are decisions of the appellant division.

21     But, as you know this Court very shortly after deciding

22     Erie emphasized, holdings of intermediate State court of

23     appeals are very persuasive data as to what State law

24     is.

25                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          It depends upon the


                                    14

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   persuasiveness of the reasoning of the court.

 2                MR. NELSON:      Yes.      And in this case, the

 3   statute on its face uses the term "right of an action

 4   brought under a statute."         There is no suggestion in

 5   901(b) that it's limited to New York State statutes.

 6   The term "statute" in the -- in the Civil Practice Law

 7   and Rules is not confined to New York State statutes.

 8                Section 901 as a whole clearly is applicable

 9   to -- to rights of action brought under any source of

10   law.   And the New York State courts in the -- the most

11   applicable case, the Rudgayzer case, justified its

12   application of the statute to a Federal right of action

13   on the ground that this was merely an -- a -- a rule

14   that governed local forms of -- of proceeding.

15                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Can't a statute be both?

16   Can a statute both establish a substantive limitation

17   and also establish a rule of procedure for New York

18   courts?   Why can't a statute say, New York courts will

19   not entertain any action, including those arising under

20   foreign law, that are class actions seeking penalties?

21   And also, no New York State cause of action which seeks

22   a penalty can be sued on in a -- in a collaborative

23   action?   Couldn't you do both in the same?

24                MR. NELSON:      Well, a statute certainly

25   phrased that way could do both.           The question is when


                                  15

                                  Official


 1   the statute is not phrased that way, when it's phrased

 2   simply as a general procedural instruction as part of

 3   the general procedural --

 4                  JUSTICE SCALIA:          Well, you are begging the

 5   question.     It's a general instruction.          But can't --

 6   can't the instruction be interpreted to be both?

 7                  MR. NELSON:      Well, the -- the question I

 8   think is -- is what basis would there be for construing

 9   it to be both?     It -- it -- it's unitary in language --

10                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Because the statute may

11   put forth both a substantive policy and a procedural

12   policy.     I'll give you a concrete example.

13                  New York establishes a claim and says in the

14   statute:     But this sort of claim has to be brought

15   within 1 year.     Then New York gets a similar claim

16   under another State's law, and it says, even though we

17   applied our -- even though our statute applies to our

18   own law in a substantive way -- that is, it says you

19   have no action after a certain amount of time ­- we

20   don't want our courts to be cluttered with claims from

21   out of State when we wouldn't entertain similar claims

22   in our own State.

23                  That is certainly the way statutes of

24   limitations have been interpreted by a number of States

25   as having both a procedural aspect and a substantive


                                    16

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   aspect.

 2                  MR. NELSON:      Well, I -- I certainly agree

 3   that statutes of limitations are generally applied by

 4   State courts to foreign causes of action.                And that's

 5   because, I think, for choice of law purposes, they are

 6   considered and were traditionally considered to be

 7   procedural matters.       It's only with the advent of Erie

 8   that they were characterized as substantive matters for

 9   purposes of -- of the application of -- of the

10   doctrine.

11                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         Well, that is not

12   altogether true, because there was always recognition

13   that a so-called built-in statute of limitations was

14   substantive.

15                  MR. NELSON:      If -- if the right of action

16   itself is delimited, as opposed to a statute of

17   limitation which, you know, cuts off your ability to

18   sue but supposedly doesn't cut off the underlying

19   right, yes, I think that's right.                But, again, that goes

20   to -- to the fact that, you know, it does make a

21   difference whether a legislature chooses to establish a

22   rule as a general procedural matter or whether it makes

23   it integral to the -- to the definition of the right.

24                  And as this Court said in the -- in the Byrd

25   case, that when looking at -- at State law -- and there


                                    17

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                Official


 1   the question was whether an issue was an issue for the

 2   jury.   But in determining whether it would be considered

 3   to be substantive or procedural, the question is whether

 4   it is so bound up with the definition of the rights and

 5   obligations under State law that it will be deemed to be

 6   part of the substance of the law or whether it simply

 7   relates to a mode of enforcing the right.          And -- and --

 8                JUSTICE GINSBURG:         I thought Byrd turned on

 9   the characteristics of a Federal court and that is the

10   judge/jury relationship.

11                MR. NELSON:      Well, Byrd -- Byrd turns in

12   part on that, but it also turns on -- on the Court's

13   view that -- that that issue, whether a case -- an issue

14   is decided by -- by jury or judge, is -- is one that is

15   not substantive under the Erie doctrine.         So -- so there

16   are two aspects, I think, to what the Court is doing in

17   Byrd.   But one of them --

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:         Well, it wouldn't matter

19   what the answer to that was, with the Seventh Amendment

20   looming over that case.

21                MR. NELSON:      Well, you know, the Court

22   didn't decide it as a Seventh Amendment issue, and --

23   and because that particular question, I think, was --

24   was a question that arose out of a State law

25   administrative scheme, I think it's controversial


                                  18

                                  Official


 1   whether it -- whether the Seventh Amendment would apply,

 2   and the Court, I think, advisedly decided that as an

 3   Erie case rather than as a Seventh Amendment case.

 4                  I want to also --

 5                  JUSTICE STEVENS:         Can I ask you one brief

 6   hypothetical?

 7                  MR. NELSON:      Sure.

 8                  JUSTICE STEVENS:         Supposing this statute,

 9   instead of being as broad as it is, said any statute

10   imposing penalties against insurance companies may not

11   be brought as a class action, any claims brought under

12   that statute?

13                  MR. NELSON:      Justice Stevens, I think the

14   outcome there would more clearly be the same, because,

15   again, it would not be -- it would not be part of the --

16   of the New York State law definition of the right to

17   insurance --

18                  JUSTICE STEVENS:         I thought you said that if

19   it puts a ceiling on it, that would be -- that would be

20   substantive rather than procedural.

21                  MR. NELSON:      Well, if -- if -- if the Court

22   put a ceiling on rights of action under its own law --

23                  JUSTICE STEVENS:         Right.

24                  MR. NELSON: -- its own State laws, that I

25   think becomes a substantive matter.              The statute that I

                               Official


 1   think you've -- you've hypothesized here is one that is

 2   based on the characteristics of the defendant regardless

 3   of the source of law under which it's being sued.

 4               JUSTICE STEVENS:         Well, you can make it a

 5   claim brought under the insurance code, instead of

 6   against insurance companies.

 7               MR. NELSON:      Yes.     Well, that then, I think,

 8   becomes very similar to the -- the hypothetical statutes

 9   that Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor were positing, and

10   I acknowledge that that is -- that that is a much harder

11   question.

12               But, again, I think, ultimately, if the ­-

13   if the issue addressed by the statute is, shall claims

14   of individuals be aggregated and adjudicated as part of

15   one unit, that is a substantive matter -- or a

16   procedural matter and is governed in the Federal courts

17   by a Federal procedural standard.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            What if the basis

19   for the restriction is the additional administrative

20   costs of a class action?       In other words, it doesn't

21   say you can't bring it, but it says any recovery shall

22   be reduced by 10 percent because class actions cost more

23   than individual actions?

24               MR. NELSON:      Well, there -- that I think

25   would be a statute that is serving a manifestly


                                 20

                      Alderson Reporting Company
                                Official


 1   procedural interest, and if the Federal courts have not

 2   chosen in their rules to impose an administrative charge

 3   on class actions, a State law that purported to do so

 4   would -- would not -- not have any application to

 5   Federal procedure.

 6                That -- that statute I think would be not

 7   only foreclosed in its operation by the Rules Enabling

 8   Act and Hanna v. Plumer, but would just be, on its face,

 9   something that, even leaving aside the Federal rules,

10   would fall on the procedural side of the line in just

11   classic Erie terms because the policies that it reflects

12   are manifestly procedural.

13                And I think, actually, the same is true

14   here.   A statute --

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:         How is it different from

16   security for costs?     I mean, that's what I started with.

17   That's -- there's nothing in the Federal rules that

18   say security for costs.

19                MR. NELSON:      Well, the -- the -- as I

20   understand the Court's reasoning in Cohen, the security

21   was -- was not just for the cost of the action, but for

22   the plaintiff's liability to the corporation that was

23   created under State law in the case of an unsuccessful

24   derivative action.

25                And that liability was what the Court looked


                                  21

                                Official


 1   at in Cohen as -- as making -- making the fundamental

 2   issue substantive, and the bond was sort of the -- you

 3   know, the tail on the dog, in the sense that the Court

 4   characterized it as substantive, having first

 5   characterized the damages remedy as substantive because

 6   without the bond, according to the majority, the remedy

 7   would be meaningless.

 8               I -- you know, the proposition was certainly

 9   debatable -- even Justice --

10               JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Without the bond, the

11   remedy would be -- I don't -- this is a plaintiff

12   that had to put up security for costs.

13               MR. NELSON:       Right, and -- but -- but the

14   remedy I'm referring to is the defendant's right to

15   recover damages from the plaintiff under State law if a

16   derivative action was unsuccessful.            And it was securing

17   that remedy that the -- that the Court saw the bond to

18   be critical to, which was not only why it -- it treated

19   it as substantive, but also granted an interlocutory

20   appeal because, if -- if the bond wasn't there, the

21   right to recover from this plaintiff would be -- would

22   be meaningless.

23               That was -- that was, as I understand it,

24   the Court's reasoning.

 6                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 7               MR. LANDAU:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 8   please the Court:

 9               As some of Justice Ginsburg's initial

10   questions point out, this case falls within the

11   heartland of Erie because allowing plaintiffs to recover

12   State law penalties in Federal court that they can't

13   recover in State court on a State law cause of action

14   would powerfully distort ex ante forum choices, which is

15   precisely what the Erie doctrine seeks to avoid.

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             But isn't Rule 23 a

17   judgment by Congress that class actions that meet the

18   criteria of Rule 23 are fair and efficient, correct?

19   That's Congress's judgment?

20               MR. LANDAU:         No, Your Honor.

21               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             Under your theory, any

22   State could pass a law that says no cause of action

23   under State law can be brought as a class action ever.

24   That would be your theory because it's substantive, if

25   it's an Erie choice.

 1                 MR. LANDAU:      Two points, Your Honor.        First,

 2   of course, Rule 23 is not enacted by Congress.            That's

 3   one of the important points here, that it comes out of

 4   this Court.

 5                 It's delegated authority under the Rules

 6   Enabling Act to set forth these rules, so there is

 7   always a limitation on what a rule of procedure can do.

 8   That's why there is an advisory committee that sets it.

 9   It's not a statute, and there are -- there are

10   restrictions on -- on the rules that don't apply to

11   Congress.

12                 But going to the substance of your question,

13   Your Honor, Rule 23 governs the criteria for when --

14   when you can have a class, but it doesn't address the

15   underlying question, which is:            Can you have a class in

16   the first place?

17                 Is there -- the legislature that creates the

18   cause of action can say, this is categorically

19   ineligible for class certification.

20                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          You haven't quite

21   answered my question.

22                 MR. LANDAU:      I'm sorry.

23                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          Your State can come in

24   and say, no State cause of action will ever be subject

25   to class treatment.      And you would say there is no


                                   24

 1   conflict between that and Rule 23?

 2                MR. LANDAU:       Well, Your Honor, if the State

 3   is talking about its own State law causes of action, the

 4   State is the master.      The State creates these causes of

 5   action in the first place.             If a State, like New York

 6   did here, says certain causes of action ­-

 7                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           No.    No State cause of

 8   action can be brought as a class.               You're saying there

 9   is no conflict with Rule 23's judgment about efficiency

10   of Federal court litigation?

11                MR. LANDAU:       Well, Your Honor, it could be,

12   if a State said that no State cause of action could be

13   brought as a class action, that that -- you have to look

14   at what the State was doing in making that rule.

15                If the State --

16                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Just what it's doing

17   here.   There are some things -- we make a policy choice,

18   the State, that, contrary to Rule 23, that there are

19   some causes of action that are not fairly and

20   efficiently brought as a class.

21                That's what the State has said as a policy

22   choice, correct?

23                MR. LANDAU:       Well, Your Honor, no, because

24   the policy choice here is a substantive policy choice to

25   limit penalties from being distorted in a class action

 1   case.

 2                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          It's a policy choice.

 3                  MR. LANDAU:      Well, if the -- if the State,

 4   Your Honor, makes a policy choice, it is a substantive

 5   policy choice, as I believe -- your hypothetical, at

 6   some points, was talking about what sounded like a

 7   substantive policy choice.

 8                  If it makes a procedural policy choice, as,

 9   in a sense, Mississippi has done and Virginia, by simply

10   not having class actions at all -- they don't have that

11   -- well, then that doesn't raise an issue under the

12   Rules of Decision Act because it's not --

13                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          So you have answered my

14   question.     Under your view, a State could say, no class

15   actions.

16                  MR. LANDAU:      A State --

17                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          And -- and a Federal

18   court, sitting in diversity, could never aggregate those

19   claims, those State law claims?

20                  MR. LANDAU:      For State law claims, yes.         If

21   it makes a substantive decision that we want -- a State

22   could abolish that cause of action altogether, Your

23   Honor.     And I think the concern that Your Honor is

24   expressing is somehow that Federal courts could be

25   flooded with State law causes of action.             Well, that


                                    26

 1   won't happen because they would still have to meet

 2   Federal jurisdictional norms to get into Federal court.

 3                  So you won't get small State law claims.

 4   You would still have to meet the requirements for

 5   Federal jurisdiction.

 6                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            Counsel, do I ­- do

 7   I understand your response to turn on -- let's say the

 8   State, for example, limits class actions because it

 9   doesn't want vast exposure under the penalty provisions

10   that you could get in a class action.              It only wants to

11   pay when they can be brought on an individual basis.

12   But they may also limit class actions by saying, as

13   Justice Sotomayor suggested, that they are not fair and

14   efficient.     Do you get one result in the former case and

15   a different result in the latter?

16                  MR. LANDAU:      Well, the Erie -- you could,

17   Your Honor.     The answer -- the short answer is "yes",

18   because the Erie cases have looked to the purpose.

19                  I think Justice --

20                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            How do you -- how do

21   you tell?

22                  MR. LANDAU:      Well, Your Honor, it's not

23   always easy.

24                  Erie cases, for that reason, are not

25   always -- result in easy line-drawing.              Certainly, in

 1   making the Erie choice, this Court has looked to the

 2   State's purpose.

 3                Here, in this case, it happens to be --

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             I suppose it's

 5   pertinent, then, whether they do it, as I think you

 6   were -- was discussed earlier, on an across-the-board

 7   basis or on an individual basis?

 8                MR. LANDAU:       I think that's something that

 9   one could look at, as part of determining how -- what is

10   the design and operation in State court.

11                And on that point, I'll say the other side

12   does try to make it seem like it is absolutely

13   dispositive that this is being applied more broadly than

14   New York State law causes of action.

15                There is two responses.            First, they really

16   haven't proven that.      The only case they have that

17   actually has applied it to anything other than a New

18   York cause of action is the Rudgayzer case under the

19   Telephone Consumer Protection Act, which is a very

20   unique Federal statute that specifically incorporates

21   State law.   It looks to State law.             And the Rudgayzer

22   court didn't come in and say, this is broadly applicable

23   to a Federal cause of action.           It relied on that very

24   language.

25                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Counsel, how can you say


                                   28

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   that?   The case itself says:             We read the language of

 2   the statute; Congress didn't say this was to be a class

 3   action; we are not permitting it.                I understand the

 4   difference, and it could have argued or analyzed the

 5   case the way you said, but the appellate division there

 6   did exactly what your adversary said it did.

 7                MR. LANDAU:        We are -- we disagree ­- I

 8   mean, what the court did in Rudgayzer -- they did not

 9   say, this applies     broadly to all New York -- to all

10   Federal causes of     action.           It looked at the TCPA and

11   said the TCPA is a special statute that refers to the

12   law of the State.     It's an unusual statute.            So again, I

13   think the Rudgayzer case, if you look at the analysis,

14   it supports us.

15                But even more broadly, Your Honor, I think

16   the key point is what they are trying to get at somehow

17   by -- by saying that this applies broadly is to say that

18   New York would treat this as procedural.               And they are

19   -- they are asking this Court essentially to speculate

20   on that.   But there is no need to speculate because the

21   New York Court of Appeals 2 years ago addressed this

22   statute in quite some detail in the Sperry case, and the

23   New York Court of Appeals actually went through why the

24   statute was adopted, why 901(b) was adopted.               And the

25   New York Court of Appeals specifically said it was a

 1   response.   The word -- it said, you know, when -- when

 2   New York modernized its class action statute regime in

 3   1975, there was concern expressed among a lot of people

 4   that applying penalties on a class-wide basis, statutory

 5   penalties and minimum measures of recovery unrelated to

 6   any actual damages, would be distorted and there would

 7   be overdeterrence and overkill in the class action

 8   context.

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:             Suppose the reason --

10   suppose the reason that they did that -- suppose they

11   are very honest about their reasons, and they say, we

12   think class actions are very often a very good thing,

13   because a lot of people who are hurt can get some

14   recovery and it acts as a deterrent.             But there is some

15   bad things about them.        And one of the bad things is,

16   somebody files a lawsuit, and before you know it, the

17   litigation expenses are so high that the company feels

18   it has to settle.     Now, in our view that latter factor

19   predominates.   And that means that these procedures,

20   class actions, will sometimes -- too often -- lead to

21   the unjust, inefficient settlement of disputes.                And

22   that's why we are doing it.

23               MR. LANDAU:         I think that's exactly what

24   they did here, Your Honor.

25               JUSTICE BREYER:             All right, if that's


                                    30

 1   exactly what we did, why isn't that second-guessing the

 2   judgment of the rule that they are saying it

 3   is efficient -- an inefficient procedure.              It is

 4   inefficient in terms of the object of -- of the Federal

 5   rules and what the class wanted.              We want efficient

 6   methods of achieving justice.

 7               MR. LANDAU:      I'm sorry, to the extent -- the

 8   hypothetical I thought you were saying, they were

 9   recognizing that it would be overdeterrence --

10               JUSTICE BREYER:          Overdeterrence because they

11   feel that the class action procedure is one that leads

12   to forcing companies to settle, and to that extent the

13   class action procedure does not lead to the efficient

14   determination of disputes but to the inefficient and

15   unjust determination.     That's their honest reason.

16               MR. LANDAU:      Right, Your Honor.         I think

17   what -- what I hear them saying in your hypothetical is

18   not really the operation of judicial process.             It

19   doesn't go to the criteria.

20               JUSTICE BREYER:          No, it does.     It says

21   it's the judicial process that does it.

22               MR. LANDAU:      Well, I think --

23               JUSTICE BREYER:          It's the judicial process

24   and its expanse --

25               MR. LANDAU:      I think --

 1               JUSTICE BREYER:          -- that forces the

 2   settlements that create unjust results.

 3               MR. LANDAU:      Right, but I think there they

 4   are looking at the unjust results.            As I hear your

 5   hypothetical, you're saying ­-

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:          That may be, and suppose

 7   they said, you know, a 30-day period for appeal creates

 8   unjust results in our opinion, and therefore we think it

 9   is more efficient to have a 90-day appeal period.              That

10   wouldn't last for 2 seconds, wouldn't it?

11               MR. LANDAU:      No, because then you would --

12               JUSTICE BREYER:          So how is this different?

13               MR. LANDAU:      Because then you would have

14   a clear Hanna problem, Your Honor.            I think -- let's go

15   back to the threshold question.          They try to get around

16   what is a clear forum distortion, a clear Erie problem

17   by saying you don't even get to Erie because you have a

18   threshold Hanna issue, which is Rule 23 answers this

19   question.

20               I didn't hear any real analysis from the

21   other side of what is it in Rule 23 that actually says

22   that you must be able to certify a class in every single

23   cause of action that comes before you, even if the very

24   legislature that created the cause of action says you

25   may not have a class?

 1               In fact, I think the Chief Justice earlier

 2   asked how this case differs from the statutes in

 3   appendices A and B.    And I think I really didn't really

 4   hear a very clear answer.        The statutes in Appendix A

 5   are all statutes where States and the Federal Government

 6   have put caps on the recovery in class actions.         That

 7   shows that you can have a substantive cap on what is a

 8   procedural device.

 9               JUSTICE STEVENS:         Yes, well, let me be -- I

10   just say I want -- I want to be sure I understood your

11   answer to Justice Sotomayor.         Is it your position that,

12   if we follow your view in this case, it would also be

13   true that -- if New York had passed a statute saying no

14   cause of action based on New York law may be maintained

15   as a class action?

16               MR. LANDAU:      Yes, Your Honor.     If New York

17   did that -- I guess my answer is -- you really would

18   have to look behind that.        If it simply said -- if

19   Mississippi and Virginia codified their current

20   nonexistence of -- nonauthorization of class actions

21   under State law and affirmatively said that there may

22   not be a class action --

23               JUSTICE STEVENS:         And that would -- that

24   would apply not only to statutory causes of action but

25   causes of action based on New York common law.

 1                 MR. LANDAU:      Right.      Under -- under New York

 2   law.   If they were making decisions, they having created

 3   these causes of action under their own State's law, if

 4   they think it would be overdeterrent to have these kinds

 5   of actions brought on a class-wide basis and they were

 6   really enacting this for purposes of limiting the

 7   remedies that were available for these causes of action

 8   that they created, I -- there would be a strong argument

 9   that that should apply under --

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            But I guess --

11                 MR. LANDAU:      -- under Erie.

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            But -- but

13   wouldn't Justice Stevens's hypothetical suggest that

14   they were less concerned about the impact of -- of the

15   class action procedure than they were about its

16   procedural efficiency?       In other words, I understand

17   your position if you're saying, look, we've only got $20

18   million in this fund to pay plaintiffs and we think it's

19   better to go on an individual basis, because if it's a

20   class action, you know, it would be over in one shot or

21   whatever --

22                 MR. LANDAU:      Right.

23                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            -- but it's not

24   appropriate to say, we don't like the class action

25   procedure as a general matter.

 1                 MR. LANDAU:      Right.

 2                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              And in Justice

 3   Stevens's hypothetical, it applied across the board,

 4   which would cause me, anyway, to think it was the

 5   latter.

 6                 MR. LANDAU:      I would agree with Your Honor.

 7   If you have an unadorned prohibition on class actions in

 8   the State -- from a State, I think the most natural

 9   understanding of that is that was their determination of

10   how the procedures in their courts are going to work.

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          It has to be one or the

12   other, though.    You -- you -- is it your position that

13   if this is substantive, as you contend, it cannot be

14   procedural?    So New York State could not apply this --

15   this rule to out-of-State causes of action, and if it

16   did, you -- you ought to have lost this case.

17                 MR. LANDAU:      No, Your Honor -- again, I

18   think they can blend.       I think in Gasperini this Court

19   pointed out that the -- the heightened standard of

20   judicial review of damages awards had a manifestly -- it

21   was a procedural command with a manifestly substantive

22   purpose.   I think this case is not really dissimilar.

23   Instead -- the cases in Appendix A say that in a

24   class -- excuse me, the statutes say in a class action

25   you may not recover more than X.                The only difference


                                   35

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                               Official


 1   here is it says, if you are seeking to recover more than

 2   X, you may not have a class action.

 3               And with respect to the statutes in Appendix

 4   B, those say there may not be a class action for

 5   particular causes of action.         I don't --

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:         New York doesn't have --

 7   as the -- the question that Justice Sotomayor asked and

 8   that Justice Stevens asked -- doesn't have any

 9   anti-class action as a procedural policy.         It has picked

10   out a particular kind of action, one for a penalty, one

11   where there's -- what is it -- minimum recovery, and

12   said that category, we have -- we're not anti-class

13   action in general, but these penalties that we created,

14   we don't want those brought as class actions.

15               MR. LANDAU:      Precisely, Your Honor.    And I

16   think that underscores is why this is substantive or the

17   fact that this reflects a substantive policy decision.

18   It is not about the efficiency or operation of the

19   class action process itself, the judicial process.        This

20   is a substantive decision to calibrate the remedy that

21   New York has afforded under its own law, and a decision

22   that when you have penalties that New York has decided

23   -- and the Sperry case is very explicit on this -- that

24   New York made a decision that the -- the appropriate

25   level of enforcement for those was the level in an


                                 36

                      Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   individual action, and that when you got -- when you

 2   tried to make it into a class, that that would be

 3   overenforcement of those.          And --

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           One -- one question that

 5   was raised by the other side is, well, if you're saying

 6   this kind of restriction -- restriction on class action

 7   -- applies in a diversity case, why not a State that

 8   says we love class actions and we want class actions to

 9   be -- not to be hemmed in by all of the Rule 23

10   requirements?

11               MR. LANDAU:        Then, Your Honor, you would

12   have a Hanna issue because Rule 23 does set forth the

13   criteria for a Federal court to certify a class.

14               State law cannot change or water down those

15   criteria or direct that you get to the goal line of a

16   certified class by some mechanism other than the Rule 23

17   criteria.

18               Our position, Your Honor, our point is that

19   you don't get to the Rule 23 criteria if the State law

20   or the substantive law that creates the cause of action

21   sends you off the highway before you get into the land

22   of the criteria.

23               If it just says, this is categorically

24   unavailable as a class, as many States have, in fact,

25   done in the statutes in Appendix B -- they have come up

 1   with novel causes of action sometimes, abusive e-mail

 2   cause of action.

 3                And they said, well, we do not want a class

 4   action to be brought for this kind of claim.              That is a

 5   decision that reflects a substantive choice by the

 6   legislature that it would be overdeterrence and

 7   overenforcement to have this brought on a class-wide

 8   basis.

 9                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Well, it -- it only

10   reflects a substantive choice -- if it is a substantive

11   choice.   If they say, we are not going to allow class

12   actions because we think, procedurally, they are a bad

13   idea because we think lawyers get too much recovery when

14   they recover -- in other words, it -- your -- your

15   position depends upon a characterization of the ban, and

16   the restriction on class actions is either substantive

17   or procedural.

18                MR. LANDAU:       Well, Your Honor, I think what

19   you can -- you can assume that, if they are not changing

20   their criteria and not changing the rules governing all

21   class actions, but singling out particular causes of

22   action or particular penalties, that it's done for a

23   substantive reason.

24                Here, in New York, we actually know that's

25   true because the Sperry court says that.             And one, I


                                   38

 1   think, important point in 901(b) is the initial clause,

 2   the "unless" clause, that we have been focusing a lot on

 3   the last clause that says it may not be brought as a --

 4   as a class action, if it's seeking a statutory penalty.

 5               But it says, "unless a statute creating or

 6   imposing a penalty or minimum measure of recovery

 7   specifically authorizes the recovery thereof in a class

 8   action."

 9               That's showing, that even though this is

10   located in the CPLR, that it's really part and parcel of

11   their statutory regime.      It's saying, this is our

12   statutory default rule.

13               To be sure, a New York statute can override

14   that, but the idea that this is somehow simply

15   procedural because it's in the CPLR is really belied by

16   that language that -- that really shows that -- and,

17   frankly, I think it also belies the fact that this

18   applies to causes of action outside of New York because

19   the "unless" clause really can only be understood as

20   setting a default baseline for the New York legislature

21   in enacting a statute, that they may want to

22   specifically authorize class actions for penalties.

23               So, again, I think --

24               JUSTICE STEVENS:         Let me just be sure I am

25   not lost on one point.     Does this just apply to

 1   statutory cause of action created by New York law?               Or

 2   does it apply to a statutory cause of action created by

 3   New Mexico law?

 4                 MR. LANDAU:       New York law, Your Honor.

 5   There's nothing --

 6                 JUSTICE STEVENS:          The language doesn't limit

 7   it that way, does it?

 8                 MR. LANDAU:       You are right, Your Honor, but,

 9   again, you read language against certain background

10   assumptions and norms that States when they're --

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:          Well, let me ask you this

12   question:     Supposing it did apply to statutory cause of

13   actions created by New Mexico law?

14                 MR. LANDAU:       You know, and the truth is,

15   Your Honor, I think it still wouldn't matter at the end

16   of the day.    I think, in Gasperini, the law -- the

17   provision of the CPLR in Gasperini provided for

18   heightened review.

19                 There was no indication that that applied

20   only to New York causes of action.               Again, it may be one

21   clue, but it's not dispositive.

22                 JUSTICE STEVENS:          But it seems to me that

23   your position basically is that New York can decide what

24   kinds of cases shall be brought as class actions,

25   period.

 1                 MR. LANDAU:      Well, Your Honor, if New York

 2   decides, for substantive reasons -- and we are talking

 3   about New York causes of action --

 4                 JUSTICE STEVENS:         Well, whatever the

 5   reason --

 6                 MR. LANDAU:      Okay.

 7                 JUSTICE STEVENS:         -- for some good reason.

 8                 MR. LANDAU:      Right.      Well -- well,

 9   New York -- yes, that New York can make a decision

10   that it doesn't want certain New York causes of action

11   to be brought as class actions, and the Federal courts

12   --

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            But the question is

14   New Mexico causes of action.           Can they decide that they

15   don't want actions from outside of the State to be

16   brought as class actions?

17                 MR. LANDAU:      Well, Your Honor, I think that

18   would raise some interesting questions about New York's

19   power to --

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            What it would do, it

21   seems to me, is make it clear that was not a

22   substantive decision, but, instead, a procedural

23   decision.

24                 MR. LANDAU:      Correct, Your Honor.        That's

 1                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But it could be -- it

 2   could be, as I -- the example of the statute of

 3   limitations.     We create a claim.              It has a certain life.

 4   It's dead after that time.              That's New York law.

 5                  A sister State may say, we create the same

 6   claim, but we think it has a longer life.                 New York

 7   would say, that's fine.         Bring that claim in your own

 8   State.   Don't clutter up our courts with out-of-State

 9   claims when we would not hear the identical claim under

10   our own law.

11                  There are policies that do operate as

12   procedural limitations and have a substantive thrust.

13                  MR. LANDAU:      Absolutely.

14                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           New York might well say,

15   look, we don't hear in New York penalty cases, and so we

16   are not going to entertain the sister State claim for

17   any -- when we wouldn't entertain our own.                 We are not

18   frustrating the sister State.              They could bring the

19   class action there, but not in -- not in our courts.

20                  MR. LANDAU:      And I think the point -- I

21   agree 100 percent.      I think the point that you are --

22   that point underscores, Your Honor, is that, ultimately,

23   the Erie issue is a Federal issue.

24                  You can look to New York to try to

25   understand the design and operation of the State rule at


                                    42

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   issue, but, ultimately, you are being asked, as a

 2   Federal court, to set the appropriate relationship

 3   between the State court system and the Federal court

 4   system.

 5                  And, again, the lesson of Erie is you don't

 6   want to create incentives that will bring people like a

 7   magnet to Federal court and distort these ex ante

 8   foreign choices of litigants for State law claims.

 9                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:         Well, they -- they bring

10   up the Class Action Fairness Act, which allows a

11   plaintiff -- they allow a defendant to remove a

12   class action from a State court to a Federal court, but

13   they also allow a plaintiff to initiate an action in the

14   Federal court.

15                  MR. LANDAU:      That's correct, Your Honor, but

16   the Class Action Fairness Act, on its face -- and the

17   legislative history actually makes this point explicit

18   -- it had no intention to change the operation of the

19   Erie doctrine in class actions.

20                  And so there is nothing in the Class Action

21   Fairness Act that changes the scope of Rule 23.           Again,

22   Rule 23 just doesn't address this antecedent issue.            It

23   assumes, but does not require, that you have a cause of

24   action that is amenable to class certification in the

25   first place.

 1               And if you were to construe Rule 23

 2   otherwise, as overriding this kind of statute -- all the

 3   statutes in Appendix B, that would be a truly remarkably

 4   substantive interpretation that this Court has always

 5   stressed, that it must, in construing the rules, be

 6   careful not to tread into that territory and has

 7   construed the rules with an eye towards the limitations

 8   of the Rules Enabling Act.

 9               The other side -- Shady Grove would walk you

10   right into an extremely problematic situation from the

11   point of view of the Rules Enabling Act, as well as

12   creating these -- these incentives that really go

13   against the heart of the Erie doctrine that would turn a

14   $500 case into a $5 million case.

15               And one interesting point, I think, is that

16   all these statutes that are listed in our Appendix B

17   that limit class certification for particular causes of

18   action -- under their theory that Rule 23 requires that

19   everything be amenable to class certification, those

20   would all be out the window.

21               I don't think counsel really wanted to admit

22   that this morning, but the logic of their theory that ­-

23   is that Rule 23 governs this case and Rule 23 requires

24   that every cause of action that comes before it be

25   eligible for class certification.


                                 44

 1               That would knock out each and every one of

 2   the statutes in Appendix B.          They don't live up to -- in

 3   their reply brief, at footnote 10, on page 15, they try

 4   to distinguish those statutes by saying, ah, well, the

 5   limitation on class actions in those statutes is in the

 6   substantive cause of action.

 7               It's not in -- it's not somewhere else in

 8   the code, but that doesn't -- that doesn't save their

 9   argument under Rule 23.      They really can't square that

10   with their -- their core position that Rule 23 itself

11   answers the question presented in this case.

12               And, again, what we would ask the Court is

13   just to -- is to recognize that Rule 23 occupies the

14   ground it occupies, but it doesn't go -- it occupies the

15   ground of the criteria, which go to the efficiency and

16   fairness of the process.

17               But where a State has made an antecedent

18   decision that -- that a particular cause of action or

19   a particular remedy is categorically unavailable -- or

20   ineligible for class certification, that's a decision

21   that Federal courts should respect under the Erie

22   doctrine.

23               If there are no further questions, I see my

24   time is about to expire.

 4   4 minutes remaining.

 5             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT L. NELSON

 6                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 7               MR. NELSON:        Thank you.

 8               I would like to begin with the point that my

 9   friend made about the "unless" clause in 901(b) and that

10   that somehow indicated that it applied only to New York

11   State statutes.    In fact, the New York courts have

12   applied that "unless" clause to Federal statutes,

13   holding in one case that the Truth in Lending Act

14   satisfied the "unless" clause because it authorized a

15   class action, and in another that the Telephone Consumer

16   Protection Act did not because it didn't authorize a

17   class action.

18               So it actually is, I think, quite clear from

19   the language of the statute and from the Court's

20   application --

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           There -- when you are

22   dealing with a Federal statute, there's a -- there's a

23   factor that doesn't come up when you are dealing with

24   sister States, and that is the Supremacy Clause.

25               If Congress has made a judgment -- let's say


                                   46

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   1983 -- I don't think the State that says, for our

 2   comparable claims, we don't allow class action could --

 3   could apply that --

 4                MR. NELSON:       I think that's right.    If

 5   Congress had provided that a class action was authorized

 6   in any court under a statute, New York couldn't prevent

 7   it.

 8                But my point here is that the "unless"

 9   clause is simply consistent with the rest of the

10   statute, which makes clear that it applies to statutes

11   from any source.

12                And that means that far from being in the

13   heartland of Erie, this is far outside the heartland of

14   Erie.   It's a case where the State court for procedural

15   -- or the State's legislature, for procedural reasons, a

16   balancing of the fairness and efficiency, the ­- of

17   class actions and those things that must -- that are

18   requisite to the just, speedy, and efficient --

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          I can't see how that's so

20   when they limit just a particular remedy or penalty.          If

21   they were saying, well, across the board we don't want

22   class actions, I could follow your argument much better.

23   But when New York singles out penalties, it seems to be

24   talking not about the efficiency and fairness of

25   proceedings, but that it doesn't want penalty claims to


                                   47

 1   be magnified.

 2               MR. NELSON:      Well, but that's an aspect of

 3   -- of the fairness and efficiency of proceedings.

 4   Remember, of course, these are not claims for which the

 5   plaintiffs can't recover in State court.         They are

 6   simply claims that they have to proceed individually in

 7   State court to pursue.

 8               And the further point I would make is that

 9   the judgment that the -- that the New York legislature

10   makes, that statutory penalties under any set of

11   statutes are not appropriate for class treatment, is

12   really contrary to the decision that the rules drafters

13   of Rule 23 have made, which actually specifies the

14   circumstances under which classes can be certified

15   exactly by reference to the type of relief sought.

16               So it's a case where the rule and the State

17   statute really do cover the same ground, to use the

18   approach this Court took in the Burlington case, where

19   it said that a State statute would not be given

20   effect when the Federal rule occupies the territory.

21   And that's --

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:         But it didn't say that

23   about Rule 59, and it didn't say that about Rule 41(b).

24               MR. NELSON:      And -- and Rule 59 doesn't

25   occupy the territory of the standard to be applied, and


                                 48

                      Alderson Reporting Company
                                Official


 1   Rule 41(b) as construed in Semtek just does not address

 2   preclusive effect.

 3                And finally, again, on the issue of ex ante

 4   forum choice, Congress, in the Class Action Fairness

 5   Act, provided jurisdiction so that Federal procedural

 6   rules would apply.    If, as my friend argues, whether or

 7   not a case can proceed as a class action is a matter of

 8   substantive right, that principle can't be cabined to

 9   cases where the substantive -- or where the State

10   standard precludes class actions.

11                If a class action, yes or no, is a matter of

12   substantive right, that applies equally to State

13   standards that -- that would promote class actions, and

14   therefore, even though as -- as my friend says, it would

15   be a Hanna issue, there would be an abridgement of a

16   substantive right.    So -- I see that my time is --

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            You can finish your

18   thought, if you like.

19                MR. NELSON:      Well, the thought is that

20   that's an indication that amenability to class actions

21   should be treated both for plaintiffs and for defendants

22   as a matter of procedural right governed by the Federal

23   rules.   Thank you.
