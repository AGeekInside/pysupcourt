 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD

 8                     ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 9                 MS. UNDERWOOD:             Thank you, Mr. Chief

10   Justice, and may it please the Court:

11                 Under the OCC regulation at issue here,

12   State antidiscrimination and consumer protection laws

13   can be enforced against national banks by the Federal

14   OCC and by private parties, but not by State attorneys

15   general.     This unusual enforcement pre-emption, which

16   detaches the State's power to make laws from its power

17   to enforce them, was not written into the National Bank

18   Act by Congress in 1864, and it's implausible that

19   Congress implicitly delegated to OCC the power to read

20   it in now.

21                 We know the NBA did not in 1864 enact

22   enforcement pre-emption against the States for three

23   reasons:     First, the words of the statute; second, a

24   long line of cases from this Court, especially St.

25   Louis, upholding the power of the State to enforce laws

 1   against a national bank or rejecting it on the ground

 2   that the law was substantively pre-empted, but not

 3   questioning the power of the State to enforce a valid

 4   law; and, finally, the wholly anomalous character,

 5   foreign really to our structure of government, of

 6   separating the power to make law from the power to

 7   enforce it.

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But to some extent, would

 9   you concede that interpretation; that is, not only the

10   attorney general under New York's law, but the

11   superintendent of banks as well, has authority over

12   mortgage lending?     Would -- would you agree that the

13   part about the bank superintendent's enforcement could

14   not be enforced against national banks?

15                 MS. UNDERWOOD:           Well, first of all, the bank

16   superintendent in New York doesn't have authority over

17   national banks.     It has authority only over State banks,

18   as we pointed out in our reply brief.                     So we don't

19   assert that authority.

20                 I would say that the -- and the injunction

21   doesn't run -- that's at issue in this case, doesn't run

22   against the superintendent.               It runs against the

23   attorney general.     But I would say --

24                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But there is -- the

25   provision that you are talking about, 296(a), concerns

 1   the authority of the bank superintendent as well as the

 2   authority of the attorney general; isn't that so?

 3                MS. UNDERWOOD:          I believe that the banking

 4   superintendent does not assert authority to enforce in a

 5   regulatory fashion against national banks.                If they did,

 6   if -- if -- if the bank superintendent asserted a

 7   chartering or licensing supervisory regime, that would

 8   be a different issue from the question --

 9                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Just with respect to the

10   same issue on mortgage lending where there's a concern

11   about racial discrimination?

12                MS. UNDERWOOD:          Well, the -- the bank -- the

13   banking superintendent of New York does not enforce

14   against national banks.

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Anything?     And you agree

16   to that?

17                MS. UNDERWOOD:          Yes, that is right.

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Even if the New York

19   statute --

20                MS. UNDERWOOD:          Read differently or

21   interpreted or applied differently.

22                What's at issue here is a distinction

23   between a supervisory regime -- "visitation" is a regime

24   characterized by routine examinations, no cause needed,

25   by a chartering or a licensing authority for the purpose

 1   of enforcing limitations on --

 2              JUSTICE BREYER:             How is it supposed to work?

 3   This is what is bothering me at the heart of this case.

 4   I imagine that banks, particularly right in these last

 5   few months, are in situations where there are three

 6   categories of -- of borrowers.             One might be a category

 7   of people whom you are reasonably confident in, and the

 8   second is a category of people who are borderline or

 9   less so, and there are also minorities.

10              Now, where you make the decision as a bank

11   to deny them the loan, it sometimes is difficult to say

12   whether that decision was made for a discriminatory

13   reason, namely race, or for a legitimate reason, namely

14   because this was a person unlikely to pay the money

15   back.

16              Now, how is a bank to function if 50

17   different attorneys general plus the Federal agencies

18   all look at the books of the bank to look at the

19   individual loan and to make that kind of determination

20   about which quite honestly reasonable people will often

21   differ?

22              And how -- how is that really a problem, or

23   am I just creating that?        And if it's really a problem,

24   how in your opinion does the Federal law deal with that

25   problem, if not in the way that your opponent suggests?

 1              MS. UNDERWOOD:            Well, an -- there is a

 2   single standard of discrimination.                 It is the case that

 3   the -- that the Federal standards applied by the OCC and

 4   the State law all look to Title VII law about a prima

 5   facie case being --

 6              JUSTICE BREYER:              If I may say so, that

 7   response overlooks the question.                I don't doubt the

 8   single standard.   What I do doubt is in the -- in the

 9   category of uncertain cases, that 51 different

10   individuals, 50 State attorneys general plus one Federal

11   individual, will reach the same result.

12              MS. UNDERWOOD:            Well --

13              JUSTICE BREYER:              These are hard and,

14   therefore, they will reach a lot of different results

15   under the same standard.

16              MS. UNDERWOOD:            There has been no such

17   multiplicity of -- of enforcement.                 In fact, there is so

18   much antidiscrimination work to go around that having

19   multiple enforcers is a device for --

20              JUSTICE BREYER:              Okay.      So you deny the

21   hypothetical.   You are saying that my analysis of the

22   problem is wrong; there simply is no such problem, and

23   since there is no such problem, it doesn't matter if

24   everyone enforces it.

25              MS. UNDERWOOD:            It is already the case that

 1   under the Fair Housing Act, HUD is required to refer --

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:              Is your answer yes or no to

 3   what I just said, that you deny that the statement of

 4   the problem is realistic and therefore there is no

 5   problem in your view about having 51 different people

 6   enforce the same standard.

 7               MS. UNDERWOOD:            There is no record of any

 8   such problem.   And should such a -- yes.

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:              And should such a problem

10   arise, what?

11               MS. UNDERWOOD:            Should such a problem arise,

12   that would be an occasion for considering a kind of

13   burden pre-emption that would be similar -- on evidence

14   of such a problem, that might be a basis for OCC to make

15   a record and enact a regulation to deal with that --

16               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But if OCC thought there

17   might be such a problem, couldn't it act in advance to

18   avoid the risk that Justice Breyer's question explains?

19               MS. UNDERWOOD:            Well, its regulation doesn't

20   say that.   The injunction that was issued in this case

21   doesn't say that.    What the regulation, the rulemaking,

22   and the injunction all rest on is a legal analysis, not

23   an empirical one.

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              May we clarify one thing

25   about the 50 jurisdictions?              The attorney general from

 1   New York is not asserting authority over bank lending in

 2   Hawaii.   So for each institution, I assume it's going to

 3   be two sovereigns, the OCC and the State attorney

 4   general, not 50 descending on the single -- single bank

 5   with respect to particular loans?

 6               MS. UNDERWOOD:           That's correct.        And the

 7   OCC --

 8               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, that's correct

 9   with respect to a particular loan.                 It's not respect --

10   with respect to Federal policy about national banks

11   around the country.      It's conceivable and I suppose

12   likely that the Federal regulator would want the same

13   rule to apply to banks in Michigan as to banks in

14   Hawaii.

15               MS. UNDERWOOD:           It is.        But if the question

16   was would the -- would the actual act of responding to a

17   complaint or to discovery burden particular people

18   because there would be 50 people asking for the same

19   information, that's not the case, because the loans made

20   in New York would be analyzed by a New York enforcer.

21               JUSTICE BREYER:             I want to --

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Excuse me.      The same rule

23   would not apply in Michigan and Hawaii, anyway, even

24   under the Federal Government.             The Federal Government

25   acknowledges that Michigan can have its own law --

 1                 MS. UNDERWOOD:          The Federal Government --

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           -- and Hawaii can have a

 3   different law.    All the Federal Government is arguing

 4   is:   We want to be the ones to enforce the separate

 5   Michigan law and the separate Hawaii law, right?

 6                 MS. UNDERWOOD:          That appears to be the case.

 7   In fact, they have acknowledged that the State law

 8   actually applies.     It's undisputed.                   OCC said so in its

 9   complaint.    Congress has several times said so, which is

10   presumably why the OCC says so -- said so in the Fair

11   Housing Act savings clause, in the -- in the Equal

12   Credit Opportunity Act savings clause, and in

13   Riegle-Neal, which specifically applies only to national

14   bank branches, but expressly preserves the application

15   of State fair lending and consumer protection laws.

16                 JUSTICE BREYER:           You are just at the point

17   of getting to what I -- the blank in my mind.                     And the

18   blank in my mind is when you said, but if there were

19   such a problem, as I had described, but if there were,

20   then they could -- and now that's the blank.                     Then they

21   could what?

22                 MS. UNDERWOOD:          Well, there are many things

23   that they might do.

24                 JUSTICE BREYER:           For example, just give me

25   two, a couple.

 1                 MS. UNDERWOOD:          For example, make some

 2   provision for -- in fact, I believe there are some

 3   regulations that call for conferencing and collaboration

 4   and consultation among the State enforcers and between

 5   the State and Federal regulators to avoid duplicative

 6   regulation.    There is already the potential with respect

 7   to State banks that are supervised both by State

 8   regulators and by the FDIC.             There are alternate audits

 9   in alternate years.      I mean, there -- there is plenty of

10   precedent in bank regulation for mechanisms for

11   consultation and collaboration so that people don't step

12   on each other's toes.

13                 And in Federal criminal enforcement, for

14   example, there are -- there are many -- many occasions

15   where there is both Federal and State authority to

16   enforce.   And the result of that tends to be to get more

17   extensive, fuller enforcement.               People don't tend to

18   both bring the same case.           If somebody is enforcing

19   something, somebody -- a different enforcer will attack

20   a different problem.

21                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           But the -- in the -- in the

22   general -- in the field of criminal enforcement

23   generally there isn't any provision comparable to what

24   is now 36(f)(1)(B), at least to my knowledge, and it's

25   set out on pages 46 and 47, the text is in the

 1   government's brief:      "The provisions of any State law to

 2   which a branch of a national bank is subject under this

 3   paragraph shall be enforced with respect to such branch

 4   by the OCC."

 5              And that mandate, it "shall be enforced with

 6   respect to such branch" sounds pretty exclusive to me.

 7              MS. UNDERWOOD:            Well --

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:             You can't tell for sure.

 9   But why would -- why would Congress, number one, if

10   it -- if Congress simply assumed that there would be

11   a -- a dual system of enforcement, that OCC could --

12   could say to the bank, you follow State law, and if you

13   don't, we are going to go after you administratively,

14   and leaving it to the State to go after, in any other

15   fashion, what State law provided.                If that was

16   Congress's assumption, why would it have -- have passed

17   this seeming mandate, "shall be enforced with respect to

18   such branch" by the -- by the OCC?

19              MS. UNDERWOOD:            There are two reasons for

20   that provision.   The purpose of that provision was to

21   confirm that OCC didn't lose its pre-existing

22   enforcement power when Riegle-Neal stated -- that's (1)

23   (B) -- in (1)(A) that national branches would be treated

24   more or less like State branches for purposes of

 1              JUSTICE SOUTER:            But that -- that's, in

 2   effect, saving clause kind of function could have been

 3   performed simply by a statute that says OCC may.                And

 4   this says it shall be enforced by OCC.

 5              MS. UNDERWOOD:           There is another reason in

 6   the legislative history, which makes it clear that it

 7   was a directive to OCC to mount an enforcement program

 8   which Congress thought it had not been doing.                We know

 9   that because in the conference report and other

10   legislative history Congress says it's trying to expand,

11   not contract, the enforcement of fair lending and

12   consumer protection laws, and that the law isn't taking

13   any authority away from the States and that they are

14   distressed at the inadequate failure of OCC to exercise

15   its enforcement authority.

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:            You don't deny, do you,

17   that the Federal Government can, if it wishes, enforce

18   the State laws?

19              MS. UNDERWOOD:           Absolutely.

20              JUSTICE SCALIA:            So this provision isn't

21   really contrary to what you are saying.                You are just

22   saying the State can do it as well?

23              MS. UNDERWOOD:           That's correct.        It isn't

24   talking -- it doesn't say anything about exclusive

25   authority, and it isn't talking about judicial


                                      13
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   enforcement, which OCC doesn't do.                It is talking about

 2   it's -- it has a savings clause kind of function and

 3   it -- it's hortatory, it's directing OCC to exercise the

 4   authority that it has.

 5              It seems to be common ground that it didn't

 6   give OCC any new power, because it would be odd to give

 7   OCC different power over the branches -- this only

 8   applies to the branches -- different power to the

 9   branches than over the branches than over the banks,

10   different, more extensive power over consumer protection

11   and fair lending than other kinds of bank enforcement.

12   This was a provision dealing with branches and consumer

13   protection and fair lending that said to OCC:                You still

14   have that authority and you should exercise it.

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But we come to the New

16   York Attorney General.      I see your argument that there's

17   a certain incongruity between saying private attorneys

18   general okay, but no public attorney general.                But on

19   the other hand, the attorney general starts out by

20   asking for bank books and records.                And high on the list

21   of visitorial powers is the authority to demand the

22   bank's books and records.

23              So why isn't that -- his preliminary

24   investigation at least, why doesn't that fit within the

25   visitorial power bundle?


                                      14
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                MS. UNDERWOOD:          Well, because you can look

 2   at books and records under various authorities.              Books

 3   and -- you can look at books and records under your

 4   visitorial authority, if you are the supervisor and have

 5   the relationship to the bank that a licensing or

 6   chartering authority has and you are looking at them for

 7   no particular cause.      Or you can look at books and

 8   records if you have a civil suit against the bank and

 9   you are engaging in discovery that is -- or for that

10   matter a criminal prosecution against the bank, and

11   ancillary to that discovery is required; or in Guthrie,

12   the inquiry -- the looking at books and records was

13   pursuant to a statutory authority for shareholders to

14   look at books and records.

15                So the simple fact of a physical act of

16   looking -- or a legal act of looking at books and

17   records doesn't tell you whether visitorial authority is

18   being exercised.   Visitorial authority has long been

19   understood as a whole regime of oversight.              Watters

20   involved a visitorial regime that was ancillary to

21   licensing.   The earlier visitorial regimes that were

22   referenced in the old treatise tended to involve

23   visitorial regimes that were established ancillary to

24   chartering, back when corporate charters had limited

25   purposes, the way banks do still, but most corporate


                                       15
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   charters, most corporate certificates of incorporation

 2   don't anymore.

 3               So the fact that books and records are being

 4   examined is neither here nor there on the question

 5   whether the visitorial power that is referenced in 484

 6   is -- is being exercised.

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 There is an historic

 8   reason for thinking that Congress would be more

 9   concerned about States exercising visitorial powers than

10   they would be about private attorneys general or private

11   lawyers.   This goes back to McCulloch v. Maryland.

12   National banks were always targeted by the States.                They

13   weren't typically targeted by private attorneys.                So

14   that incongruity doesn't strike me as terribly

15   significant.

16               MS. UNDERWOOD:           Well, the suggestion is made

17   that 484, and there is some historical basis for it, was

18   -- was meant to protect national banks against --

19   against, hostile States, which I guess is what you are

20   suggesting, rather than hostile private people.                But

21   actually what it was meant to do was assign

22   responsibility for the supervision of these new

23   entities -- there hadn't been banks like this, private

24   banks which were nevertheless federally chartered.

25   Before that there was the National Bank that was at


                                       16
                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   issue in McCulloch v Maryland, and to exclude the States

 2   from asserting the authority to do audits, to do regular

 3   banking examinations, which actually one senator had

 4   proposed the States be permitted to do and that was

 5   rejected.

 6               I would say the concern about State

 7   hostility was apparently much reduced by 1869, not much

 8   after this statute was passed, when this Court in

 9   National Bank v. Kentucky upheld the power of the States

10   not just to tax shareholders on their shares, but to

11   require the national banks to help, to require the

12   national banks to pay the tax that was due from those

13   shareholders in order to assist in collection.                 And the

14   Court -- McCulloch was cited to the Court and the Court

15   said it saw no possibility here, unlike in McCulloch,

16   that the State would somehow use its authority in this

17   way to incapacitate the banks or impair them by

18   eliciting their help to collect a valid tax.

19               There actually had been some thought when

20   the national banks were first created that they would,

21   in the marketplace, drive State banks out of existence,

22   but they didn't.   And the story has been one

23   legislatively of maintaining competitive equality

24   between them, not of hostility.               So --

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Do you want to talk

 1   a little bit about Chevron?

 2                 MS. UNDERWOOD:          Yes.

 3                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Whatever the

 4   arguments may be on the merits, it's not clear to me

 5   that visitorial powers has an unambiguous meaning that

 6   would pre-empt the authority of the OCC to explain it to

 7   us.

 8                 MS. UNDERWOOD:          Well, I'd say two thing

 9   about that.    484 may have some ambiguity about it.               I

10   think it is not ambiguous as to the matters covered by

11   this regulation.    Visitorials have -- visitorial powers

12   have never been understood to include discrete acts of

13   law enforcement by a jurisdiction that neither has nor

14   asserts supervisory relationship, the kind of

15   supervisory relationship that the chartering or

16   licensing sovereign has.          So I think --

17                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           What do you say about the

18   quotations in the -- the brief that Mr. Waxman filed, as

19   I recall; it may have been the government's brief --

20                 MS. UNDERWOOD:          Yes.

21                 JUSTICE SOUTER:           -- which -- which do have

22   references to visitorial powers as including general

23   conformance to the law.         Those are not universal

24   provisions, but they -- they were certainly understood

25   in some cases.

 1               MS. UNDERWOOD:             Well, the strongest

 2   quotations that his brief mentioned several times come

 3   from Blackstone.     He talks about inquiring into all

 4   misbehaviors of the supervised visited corporation.

 5   Those comments are made in a time and place when there

 6   was only one sovereign, not the distinctive federalism

 7   we have today, and so there was no need to distinguish

 8   between the visitorial, the distinctly visitorial powers

 9   of the sovereign, and the coexisting police powers of

10   another sovereign.      There was no --

11               JUSTICE SOUTER:              No, but there was -- there

12   was a point in -- in distinguishing the visitorial

13   powers that Blackstone, in the cases Blackstone was

14   referring to, and those for example that would apply

15   solely to -- to religious or originally religious

16   foundations like Oxford and Cambridge colleges and so

17   on.   So there -- there seems to have been a reason to

18   understand the distinction.

19               MS. UNDERWOOD:             Well, I think that the point

20   about Blackstone's comment to distinguish -- the point

21   about the distinction between the charitable

22   corporations and the public non-charitable corporations

23   is that it may well be that the sovereign was enforcing

24   not just the charter, but the laws of the sovereign with

25   respect to that State.         It simply --


                                         19
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               JUSTICE SOUTER:            But he didn't need

 2   visitorial powers to do that.             I mean, the sovereign had

 3   that by virtue of the general law.

 4               MS. UNDERWOOD:           Yes, but the sovereign might

 5   do it in many different -- a supervisor might do it in

 6   many different ways, just as OCC here claims to enforce

 7   law not by going into court --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:            I thought that was your

 9   position, that the -- that the visitation authority

10   includes the power to enforce general laws.

11               MS. UNDERWOOD:           The general laws of the

12   visitor, of the sovereign.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Of the sovereign.     But that

14   a separate action to enforce the laws of the sovereign

15   does not necessarily mean that visitorial powers are

16   being exercised.

17               MS. UNDERWOOD:           That is correct.      That is

18   correct.   That is --

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:            So there would be no

20   inconsistency, if you believe that.

21               JUSTICE STEVENS:            One thing --

22               MS. UNDERWOOD:           That's --

23               JUSTICE STEVENS:            One thing puzzled me about

24   this.   They are not pre-empting any New York laws; is

25   that correct?


                                       20

 1                MS. UNDERWOOD:            They're pre-empting --

 2   that's correct.     They are preempting our ability to

 3   enforce any laws.

 4                JUSTICE STEVENS:             Did we ever -- do we have

 5   any precedents dealing with the question whether

 6   preemption of the right to enforce a valid law is

 7   appropriate?

 8                MS. UNDERWOOD:            Well, this Court in, for

 9   example, St. Louis said that when the Federal and the

10   State prohibition were the same, that is, a bank

11   couldn't branch at that time or couldn't interstate

12   branch, the -- and the -- and State tried to enforce

13   both provisions -- they were the same, but the State

14   tried to enforce both the Federal charter limitation and

15   the State law, this Court said the State could not

16   enforce the Federal charter, because that was the

17   prerogative of the chartering visitor, but that it could

18   enforce the State prohibition.                And it said that

19   separating -- if the law is valid and can be validly

20   applied, then it's virtually unthinkable to separate the

21   authority to enforce it from the application of the law.

22                This Court said that in -- in St. Louis; it

23   -- actually it said it in -- in Easton, which went the

24   other way.   That is to say, Easton was a criminal

25   prosecution of a bank officer for taking deposits

 1   knowing the bank was insolvent.                 Prosecution under State

 2   law.   And this Court said that the law itself had to be

 3   preempted.     Wasn't clear exactly what Federal law on the

 4   subject was.     The Court said there must be some Federal

 5   law in this area, but we can't afford to have

 6   conflicting laws, so it's substantively pre-empted.                     But

 7   the Court also said, if it were valid, it would be

 8   unthinkable to bar the State from enforcing it.                   And

 9   that is the correct way, we think, to approach this

10   problem.

11                JUSTICE BREYER:             Is it -- could they --

12   could the Federal authorities pre-empt the State law, in

13   your opinion?

14                MS. UNDERWOOD:            Well, no, because Congress

15   has said to the contrary.            Congress has said, that's why

16   they didn't -- presumably why they didn't do it that

17   way.   Congress has said State law shall apply.                  So I

18   think this is an area where Congress clearly had in mind

19   that there would be, not broad pre-emption of this kind,

20   but the laws would apply.            But that it --

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, but -- I'm

22   sorry, but it certainly is pre-empted with respect to

23   visitorial powers.

24                MS. UNDERWOOD:            Yes.      That is correct.

 4   rebuttal, if I may.

 8             ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

 9                FOR THE RESPONDENT OFFICE OF

10               THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY

11              MR. STEWART:           Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

12   please the Court:

13              To explain the threat that the OCC believes

14   the State's enforcement regime poses to the national

15   banking system and OCC's administration of that system,

16   I would like to begin by going back to a colloquy

17   between Ms. Underwood and Justice Breyer near the

18   beginning of the argument.

19              And Justice Breyer raised the possibility

20   that a myriad of State attorneys general would file --

21   would pursue similar antidiscrimination claims, and Ms.

22   Underwood's response was there really would be no

23   problem because they are all applying the same

24   substantive standard.        And I think at a very high level

25   of generality that is so; that is, the Federal statute


                                        23

 1   and the State statute both say no discrimination on the

 2   basis of race in extensions of credit.                    But I think when

 3   you get to the way in which the statutes are

 4   administered, there is at least the potential for

 5   significant differences, because --

 6              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Well, wait a minute.        I --

 7   this is state law.      And if the State supreme court has

 8   said that the statute means a certain thing and that

 9   certain thing is a little bit different from what the

10   Federal antidiscrimination law is, I assume that the

11   Federal Government in applying State law has to -- has

12   to take that difference into account, doesn't it?

13              MR. STEWART:            We would --

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:               The Federal Government

15   doesn't -- doesn't have the right to alter State law.

16              MR. STEWART:            The Federal Government

17   wouldn't have the right to alter State law.                   The Federal

18   Government would have the authority to make its own

19   assessment of whether the State law was pre-empted based

20   upon those distinctions.

21              JUSTICE GINSBURG:                But I thought it is a

22   given in this case -- and tell me if I am wrong on this

23   -- that the State substantive law is not pre-empted.

24   You refer, I think, to enforcement pre-emption; that is,

25   the State law is governing law.                 But the only enforcer

 1   is Federal authority; and if that's so, is there any

 2   other -- in all of Federal-State relations, any other

 3   law where the State as sovereign can prescribe but

 4   cannot enforce?

 5              MR. STEWART:           I give two examples from the

 6   national banking system, itself.                The first is the

 7   Riegle-Neal amendments, which Justice Souter was

 8   alluding to.    And the amendments don't simply say that

 9   OCC shall enforce non-pre-empted State laws.                It says

10   that those laws shall be enforced by the Comptroller of

11   the Currency.

12              JUSTICE SOUTER:              But do you -- do you agree

13   that -- that it is possible to read the "shall" both as

14   -- as an unequivocal grant of power to OCC, but not

15   necessarily as an exclusive ground?

16              MR. STEWART:           I don't think so with the

17   "shall" in combination with the passive voice.               That is,

18   if you had a statute that said a certain category of

19   suits shall be adjudicated by the Court of Federal

20   Claims, I think that would mean not simply that the

21   Court of Federal Claims would be required to adjudicate

22   them if a case was brought before it, but I think that

23   would unmistakably identify the Court of Federal Claims

24   as the exclusive tribunal --

25              JUSTICE STEVENS:              Yes, but if you have a


                                        25

 1   situation in which the OCC, say, has very limited

 2   personnel -- they only have ten people in their

 3   enforcement division, for example -- and Congress

 4   thought they have to get more, wouldn't it be

 5   appropriate in that background to say, you shall start

 6   enforcing?   And that wouldn't necessarily mean you are

 7   excluding States from also enforcing.

 8                MR. STEWART:        I agree that if the statute

 9   simply -- if the statute used the active voice and said

10   the OCC shall enforce these laws, there would be a

11   better argument that the OCC's authority was not

12   exclusive.   But when the statute said -- says these laws

13   shall be enforced by the Comptroller of the Currency, I

14   think the clear implication is this is the exclusive

15   mechanism by which the laws --

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't see any difference

17   whatever in that regard between using the active and

18   passive.

19                MR. STEWART:        Well, let me give you another

20   example from the national banking system, and that is 12

21   U.S.C. 85.

22                JUSTICE SOUTER:           I want you to come back.       I

23   -- I won't stop -- I don't want to stop you from doing

24   that, but I want to come back to this.                  Do you -- do you

25   want to go on to your second example, or do you want to

 1   --

 2                MR. STEWART:          Let me just give you a second

 3   example very quickly.         12 U.S.C. section 85, which was

 4   an issue in Smiley, deals with the maximum rate of

 5   interest that national banks may charge, and it says

 6   that they may charge as much as the law of the State in

 7   which they are located allows and no more.                  And that is

 8   a similar system in that to determine the maximum rate

 9   of interest that the bank may charge, you look to State

10   law.    You defer to the choice of the State legislature,

11   but the enforcement regime with respect to

12   administrative enforcement is exclusively Federal.                    It's

13   only the Federal authorities that can go after --

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:              But that's because --

15   because it's picking a rate.              It's not saying there is

16   the Federal law and it has this rate, and the State law

17   that has that rate.       Here, the Equal Credit Opportunity

18   Act, a Federal Act, undoubtedly applies.                  And that is

19   proper Federal -- Federal law enforced by the Federal

20   authorities.

21                The State law, as this picture is drawn for

22   us, is applicable.      It's substantive law applicable to

23   these banks, but only the Federal authority can enforce

24   it.    That seems passing strange.               And do you have an

25   example outside the -- the two you gave us in the


                                         27

 1   National Bank Act where the State prescribes but the

 2   Federal authorities enforce?

 3                MR. STEWART:         Well, another example would be

 4   the Similar Crimes Act, which provides for the

 5   incorporation of State law with respect to --

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, that's not State law

 7   applying of its own force, just as your second example

 8   was not State law applying of its own force.                       It was

 9   State law that had been converted into Federal law by

10   the Federal Government's adoption of it.

11                MR. STEWART:         Those provisions --

12                JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's a different

13   situation.

14                MR. STEWART:         Those provisions do accomplish

15   incorporation of State law as Federal law.                       But this

16   Court has repeatedly said, most recently in Watters,

17   that State law applies to national banks only insofar as

18   Congress shall see fit to permit it.                     So --

19                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Is your concern that

20   -- not with the substantive State law, but that leaving

21   enforcement to the States would cause particular

22   problems?    I mean there may be a State law provision

23   that says you shall do this, and the way the attorney

24   general elects to enforce it is by shutting the bank

25   down, jailing the bank officers, doing all sorts of


                                        28

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   things that -- that the -- the Federal Government may

 2   not consider appropriate.

 3              MR. STEWART:         That is certainly true, that

 4   the -- the State's exercise of remedial discretion may

 5   be different from the Federal Government's.                  But even

 6   before that stage, if you look at the letters in the

 7   Joint Appendix that the New York Attorney General's

 8   Office sent to the national banks in question, basically

 9   the thrust of the letters was:             We have identified what

10   we believe to be troubling statistical disparities in

11   terms of the terms on which the credit was offered to

12   applicants of different races.             If those disparities are

13   not satisfactorily explained, that it -- you may be in

14   violation of State fair lending laws.                  Therefore, give

15   us a wide variety of information that would allow us to

16   determine whether you have a satisfactory explanation.

17              And I think it's clear that had this process

18   been allowed to run its course, what the New York

19   Attorney General's Office was going to do was assess the

20   bank's own criteria for making lending decisions to

21   decide whether those criteria were suitable and decide,

22   therefore, whether they provided a satisfactory

23   explanation for the statistical disparities that had

24   been observed.

25              And once the New York A.G. is in the


                                      29

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   business of passing upon the adequacy of the bank's

 2   lending criteria, he is right on the -- the OCC's --

 3                JUSTICE SCALIA:           You are arguing for

 4   conflict pre-emption.       I mean that's a -- that's a

 5   different issue than, say, that the -- the State law

 6   shouldn't apply.   But don't tell me the State law

 7   applies, but only the Federal Government is -- what

 8   incentive does the Federal Government have to enforce

 9   State law?

10                MR. STEWART:        Well --

11                JUSTICE SCALIA:           It -- it has so much spare

12   time after enforcing Federal law that it's -- it's going

13   to be worrying about State law?

14                MR. STEWART:        Well, the point that has been

15   made at various times in the argument that the State law

16   basically tracks Federal law, I think, is an answer to

17   that question; that is, whatever incentive the Federal

18   Government might have to enforce idiosyncratic features

19   of State law that didn't have a Federal analogue.            Here

20   the State law in question prohibits discriminatory

21   practices that are already prohibited by Federal law.

22   So whether OCC and HUD set out to enforce State law, if

23   they are vigorously enforcing Federal law, they will in

24   the course of doing that vindicate the State's

25   prerogatives.

 1               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Is there any -- is there

 2   any legislative history whatever to the effect that at

 3   the time 36(f)(1)(B) was adopted -- to the effect that

 4   its effect was to pre-empt State enforcement for --

 5               MR. STEWART:         They -- they don't say it in

 6   -- with quite that degree of clarity, but there is a

 7   colloquy quoted in the -- the brief for the Clearing

 8   House between -- I believe it's Senator D'Amato and --

 9               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Senator D'Amato and --

10               MR. STEWART:         And it is -- it is to the

11   effect that Senator D'Amato expresses the concern that

12   this may subject the -- the national banks in their

13   branch activities to State supervision.                 And the

14   response is that's not the case.               That will happen with

15   branches of State banks, but with respect to branches of

16   national banks the supervision will be by the OCC.

17               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yes, but the -- the problem

18   I have with that is, as a -- as a kind of clear

19   statement of -- of something which is -- is -- would be

20   extraordinary -- is that it talks in terms of

21   supervision.   It doesn't use the -- my recollection is

22   it doesn't use the magic word "enforcement."

23               And I would have thought that if in the

24   course of that colloquy the -- the statement had been

25   made:   The States will not have the authority to enforce


                                       31

 1   this, that there would have been rather a dust-up.                  And

 2   there wasn't.   It's kind of a "dog that didn't bark"

 3   argument.   And, therefore, if -- if there is uncertainty

 4   as to how to construe 36(f)(1)(B), I'm not sure that I

 5   -- I don't think the legislative history supports your

 6   exclusivity view.

 7               MR. STEWART:          Well, section 36(f)(1)(A)

 8   refers to a very limited category of State laws that

 9   include State fair lending laws and said these laws will

10   not be pre-empted unless they would be pre-empted with

11   respect to national banks generally.                     And then

12   36(f)(1)(B) says the laws in that preceding paragraph

13   shall be enforced by the comptroller of the Currency.

14   And so even if the colloquy used the term "supervision,"

15   the focus of the statutory language was -- was on a

16   pretty narrow category of laws.

17               I would like also to refer the Court to 12

18   U.S.C. 484(b), which I think is relevant here, and it is

19   on page 1a of the appendix to the government's brief.

20   And it is an express exception to the general rule

21   against the exercise of visitorial powers.

22               And it says, "Notwithstanding subsection (a)

23   of this section, lawfully authorized State auditors and

24   examiners may at reasonable times and upon reasonable

25   notice to a bank review its records solely to ensure


                                        32
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   compliance with applicable State unclaimed property or

 2   escheat laws."

 3               Now, the basic thrust of --

 4               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Does that mean -- when they

 5   say "review records," does that mean that the State

 6   auditors in effect can walk into the bank, as

 7   distinguished from what we have here, in which the bank

 8   is being requested to produce excerpts from records?

 9               MR. STEWART:         I think that would be the

10   implication of the provision, but the significant point

11   for our purposes is that it refers solely to ensure

12   compliance with applicable State unclaimed property

13   ordinances and laws.

14               JUSTICE STEVENS:            May I ask you this

15   question?   Naturally, if it's State laws, clearly they

16   can look at, but what if New York was trying to enforce

17   its discrimination laws in an employment context or in

18   context where they said you are charging minority

19   depositors -- giving them lower rates of interest than

20   you give Caucasian depositors?              Would they have -- would

21   the discrimination and the rates of interests paid on

22   deposits -- assume that was the question.               Would you

23   make the same argument, if that was what New York had

24   alleged?

25               MR. STEWART:         Yes, we would because that


                                       33

 1   would be going to the banks' federally authorized

 2   banking --

 3                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           All you would have to just

 4   look at the records.       You can tell from the records

 5   whether people of different classes are paying different

 6   -- are getting different rates on their deposits.

 7                 MR. STEWART:        I mean, it might be that in

 8   that instance the discrimination would be unlikely to

 9   persist, but the basic --

10                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           It would be unlikely to

11   persist.   Maybe it's an unlikely example.               But you are

12   suggesting that that would also interfere with the

13   Comptroller's ability to regulate the banks?

14                 MR. STEWART:        Yes, the way the regulation is

15   written, it speaks to State efforts to enforce laws that

16   are directed at the bank's federally authorized banking

17   activities.

18                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So do you think the same

19   answer whether -- Justice Stevens mentioned employment

20   discrimination.    The State has reason to believe the

21   bank is discriminating in its employment policies, and

22   it wants to examine certain employment records in that

23   connection.    Would you say also that, although New York

24   can prescribe its antidiscrimination in employment law,

25   it can't enforce it?


                                        34

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               MR. STEWART:         No, the regulation does sweep

 2   more categorically with respect to inspection of bank

 3   records.   New York would not be forbidden to file

 4   lawsuits to enforce its employment discrimination laws.

 5               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Does any of this bring us

 6   back to the colloquy you began -- began with -- between

 7   Justice Breyer and Ms. Underwood with reference to many

 8   States?

 9               MR. STEWART:         Yes, a certain --

10               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You -- you began on that,

11   and I never did hear --

12               MR. STEWART:         The part of the point I was

13   trying to make was, even if the substantive State law on

14   its face is not pre-empted because it is identical to

15   the Federal law, once we get to the enforcement stage

16   where the relevant enforcement agency is saying your

17   statistical disparity constitutes a violation because it

18   is not justified by sound banking practices, inevitably

19   that judgment is going to put the State regulator in the

20   business of doing what OCC does.               And if 50 different

21   State attorneys general have slightly different ideas of

22   what constitutes an adequate banking justification for

23   lending criteria that produces statistical disparity,

24   then the problem is multiplied.               Then --

25               JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's conflict


                                       35
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   pre-emption, and that goes to the -- to the law.                      You

 2   shouldn't have a separate State law that -- that

 3   provides a separate standard that conflicts with the

 4   Federal standard.    So you pre-empt the law.                    You don't

 5   say the law is in effect, but the State can't enforce

 6   it.   That's a weird way to solve that problem.

 7               MR. STEWART:          Well, the other point I would

 8   make about this is that it is accurate to say that under

 9   the Federal regime the State is entirely disabled from

10   enforcing its own fair lending law.                      As Ms. Underwood

11   alluded to in the opening part of the argument and as

12   the Petitioner's reply brief explains at pages 25 and

13   26, the Fair Housing Act does contain a mechanism by

14   which a State agency -- in the case of New York, it's

15   the Division of Human Resources --- can be certified by

16   HUD to enforce the State fair lending laws.

17               But that certification entails two different

18   steps:   First, HUD has to determine that the substantive

19   State law is -- I believe it's substantially equivalent

20   to the comparable Federal law.               And, second, HUD

21   monitors the performance of the enforcing agency, the

22   particular agency under State law that carries out that

23   responsibility, and HUD can thereby make sure that

24   enforcement as well as the substance of the law are

25   consistent with Federal law.

10   Watters, is, quote, "the State's investigative and

11   enforcement machinery," close quote.

12                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Mr. Waxman, your mention

13   of Watters, which has been mentioned in the briefs, I

14   think is an inaccurate description of what that opinion

15   held.   Watters dealt with a regime that was indisputably

16   visitorial.    It was a registration regime, where annual

17   fees were paid, annual reports were filed with the State

18   financial agency, and the State monitor could go into a

19   lending organization any time for any reason without any

20   suspicion of wrongdoing.          The only -- so everyone agreed

21   that was a visitorial regime.

22                 The sole question was whether the banks --

23   the national bank's operating subsidiary was to be

24   equated with a division of the national bank.                 That was

25   the only question provided the Court.

 1                MR. WAXMAN:       Oh, I -- I quite agree, and I

 2   did not mean to suggest that this Court's decision in

 3   Watters, you know, the holding in Watters concludes the

 4   outcome of this case.       But this Court, in section II A

 5   of Watters -- and we did have a State statutory regime

 6   that dealt, yes, with licensure but also with

 7   examination, supervision, and enforcement, including

 8   judicial enforcement -- this Court repeatedly described

 9   that what was pre-empted is -- and this goes to, I

10   think, a point that Justice Scalia was making -- was not

11   substantive pre-emption.         There are substantive

12   pre-emption provisions that are addressed in other

13   sections of the Act, including the one that was at issue

14   in Smiley.   What is exempted, this Court said again and

15   again, is the State's enforcement and investment and --

16   investigative and enforcement machinery, or its

17   examination and enforcement authority, and that those --

18                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            And that was in the

19   context of a State law that says, mortgage lending

20   institution, you may not lend unless you register and do

21   all the rest.   That was the context of Watters.                  And I

22   do not think that excerpts from that opinion should be

23   taken out of that context, which was:                   You can't be in

24   this business unless you register with us.

25                MR. WAXMAN:       The question in the case is

 1   whether or not what the Attorney General here sought to

 2   do is the exercise of a visitorial power.

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:            Can I -- can I take what

 4   Justice Ginsburg just said, and give you a thought that

 5   I am interested in your response to?

 6                I haven't seen the letter from the Attorney

 7   General.    Is the whole thing in the record?

 8                MR. WAXMAN:        There -- the letters are in the

 9   record in the Joint Appendix.

10                JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay.       Now, reading Judge

11   Parker's description of it, it seemed to me that what he

12   had said was that there are statistical disparities

13   between interest rates and race.                Well, as long as, most

14   unfortunately, income is correlated with race, with

15   minorities being towards the bottom, of course such

16   statistical disparities will exist, some legitimate,

17   some not.   So if the only basis for getting this

18   information is that allegation, it's hard to see how

19   this differs from the case that Justice Ginsburg put.

20                MR. WAXMAN:        Yes, that --

21                JUSTICE BREYER:            But it might be quite a

22   different case, if they had gone into court and found

23   individuals who were really getting different interest

24   rates and who really seemed very, very similar, but for

25   race.   But at that point, they'd have to go get this

 1   same information, because that's where they would find

 2   whether that prima facie case was right or wrong.

 3              MR. WAXMAN:           Yes.

 4              JUSTICE BREYER:               Do you see what I'm doing?

 5              MR. WAXMAN:           Right.

 6              JUSTICE BREYER:               I'm dividing the matter

 7   vertically, instead of, say, horizontally --

 8              MR. WAXMAN:           I'd like to --

 9              JUSTICE BREYER:               -- and I want to know if

10   that's possible.

11              MR. WAXMAN:           I'd like to address both the

12   vertical and horizontal axes of what I perceive to be

13   your question.     One is the distinction that this Court

14   drew in Guthrie, where it said there is a -- there's a

15   huge distinction in determining what's a visitorial

16   power between a private individual seeking to vindicate

17   a deprivation of his or her traditional property right,

18   which is what was at issue there, and what the Court --

19   what this Court said was the public right of visitation,

20   which it also explained was the State's, quote,

21   "enforcing observance of its laws and regulations."

22   There is a public and private distinction, and

23   visitation deals with the former.

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:               Sure, there is.

25              MR. WAXMAN:           It deals with the sovereign.

 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Would -- would you

 2   acknowledge, counsel, that there is a difference between

 3   enforcing State laws through visitation and enforcing

 4   State laws apart from visitation?               And what Waters

 5   involved was enforcing State laws through visitation.

 6   Of course, you can do that through -- through visitation

 7   powers, but you can also do apart from that by bringing

 8   a lawsuit or whatever.

 9               MR. WAXMAN:       Justice Breyer, I'll get to the

10   horizontal axis in a moment.           I'm afraid I'm going to

11   forget --

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:           I'm sorry, did I skip over

13   an axis here.

14               (Laughter.)

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:           I didn't mean to.

16               MR. WAXMAN:       Let me go -- let me go to your

17   axis first, which is to say that anything that is a

18   visitorial power can also be interpreted as a police or

19   enforcement power, and what Congress had in mind -- this

20   is legislation that was born in the crucible of the

21   Civil War, and what Congress sought to pre-empt was

22   State executive action, State examination and

23   enforcement action with respect to these newly created,

24   very important Federal instrumentalities.              That was

25   historically done, this Court explained in Guthrie, and


                                      41

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   Chancellor Kent and Blackstone and many other

 2   authorities agree was historically done through access

 3   to the courts; and in fact what Dean Pound in his

 4   oft-cited article about visitorial powers said, was --

 5   he said, and this is discussed at pages 16 through 18 of

 6   the amicus brief of the Financial Services Roundtable --

 7   what he called, quote, "the leading case for visitorial

 8   powers in equity" was a case called the Attorney General

 9   v Chicago and Northwest Railroad decided in 1874, in

10   which the Attorney General of Wisconsin was seeking to

11   require this railroad to comply with the State's

12   mandated rate schedule.         That was a visitorial power,

13   even though you could also call it a law enforcement

14   power.

15                Now, Justice Breyer, on the horizontality of

16   your question:    This is not a suit in which the New York

17   Attorney General is trying to enforce its employment

18   discrimination laws or its health laws or its zoning

19   laws.    The attorney general wants the loan records of

20   national banks, and he wants them so that he can

21   evaluate for himself whether the banks are making proper

22   judgments about how to market and how to price their

23   loans.

24                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Mr. Waxman, assume --

25   assume for a minute, this -- what if before writing the

 1   letter, the Attorney General of New York said, "We have

 2   conducted 500 interviews with people who have borrowed

 3   money from you, and on the basis of all these interviews

 4   we have drawn these tentative conclusions that there is

 5   discrimination.     We would like to give you an

 6   opportunity to explain all of this by showing us your

 7   records."     And they say no, we won't do it.             Would they

 8   then be pre-empted from bringing their lawsuit?

 9                 MR. WAXMAN:        Yes, they would.         And in fact

10   --

11                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Even though they didn't

12   have to look at any bank record to make their prima

13   facie case?

14                 MR. WAXMAN:        Well, their -- the OCC in the

15   preamble to its regulations does draw a distinction

16   between State enforcement actions and a pure State

17   declaratory judgment, quote, "as to the meaning of the

18   applicable law."    This is a case that -- in which --

19                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            I am asking about a

20   hypothetical.    I understand your argument here.               But I

21   just don't understand how your argument would apply to

22   my hypothetical.    But I think the regulation would apply

23   to the hypothetical.

24                 MR. WAXMAN:        Well, this is -- this case is

25   certainly in the core, but a -- a State authority,

 1   whether it's the State banking commission or the State

 2   human rights commission or the State attorney general,

 3   or for that matter another Federal Government authority,

 4   that seeks to call a national bank to account for the

 5   manner in which it is conducting an expressly

 6   designated, allocated banking power is an exercise of

 7   visitorial power.

 8               JUSTICE SOUTER:             Well, it isn't -- it isn't

 9   if --

10               JUSTICE STEVENS:             He doesn't even want to

11   look at your books; he just wants to prove it by people

12   who have been borrowing money and compare them with --

13   among them they can orally.

14               MR. WAXMAN:         I don't --

15               JUSTICE STEVENS:             I don't understand why

16   that would be visitorial power.

17               MR. WAXMAN:         The -- the State's enforcement

18   of any law that is directed at a national bank's

19   authorized banking powers is a visitorial power.             And

20   the fact that it may also be characterized as a police

21   power or a lawsuit is -- is interesting, but not what's

22   at stake.

23               What Congress aimed at -- Congress in 1864

24   knew -- the Supreme Court said, Blackstone and Kent had

25   said -- that visitorial powers on civil corporations are

 1   exercised A, by the sovereign, not by a private

 2   individual, and B, are almost always exercised through

 3   access to the courts.       Whether they are invoking the

 4   courts' authority to seek records or not, that was the

 5   historical core of what visitorial powers --

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So one could say, yes,

 7   the Federal authorities have visitorial powers, and they

 8   can go to court.   But we have here that the State can

 9   prescribe, not a supervisory regime, but -- fair

10   lending.   And the State wants to go into court and say

11   the bank is violating the State substantive law, which

12   is applicable.

13               MR. WAXMAN:        That's correct.          And a

14   sovereign taking a national bank into court with respect

15   to not any old general law, but with respect to the

16   conduct of its specifically authorized national banking

17   powers, is the exercise of visitorial powers.

18               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, is it --

19               MR. WAXMAN:        That was the reason for the

20   courts of justice exception.

21               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Is it the exercise of

22   visitorial powers, or is it an action which covers the

23   same subject that an exercise of visitorial powers would

24   do?   Let me -- let me propose a distinction, and I don't

25   know whether this is sound.            You know -- I mean, you


                                       45

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   tell me.

 2               I would suppose that if someone with

 3   visitorial powers dealing with discrimination in lending

 4   brought an action against the bank or tried to enforce

 5   it against the bank and couldn't do so in any other way

 6   then by going to court, it would go to court, and it

 7   would say court, tell this institution that I have some

 8   responsibility for, to obey the law.

 9               But I also assume that if the Attorney

10   General of New York, which is not a visitor, enforces

11   the law, it would go into court and say tell them to

12   obey the law and to pay damages or recompense of some

13   sort to these people whom they have wronged.

14               The subject matter of each suit is the same,

15   but the relief that is being requested and the judicial

16   power that is being exercised is different in these two

17   cases.   Is that a fair distinction?

18               MR. WAXMAN:        I don't think -- I think that

19   if I understood your question, and I may not have -- if

20   a suit by a private individual or a group of private

21   individuals seeking to indicate the deprivation of a

22   private traditional right is not visitorial; but if the

23   State, either directly in the enforcement of its general

24   laws or seeking to protect the people of its State, goes

25   into court or asks for records or anything else, it is


                                       46

 1   exercising a traditional visitorial power.

 2              May -- while I have your attention, may I

 3   also go back to your question about 36(f) and

 4   Riegle-Neal, because there is yet -- there are other

 5   additional indicators that when the Congress said in

 6   36(f) that these State laws shall be enforced by the

 7   OCC, it was mandatory and exclusive.

 8              First of all, the colloquy that was

 9   discussed and is reported in our brief, I think at page

10   26, does use the word "enforce" as well as "supervise,"

11   but more to the point --

12              JUSTICE SOUTER:               That is the one with

13   Senator D'Amato?

14              MR. WAXMAN:           Yes.       Riegle-Neal -- here's the

15   most important point.         That provision that we've been

16   were looking at had a cognate, had an analogue that was

17   also enforced.     Riegle-Neal basically said out-of-state

18   banks can now branch bank.             When they do so, they are

19   subject to these four categories of State laws.                 The

20   provision we have been looking, which was section 102,

21   said with respect to enforcement of those laws, the OCC

22   shall enforce it.     But section 105 said where the

23   out-of-state bank is a State-chartered bank -- and this

24   is reported, I think it's at section 1820(h) of title

25   12, when it's a State-chartered bank, the State


                                         47

 1   authorities of the host State shall enforce the laws.

 2              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Uh-huh.

 3              MR. WAXMAN:        So it enacted a dual regime

 4   that demonstrates exactly what Congress had in mind,

 5   which is that there would be one regulator making the

 6   kind of judgments about, okay, there is a disparity, but

 7   let's look at credit history, let's look at the loan to

 8   equity value, let's look at income versus debt incurred,

 9   and all these factors that the OCC and the Fed have

10   explained have to go into making a judgment about

11   whether or not a particular condition of a particular

12   loan violates Federal law, whether it the Fair Housing

13   Act or the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or the Fed's

14   regulation B.

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Waxman, you are

16   talking about lending.      And like depositing, those are

17   core banking activities, but today national banks have a

18   lot of incidental -- they have authority to do things

19   incidental to banking.      Does your restriction of State

20   enforcement extend to those matters incidental to

21   banking?

22              MR. WAXMAN:        May I answer?            I believe that

23   it would if those incidental authorities are in fact

24   authorized, approved and regulated by the OCC, but this

25   case doesn't require you to address it, because this is

 4            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD

 5                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 6                MS. UNDERWOOD:            A couple of -- four points

 7   or so.   To the extent the subpoena is perceived -- or

 8   this discovery request -- it didn't even proceed to this

 9   subpoena stage -- is perceived to be burdensome, State

10   laws allows a motion to quash a subpoena for inadequate

11   basis or for harassment.           So there is control in the

12   State courts over anything that is perceived to be

13   excessive.

14                Two, States have been enforcing consumer

15   protection and fair lending laws since the mid '70s when

16   they were enacted.      The Center for Responsive Lending

17   amicus brief has a discussion of that history of

18   enforcement.   The Conway affidavit at the Joint Appendix

19   at 152 has a description of New York's enforcement

20   activities between 1975 and 2004.                  And the Lawyers'

21   Committee for Civil Rights also goes over that history.

22                And they have been enforcing other laws

23   against national banks for even longer, antitrust laws,

24   branching laws, idiosyncratic laws of various sorts with

25   no evidence that this has impaired the functions of the

 1   banks.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Ms. Underwood, I -- I

 3   forgot the response you made in your brief.                  I know you

 4   did make some response to subsection (b) of section 484.

 5   How do you -- how do you explain that?

 6                MS. UNDERWOOD:           In the exceptions?

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Yes.      Why -- why do they

 8   list those exceptions, unless one would think that

 9   everything is covered?

10                MS. UNDERWOOD:           Virtually every exception

11   was enacted to resolve a controversy over whether

12   something was visitorial or not.                In fact, just as in

13   Guthrie, where this Court said the shareholders' suit

14   for bank records was not visitorial, or alternatively,

15   if it is, it is covered by the courts of justice

16   exception.    So too, each of those exceptions involved a

17   situation where there was a claim, an incorrect claim,

18   but a claim that the action would be banned as

19   visitorial, so Congress --

20                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Counsel, why isn't

21   it a complete answer to what I agree is a somewhat

22   unusual situation of pre-empting enforcement but not the

23   substance of law that its enforcement that raises the

24   concerns?    That the Federal Government thinks the State

25   law is fine, but when you get attorneys general

 1   enforcing it in a particular way, that's what causes the

 2   problem.     And I mean, the problem arises in a lot of

 3   areas.     Even within the Federal Government, the FBI and

 4   DEA have different ways of enforcing that might conflict

 5   with each other.     Why doesn't that make perfect sense?

 6                 MS. UNDERWOOD:           Well, even without

 7   enforcement of State law, OCC would not have exclusive

 8   control of enforcement of discrimination laws against

 9   national banks.     So the idea that State enforcement

10   poses some special problem to interfere with that

11   exclusive control is just a mistake.                      That's not the way

12   Congress set it up.

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So, why -- why is it

14   a mistake?    Why can't Congress or the OCC think that

15   that's where the difficulties are going to arise?                     In

16   other words, it's kind of a less intrusive approach, and

17   saying, well, you can have your State law but we are

18   concerned about enforcement, so we are going to be the

19   ones that enforce it.

20                 MS. UNDERWOOD:           I didn't mean it's a mistake

21   of policy.    I meant it's a mistake in description of the

22   regime Congress created.

23                 HUD has administrative enforcement.                    DOJ has

24   litigation enforcement.          This is a Federal law.              Private

25   parties can enforce Federal fair housing law.                     States


                                         51

 1   can probably enforce Federal fair housing laws, too, as

 2   -- patriotic for the victim.           The Second Circuit set

 3   aside that part of the injunction, the part that barred

 4   New York from enforcing Federal law.

 5              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 So your answer is

 6   because they have different entities that can enforce

 7   it, they are sort of in for a penny, in for a pound?                  If

 8   you let anybody else enforce it, you have got to let

 9   everybody else enforce it?

10              MS. UNDERWOOD:           No, I don't say that --

11              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Including the

12   entities that have historically have targeted national

13   banks?

14              MS. UNDERWOOD:           I don't make that argument.

15   What I say is that is strong evidence that Congress

16   didn't intend to give OCC exclusive control here.

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:            I suppose if -- if

18   enforcement pre-emption is the lesser step, we probably

19   ought to revise our jurisprudence so as not to tread any

20   more heavily than we have to upon the States so that

21   where there is conflict pre-emption, all we should say

22   is the State law is not invalidated, it is simply not

23   enforceable?

24              MS. UNDERWOOD:           Well --

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:            I mean that would --

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  No, I suppose the

 2   question would not be what we think is a good idea but

 3   what Congress has done.        And here the OCC has

 4   interpreted what Congress has done is to make exclusive

 5   the OCC regulation only with respect to enforcement.

 6              MS. UNDERWOOD:            Well --

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  I would suppose you

 8   would thank them for that rather than criticize them for

 9   it.

10              MS. UNDERWOOD:            I think that in many ways

11   leaving the law intact and denying the States the

12   ability to enforce it is more intrusive then simply

13   finding pre-emption.      In any event, Congress made it

14   quite clear that it didn't want pre-emption.

15              I think my time is up.

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you,

17   Ms. Underwood.   The case is submitted.

18              (Whereupon, at 12:18 p.m., the case in the

19   above-entitled matter was submitted.)
