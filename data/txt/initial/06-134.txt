 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in case 06-134, The Permanent Mission

 5   of India to the United Nations et al.                      vs. The City of

 6   New York.

 8               ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J.P. HOWLEY,

 9                    ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

10                MR. HOWLEY:        Mr. Chief Justice and may it

11   please the Court.

12                These are tax enforcement lawsuits.                     If

13   jurisdiction existed, the only issue a court would

14   decide is whether a tax is owed.                This type of case did

15   not fall within any real property exception to sovereign

16   immunity before Congress passed the Foreign Sovereign

17   Immunities Act and Section 1605(a)(4) of that act did

18   not create a new exception where none had otherwise

19   existed.    Congress chose --

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Of course you could say the

21   same thing if the mission here sold its property to

22   someone and someone was claiming the right to possess

23   the property by reason of the sale.                      And you could come

24   up and say this is simply, simply a case deciding the,

25   the ultimate issue of whether the sale occurred or not.

 1                 MR. HOWLEY:        Uh --

 2                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             But it would clearly come

 3   within the property right exception, wouldn't it?                     You

 4   -- you don't go one step back to look at the transaction

 5   that created the, the right in real property assuming

 6   the right in real property exists.

 7                 MR. HOWLEY:        Actually, Justice Scalia, I

 8   believe that if you had a dispute over what happened

 9   with the sale of property that it would fall within the

10   based upon commercial activities exception in

11   1605(a)(2).

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Let's assume that, let's

13   assume that exception didn't exist.

14                 MR. HOWLEY:        Okay.

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             And you had nothing but the

16   real estate exception.         You would come in and say this

17   ultimately relates to not who owns the real estate but

18   whether there was a proper contract or not.                     And I --

19   frankly we wouldn't accept that.

20                 MR. HOWLEY:        No.       And I think that's a very

21   different case from what we have here because in that

22   case the issue for the Court to decide is which of the

23   parties has the right, has the title in the real

24   property.     That is not in issue here.                  The City of New

25   York does not seek title in this property.                     Their action


                                          4

 1   is to declare the validity of a tax lien and the issue

 2   in an action to declare the validity of a tax lien is

 3   whether the tax is owed and whether it has been paid.

 4   That is the issue that's presented to the Court.

 5                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But what New York is

 6   seeking is an interest in land and a lien is an interest

 7   in the land.     It runs with the land, doesn't it?

 8                 MR. HOWLEY:        I -- I -- yes.           I acknowledge

 9   that there are some similarities between a lien and a

10   right in property.      For example, that it runs with the

11   land.     But there are dissimilarities that are far more

12   numerous and far more significant.                   Unlike rights and

13   property a lien does not give the lien holder any right

14   to own, access, possess, cross over, collect rents from,

15   exclude or any other right in the property.

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             Can't he force a sale of

17   the property to collect the lien?

18                 MR. HOWLEY:        This action does not.

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:             I understand that this

20   action does not because of the sovereign immunity.                   But

21   -- but we are talking about what the nature of a lien

22   is.     In an ordinary case cannot a lien holder force a

23   sale of the property so that he can get out the money

24   represented by his lien?

25                 MR. HOWLEY:        Yes.       If the lien holder


                                          5

 1   commences an action to foreclose on the property, then a

 2   consequence of that could be the sale of the property.

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, how can he commence

 4   an action to foreclose on the property unless he in any

 5   ordinary sense of the term has an interest in the

 6   property?

 7               MR. HOWLEY:        I do not dispute that a lien

 8   holder has an interest, a security interest in the

 9   property.   But Congress did not write in Section

10   1605(a)(4) all interests that are in issue in property.

11   Congress in fact had the European Convention in front of

12   it which said rights, interests and obligations in

13   property.   Congress chose language from the European

14   Convention elsewhere but did not choose that language

15   here.   Congress said only rights in property.

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:             You're distinguishing

17   between rights in property and interests in property?               I

18   would think that every right in property is an interest

19   in property and vice versa.

20               MR. HOWLEY:        No.       I do not believe so,

21   Justice Scalia.   There -- there -- there has to be a

22   reason why Congress chose language verbatim from the

23   European Convention in other sections of the statute

24   such as the counterclaim exception, but in this

25   exception said we are not taking interest and

 1   obligations from the European Convention, we are only

 2   saying rights.     And this Court --

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               The counterclaim sounds

 4   to me very much like it comes straight out of the

 5   Federal Rules, not out of any convention.                       It's the same

 6   transaction and occurrence, right?

 7               MR. HOWLEY:          Yes.       Yes.          The, the

 8   counterclaim exception --

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Well, that's exactly what

10   it says in the Federal Rules about compulsory --

11               MR. HOWLEY:          Yes, but Congress said, in the

12   House report Congress refers to the European Convention

13   as the source for the counterclaim exception in the

14   Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act so Congress said we are

15   taking this from the European Convention.                      This -- this

16   language also --

17               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Congress didn't really say

18   it.   I mean the committee said it to be precise.

19               MR. HOWLEY:          Yes, that's absolutely correct,

20   Justice.

21               JUSTICE SCALIA:               Good.

22               JUSTICE BREYER:               What was your distinction

23   between a mortgage and a tax lien?

24               MR. HOWLEY:          I don't think there is a

25   distinguished, a distinction between a mortgage and a


                                          7

 1   tax lien.

 2               JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, so think they can't

 3   enforce mortgage under this?             That is to say the bank

 4   can't; it's not an interest of property in mortgage?

 5               MR. HOWLEY:        No.       But Congress, Congress

 6   passed another exception here, 1605(a)(2) that said

 7   actions based upon commercial activity provide an

 8   exception to sovereign immunity and these exceptions

 9   have to be read together.          They have to be read --

10               JUSTICE BREYER:             That's, that's where it's

11   hard for me because a purchase money mortgage, you sell

12   the real estate.   Ordinary secured interest in mortgage

13   is secured interest by a lender is normally viewed as an

14   interest in property, I think.              I mean is there, is

15   there any law anywhere that says that isn't an interest

16   in property?

17               MR. HOWLEY:        Well, actually there is.           In

18   the, in -- when the United States waived immunity from

19   suit concerning real property it limited its waivers to

20   liens and mortgages and not rights in property.              And so

21   there has been distinctions made between mortgage liens

22   and liens on the one hand and rights in property on the

23   other.

24               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, on that point in

25   some jurisdictions and perhaps you can tell me about New

 1   York, I had thought and correct me if I'm wrong, that

 2   tax liens have a superior status to other liens in that

 3   they are an, an interest or an estate in the property as

 4   opposed to an attachment.

 5              Is it not true?             And I don't, and I'm not

 6   talking just about order of priority for creditors.                     I'm

 7   talking about the superiority insofar as being or not

 8   being an interest in property.

 9              MR. HOWLEY:        Well, yes.               It is superior to

10   other types of liens.

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Yes.

12              MR. HOWLEY:        It is an interest, a security

13   interest in the property, but it is not a right in the

14   estate of the property, and it doesn't give any type of

15   the possession and ownership rights that every other

16   right in property gives.

17              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Is there New York law to

18   that effect?

19              MR. HOWLEY:        Yes, there is.              And we have

20   cited it in our brief.      The Respondent has attempted to

21   distinguish it, because a Court of Claims jurisdictional

22   act was passed that deemed a lien an interest in

23   property for purposes of jurisdiction in the New York

24   Court of Claims but the essential nature of a lien is

25   not, under New York law, a right in the estate.

 1                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Because I had -- I had

 2   thought that it is an estate in land in at least some

 3   jurisdictions.    And Justice Breyer was asking about the

 4   same thing.    In other words, there are liens -- there

 5   are liens and liens.       There are different kinds of

 6   liens.

 7                 MR. HOWLEY:       There appears to be in

 8   different jurisdictions, different treatments of liens.

 9                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, that brings up

10   the basic question I have, is this a question of State

11   law or Federal law?

12                 MR. HOWLEY:       This is a question of Federal

13   law.   This Court has held --

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So even if you have

15   different rules in different States, there is going to

16   be one rule under Federal law under 1605(a)(4)?

17                 MR. HOWLEY:       Yes, that is correct, Mr. Chief

18   Justice.   And this Court held in Saudi Arabia against

19   Nelson and Argentina against Weltover that the exception

20   language -- they are dealing with the commercial

21   activities exception -- must have the meaning that

22   Congress understood the restrictive theory of sovereign

23   immunity to require at the time it passed the statute.

24                 And so when defining what a right in

25   immovable property in issue means, we have to give that


                                        10

 1   the meaning that the restrictive theory of sovereign

 2   immunity required at the time in 1976.                   And in 1976, no

 3   court here in the United States or anywhere in the world

 4   had held that sovereign immunity was abrogated merely by

 5   having a statutory lien on the property.

 6                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Had the State Department

 7   taken a position at that point, at the time the Act was

 8   passed?

 9                MR. HOWLEY:        There is -- not to my

10   knowledge.    There is vague language in the testimony in

11   the House report, general language about 1605(a)(4)

12   relating to real property disputes, but there is not

13   precise language about whether liens are or liens are

14   not --

15                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             There was nothing vague

16   about the State Department's brief in the Englewood

17   case.

18                MR. HOWLEY:        No, there is not, Justice

19   Ginsburg.    But they lost in Englewood.                 They lost and

20   the Englewood Court relied on a D.C. Circuit decision.

21   And I believe that the Solicitor General will say that

22   they have reconsidered their position, they have

23   reconsidered Article 29 of the European Convention,

24   which they relied on heavily in the Englewood brief.

25                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But anyway, at a time


                                        11

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   closer to the passage of the Act, the State Department

 2   was taking the position that a lien was an interest in

 3   land.

 4               MR. HOWLEY:        Yes, that is correct.           But they

 5   have since decided that that position was wrong.

 6               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, they just may

 7   be more sympathetic to India and Mongolia than they were

 8   to Libya.

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:            That's not beyond the realm

10   of the conceivable, is it?

11               MR. HOWLEY:        It's not beyond the realm of

12   the conceivable.

13               JUSTICE BREYER:            But I take it there has

14   never been a case in the history of the world you'll

15   tell me where a lender or bank or anybody who loaned

16   money to build an embassy has ever brought a case

17   against the owner of the embassy, the sovereign, and won

18   under anything like this exception, because they can't

19   sue them.

20               MR. HOWLEY:        Not that we're aware of, and

21   not that we've seen --

22               JUSTICE BREYER:            Ever.       And there is none

23   the other way, where they said you couldn't sue them.

24               MR. HOWLEY:        Yes.

25               JUSTICE BREYER:            Okay.       So why do people

 1   lend money to build embassies?

 2                MR. HOWLEY:       Well, because once you lend

 3   money and you engage in commercial activity, if the

 4   claim is based upon the commercial activity, Congress

 5   had provided a separate section, 1605(a)(2) that

 6   protects the American citizen who has lent money to an

 7   embassy.

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:           And how did it work before

 9   1605 was passed, how did they used to build, in the 19th

10   century, embassies, if you know.

11                MR. HOWLEY:       I don't know about 19th century

12   embassies.   I do know that since the Tate letter, which

13   predates the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, there has

14   been a commercial activity exception here in the United

15   States.

16                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Why isn't buying land that

17   you're not using for your embassy itself, or for the

18   residence of the ambassador, but buying and occupying

19   that land which subjects yourself to real estate taxes

20   on that land, why isn't that a commercial activity?

21                MR. HOWLEY:       Well, this Court held in Saudi

22   Arabia against Nelson that it's not just engaged in,

23   related to commercial activity, but the cause of action,

24   the claim has to be based upon commercial activity.

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:           So the Indian embassy could

 1   own real estate throughout New York City, which it

 2   wouldn't have to pay taxes on?               Or if it didn't, nothing

 3   could be done about it?

 4               MR. HOWLEY:         It depends on the use they put

 5   that property to.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Why?      No.    You're saying,

 7   you're saying it's not a commercial activity.                    I mean --

 8               MR. HOWLEY:         The mere ownership of the land

 9   is not --

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:             It depends upon the use,

11   and the use in this case is not -- is not the embassy

12   itself or the residence of the ambassador.                  I mean, they

13   could use a piece of property for anything.

14               MR. HOWLEY:         As long as it's not commercial

15   activity, it would not be taxed and --

16               JUSTICE SCALIA:             But the buying and

17   occupying of it is commercial activity.

18               MR. HOWLEY:         Well, the buying of it, if the

19   claim is based upon the buying of the property, under

20   Saudi Arabia against Nelson, then the commercial

21   activities exception would apply.                 But the mere

22   ownership of the property is not commercial activity.

23               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Why isn't it commercial

24   activity for New York to say, we provide garbage

25   services, electric services, et cetera.

 1                 MR. HOWLEY:        Well, separate and apart from

 2   the jurisdictional issue, the Vienna Conventions do say

 3   that if there are fees for services provided, such as

 4   garbage collection, water, those types of services, then

 5   there is no immunity from the fees for those services.

 6   And those fees should be paid.                The separate issue of

 7   whether that's commercial activity, it may be.                It

 8   doesn't matter whether the city provides a service such

 9   as water, or a private entity provides a service such as

10   water.    That may be commercial activity.

11                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But they pay fees and New

12   York taxes.     Suppose New York doesn't have fees.

13   Suppose they say, we'll just do this out of our property

14   tax.

15                 MR. HOWLEY:        Well, no, that does not -- on

16   the substantive issue of whether it's immune under the

17   Foreign -- under the Vienna Conventions, a tax is

18   immune.    They are immune from a tax, but they're not

19   immune for a fee for service.               That is how the Vienna

20   Conventions --

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And in reality, you will

22   never get there, because the Vienna Convention deals

23   with the substantive liability -- you're talking about

24   jurisdiction.     On your theory, you would never get to

25   the fee for picking up the garbage, because you wouldn't

 1   have any jurisdiction.

 2                 MR. HOWLEY:        No, Justice Ginsburg, not at

 3   all.     That's not my position.            Let me make my position

 4   clear.     If there is a fee for service provided, such as

 5   garbage collection, or provision of water, that would

 6   fall under the commercial activities exception.                       But if

 7   there is a tax, unless the activity at issue and the

 8   cause of action at issue is based upon the commercial

 9   activity, there is no jurisdiction.                       This does not mean

10   --

11                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             The commercial activity,

12   it's applied to that same building that you say can't

13   be -- it can't be any suit for taxes.

14                 MR. HOWLEY:        Yes.       There cannot be a suit

15   for taxes.    There could be a suit for specific fees for

16   services rendered.      But --

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Even -- even if this, the

18   building were only the mission and the representative,

19   the minister to the U.N., even then --

20                 MR. HOWLEY:        Yes.

21                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             -- the water of a

22   municipal service, garbage collection, could be charged.

23                 MR. BAKER:       Yes, Justice Ginsburg, just as

24   if the Indian mission went out to a private water

25   company and said, please supply me with water, the

 1   private water company could sue, based on commercial

 2   activity, to collect for the water it had provided.                It

 3   doesn't matter if it's the city.

 4               JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Well, it's the city.   Not

 5   a private company, the city itself.

 6               MR. HOWLEY:          The nature of the activity

 7   doesn't change just because it's the city providing the

 8   water as opposed to a private entity providing the

 9   water.   We have to look at the nature of the activity.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Of course, this isn't a

11   suit for the taxes.       I mean, we are not talking about a

12   suit for the taxes.

13               MR. HOWLEY:          We are here --

14               JUSTICE SCALIA:              We are talking about a

15   declaration as to the interest in the land.

16               MR. HOWLEY:          No.      No, Justice Scalia.

17   Absolutely not.   Joint Appendix page 78 is the city's

18   amended complaint.      And even in their foreclosure claim,

19   even in their foreclosure claim, what they ask is for a

20   judgment of foreclosure directing that the Defendant pay

21   the amount of taxes, interest and other charges due.

22   They are not asking for an interest in the property.

23               All this case is about is money.               It's not

24   about rights in the property.               And there is a very big

25   problem with allowing a claim for money to become a

 1   right in property merely by having a local law passed

 2   that converts the claim into a lien.                     The City of New

 3   York tomorrow could pass a law that said, if you don't

 4   pay your parking tickets, that is automatically

 5   converted into a lien on the property.                     And then while

 6   we can't sue you for the parking tickets, we have

 7   created a right in your property.

 8                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            You could easily say

 9   there has to be a relationship to the property itself.

10                 MR. HOWLEY:       Well, that's not -- that's not

11   what the City's position is.             The City's position is a

12   lien is an interest in property and falls within the

13   statute.   And Congress didn't write in the statute

14   arising out of, related to.             It said, rights in the

15   property are an issue.        So if under the City's theory,

16   if they passed a lien law tomorrow converting all

17   parking tickets into liens on property, then their

18   position is they could sue us for parking tickets.                    And

19   if there are no further questions, I will reserve the

20   rest of my time.

 1          AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS

 2              MR. SRINIVASAN:            Thank you, Mr. Chief

 3   Justice, and may it please the Court:

 4              An action to determine whether property

 5   taxes are owed is not a case in which rights of

 6   immovable property are an issue, and it's not

 7   transformed into such a case by attaching a lien, and

 8   recharacterizing the case as one to determine the

 9   validity of the lien.

10              And I'd like to begin by picking up, Justice

11   Ginsburg, on the question you just asked, because I

12   think it's very important to emphasize that under

13   Respondent's lien-based theory, that theory has the

14   potential largely to eviscerate the other exceptions in

15   the FSIA in the following sense:              Respondent's theory

16   doesn't turn in any way on the nature or source of the

17   debt that's secured by the lien.

18              So under Respondent's view, the fact that

19   this case involves a debt that arises out of property

20   taxes is largely beside the point.                The load bearing

21   weight of that theory rests entirely on the supposed

22   effects of the lien on the property.                   And so for

23   example, you could have a case in which a commercial

24   activity is brought into play, where the plaintiff sues

25   a foreign sovereign for commercial activity that occurs

 1   --

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:              That's always brought up to

 3   answer the problem, well, you know -- let me give you a

 4   case in which it obviously is not a commercial activity,

 5   but it seems to me that the -- that the lien interest

 6   has to be honored.      Let's suppose that there is an

 7   American who is very friendly to and sympathetic with

 8   the Indian government, and gives them real estate, not a

 9   commercial activity, he gives them real estate in which

10   to house the employees in -- in their mission.

11               However, he retains an interest in that real

12   estate.   He retains a lien on the real estate, to have

13   money paid to him at some point.                 He is not willing to

14   give the full amount of the property, but most of it.

15   And he retains a lien.         Now, under your theory, that

16   lien would not be enforceable, is that right?

17               MR. SRINIVASAN:              Well, the lien wouldn't

18   constitute a right in the property, and that's

19   consistent with what -- the way this Court has always

20   described liens.   As we point out in pages 21 and 22 of

21   our brief, the Court has said --

22               JUSTICE SCALIA:              Enforceable or not.

23               MR. SRINIVASAN:              The lien would not be

24   enforceable against a foreign sovereign, because -- at

25   least with respect to the immovable property.

 1                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            That seems very strange to

 2   me.

 3                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            We are only talking about

 4   the immovable property exception.                  And with respect to

 5   that exception, this Court has expounded that a lien on

 6   land constitutes no property or right in the land

 7   itself.     And it said that on more than one occasion.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I thought that the

 9   Department submitted a good brief on this issue, but in

10   1985.   What do you do with all the arguments -- I'm

11   looking at page 12 of your brief in the Englewood case,

12   which you argued that these liens were interests in

13   property.    Are those arguments no longer valid?

14                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, we, of course,

15   reviewed our position in that case, and we have come to

16   the conclusion that it was incorrect.                     And in the

17   Englewood case, that argument was the third argument in

18   the brief.    The first two arguments in the brief were

19   more along the lines of the Court of Appeals decision.

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Well, what about the

21   argument that it was an interest in property.                     The brief

22   was very clear that it is an interest in property, and

23   that a tax lien is almost sui generis, in that it is an

24   estate in the property.

25                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            I don't --

 1               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It survives bona fide --

 2   it survives bona fide purchaser without notice?

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 The other reasons

 4   you gave, the holder of a lien can bring an action to

 5   enjoin waste, holders of liens are entitled to

 6   compensation if eminent domain is exercised.                 All of

 7   those reasons are still as valid as they were in 1985.

 8               MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, let me try to take up

 9   some of those in order.        First with respect to the

10   question of whether holders of a lien are entitled to

11   compensation in eminent domain, we don't take issue with

12   the proposition that a lien is property.                A lien is

13   property, but the question under the statute is whether

14   a lien confers a right in the underlying immovable

15   property.   And so in an eminent domain proceeding it may

16   just be that just compensation is owed to a lien holder

17   because to the extent that the eminent domain proceeding

18   takes that lien there's compensation owed for that

19   property.   But that doesn't --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:            What property is it a right

21   in if not the immovable property?

22               MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, it's --

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:            And it follows that

24   immovable property and when the immovable property

25   disappears the lien disappears.              You know, if it's blown


                                       22

 1   away or flooded, it's now in the Atlantic; the lien is

 2   gone.

 3              MR. SRINIVASAN:               Well, I think --

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA                 :    But otherwise wherever

 5   the property goes the lien follows it.                      How can you say

 6   that that's not an interest in the property?

 7              MR. SRINIVASAN:               Well, I don't think it's a

 8   right in property, Justice Scalia.                   The lien is a

 9   species of property, of intangible personal property, in

10   the same sense that a cause of action would be, because

11   after all what a lien is is essentially at bottom a

12   claim.

13              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Well, how can the,

14   how can the lien holder then bring an action to enjoin

15   waste of the immovable property?

16              MR. SRINIVASAN:               Well, a lien holder can

17   bring an action to enjoin waste, but it's important to

18   understand what interest the lien holder is protecting

19   in that situation.      An action for waste by a lien holder

20   is to protect the security interest.                      It's different

21   from an action for waste by someone who holds a right in

22   the property.   And New York law appears to recognize

23   this because New York I think has two species of waste

24   actions, one brought by a security interest holder and

25   one brought by the holder of property rights.                      There's a

 1   case, Travelers Insurance, in which the Second Circuit

 2   reviewed New York law in this matter -- it's at 14 F.3d

 3   114 -- and describes how there's two species of waste

 4   actions depending on which sort of plaintiff you have in

 5   issue.   And that recognizes that the interest, if you

 6   will, that a lien holder has in the property, is

 7   different from a right in the property.

 8                 JUSTICE BREYER:            What about paragraph 3 just

 9   after paragraph 2 in the complaint?                       Paragraph 3 asks

10   the court to bar and forever foreclose the defendants

11   from all right, interest, claim, etcetera in the parcel.

12   Well, what about that?         What they're asking, I just

13   heard it.     So what's the answer to that?                   They seem to

14   be saying, we have the right to the parcel, you the

15   defendant have no right to the parcel.

16                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, I don't -- you'd have

17   to ask Respondent's counsel exactly what they mean by

18   that.

19                 JUSTICE BREYER:            Well, I did in part, so he

20   can answer.

21                 MR. SRINIVASAN:            Because Respondents have

22   repeatedly indicated in this case and in the court of

23   appeals and in this Court that they can't foreclose on

24   the property and so they've abandoned any claim for

25   foreclosure.     And a foreclosure action wouldn't result

 1   in the property being deeded to Respondent.              It would be

 2   put up for sale and a third party would purchase it.              So

 3   I'm not -- I can't tell you exactly what that paragraph

 4   means.

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             In a very practical way,

 6   you're expressing that right means ownership means

 7   ownership.    But the title is certainly impaired by this

 8   lien.    India could not turn around and sell it to anyone

 9   without doing something to discharge the, lien right?

10                MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well --

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             So the title is certainly

12   clouded by this lien.

13                MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, I think liens

14   generally constitute clouds on title, but the fact that

15   something's a cloud on title doesn't make it a right in

16   the property.   And I could give you one other example.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:            It doesn't have to be a

18   right in the property.        If you look at it from the

19   owner's point of view, it is a cloud on the owner's

20   title in the property.        It affects the owner's title.

21   Even if you assert that it doesn't give any title to the

22   lien holder, it impairs the title of the property owner.

23   And that's all that's required, as I read the title, in

24   which rights in immovable property are an issue, and

25   here the question is whether the, the mission's right to


                                        25

 1   the property is, is impaired by this lien.

 2              MR. SRINIVASAN:            I think our arguments apply

 3   equally both to the lien holder and to the property

 4   owner, Justice Scalia, in the following sense, that with

 5   respect to both of them a lien -- the lien doesn't

 6   affect rights of possession, it doesn't affect the right

 7   to exclude others, which this Court has characterized as

 8   the most fundamental of property rights.               It doesn't

 9   affect the right to receive income from the property.

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:            It affects the right to

11   convey the property free and clear, which is an enormous

12   right that goes along with the real estate.

13              MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, it has a practical

14   consequence on conveyance because it, as Justice

15   Ginsburg said, amounts to a cloud on title.              But there

16   are other instruments that result in a cloud on title

17   but that wouldn't be considered rights in property.                 One

18   example would be a contract, a purchase option contract

19   to purchase property.     The holder of a purchase option

20   wouldn't be considered to have a right in the property

21   unless and until the option was exercised.              At least

22   that's the general rule, even though the purchase

23   contract in a sense constitutes a cloud on the title in

24   the same way that a lien might constitute a lien on the

25   title.

 1               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How long did the United

 2   States take the opposite position and when did it

 3   change?

 4               MR. SRINIVASAN:            I'm sorry?

 5               JUSTICE GINSBURG:             How long did the United

 6   States adhere to the position that's reflect in the

 7   Englewood brief and when did it change?

 8               MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, I'm not aware that we

 9   took the position before the Englewood brief, so I think

10   that would be 1985.     And I don't think we've had

11   occasion to revisit that position until this case.

12               And let me point out with respect to the

13   Englewood brief, the first two points made in that brief

14   were along the lines of the court of appeals reasoning

15   in this case, which was to the effect that a statute

16   that refers to a right in immovable property encompasses

17   obligations arising out of immovable property.            And

18   Respondent doesn't attempt to defend that position, but

19   that's the predicate on which our Englewood brief

20   rested.   And so we think there's good cause for us to

21   revisit our position from that case.

22               Now, with respect to the question of whether

23   a lien establishes rights in property, which is now the

24   focus of Respondent's argument, I would point out that

25   in other areas of the law the Court has looked to


                                       27
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   questions concerning whether there is a right to exclude

 2   others, whether there is a right to obtain income from

 3   the property, whether there is a right to assert

 4   possession of the property.           That's, for example, the

 5   types of considerations this Court takes into account in

 6   the tax area in assessing whether a Federal tax lien can

 7   attach to a property by virtue of the fact that there is

 8   a right to property at stake.            And we think the same

 9   sorts of consideration should inform the Court's

10   assessment of the immovable property exception in this

11   case.

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:            What about an easement?

13   That doesn't involve any of those things.                You can't

14   exclude people and so forth.

15              MR. SRINIVASAN:            Well, an easement I think

16   would qualify as a right in property because at least

17   your standard easement would provide a right of access

18   to the property by a thoroughfare.                And so both sides

19   would be affected in their use of the property in that

20   sense.

21              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, Counsel.

 1   please the Court:

 2                 There are three reasons this case puts in

 3   issue rights in immovable property:                       First, the plain

 4   language of the statute; second, the statute's purpose

 5   and legislative history; and third, international

 6   practice as it existed in 1976.

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Cardozo, before you go

 8   any further, I had been under the impression from your

 9   brief that you're not trying to enforce anything

10   against, against India or against the mission.                      You just

11   said you wanted a declaratory judgment that the lien is

12   a valid lien.     But, but here it is in your complaint

13   you're asking for foreclosure.                Which, which is it?

14                 MR. CARDOZO:         Justice Scalia, we know that

15   Section 1610 would preclude us from actually

16   foreclosing.     We're not allowed to do that.                   There's no

17   question about that.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            You just asked for it to

19   scare them?     Was that it?

20                 MR. CARDOZO:         No.      We do want, as the

21   discussion preceding me highlighted, we do want to get

22   in and take what we think is, as a practical matter, is

23   our property.     But we can't.           We understand that.          So

24   what we're, what we're saying in our complaint in

25   paragraph 3, as Justice Breyer pointed out, is we would


                                         29
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   like to bar them from holding title.                      But as we quickly

 2   conceded as soon as we filed the action, we can't

 3   foreclose because of the provisions of Section 1610.

 4   But it doesn't mean that the fact that we can't

 5   foreclose doesn't mean that we don't have a right in

 6   property.    Let me give you a very good illustration.                    If

 7   there is a possessory dispute, someone, an embassy,

 8   rented premises and agreed that if they didn't pay the

 9   rent they would lose their ability to continue to occupy

10   the premises and they failed to pay rent, that's a title

11   dispute.    The person who rented the property would bring

12   a suit saying:    I have a right to get back into my

13   property and there is clearly a right in property in

14   Section 1605.     I can't believe that Congress said, that

15   Congress intended to say, well, you can bring an action

16   for nonpayment of rent and seek possession except for

17   1610, that's okay.      There's jurisdiction in an action

18   for rent, but if you want possession of property because

19   you haven't paid your taxes, and of course you still

20   can't foreclose, there's no jurisdiction.                     That doesn't

21   make any sense.

22                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, but they'll say as

23   was their response to a lot of hypotheticals, the

24   commercial act exception covers that.

25                MR. CARDOZO:          Your Honor, it may or may not

 1   cover the commercial act exception.                       And going back to a

 2   question that Justice Breyer asked, there are, there are

 3   cases, not in the United States, but -- and we're citing

 4   some of them in footnote 24 in the red brief -- that

 5   when someone, not the commercial property exception,

 6   someone lent money to, to build an embassy and they

 7   defaulted on the mortgage, the German court said

 8   jurisdiction.   It's not a question of enforcement, but

 9   jurisdiction.

10               The reason for this is if you first look at

11   the language of the statute, the language of the statute

12   doesn't say only certain kinds of rights.                      It says all

13   rights in property if they're in issue.

14               We believe that we have a right in the

15   Indian and Mongolia premises.               We --

16               JUSTICE BREYER:              The problem that actually

17   is bothering me with your side of the case which I find

18   difficult is, suppose I accept this principle that you

19   have.   All right, it seems to me anything at all can be

20   reduced to a lien, any judgment, at least certainly slip

21   and fall cases and you didn't keep the ice up in front

22   and I want $4 million damages plus 300 million in

23   punitives and where it is I have a lien against the

24   embassy here.   And I can't think of a distinction once I

25   go down your road.      I mean, he at least has an absolute


                                         31

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   distinction which I can see, but once I go down your

 2   road where is the stopping place?                What's the principle?

 3               MR. ROBERTS:         Let me try, Justice Breyer.

 4   First of all, if there was a judgment on that

 5   hypothetical tort action that you just mentioned, if

 6   there were a judgment you wouldn't have gotten the

 7   judgment in the first place unless you had originally

 8   come within --

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:            I'm imagining a city or

10   Belarus or someplace where what they do is they say slip

11   and fall on ice -- you know, you get a lien against the

12   property prior to -- okay.          I mean, it's easy to imagine

13   that kind of thing.

14               MR. ROBERTS:         Yes.

15               JUSTICE BREYER:            And in a range of subject

16   matters.   So I'm looking to what the stopping place is

17   once I start down your road.

18               MR. ROBERTS:         And the stopping place I think

19   is a Federalism concept and a due process concept,

20   because as this Court has held in a number of cases,

21   there's a real due process question if liens are created

22   with no concern about the effect on the defendant.               You

23   have to take a look at the interest of the so-called

24   plaintiff and you have to find whether there is a

25   relationship between the lien and the underlying claim.

 1   Now --

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Why didn't you just say --

 3   you know, if you're worried about the malevolence of

 4   countries to make all sorts of stuff liens, I guess if

 5   they're malevolent enough they can make all sorts of

 6   stuff easements, which, which the other side says is

 7   undoubtedly a property interest.              So they could say

 8   that, you know, if you're held liable the court can give

 9   you an easement over the property of, of the defendant

10   worth so much money.     And that would undoubtedly be

11   enforceable.

12              MR. CARDOZO:         Justice Scalia, they did say

13   that and certainly if an easement is a right in

14   property, either because of the hypothetical you just

15   gave or a traditional easement, there is nothing

16   different with a tax lien.         In fact, a tax lien is a

17   much greater interest.

18              JUSTICE BREYER:            I still have my question

19   because I'm not world about malevolence, is that I don't

20   carry around in my head all of the possible things that

21   might be liens against property.              And so maybe my

22   imagination is wrong, but I want to know are you are

23   arguing that every lien against the property is in fact

24   a right in property which allows a lawsuit, or are you

25   arguing that there is some distinction between some and


                                      33
                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the other.   And I noticed that the Restatements and

 2   others are trying to distinguish between whether the

 3   lien in question grows out of the property or it doesn't

 4   grow out of the property, which I find possibly hard to

 5   work with and so I want to know how you see it.

 6                MR. CARDOZO:        And what I see, Justice

 7   Breyer, is when you take a look at the cases in this

 8   Court such as Connecticut against Doehr and the other

 9   cases which put limits, the constitutional limits on

10   liens, of course if a State passed a statute that runs

11   afoul of the various due process concerns that this

12   Court has articulated that is certainly one check that

13   we have.

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Well, let's take the

15   parking ticket that your colleague raised, that New York

16   would make a parking ticket a lien, unpaid parking

17   ticket a lien on all, all property.

18                MR. CARDOZO:        Justice Ginsburg, I think that

19   would be a hard question, but if it does not run afoul

20   of the constitutional concerns that I just articulated

21   and it was a lien applicable not just of course to

22   foreign sovereigns, but to any unpaid parking ticket --

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Yes, yes.

24                MR. CARDOZO:        -- I think that then that

25   would come within the immovable property exception.

 1                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            So the only thing they

 2   would have to do I suppose -- you've mentioned the due

 3   process point -- would be to perhaps give a hearing

 4   before the lien was declared and that would be enough?

 5                 MR. CARDOZO:         I think, I think it certainly

 6   would, Justice Souter, if in fact there was a hearing.

 7                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Well, provided that,

 8   provided notice of hearing was offered, the parking

 9   ticket lien would be in the same position as this lien,

10   right -- the hearing.

11                 MR. CARDOZO:         I think that's right.     I think

12   that's right.     And so --

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            And under New York law

14   does property, do property tax liens have some superior

15   status?     Are they distinct under New York law from other

16   liens?

17                 MR. CARDOZO:         Well, they're -- as tax liens

18   you may get into a priority fight in a bankruptcy

19   context.

20                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Without reference to

21   priority.

22                 MR. CARDOZO:         I don't believe that they

23   would have any different lien, any different status,

24   although my colleague corrects me and says that yes, tax

25   liens -- tax liens do have in certain circumstances a

 1   greater priority.    It's hard to think through exactly

 2   where that issue would be.

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I -- I had thought they

 4   had a greater priority and that they even survived

 5   purchase from bona fide sellers.

 6               MR. CARDOZO:          That certainly, that is

 7   certainly true and a property -- excuse me for

 8   interrupting -- a tax lien would run forever with no

 9   time limit, for example, whereas a mechanics lien has a

10   statutory time on it.       If you got into a dispute about

11   those two liens obviously the tax lien would have --

12   would have priority.

13               JUSTICE STEVENS:             May I ask -- may I ask

14   this question?   Suppose another jurisdiction had a tax

15   system which was just a little different from New York's

16   and didn't provide for a lien until after a suit had

17   been brought and there had been a failure to pay or had

18   to get a judgment first.          On that case, that

19   jurisdiction could not enforce this tax law?

20               MR. CARDOZO:          That is correct, Justice

21   Stevens.

22               JUSTICE STEVENS:             And don't you think it's

23   sort of a strange way to define a tax immunity, by --

24   by, by describing the -- the interest in immovable

25   property?

 1               MR. CARDOZO:          Well, we start off with the

 2   statutory language and the statutory language says right

 3   in property.    We are not talking about the abstract

 4   right to tax.

 5               JUSTICE STEVENS:             But, but the basic issue

 6   in final analysis is whether they have to pay their

 7   taxes, isn't it?

 8               MR. CARDOZO:          I'm sorry.

 9               JUSTICE STEVENS:             The ultimate issue is

10   whether they have to pay their taxes.

11               MR. CARDOZO:          The ultimate substance --

12   underlying substantive issue is that but -- and of

13   course, the State Department even today says these taxes

14   should be paid.    But the jurisdictional issue is whether

15   there is a right in property.              And so if you just -- if

16   you don't create a lien, if a particular State did not

17   create a lien, that would not give you the right, which

18   is what the statute, statutory language says.

19               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Do you know any States that

20   don't?   Isn't it fairly standard?                For --

21               MR. CARDOZO:          I believe -- I believe it is

22   fairly standard, Justice Scalia.

23               JUSTICE SCALIA:             Yeah.

24               MR. CARDOZO:          I -- there may be one out of

25   50 States that, that don't say this.                     I think --

 1               JUSTICE SOUTER:            May, may I just ask, for a

 2   kind of a footnote kind of question?                    I mean you

 3   referred again to the text.            And if we are going to go

 4   on a very strict reading of the text as I understand it,

 5   you don't have to claim a right in property, you have to

 6   have a claim in -- in which someone's rights in

 7   immovable property are in issue.               So whether the, the --

 8   and so long as you create a cloud on the title, however

 9   that cloud is classified, it puts in issue the title of

10   the named title holder, so that the debates about the

11   distinction between a lien and easement and so forth is

12   essentially irrelevant as long as it's a cloud on the

13   title.   If we are going to be that, if we are going to

14   be literal, isn't that so?

15               MR. CARDOZO:         I, I agree with that.               And

16   here today the right that India and Mongolia claim in

17   their property is in issue, because we say you do not

18   have the full right to your property and if this lien

19   runs long enough, it's going to wipe out the value of

20   their property completely.          And all the statute, the

21   statute doesn't say as the European Convention says the

22   foreign sovereign's right in property.                   The statute says

23   either -- in effect, either side's right in property.

24               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yeah.

25               MR. CARDOZO:         And I think we can also get a

 1   great deal of help by looking --

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:              The -- the -- the European,

 3   the European treaty looks at it from the other side,

 4   you're saying.    It looks at it from the foreign

 5   sovereign side.

 6              MR. CARDOZO:           The European Convention

 7   phrased differently looks at it from both sides, Justice

 8   Scalia, which is why they needed the words obligation.

 9   If you look at Article 9 of the European Convention it

10   first talks about the foreign sovereign's right or

11   interest in property, and then it says "or the foreign

12   sovereign's obligations arising out of that property."

13   That's a different phrase than the FSIA which doesn't

14   use the word foreign sovereign; it says "its" rights in

15   property have to be an issue.              So you didn't need to

16   encompass all the language of the European Convention.

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Would the obligations

18   arising out of the property in the European Convention

19   include the obligation to pay taxes, property taxes?

20              MR. CARDOZO:           It would include a controversy

21   over that absolutely.       And let, let me talk about the

22   international practice because we should take a look at

23   international practice to -- to guide us.

24              What was the practice in 1976?                Well, first

25   of all we know that the restatement second and comment


                                        39
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   in paragraph 68 says disputes over rights or interest in

 2   property.     And the restatement third, which was

 3   concededly a few years after the 1976 adoption of the

 4   statute, makes it perfectly clear.                   It says it

 5   explicitly.     But where did the restatement --

 6                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            This says what explicitly?

 7                 MR. CARDOZO:         Says that there is

 8   jurisdiction over tax claim.              Section 455 of -- of

 9   restatement third.

10                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Over tax liens or

11   claims?

12                 MR. CARDOZO:         Over tax claims.          Excuse me,

13   Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice.

14                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And you don't go

15   that far.

16                 MR. CARDOZO:         That -- we don't have to go

17   that far because we believe we, as a -- we have a right

18   in property arising from the lien.                   Now let's look at

19   the foreign cases before we get to the European

20   Convention and we cite a number of them in footnote 24.

21   There is for example the case I referred to in response

22   to Justice Breyer, a suit over a mortgage.                   A suit over

23   a mortgage.    It's not the commercial exception; a suit

24   over a mortgage.

25                 There is a case in England in 1975 which


                                         40
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   analyzes broadly what's the meaning of this real

 2   property exception.      And that case in England which we

 3   cite says a security interest, a suit over security

 4   interest for a mortgage, there is jurisdiction within

 5   the immovable property exception.

 6                 There is a large number of cases.                   You look

 7   at the Harvard Review of 1932, the status of the law at

 8   that time, extensive review of all the relevant cases,

 9   says the same thing.       Then that brings us to the

10   European Convention which was adopted shortly before the

11   FSIA and which the State Department told Congress was

12   consistent with the FSIA.

13                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Is this the Vienna

14   Convention?

15                 MR. CARDOZO:        Pardon me?             No, the European

16   Convention.

17                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           European Convention.

18                 MR. CARDOZO:        Right.        And the European

19   Convention in Article 9 as I say has a very broad

20   immovable property exception.              I'm not looking just at

21   the language.    I'm looking at what does this convention

22   reflect as far as international practice was at the

23   time?   And that practice at the time as reflected by the

24   convention, as reflected by these cases, all say that

25   there is a very broad immovable property exception that


                                        41

 1   should cover this kind of dispute.

 2                 Now let me make one, one or two final

 3   points.   If this --

 4                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, the -- the

 5   convention used language quite different than that was

 6   used by Congress.    So I'm not quite sure how that

 7   international practice reflected in or arising out of

 8   the convention is terribly pertinent.

 9                 MR. CARDOZO:        I'm not, Mr. Chief Justice,

10   I'm not talking just about the language.                  I'm talking

11   about the European, the international practice as

12   reflected by that convention because the 1976

13   legislative history of the FSIA says we are trying to

14   conform United States practice into the, the practice

15   that is followed internationally.                 And I --

16                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                And in some cases

17   they used language directly from the convention and in

18   this case they didn't so it seems to me a particularly

19   ill-advised source for looking for what they were trying

20   to do.

21                 MR. CARDOZO:        Then I would say where did

22   they get that source from?           And that's where I cite the,

23   first the international cases themselves which reflect

24   as of 1976 the same philosophy reflected by the European

25   Convention.    There is no question that the wording is


                                        42
                            Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   different.    I'm not, I'm not disputing that.           What I'm

 2   saying is that wording conveys an intent from the

 3   international point of view to have the broad parameters

 4   of an international, of an immovable property exception

 5   and that was consistent with the international cases

 6   that have been decided at that time.

 7                 JUSTICE STEVENS:           Did their practice draw a

 8   distinction between occupied by the ambassador himself

 9   and property occupied by employees of the embassy?

10                 MR. CARDOZO:        As a substantive matter,

11   Justice Stevens, the answer to that question is of

12   course yes.    Because the Vienna convention in Article 20

13   -- 23 says that the premises of -- of the mission may

14   not be, may not be taxed.           And then you look at Article

15   1 to look at what is the meaning of premises of the

16   mission and they talk about where the business of the

17   mission is conducted, or where the ambassador resides.

18   It doesn't talk about the rest of the employees.             And

19   since 1952, the State Department even before the Vienna

20   convention and subsequent has been advising missions in

21   New York, it's on their web site today that they must

22   pay taxes on staff housing.

23                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Can I ask you what, what do

24   you get out of this case?           You've withdrawn your claim

25   for judgment of foreclosure.             What are you going to get


                                        43

 1   out of it?    Declaratory judgment that they owe the

 2   taxes?   I'm not sure they have ever contested that they

 3   don't owe taxes.

 4                 MR. CARDOZO:        Oh yes I think if you look, if

 5   you look at the Petitioners' brief I think they do

 6   contest that they, that they have to pay the tax.                  But

 7   what we'll get out of this is the following.

 8                 First of all, start with the fact that the

 9   statute says you can bring an action in this

10   jurisdiction even if you can't execute.                  We have the

11   State Department telling us, the Solicitor General

12   telling us in their briefs, footnote 17, that countries

13   pay lawful taxes.     So if we can get, if we can proceed

14   to judgment and get that, and get that declaration, we

15   believe based upon what the Solicitor General has said

16   they will pay their taxes.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Yeah, but --

18                 MR. CARDOZO:        In addition --

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           You say he is wrong about a

20   lot of other stuff.

21                 (Laughter.)

22                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           Why do you believe him

23   about that?

24                 MR. CARDOZO:        And the -- the reason I

25   believe him about that is that Congress has passed a law


                                        44
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that says if you don't pay your taxes reflected by a

 2   judgment, whatever the amount of that tax is, you're

 3   going to lose 1110 percent of your foreign aid.                  And so

 4   I believe we are going to get a lot out of that.

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:            Can I -- can I can ask you

 6   to go back for a second to where I'm getting myself into

 7   a muddle here.

 8              I'm still now being very, very literal.                     I

 9   think you're very literal and you say it says, a case in

10   which is involved rights to property.                  And you say, but

11   this is a right to property in this case; if I win this

12   case then I have a right to sell that house.                  Therefore,

13   I have a right in property.

14              Now, if that's the reasoning why doesn't

15   that apply to every case where a State might say if you

16   win this case you can sell his house?                  I mean, I can

17   easily imagine a tort case, a contract case where a

18   State would say, you win, you can sell their house to

19   collect the judgment.

20              MR. CARDOZO:         And --

21              JUSTICE BREYER:            So I'm still back in a

22   different route at where I'm having the problem, which

23   is a problem of distinguishing in principle between

24   either your absolute principle, "do it," his absolute

25   principle, "don't do it," or something in the middle.

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              MR. CARDOZO:         And I think the something in

 2   the middle, Justice Breyer, is if you're talking about a

 3   prejudgment lien which I think is your hypothetical.

 4   It's --

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:            The hypothetical was doing

 6   away with the prejudgment lien.             I would say the exact

 7   same words apply with just as much force if there is no

 8   prejudgment lien because a suit without a lien the State

 9   were to say, you win this tort claim, you can go sell

10   this property to collect the judgment, is a suit in

11   which there is at issue your right to sell his property,

12   just as there is here.

13              MR. CARDOZO:         But Justice, Justice Breyer,

14   in that hypothetical, you don't have a right in property

15   until you win the case.

16              JUSTICE BREYER:            Do you?

17              MR. CARDOZO:         We have, we have a, there is

18   an in issue today our right to property and I believe

19   that that is a distinction and I believe also -- and of

20   critical importance.

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, wait a minute.      But

22   the -- the embassy has rights in it when the case is

23   brought, even before the final judgment.               So you know,

24   let's give the devil his due.            It would be a case in

25   which rights in immovable property are in issue.

 1               MR. CARDOZO:         And if --

 2               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You want to look at it from

 3   the embassy side too so --

 4               MR. CARDOZO:         Yes.       And if you want to look

 5   at it from the embassy side under my theory, their right

 6   -- under my lien their rights are an issue today.                 And

 7   under Justice Breyer's hypothetical if it meets the

 8   other due process concerns which I think under that

 9   hypothetical would raise a number of interesting ones --

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, that's your big

11   defense.   To do that they would have to do it for

12   everybody' they would have to do it for Joe Sixpack as

13   well as for the embassy, right?

14               MR. CARDOZO:         That's right.          That's right.

15               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Is it only the case that

16   the, that the only instances in which, consistent with

17   the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act the State could say

18   you get the house, would be instances of litigation

19   arising out of commercial activity?

20               MR. CARDOZO:         Yes.       That is -- that is --

21   that is correct.   Because it's only in the commercial

22   activities exception can you execute and then only in

23   certain limited circumstances --

24               JUSTICE SOUTER:            Yeah.

25               MR. CARDOZO:         And you can execute unless the

 1   premises are not being used for the purposes of the

 2   mission.

 3                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Now -- now I take it you

 4   under New York law and the law of most jurisdictions,

 5   the tax lien becomes a lien against the property before

 6   any judicial proceedings.

 7                MR. CARDOZO:         That is correct.

 8                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Just because they are

 9   unpaid.    And this is probably a question more for them

10   than for you, but as you understand their position, if

11   you put a lien on the property for unpaid taxes, are

12   they entitled to demand its removal?

13                MR. CARDOZO:         Of course they can.          And in

14   fact the Republic of Argentina case --

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You mean of course they

16   can under their view?

17                MR. CARDOZO:         No.      They can bring an action

18   to quiet title.   They can bring an action --

19                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            No.      No.    No.

20                MR. CARDOZO:         I'm sorry.

21                JUSTICE KENNEY:            Excuse me.

22                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Can they demand that that

23   lien be released --

24                MR. CARDOZO:         They can demand it.

25                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            No, no.

 1              -- because it violates the Foreign Sovereign

 2   Immunities Act?   Is it their position that you have no

 3   right at all even to notice a lien against the property?

 4              MR. CARDOZO:          Well, I haven't heard their

 5   articulation of that position, but they certainly could

 6   write --

 7              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             It would seem to me to

 8   follow from what they're saying.

 9              MR. CARDOZO:          I think it may.             I think they

10   certainly have a right to ask us to reconsider and make

11   the various arguments on the merits to us.                    There are

12   cases preceding the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act

13   where a country felt the lien was invalid and brought a

14   lawsuit.

15              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             My hypothetical is can

16   they demand that the lien be removed solely because of

17   the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.

18              MR. CARDOZO:          They could demand that, but I

19   don't that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act answers

20   the underlying substantive question.                    You'd have to look

21   at the Vienna Convention as well as New York law to

22   answer that question, because all the Foreign Sovereign

23   Immunities Act is talking about is the jurisdictional

24   issue, not the substantive issue.

25              And let me just point out that if we, if we


                                       49

 1   can't bring this lawsuit to have, to try to foreclose or

 2   at least to have a declaration of our rights, this

 3   lawsuit can't be brought anywhere.                 No place in the

 4   world can New York City have a conclusion as to who owns

 5   this property.   That is absolutely inconsistent with the

 6   underlying immovable property exception and the local

 7   action rule, which says that land -- that a sovereign

 8   has a prim evil interest in its land, it has the right

 9   to adjudicate its property.

10               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            With reference to the

11   offset of foreign aid, could that offset be made under

12   the controlling statutes just based on your lien, or do

13   you have to have a judgment first?

14               MR. CARDOZO:         No.      The statute talks about a

15   judgment.   It can't just be that.

16               So finally, even though we cannot execute on

17   our property -- on the judgment, it has a major impact,

18   this case has a major impact on what we can do.                If we

19   can't do it there's no other place for our problems to

20   be resolved.   I urge that the decision below be

21   affirmed.   Thank you.

22               JUSTICE SOUTER:            May I ask you a question in

23   your remaining time.      With respect to the statute that

24   authorizes the, the charge against foreign aid, would

25   that statute have any application except either in a

 1   commercial case or a case like yours?

 2                MR. CARDOZO:         Theoretically it would have an

 3   application in a counterclaim situation as well --

 4                JUSTICE SOUTER:            Okay.

 5                MR. CARDOZO:         -- Justice Souter.          I think

 6   those are the three things.             Of course, you don't need

 7   that statute for the commercial exception because you

 8   can execute.

 9                JUSTICE SOUTER:            That's right.       You can go

10   directly.

11                MR. CARDOZO:         Right.

12                JUSTICE SOUTER:            So in practical terms, with

13   the possible exception of a counterclaim, the foreign

14   aid setoff would simply apply to a case like this, then?

15                MR. CARDOZO:         That's right.          And Justice

16   Souter, while certainly the Congress that passed those

17   statutes was not the Congress that passed the FSIA,

18   there is, certainly should be an effort to harmonize

19   what the Congress has done.

20                JUSTICE SOUTER:            I was going to say, if you

21   deny all the statutes you've got to --

22                MR. CARDOZO:         That is obviously the way to

23   reconcile these statutes.

24                JUSTICE SCALIA:            What do you do with traffic

25   tickets?    They've built up.           You know, there's $100,000

 1   owing in traffic tickets by some embassy.                   How do you

 2   get a judgment that that is owing?

 3                 MR. CARDOZO:         You can't get a judgment that

 4   that is owing.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            So you can't use even the

 6   foreign aid gimmick to --

 7                 MR. CARDOZO:         Not unless, unless the statute

 8   is changed, Justice Scalia, which we have from time to

 9   time tried to persuade Congress to do.

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Foreign aid --

11                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Unless New York law

12   is changed and you pass something saying you get a lien

13   on property if you have delinquent property, parking

14   tickets.

15                 MR. CARDOZO:         That is right, and that would

16   get us right back into the --

17                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             I thought that the

18   Federal, the 100 percent withholding, relates to taxes?

19                 MR. CARDOZO:         Yes.

20                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Taxes, not for parking

21   tickets or anything else.

22                 MR. CARDOZO:         Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it

23   does.    It relates to unpaid property, unpaid property

24   taxes.     It doesn't apply to unpaid parking tickets.

25                 Thank you very much.

 3             REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J.P. HOWLEY

 4                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 5                 MR. HOWLEY:        Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

 6                 Article 29 of the European Convention

 7   expressly excludes any intent to create an exception for

 8   tax claims.    That was the international practice at the

 9   time.   What we have here is a bootstrap and I refer to

10   the Court to its decision in Ministry of Defense of

11   Republic of Iran against Elahi, where this Court said

12   that when you have an action to impose a lien, it is

13   analyzed as an attachment under Section 1609-1610 of the

14   Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.                  And what the Foreign

15   Sovereign Immunities Act says is you cannot use an

16   attachment to get jurisdiction where jurisdiction

17   otherwise does not exist.

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Do you take the position

19   that it's improper even to notice the property with the

20   lien?

21                 MR. HOWLEY:        Under New York law, yes, and we

22   have Chief Judge Fulbright for a unanimous --

23                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I mean, let's assume that

24   you owe the taxes.

25                 MR. HOWLEY:        Well, we say that there's no

 1   right to impose the lien because the Vienna Convention

 2   and New York law prohibit the taxation of the property

 3   and you cannot impose the lien to collect something that

 4   you're not entitled to.        And this is a dispute that has

 5   historically been resolved through diplomacy, not in the

 6   courts, because the fact is whatever happens in this

 7   case to India and Mongolia is likely to happen to the

 8   United States around the world and that's a foreign

 9   policy question for the State Department to decide.

10               JUSTICE SCALIA:            You mean we'll have to

11   start paying our taxes around the world?

12               MR. HOWLEY:        I'm afraid so, Justice Scalia.

13               JUSTICE SCALIA:            Is that a real problem for

14   us?   I don't think so.

15               MR. HOWLEY:        I am afraid so.

16               Thank you very much.
