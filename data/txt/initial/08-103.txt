 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  We will hear

 6               ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S. SIMS

 7                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

 8               MR. SIMS:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 9   please the Court:

10               The Second Circuit's decision vacating for

11   lack of jurisdiction a settlement agreement that

12   compensated authors for all their arguably infringed

13   works in the face of Congress's direction that Federal

14   district courts shall have jurisdiction over any civil

15   action arising under copyright is wrong for three

16   reasons.   First, even -- first, the decision is

17   incorrect under the unanimous holding three years ago in

18   Arbaugh that where Congress affords unqualified subject

19   matter jurisdiction, other statutory provisions argued

20   to be jurisdictional that do not clearly restrict that

21   jurisdiction won't be deemed to do so.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  This is a lot harder

23   case than Arbaugh, though.            Arbaugh involved the

24   definition of an employer and then the scope of the

25   statute.   This one says no suit shall be instituted.


                                         3

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              MR. SIMS:       Well, Arbaugh relied heavily on

 2   the Zipes case, and the Zipes involved a statutory

 3   threshold condition much like the one here.                You

 4   couldn't bring a Title VII action unless you filed a

 5   particular kind of piece of paper with the EEOC.                 And

 6   Zipes and Arbaugh both held that those statutory

 7   conditions or essential ingredients were not

 8   jurisdictional, and the Court relied, heavily I think,

 9   on the fact that jurisdiction was separately provided

10   for and the provisions at issue weren't.

11              The second point I want to make is that,

12   even putting the clear statement rule of Arbaugh to one

13   side, statutory text, structure, purpose and history all

14   point to classifying 411(a) as mandatory but not

15   jurisdictional.

16              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I think you are

17   right that Arbaugh at least set forth a clear statement

18   rule, but I think that's significant only going forward.

19   I don't know that Congress, when it passed this

20   provision, could have been aware of the clear statement

21   rule that Arbaugh articulated.

22              MR. SIMS:       Well, the Court did apply --

23   reiterate and apply the Arbaugh rule in the Rockwell

24   case with respect to a provision that had predated

25   Arbaugh, and nothing in Arbaugh said that.

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               But in any event, our second point is that

 2   if you look at the traditional indicia of not only text

 3   but also structure, history and purpose, this provision

 4   should be ranked as mandatory but not jurisdictional.

 5               And the third point I want to get to --

 6               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Do you agree with the --

 7   with the government that it's mandatory for the district

 8   court but prohibited to the court of appeals?           The

 9   government has this hybrid where, because of the public

10   purposes served by registration, not only can but the

11   district court should raise the failure to register on

12   its own, but then the government says once you have a

13   final judgment in district court, it's no longer open

14   for the court of appeals to raise it on its own.

15               Do you agree with that or do you say it's

16   for the defendants to raise, and if they don't raise it,

17   too bad?

18               MR. SIMS:      Justice Ginsburg, we certainly

19   agree with the government with respect to the court of

20   appeals.   With respect to the district court, on the one

21   hand, my clients don't -- are satisfied with the

22   government's position.       On the other hand, as Justice

23   Scalia's decision, I think, in Day v. McDonough pointed

24   out, the traditional default rule really is that

25   defenses are up to defendants to raise.


                                       5

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1                 In this particular kind of situation where

 2   there is no reason at all, I think, to suspect that

 3   defense counsel will not raise 411 whenever -- none of

 4   the cases that Ms. Merritt raises for example, involve

 5   situations of waiver, where the issues weren't raised

 6   until the court of appeals -- I think that the Court can

 7   rely, frankly, on defendants and on the ability of

 8   district judges to nudge defense counsel when they need

 9   nudging.

10                 But if the Court felt that the provision was

11   important enough so that it wanted to impose on district

12   courts the obligation of strict policing, I think it

13   could.   But as I say, I have been practicing copyright

14   law for 25 years; I've never seen a defendant who either

15   missed a defense or chose not to raise it.

16                 The third point I want to raise if there is

17   time is simply that, even if 411(a) were deemed

18   jurisdictional at the outset of the case with respect to

19   its language which talks about instituting, nothing in

20   either its text or purpose suggests that Congress meant

21   to deprive district courts of their usual power to

22   settle cases with respect to approving settlement

23   agreements.

24                 In this case, because the plaintiffs

25   complied with 411(a) at the front door by alleging


                                        6

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   properly that they had complied with the obligation, we

 2   think the district court had jurisdiction to send the

 3   parties to mediation and then necessarily to approve the

 4   agreement they returned with three years later.              Now

 5   with respect to --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Can -- can I ask you, one

 7   of the points made by the amicus is that, if I recall it

 8   correctly, that what -- what Congress had in mind in

 9   phrasing it this way was to enable -- enable the party

10   who had not gone to the Copyright Office to go after

11   dismissal on jurisdictional grounds, and the implication

12   is that if it were not held to be jurisdictional, there

13   would be a merits dismissal because of the failure to

14   have gone to the Copyright Office first.              And therefore

15   would not -- the plaintiff would not be able to come

16   back to the court.

17               MR. SIMS:      I don't understand the amicus to

18   be making that argument.       If Your Honor is referring

19   to --

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:           I don't --

21               MR. SIMS:      -- the third -- the third

22   sentence of 411(a), I think that's the principal

23   argument she makes as to why this satisfies Arbaugh and

24   we think, quite to the contrary, the third sentence of

25   411(a) --


                                      7

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1              JUSTICE SCALIA:             No, I didn't -- I didn't

 2   think it related to the third sentence.               I -- I thought

 3   she said the whole purpose of Congress was to make sure

 4   that you'd be able to come back, that your failure to go

 5   to the Copyright Office initially would not result in a

 6   merits dismissal so that you could not later go back and

 7   then rebring the suit.       If it was jurisdictional, just a

 8   jurisdictional dismissal, the jurisdiction could be

 9   cured by going to the Copyright Office and your suit

10   could then proceed.

11              MR. SIMS:        Your Honor, I think that the --

12   because of the way 411(a) is phrased, dismissals under

13   411(a), whether we are correct that it's not

14   jurisdictional or whether they are correct that it is, I

15   think ordinarily --

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:             You would be --

17              MR. SIMS:        -- without prejudice --

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:             You'd be able to come back

19   anyway?

20              MR. SIMS:        Absolutely.

21              JUSTICE SCALIA:             That's what I thought.

22              MR. SIMS:        That's the nature of this

23   requirement.

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:             That's what I thought you'd

25   say.

 1              MR. SIMS:        Yeah.

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Yeah.

 3              MR. SIMS:        With respect to the Arbaugh --

 4              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Would -- if the statute of

 5   limitations had run, could you still come back?

 6              MR. SIMS:        The problem in this case, and

 7   really the reason why the settlement agreement has

 8   turned out the way it did is there is no effective --

 9              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             I mean, not -- not

10   necessarily in this case, but in -- but in a typical

11   case.

12              MR. SIMS:        There is no effective statute of

13   limitations in these cases, Your Honor.

14              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I said in a typical case.

15              MR. SIMS:        Well --

16              JUSTICE KENNEDY:            Or is it just --

17              MR. SIMS:        In -- in a case where the

18   infringement is the existence of something on the web,

19   then there is no statute of limitations effectively,

20   because the argument would be that the making available

21   is an infringement.

22              We don't think that the last sentence of

23   411(a) satisfies Arbaugh or indeed is -- is any evidence

24   toward this being jurisdictional.               The last sentence was

25   inserted, as the history makes perfectly clear, to solve


                                       9

 1   the problem created by the Vacheron decision that the

 2   Second Circuit had decided in 1958.                    And in that case,

 3   what justice -- Judge Hand had done, and other courts

 4   have done it, too, is to say it is -- district courts

 5   cannot review the registrar's action in denying

 6   registration, and that has to be done in a separate

 7   mandamus action, at that point in Washington, D.C.

 8              So the lesson simply is Congress's way of

 9   saying very clearly:     We want to get rid of that

10   rigamarole and we want to allow all this to be done

11   efficiently.   But the statement that this could be done

12   even if the registrant didn't show up is not at all any

13   statement, much less a clear statement, that this was

14   intended to be jurisdictional.             Now --

15              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Mr. Sims, it has been

16   pointed out that you have taken inconsistent positions.

17   That is, back in the district court before there was a

18   settlement, you urged before the district court that

19   411(a) was a jurisdictional bar and that that precluded

20   certifying a class that included the non-registered

21   copyright holders.    You did make that argument in the

22   district court, and now you are saying -- you are

23   confessing error, that was wrong?

24              MR. SIMS:       Your Honor, I don't think it's

25   fair to say that we made that argument.                   We did -- we


                                      10

 1   did issue, we did say that sentence in one or two

 2   places, and the argument --

 3                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The argument --

 4                 MR. SIMS:      But I think it's -- I think it's

 5   different, because the issue in the district court was

 6   the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of the

 7   settlement and there was an attack on the different

 8   valuation for unregistered claims.                  In that context we

 9   relied on 411(a).     The argument would have been exactly

10   the same had we said, as we should have, that 411(a) is

11   mandatory but not jurisdictional.                  We were guilty of

12   exactly the loose language that this Court was guilty of

13   in Robinson and Smith, as it pointed out in Eberhart or

14   Kontrick.

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           And -- and --

16                 MR. SIMS:      But as -- but as the Court

17   decision in that case said, there was no need to

18   overrule Robinson or Smith because really what was going

19   on there was the Court had been saying the rule was

20   mandatory, and the additional language that was

21   jurisdictional was loose language.

22                 Our argument never focused on the ranking of

23   411(a).     It was always rooted in the existence of the

24   rule which did justify, and on the merits of the appeal

25   back in the Second Circuit we will again argue did

 1   justify, a different valuation of the claim.

 2              JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, you shouldn't use

 3   loose language, especially when it's the same loose

 4   language, supposedly, that seems to have been used by

 5   all the courts of appeals and all the district courts.

 6              MR. SIMS:       Not all the courts --

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:           For years and years.

 8              MR. SIMS:       Your Honor, the first court of

 9   appeals which said that 411(a) said -- not held -- was

10   jurisdictional was in 1990.          That's well after the 1976

11   act, and the original act had been -- I mean, the 1909

12   act, which it was patterned after, had been nearly

13   100 years earlier.    There was no court of appeals that

14   ever said that the 1909 act was jurisdictional, and when

15   this Court had that case in the Washingtonian case in

16   the 1930s, there was no reference to it being

17   jurisdictional by either the majority or the dissent.

18   And I think Washingtonian is particularly interesting

19   because there the district court had originally held

20   that it was jurisdictional and then sua sponte recanted

21   a few days later and issued another position.          And that

22   is in the record of this Court in Washingtonian and it

23   was pointed out by Professor Ben Kaplan in the report to

24   the register and to Congress in connection with the 1976

25   act.


                                     12

                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               So the issue was raised for people to think

 2   about if anybody had.      But Congress did not in 1976 or

 3   at any time earlier say that this was intended to be

 4   jurisdictional or was jurisdictional.                  So if -- if

 5   passing the Arbaugh argument with respect to text,

 6   structure, history and purpose -- the structure I think

 7   is particularly telling, because in this case the

 8   provision of jurisdiction is in Title 28, the provision

 9   of registration is in the Copyright Act.                  They've been

10   separated --

11               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But still it's a statute

12   and didn't this Court say in Bowles that a statutory

13   qualification on the right to sue is generally

14   jurisdictional?

15               MR. SIMS:      I don't think the Court said

16   that.   I think that the Court said that in Bowles with

17   respect to time limits for appeal.                I think Bowles is

18   quite clearly limited to time limits for appeal, and the

19   Court's decision rested on -- heavily on stare decisis.

20   With respect to --

21               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            But I thought they made a

22   distinction to distinguish the other cases, the one -- I

23   forgot -- the one involving Criminal Rule 33, on the

24   ground, well, that's a court rule, but when Congress

25   makes the qualification then it's jurisdictional.

 1                 MR. SIMS:      But this doesn't involve a time

 2   limit.     This involves, as Arbaugh and Zipes did,

 3   ingredients of the claim, preconditions to the claim,

 4   threshold steps with respect to the claim, and I think

 5   there is no reason for the Arbaugh approach not to

 6   apply.     But in any event the structure is telling here;

 7   the language is telling as well.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, if you are

 9   talking about the language, what about John R. Sand &

10   Gravel?    That said we held it was jurisdictional when

11   the statute said:     "Suits shall be barred."                  The

12   language here is "No suit shall be instituted."                       That

13   sounds pretty close.

14                 MR. SIMS:      I think not, Chief Justice

15   Roberts.    The language here has been used in copyright

16   statutes in 1831, as our reply brief points out, and

17   includes the language for statutes of limitation and for

18   copyright notice.     And all of those have always been

19   deemed mandatory.     None of them has been deemed

20   jurisdictional.

21                 Again, Section 507 of the Copyright Act, the

22   statute of limitations provision here, has almost

23   exactly the same language as in 411.                     John R. Sand I

24   think the Court treated as in Bowles --

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                No, that was -- that

 1   was a statute of limitations provision, right?              It shall

 2   be barred after six years?

 3                 MR. SIMS:      Well, John R. Sand involved a

 4   special situation of suits against the government and

 5   considerations of sovereign immunity.

 6                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I thought the Court said

 7   it was mandatory.     I don't remember when they used the

 8   word "jurisdictional."

 9                 MR. SIMS:      Well, I think John R. Sand held

10   that provision was jurisdictional, but I think the

11   decision went off on -- on stare decisis, and the fact

12   that the Court had, with respect to the Tucker Act and

13   matters of suits against the government, taken a

14   different position.

15                 Those, I think, are really the only

16   carve-outs, the statutory time limits for appeal and

17   suits against the government, from the general Arbaugh

18   rule.

19                 So here Congress has used this language

20   repeatedly.    This Court's own forms for copyright

21   infringement, which were first promulgated in the 1930s,

22   have patterned our argument and are contrary to the

23   amicuses'.    They have always treated the registration

24   provision of the model complaint differently from the

25   jurisdictional provisions.            Those are in separate

 1   sections, not next to each other even.

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                We have forms for

 3   copyright infringement actions?

 4                MR. SIMS:      You do.         The Federal Rule --

 5                (Laughter.)

 6                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Live and learn.

 7                MR. SIMS:      And because they haven't changed

 8   very much in 70 years, you probably haven't spent much

 9   time with them.

10                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            It'S Form 19.

11                MR. SIMS:      Yes.       It was originally Form 17.

12   We have gone through the history.                 But I think there is

13   really only one change and in every respect it is

14   identical to what it was in 1938.                 And, again, as I say,

15   it separates out the registration provision from the

16   jurisdictional provision.

17                If Congress had wanted to make registration

18   jurisdictional, it would have been extraordinarily easy

19   to do so.    All they would have had to add at the

20   beginning of 411(a) is "notwithstanding anything in 1338

21   and 1331."

22                We have -- we have included in our brief as

23   an appendix about 60-odd Federal statutes, which carved

24   out jurisdiction otherwise provided by 1331 or other

25   provisions, and 411(a) looks nothing like them.                 They

 1   all look, roughly, like each other.

 2                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Can I ask a sort of basic

 3   question I never understood about this case.             As I

 4   understand it, the end-of-the-line concern of the

 5   fairness of the settlement, and particularly to people

 6   who have copyrights who have never been registered.                Am

 7   I right, that that's what --

 8                MR. SIMS:      Well, not -- not quite.        There

 9   were -- there were ten authors who objected, I mean, as

10   a group, and they wanted more money for unregistered

11   authors.    There were, needless to say, tens of thousands

12   of other authors who didn't object, but it is true that

13   the objectors wanted -- thought that they had gotten a

14   bad deal.

15                JUSTICE STEVENS:            But those were people who

16   owned some registered copyrights, but had other works

17   that were not -- had no registered copyrights.             Is that

18   right?

19                MR. SIMS:      I --

20                JUSTICE STEVENS:            Were there any of those

21   people who had no -- no copyrights at all?

22                MR. SIMS:      Well, they -- I don't know, Your

23   Honor, whether the objectors had any registered works.

24   I know that the named plaintiffs had more unregistered

25   works than registered works.

 1                JUSTICE STEVENS:             But they had some

 2   registered works?

 3                MR. SIMS:       Yes.

 4                JUSTICE STEVENS:             You see, one of the -- one

 5   of the risks involved here is whether people who had no

 6   registered works are being adequately protected by this

 7   Class C settlement.

 8                MR. SIMS:       Yes.       This is not a situation --

 9                JUSTICE STEVENS:             And just to get the

10   question on the table -- I don't want to take up much of

11   your time.   I don't understand how it makes any

12   difference whether you say the rule is mandatory or the

13   rule is jurisdictional, in terms of the fairness of the

14   settlement, at the end of the line.

15                MR. SIMS:       I don't think that has anything

16   to do with the fairness of the settlement.               I think we

17   are here because the Second Circuit blew up the

18   settlement and said we can't settle this case, and the

19   only way it was settleable was to give the publishers

20   and the databases complete peace by clearing all off of

21   this off.

22                And so --

23                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             And that -- that,

24   certainly, would be open.           If you are correct that the

25   Second Circuit shouldn't have cut this off at the

 1   threshold by saying it's jurisdictional, the question of

 2   the fairness of the settlement is what you were

 3   contending.

 4                 MR. SIMS:      That is correct, Your Honor.

 5                 I would like to reserve the balance of my

 6   time.   But the -- the adequacy and fairness of the

 7   settlement is back in the Second Circuit on remand.

11                 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

13                   SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

14                 MS. ANDERS:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

15   please the Court:

16                 Statutory prerequisites to suit like Section

17   411(a) often fall into one of two distinct categories.

18   They are either jurisdictional and therefore unwaivable

19   or they are not jurisdictional and are fully waivable.

20   Section 411(a)'s registration requirement falls in the

21   middle of those two extremes.

22                 It is not jurisdictional, but it should not

23   be fully waivable.     The provision does not speak to the

24   power of the courts to decide cases and therefore it

25   does not limit the court's jurisdiction to adjudicate


                                        19

 1   infringement suits.

 2              But, because of this phrase and mandatory

 3   language, the requirement should be strictly enforced

 4   whenever the defendant asserts it, and because the

 5   requirement serves important public interest that are

 6   independent of the concerns of the parties to any

 7   individual suit --

 8              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So your position is that

 9   the district court really should have dismissed this

10   case at the outset?

11              MS. ANDERS:         I think that, in the ordinary

12   case, the district court should -- when -- when the

13   defendant waives the requirement, which would be the

14   rare case, when the defendant doesn't assert it.          When

15   the defendant waives the requirement, the district court

16   should consider whether accepting that waiver would

17   undermine the public interest behind 411.

18              Now, in this particular case, it may not

19   have been an abuse of discretion for the district court

20   to consider those interests and decide that here it

21   would have been acceptable to accept the defendant's

22   waiver and permit the resolution to go forward because,

23   in this case, the periodicals that -- that are

24   involved -- the works at issue were primarily already in

25   the possession of the Library of Congress, because they


                                      20
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   had been registered as -- the periodicals themselves had

 2   been registered.

 3               So the Library's interest is not as strongly

 4   implicated here.   In addition, this is a case in which

 5   there was going to be settlement, so the Court wasn't

 6   going to need to adjudicate the copyright claims and

 7   therefore the opportunity for the register's views to be

 8   taken into account was less important.

 9               JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Maybe this is the same

10   question.   Are you representing the interest of the

11   Library of Congress?

12               MS. ANDERS:        Yes, we are representing the

13   interest of the Library of Congress.

14               So I think in this case it may have been

15   appropriate for the district court to conclude that --

16   that it could let someone go forward, notwithstanding

17   the fact that some unregistered copyrights were

18   involved.

19               But after adjudication on the merits, the

20   defendant has waived the requirement, and, having come

21   up, Section 411(a), like any other non-jurisdictional

22   rule, should be subject to the general principle that

23   issues that are not raised below should not be

24   considered for the first time on appeal, absent

25   extraordinary circumstances.

 1                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           You were candid to say

 2   that this is in a hybrid category, that the government

 3   was taking an intermediate position.                     Do you know of any

 4   other provision where the district court has an

 5   obligation to raise the question on its own motion that

 6   is yet not jurisdictional?

 7                 MS. ANDERS:      I believe this Court has

 8   recognized that waiver doctrines in general are

 9   discretionary, and so, particularly in the area of res

10   judicata, the Court has recognized in the Plaut v.

11   Spendthrift Farm and Arizona v. California that the

12   Court has some discretion to enforce res judicata on its

13   own motion.

14                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Very, very limited.          I

15   think Arizona didn't say any time there's -- there's a

16   preclusion plea, the Court can raise it on its own.

17                 MS. ANDERS:      That's correct.               I think also

18   the plain error rule presupposes that there are some

19   errors that the district court has a responsibility to

20   correct on its own, even though neither party has

21   brought the error to its attention.                     So in other words,

22   the district court has the obligation to issue a legal

23   ruling that neither party has asked for, and I think

24   that kind of regime is appropriate here because the

25   public interest at issue, the Library's interest and the


                                       22
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                      Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   interest in the public record of copyright, those don't

 2   depend on the defendant's litigation decisions -- they

 3   shouldn't depend on the defendant's particular strategic

 4   decisions within a particular case.

 5              The Library's interest will always be in

 6   having every work registered and the public interest and

 7   public record will be the same.

 8              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Is your discussion

 9   of that, including in your response to Justice Ginsburg

10   and in your brief, do you think that that's within the

11   question presented, rephrased?

12              MS. ANDERS:       I think it is fairly within the

13   question of whether the rule is jurisdictional or not, I

14   think, is -- also encompasses the question of how the

15   rule should be enforced, assuming that it is

16   non-jurisdictional, of what should happen in this case.

17              So I do think that the -- the

18   characterization of this rule as a mandatory or a

19   waivable rule is -- is within the question presented.

20   So I think that the regime we're proposing best gives

21   effect to the mandatory, but non-jurisdictional language

22   that Congress used in Section 411(a).

23              And it also protects the public interest

24   that the requirement serves, which, again, the

25   compilation of a public record of copyrighted works in

 1   the copyright office, which allows a robust licensing

 2   system under the Copyright Act.

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:            But how -- how would we get

 4   to hold what -- what you say is the law?               It seems, to

 5   me, once we decide it's not jurisdictional and once we

 6   agree with you, that it doesn't -- at least in this

 7   case -- didn't have to be raised sua sponte by the

 8   district court.

 9              That's the end of the case, and so why do we

10   have to engage in the further discussion, well,

11   ordinarily, the district court must raise it on its

12   own and -- you know, and, if it doesn't ordinarily --

13   you know, the appellate court should.

14              Why do we have to get into that?

15              MS. ANDERS:        I don't think you have to get

16   into it, Justice Scalia.        I think --

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:            Which means we shouldn't.

18              (Laughter.)

19              MS. ANDERS:        Well, that may be the case, but

20   I think we are simply trying to -- trying to explain to

21   the Court what we think how the rule should be applied

22   in the district court, in the -- in the ordinary case,

23   and then, in the rare case, this one, where the

24   defendant has waived, and permitting the settlement to

25   go forward, it wouldn't adversely affect the public

 1   interest that are normally in force here.

 2                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Do you have an

 3   example of the non-ordinary case?                 I mean, you seem to

 4   say, either -- I guess it's not always after judgment

 5   that it shouldn't be implemented, I guess.                 But when

 6   wouldn't it be after judgment?

 7                MS. ANDERS:       I think that the -- that in

 8   general, the requirement would be considered waived if

 9   it's not raised before judgment.                We can't think of a

10   case in which the extraordinary circumstance would be

11   fulfilled.

12                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So it's more -- so

13   it's more or less jurisdictional after judgment?

14                MS. ANDERS:       No, I'm sorry.           What I meant to

15   say was that I don't think this rule could ever be

16   enforced, in the first instance, on appeal if it has

17   been waived below.    I think the general civil rule for

18   non-jurisdictional requirements is that if it's not

19   raised before judgment, it's lost on appeal --

20   circumstances --

21                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Well, that's normal, but

22   not invariable.

23                MS. ANDERS:       Well, I think that's the

24   rule -- that's the rule that this Court has applied to

25   constitutional rights with the plain error rule, and


                                       25

 1   also, with respect to structural constitutional rights

 2   that might implicate other public interests, the general

 3   rule is that if the requirement has not been raised

 4   during the -- during the trial stages of the case, then

 5   it can't be enforced for the first time on appeal.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:           Unless it is plain error.

 7               MS. ANDERS:        Unless it's plain error, and in

 8   this situation, if the plain error standard applied, or

 9   something even more -- even more heightened in the civil

10   context, we can't think of a case in which registration

11   requirements --

12               JUSTICE SCALIA:           It's pretty plain that the

13   things haven't been registered.              I mean, right?   And

14   it's pretty plain that if they hadn't been registered,

15   the district court should not have proceeded with the

16   case.   So I don't know why it wouldn't normally be plain

17   error in -- in the court of appeals.

18               MS. ANDERS:        Well, I think those -- those

19   circumstances would be true in most cases in which the

20   -- for some reason, the requirement hadn't been reached

21   at the trial stage.      So I don't think that the

22   extraordinary circumstance is present here that would

23   justify overturning the independent interest in judgment

24   that our legal system has, the finality of judgment, the

25   rights of the parties in relying on that judgment and


                                      26

 1   the judicial resources expended.

 2              You know, I think in some ways we can think

 3   of this requirement as sort of like a filing fee, that

 4   it's -- it serves interests beyond those of the parties

 5   at the district court, and therefore you wouldn't think

 6   of it as waivable at the instance of the defendant.                 But

 7   --

 8              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  There really are, in

 9   our recent decisions, it seems to me, two different

10   lines of authority.      There is the Bowles and the John R.

11   Sand and Gravel, which treats these sorts of things as

12   jurisdictional, and the Arbaugh line that doesn't.                And

13   it does seem to me that the language here, "No suit

14   shall be instituted," sounds an awful lot like "suit

15   shall be barred," or the other language in -- in Bowles.

16              MS. ANDERS:         I think it's similar to a lot

17   of language that's used in statutes of limitations,

18   which are traditionally considered non-jurisdictional,

19   that no statute -- no suit shall be instituted.

20              I think what's important is that it speaks

21   in terms of the actions of the parties, because the

22   parties institute a suit, not the Court.                So it doesn't

23   speak in terms of the power of the Court.                And there's

24   no evidence, I don't think, that Congress intended to

25   withdraw the broad grant to jurisdiction in 1331 and


                                      27

 1   1338.   I think Bowles and John R. Sand are cases in

 2   which the Court's own precedents had previously treated

 3   the rules at issue as jurisdictional, had accorded them

 4   jurisdictional consequences.            So those are cases in

 5   which the Court relied on stare decisis, but I don't

 6   think that we have any similar situation here.                There's

 7   no --

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What about the

 9   congressional reaction to the Second Circuit's decision?

10   It provided that the -- there was to be no

11   jurisdictional bar in criminal matters.                Didn't -- it

12   didn't affect jurisdiction in criminal matters, but it

13   didn't say anything about civil matters.                So isn't that

14   some kind of reflected acceptance that in some of the

15   civil -- in civil cases, it would be jurisdictional?

16               MS. ANDERS:       I don't think so.           I think, in

17   enacting that, Congress had recognized that the

18   incentives for registration should stay in place in the

19   civil context, but that making an exception wouldn't --

20   wouldn't make a difference in the criminal context.

21               I think Congress still spoke of it as a --

22   as a non-jurisdictional requirement in the legislative

23   history, so I don't think that there is any indication

24   that Congress has ratified the Second Circuit's decision

25   here.

 6                        OF THE JUDGEMENT BELOW

 7                 MS. JONES MERRITT:            Mr. Chief Justice and

 8   may it please the Court:

 9                 We will start with the statutory language as

10   the Court has been discussing for the last half-hour.

11                 Section 411(a) appears on page 1 of the

12   Petitioner's brief.      It uses, first, the mandatory word

13   "shall" in commanding that no action shall be

14   instituted.

15                 It does not contain a limitations period, as

16   statutes of limitations do.            It simply says, "No action

17   shall be instituted."       No waiver --

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          "Until."         That's a

19   limitation period.

20                 MS. JONES MERRITT:            Until?

21                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          Until preregistration or

22   registration has been made.

23                 MS. JONES MERRITT:            That's correct, Justice

24   Scalia, and that makes --

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          That's our limitation

 1   period.

 2                 MS. JONES MERRITT:             That makes -- it's a --

 3   it's a requirement that registration be made.                   It is

 4   quite analogous, although stronger than the statute in

 5   the Hallstrom case.      The hybrid argument that the

 6   Solicitor General was referring to is the Court's

 7   decision in the Hallstrom case, which was a provision of

 8   the environmental statutes that is common in several of

 9   those statutes providing:           No action may be commenced

10   until a notice is filed.

11                 Our provision here is stronger.                 It says:

12   "No action shall be instituted," instead of "No action

13   may be commenced."     Even if this case is not -- even if

14   this statute does not impose a jurisdictional limit,

15   which I will strongly argue that it does, it at the very

16   least imposes a mandatory command like the statute in

17   Hallstrom.     And there is no reason in this case to

18   reverse the Second Circuit, even if this is a mandatory

19   provision.

20                 As you will recall, in Hallstrom, the

21   parties had gone through four years of complicated

22   environmental litigation.           Went up through the court of

23   appeals.     The court of appeals reversed, saying, you did

24   not comply with this notice provision.                   This Court held

25   that it did not need to decide whether that provision


                                        30

 1   was jurisdictional in the strictest sense of the term,

 2   because it was at least mandatory.                 And the Court

 3   reversed despite that time, sent the case back.

 4               In fact, I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, you

 5   asked about whether the mandatory issue would be within

 6   the Court's grant of certiorari.                The grant of

 7   certiorari in Hallstrom referred to the jurisdictional

 8   issue and the Court decided that rather than get to the

 9   strict issue of jurisdiction, it would decide on a

10   mandatory forum.

11               But there is no reason, if we are -- if the

12   Court wants to avoid the jurisdictional issue and to

13   endorse the mandatory hybrid one, the Second Circuit

14   should still be affirmed in this case.                  The parties

15   raised Section 411(a) quite clearly to the district

16   court.   They used this provision as their major defense

17   of both the substance of the settlement's fairness and

18   the representation.      The representation was the major

19   issue that the objectors raised in the district court.

20   And so both parties, the Plaintiffs and the defendants,

21   argued in their briefs -- and it's simply not a few

22   sentences; we've provided the parts of the record in the

23   appendix to our brief -- that the reason that this

24   settlement should be upheld was because of this

25   mandatory, they called it then, jurisdictional


                                       31
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   provision.   That was an essential argument that they

 2   made to the district court and that they then repeated

 3   to the Second Circuit in the merits briefs long before

 4   the circuit said, then:       Wait a minute; you are making a

 5   curious argument here that this is a jurisdictional

 6   provision that upholds your settlement, but that we

 7   still have the ability to look at this settlement if

 8   it's jurisdictional.

 9                I would like to return to the language of

10   Section 411(a).   As I have argued, it begins with this

11   mandatory language, "No action shall be maintained."

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           In -- aren't there

13   statutes that have exhaustion requirements, or like the

14   EEOC filing requirement, that say, you can't sue until

15   you have gone to X administrative agency?              And those are

16   not considered jurisdictional.

17                MS. JONES MERRITT:            That's correct.    That's

18   correct, Justice Ginsburg.          Many of those statutes refer

19   specifically to exhaustion.           The Prison Litigation

20   Reform Act, for example, that some of the parties cite,

21   refers specifically to exhaustion of remedies after the

22   "no action" sort of language.

23                Every jurisdictional statute has its own

24   language and its own story.           We could say they are like

25   Tolstoy's unhappy families; they are all different.              And


                                      32
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   in this case, the story of the Copyright Act and its

 2   language is very distinctive, both in the public

 3   purposes that it furthers and in the language that it

 4   uses.

 5               Again, on the statutory language, we have

 6   the very mandatory language, "no action shall be

 7   instituted."   No modifiers; there's no provision for

 8   waiver.   The Solicitor General's assistant mentioned

 9   that this statute is like fee waivers.                   It's not at all

10   like a fee waiver, because the statute for fee waivers

11   explicitly gives the district judge authority to waive

12   the fee in the case of an in forma pauperis plaintiff.

13   This statute contains no waiver for the parties.                   It

14   contains no discretion for the district judge.

15               And in the last word of -- the last sentence

16   of this very short three-sentence provision, Congress

17   referred explicitly to jurisdiction.                   And I would like

18   to look very closely at that word, because any plain

19   reading of this section will show -- shows that Congress

20   intended the entire provision to refer to the

21   jurisdiction of the court.

22               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I thought that -- that

23   last sentence is just relating to the court can -- has

24   authority to decide this particular issue,

25   copyrightability, even though the registrant has chosen


                                      33
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   not to enter the suit.        The sentence simply says, court,

 2   you have authority to decide this question.

 3                 MS. JONES MERRITT:            That's the most

 4   immediate reference, Justice Ginsburg, but the three

 5   sentences work together.         And if we look at the three

 6   sentences, they appear on the first page of the

 7   Petitioner's brief.      The first sentence creates two

 8   categories of cases:      Those that the Court may decide

 9   and those it may not.       Let us say for now we are not

10   meaning what that power is.            We are simply saying two

11   categories of cases, one the court may decide, the other

12   one it may not.

13                 The second sentence then adds a small group

14   of cases to this first category, the one that the court

15   may decide.    As opposing counsel mentioned, Congress did

16   that in response to a particular case, the Vacheron

17   case.   Vacheron itself was built on a line of cases

18   holding that the previous section like 411(a) was a

19   jurisdictional limit.

20                 The reason that courts could not consider a

21   copy -- an application for -- a petition for

22   infringement complaint, I'm sorry, from a person who had

23   not yet gotten registration was because they construed

24   that predecessor as jurisdictional and therefore, they

25   had no jurisdiction to hear an infringement claim until


                                       34
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   this person instituted a mandamus suit and got the

 2   certificate from the registrant.

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                I would have thought

 4   that cut against you in the sense that the same

 5   paragraph Congress used the word "jurisdiction," but

 6   they didn't use that in the provision that you are

 7   arguing, does deprive the court of jurisdiction.

 8               MS. JONES MERRITT:             No, Mr. Chief Justice,

 9   because when Congress revised this statute in 1976, it

10   had before it 60 years already of courts construing its

11   language, no action shall be maintained, which was the

12   previous 1909 language as a jurisdictional limit.               There

13   had not been any resistance to that notion.

14               Even courts as early as the 1920s in the

15   Lumiere case, the Second Circuit did not hold there was

16   "jurisdiction," but it held that this provision was

17   unwaiverable.   What the parties want to do here, of

18   course, is to waive the provision.

19               So the language was working quite nicely for

20   Congress.   No action shall be maintained, they switched

21   it to instituted to make clear that they meant at the

22   beginning of the action.        There had been a few parties

23   who had argued during the early 20th century that if

24   they snuck in the door, they could remain inside -- or

25   I'm sorry, once they got inside, they could file the --


                                      35
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   certificate, and the courts rejected that, but Congress

 2   cleared up that particular problem.

 3                So Congress knows that its first sentence is

 4   working quite well.      Congress then adds this second

 5   sentence to -- these, of course, are people working with

 6   the Copyright Office, experts in the area of copyright

 7   law.   Congress adds the second sentence which adds the

 8   small category of cases to the ones that may come before

 9   the court.   And then in the final sentence, Congress

10   gives a clarification about that final group of cases.

11                As Justice Ginsburg said, the -- Congress

12   made clear that when the registrar decides not to appear

13   in these cases, the Court may still go on and has the

14   power to decide these cases.

15                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 It's not -- it's not

16   a very big deal to register your copyright, right?

17                MS. JONES MERRITT:              It is not at all a big

18   deal, Your Honor.     In fact, for freelance writers one

19   may register an entire year's worth of work on a single

20   form for $65.

21                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And -- but -- but

22   doesn't that mean that it would be odd to make

23   jurisdiction over an action for infringement hinge on

24   whether you've, you know, dotted an "I" and crossed a

25   "T"?


                                        36

 1                 MS. JONES MERRITT:            Not at all, Your Honor,

 2   because again, the copyright statute has a different

 3   history than other jurisdictional statutes.                Before

 4   1909, owners of copyright had to dot every "I" and cross

 5   every "T" within a limited period of time.                If they

 6   didn't, they lost their entire ownership in the

 7   copyright.

 8                 What Congress wanted to do in 1909 was to

 9   give copyright owners a longer period of time to comply

10   with some of these formalities.               But, it still wanted to

11   preserve the public interest that registration serves.

12                 We haven't talked yet about the major public

13   interest that Congress had in mind here.                It is

14   ironically the very problem that gave rise to this

15   lawsuit, trying to find the owner's of copyrighted

16   works.

17                 Before using a copyrighted work, any person

18   needs to find the owner to ask permission.                The

19   electronic databases in this case have argued that they

20   are somehow special, that because they need to obtain

21   many permissions, they shouldn't have to do it.

22                 Universities, libraries, archives obtain as

23   many or more permissions as electronic databases in

24   every year.    For large universities like Harvard

25   University or the Ohio State University, we have to

 1   obtain permissions for every article that is distributed

 2   in course packs to our students.

 3                 If one of those articles is a freelance

 4   work, written by Mr. Muchnick, for example, we have to

 5   track him down and get his permission to use that

 6   article.

 7                 So the registration system was Congress's

 8   response to this problem of finding the owners of

 9   copyright.    In this --

10                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Isn't it true, though,

11   that -- that most copyright holders, most people who

12   write articles, freelance articles, even if it's only

13   $65, it's not -- it's not worth it because they really

14   don't expect to get -- they don't think anybody is going

15   to infringe, in the first place, and if they did what

16   establishes to be, just wouldn't be economically

17   worthwhile?    So I think it's a fact that most copyrights

18   are not registered, isn't it?

19                 MS. JONES MERRITT:            The beauty, Your Honor,

20   though, of the solution that Congress adopted with the

21   registration, moving the registration to a

22   jurisdictional element rather than to an element of the

23   claim, as it was in the 19th century, is that the

24   copyright owner may do this any time.                   Copyright lasts,

25   of course, for the lifetime of the owner plus another


                                       38

 1   70 years after death.      Sixty-nine years after my death,

 2   my heirs could register my copyright if they are finding

 3   that somebody is now making a lot of money off of my

 4   works.   And they could then bring an infringement suit

 5   against that person.

 6                It's odd to think of a jurisdictional

 7   restriction as being a looser element than a claim

 8   element, but in this particular story of copyright, it

 9   is.

10                What Congress did was to say, we want people

11   to own copyrights immediately without complying with

12   formality.   And in 1976, Congress even extended that to

13   unpublished works, so I already have a copyright of the

14   notes I have in front of me and in the e-mails I print

15   last night and so forth.

16                What Congress said, with this huge sea of

17   copyrighted works, before somebody can bring an

18   infringement action in the Federal court, we want them

19   to confer a public benefit.           We want them to register

20   the copyright so that other people can find the owner

21   and request permission.

22                What will happen in this case under the

23   terms of this settlement is that the defendant who did

24   not take time to find the owners of these works, even

25   though the owners of these works were easier to find


                                      39
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   than many of the very elusive of works that archives and

 2   historical societies search for, they did not find --

 3   look for the owners because they thought it would be too

 4   difficult.

 5                This settlement now gives the defendants a

 6   perpetual right to use all of those works without ever

 7   identifying the owners, and without the owners ever

 8   being identified on the national copyright register,

 9   which is what Congress wanted.

10                If I want to create a competing database for

11   any of the defendants, I have to undertake the arduous

12   work of tracking down all the owners.

13                JUSTICE BREYER:          Well, there's some that

14   can't be found.   So if we take your position, there's

15   some that can't be found, we just can't create our

16   database.

17                MS. JONES MERRITT:            Justice Breyer --

18                JUSTICE BREYER:          I mean, that's the problem

19   that's underlying the fairness of this thing.

20                MS. JONES MERRITT:            I'm --

21                JUSTICE BREYER:          In terms of if we take your

22   approach, no matter how hard it is to find owners, you

23   are just out of luck.      That is to say, there will not be

24   databases collected, because they cannot be complete

25   because we cannot find the owner.                If we take the

 1   position that it is sometimes waiverable, that obstacle

 2   disappears and now it's a question of the fairness of

 3   the situation.

 4                MS. JONES MERRITT:             Justice Breyer, that

 5   concern exists for everybody, not just for electronic

 6   databases.    In fact, there is -- the copyright --

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:           That's right.       I just

 8   wonder why Congress would have ever wanted this kind of

 9   provision to serve as that kind of obstacle in any area.

10                MS. JONES MERRITT:             Because Congress wants

11   to protect the rights of copyright owners.                 Congress has

12   more than 200 years' experience balancing these two

13   interests.    And, in fact, as we speak, Congress is

14   considering orphan works legislation to address that

15   specific issue.    What Congress has -- and that

16   legislation would apply to all types of works,

17   electronic databases, national archives, historical

18   documentaries.

19                And what Congress is proposing in that

20   legislation is quite illustrative.                 Congress says that

21   if somebody makes a diligent search and cannot find the

22   owner, then the person may use the work --

23                JUSTICE BREYER:           That's the underlying

24   fairness.    There might be -- maybe they will win on

25   that.   I don't know what the merits of that are.                But


                                       41

 1   certainly an absolute bar might sometimes help some

 2   copyright owners, but many times it will hurt them,

 3   because since they can't be found they can't be

 4   compensated.   And if we set up a system and put some

 5   money in it, so if they are ever found they will be

 6   compensated, that will help them.

 7              So that's why I ask the question, why would

 8   a Congress, that wants to help copyright owners create

 9   this kind of system?      When all the things you are

10   talking about can be brought into play when we consider

11   the fairness of the system.

12              MS. JONES MERRITT:              This is a -- the system

13   that Congress put in play is, Your Honor, one in which

14   copyright owners have an absolute right to control the

15   disposition of their works.           That is the current system,

16   even without getting to the jurisdictional issue.

17   Congress may change that disposition, and that is within

18   Congress's control.      What they have been trying to do is

19   to balance the interest of the copyright owner with the

20   interest of the public in using works.                 And that is the

21   perennial challenge in copyright law, how to balance

22   those two interests.

23              Section 411(a) is actually a vital cog as

24   part of that balance, because what Section 411(a) does

25   is it says to the copyright owner don't worry about all

 1   this business of registering or anything else, you have

 2   your copyright, and you will have it for your life plus

 3   70 years.   If it ever becomes important to you to bring

 4   a lawsuit, then you can register at that time, come into

 5   court.   It's a deal that Congress has offered to

 6   copyright owners in order to strike this particular

 7   balance between the public interest and the private

 8   interest.

 9               JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Do they -- if they are

10   just suing, not for money but for an injunction, do they

11   have to register before bringing an injunction suit?

12               MS. JONES MERRITT:               Yes, Your Honor, they

13   do.   In order to bring any action -- if the injunction

14   is based on infringement.           So we're -- if the plaintiff

15   brings an action for infringement and the remedy they

16   seek is an injunction, then the copyright must be

17   registered first.

18               There are some cases in the lower courts in

19   which we have a plaintiff who has a longstanding pattern

20   of infringements that a particular defendant has been

21   engaged in against that plaintiff.                  The Owen Mills case

22   is an example.   A local photography studio was upset

23   because a photo duplicating shop kept copying their

24   copyrighted photographs.          They entered an action for

25   infringement, had registered several of the photographs.

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   The Court issued an injunction that covered future works

 2   as well, but those were all works within the same

 3   judicial controversy.       So an injunction could reach

 4   further than a single registered work as long as we are

 5   talking about one single controversy.

 6              In this case we don't have an injunction, we

 7   have damages, and we have thousands of different

 8   controversies.    As the Court knows the class action

 9   rules do not change the substantive law or the rules of

10   -- of jurisdiction.      We have here thousands of different

11   controversies that have been aggregated for convenience

12   under rule 23(b)(3), but the court must have

13   jurisdiction over each of those controversies.                    Or if we

14   take the alternative route of Hallstrom, the hybrid

15   approach, and we say that this is a mandatory

16   requirement.    Congress has been quite clear about this

17   mandatory requirement, and that mandate must be

18   satisfied with respect to every controversy in this

19   class action.

20              JUSTICE STEVENS:              May I ask -- I just hate

21   to reveal my ignorance on something like this, but I had

22   the same problem with your opponent.                    I really don't

23   understand why it makes any difference whether you call

24   a requirement mandatory or you call it jurisdictional in

25   terms of the fairness of settlement, all the


                                       44

 1   considerations you are discussing.                It seems to me as a

 2   practical matter it doesn't seem to make any difference.

 3              MS. JONES MERRITT:             It depends on the brand

 4   of mandatory, Your Honor.        There are in this case three

 5   different proposals before the Court.                 I, as appointed

 6   amicus I have argued that Section 411(a) is

 7   jurisdictional which I think the clear history and

 8   language of the statute, which I will still come back

 9   to --

10              JUSTICE STEVENS:            But would you not make all

11   the arguments directed at the fairness of the

12   settlements and so forth if it were merely mandatory?

13              MS. JONES MERRITT:             Yes, because then the

14   two versions of mandatory are -- the flavor of mandatory

15   that the Solicitor General urges is that the district --

16   this is very mandatory, as in Hallstrom -- even if a

17   party doesn't raise the issue, the district court sua

18   sponte should raise the issue on its own.

19              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            The -- so mingle -- rule.

20   I think Ms. Anders answered that question.                In this

21   situation it would be appropriate for the judge to

22   accept the waiver.

23              MS. JONES MERRITT:             That was -- that was

24   what Ms. Anders argued.       I disagree with that, because

25   the public interest that Congress has put forth here


                                     45
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   would not be satisfied.       The parties in this case argue

 2   the same public interests that parties argue in every

 3   copyright case.   The plaintiffs in a copyright case

 4   always argue that their interest should be protected

 5   even if they haven't complied with Congress's mandates.

 6   The defendants in a copyright case always argue that

 7   allowing them to copy the plaintiffs' works would give

 8   the public greater access to those works.                    There are no

 9   special public interests here.

10              In fact, the electronic databases in this

11   case have been superseded technologically.

12              JUSTICE GINSBURG:             If we -- if we are

13   talking about the ordinary case, and someone sued for

14   infringement apart from this settlement in the context

15   that we are in, certainly it's not going to raise that

16   question whether it's mandatory, optional or whatever.

17   What defendant who is sued for infringement wouldn't

18   say, judge, I'm relying on 411(a); they haven't

19   registered their copyright; they can't sue me?                    I can't

20   imagine a defendant in an ordinary copyright case who

21   wouldn't raise it.

22              MS. JONES MERRITT:              Actually there are quite

23   a number, Your Honor, just as there are defendants who

24   will waive statutes of limitations.                    There are times

25   when a defendant would rather have the resolution on the


                                      46
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   merits, because that then would not allow the plaintiff

 2   to come back into court and sue again.                  Or the

 3   defendant -- the plaintiff in this case might have sued

 4   -- that you are referring to -- might have sued for

 5   infringement, and the defendant wants to make clear that

 6   it has the right to use this work.                 That would then

 7   establish that principle with this plaintiff with

 8   related works or with other works.

 9                 JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Then let's switch to the

10   plaintiff.    If the plaintiff is in it for money, for

11   real money, for damages, the plaintiff's going to

12   register because then the stakes are such that $65 is

13   well worth it, if the plaintiff thinks it can get a

14   large infringement award.

15                 MS. JONES MERRITT:            The problem, Your Honor,

16   is that there are many naive people who believe that

17   famous movies and novels have infringed their freshman

18   college essays.    There are cases exactly like that in

19   the courts.    And in fact the case I cite in the brief is

20   one in which the author sued the university, claiming

21   that the department of English obviously had released

22   his freshman essay to Hollywood, because this movie

23   built upon his fresh man essay.

24                 In those cases, and this is another

25   distinction, Justice Stevens, between mandatory and


                                       47
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   jurisdictional, the defendant doesn't even have to

 2   appear.     The district court can sua sponte dismiss the

 3   complaint for lack of jurisdiction.                      We cite I believe

 4   seven or eight cases in the brief where exactly that

 5   happened, including two different cases --

 6                 JUSTICE BREYER:           They wouldn't waive it

 7   then.     I mean, the problem, I take it, realistically is

 8   this:     let's take a group of people who want to make

 9   databases; now they want to use copyrighted material.

10   There is a subset of people who have written it they

11   can't find, so they say here's what we will do.                     We will

12   take $100 billion, and we will put it in a fund, and

13   like ASCAP, that fund can administer this money for the

14   benefit of anyone who turns up.

15                 Now, maybe that's illegal under some law.

16   Maybe the class isn't right.              Maybe they can't get

17   proper representation.         Maybe it's inadequate, et

18   cetera.    But what I don't fail to see -- what I fail to

19   see, is how -- whether you could do that or not do it

20   has anything to do with registration, because we are

21   talking about the people who aren't here, all of whom,

22   if you ever bring suit when he's found, will register

23   the copyright.    The only reason they haven't registered,

24   we don't know who they are, that's why.                     Maybe they have

25   registered, for all we know.

 1              MS. JONES MERRITT:              All of the people who

 2   haven't registered yet, Your Honor, will not be able to

 3   bring suit, because the class action will extinguish

 4   their claims.   That's the important --

 5              JUSTICE BREYER:            Maybe they can't do that

 6   because it would be an unfair result.                  But where is it

 7   in this provision of law that's designed to stop that

 8   ever from happening?

 9              MS. JONES MERRITT:              This provision, if we go

10   back to section --

11              JUSTICE BREYER:            Maybe it won't, by the way.

12              MS. JONES MERRITT:              Right.

13              JUSTICE BREYER:            It depends on what the

14   terms of the settlement are.            We could have a subclass

15   that allows a subset of those people to come into court.

16   No reason you couldn't.       So I don't know whether or not

17   it's true that they won't register when they are found.

18              MS. JONES MERRITT:              Justice Breyer, once

19   again the Copyright Act itself already makes that choice

20   that no person may -- and I'm not talking yet even about

21   the jurisdictional provision -- no person may use

22   another's copyrighted work without their permission.

23              JUSTICE BREYER:            In 1909 Congress thought

24   all this through with the databases and so forth?

 2   issue -- sometime -- sometimes -- in 1976, by the way,

 3   Congress did because LEXIS and Westlaw existed before

 4   1976.   The -- but the databases are a red herring here.

 5               Sometimes, technology is different, and,

 6   sometimes, it's not.     The Library of Congress recently

 7   did a project in which they sought 7,000 permissions for

 8   a single project because they were digitizing the

 9   letters of Hannah Arendt.

10               They sought those permissions.              They -- if

11   they could not get permission, if they couldn't find the

12   author or if they didn't get an okay from the author,

13   they had to leave the work off of the web site because

14   they are following copyright law.

15               They have a copy of the original work that

16   was given to them or that they purchased, and they may

17   display that, but, if they are going to make a copy of

18   the work, then they have to comply by copyright law.

19               I mentioned a moment ago that the databases

20   here have been superseded by technology, and that is

21   another way in which technology is not -- is not

22   different in this case.       It is now possible for works to

23   be scanned in photographic form or PDF form and put in

24   to electronic databases that are fully searchable, and

25   that does not violate copyright law.

 2   articles on --

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:              But why doesn't it?             Just

 4   out of curiosity.     You are making a --

 5              MS. JONES MERRITT:                Because it is -- it is

 6   part of the original collection -- I'm sorry.                        If the --

 7   if the publisher of the collected work consents to that.

 8   I am thinking of this case in The New York Times --

 9              JUSTICE BREYER:              Well, you say if somebody

10   who owns the copyright.

11              MS. JONES MERRITT:                Yes.         But who owns --

12              JUSTICE BREYER:              Yes.       No.      No.    But what we

13   want to do is we want to have, in our database, all of

14   the material written about slavery, and, lo and behold,

15   there are 4,000 books that we can't trace.                        Who, now,

16   owns the copyright 100 years later?                      And there is no way

17   to get those into our database.                Whether --

18              MS. JONES MERRITT:                That's correct.           That is

19   correct.

20              JUSTICE BREYER:              All right.           Now, that's a

21   sort of loss, and my same point, that maybe that's as it

22   should be, but it's rather surprising that this law is

23   the law that will answer that question.

24              MS. JONES MERRITT:                This law relates to the

25   question, Your Honor, because this law relates to the


                                        51

 1   access to the Court.

 2              The way it relates to the question is that

 3   what Congress was trying to do was to give people like

 4   you and me information about those copyright owners, so

 5   that we could find the owner of the book on slavery.

 6              And, as a way to maintain that register,

 7   which Congress started in 1790, it said, to the authors

 8   of copyrighted works, if you want to use our courts, the

 9   judicial powers of the United States, you need to confer

10   this benefit, so that Justice Breyer could find you, if

11   he wants to include your work in the database.             And that

12   was the story that Congress did.

13              I would like to say just one more word about

14   the word "jurisdiction" in the third line of Section

15   411(a) because we were interrupted there.             The parties

16   have offered no convincing explanation for that word,

17   other than to show that Congress understood this whole

18   provision was jurisdictional.

19              It refers, most immediately, to

20   registrability, but that was not a new issue in 1976.

21   Courts have always decided registrability.             And, as the

22   rules of civil procedure make clear to us, a party's

23   absence never deprives a court of subject matter

24   jurisdiction.

25              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            So the rulemakers got it


                                     52
                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   wrong in Form 19, when they did not write 411(a) as

 2   jurisdictional.   They say copy the 1331, 1338, that is

 3   jurisdictional, and then they put the certificate

 4   requirement below the line -- below the jurisdictional

 5   line.

 6               So that was -- well, that was wrong, in your

 7   judgment.

 8               MS. JONES MERRITT:             As the -- as the

 9   Congress made -- I'm sorry, as the Court made clear, in

10   issuing those forms, they are advisory only, and they

11   are not -- they are not intended to give legal advice to

12   counsel about what the issues in the case are.

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:            I suppose, if you picked

14   up any copyright complaint, you will see the

15   jurisdictional allegation will say 1331, 1338, and

16   nothing about 411.

17               MS. JONES MERRITT:             And that is quite

18   common, Your Honor, because, in many situations, what

19   Congress has done is given a general grant of

20   jurisdiction in 1331 or 1338 and then pulled it back for

21   a subcategory of cases, which is what 411(a) does.

22               In those circumstances, not just in

23   copyright, but in all sorts of areas, the complaint will

24   plead jurisdiction under the general grant and then may

25   show that it satisfies the condition later.

 1                 This is -- we are not arguing that -- and

 2   the Second Circuit has not argued that 411(a) is a

 3   jurisdictional grant.       It is a section that takes back

 4   part of the jurisdictional grant in 1331 and 1338.

 5                 Congress has more than 200 years' experience

 6   working with copyright law, as the questions today have

 7   revealed -- I'm sorry.

 8                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Finish your

 9   sentence.

10                 MS. JONES MERRITT:            And the questions today

11   have revealed striking the balance between the public

12   and the private interest is a difficult one.

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Thank you, counsel.

14                 MS. JONES MERRITT:            Thank you very much.

15                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               Mr. Sims, you have

16   two minutes remaining.

17                 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S. SIMS

18                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

19                 MR. SIMS:     Thank you, Your Honor.

20                 I, first, want to correct the misimpression

21   given that the databases think they are special.                 The

22   databases haven't thought they don't need to get

23   permission.    They thought they had permission under

24   Section 201(c), and this Court had the case and

25   decided -- two of you believed we were right, and more


                                       54
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   of you believed we were wrong, but the databases took no

 2   position that they had no obligation.

 3                They got the rights by contract from the

 4   publishers, with representations and warranties, and

 5   that's why, when this case was instituted, they went to

 6   mediation.   They resolved this in a way.                 They got money

 7   from the publishers, who were exposed under

 8   representations and warranties.

 9                The authors were represented by the three

10   major national freelance author groups in the country,

11   and this was a way, we thought, to address this problem

12   responsibly and without taking the Court's time.

13                Now, Mr. Chief Justice Roberts, you said a

14   couple of times that you wonder whether the language

15   here, "No action shall be instituted," doesn't sound

16   jurisdictional, and exactly to the contrary, the Court's

17   decision of Jones v. Bock, which, I think -- if I am

18   remembering, you authored, but, in any event, it was

19   within a year or two, said that was boilerplate language

20   used all the time for statutes of limitations that are

21   not jurisdictional.      And, indeed, that is correct.

22                In the footnote of our reply brief, we list

23   three times in the 19th century when that very language

24   was used for statutes of limitations.                  And, if you put

25   it into LEXIS or Westlaw, you will get a zillion


                                      55
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   statutes with respect to -- exhaust nonjurisdictional

 2   statutes.

 3               So I think, quite to the contrary, that --

 4   that is the language Congress uses when it wants

 5   something to be not jurisdictional.

 6               Now, Ms. Merritt began with the word

 7   "shall," in 411(a).      I want to be clear.             This case was

 8   instituted in compliance with 411(a).                 The named

 9   plaintiffs registered their works and came into court.

10   It went to mediation, and the next thing the court knew,

11   it had a settlement agreement to review, and it did

12   review under Rule 23.

13               She relies on the Hallstrom case, but, of

14   course, the Hallstrom case, which did avoid saying

15   whether it was mandatory or jurisdictional, involved the

16   enforcement of a mandatory -- at least mandatory rule,

17   on the application of a party, and that's what the Court

18   does, and that's why, to some extent, other than with

19   respect to settlement agreements, this case doesn't

20   matter a lot because the defendants will always be

21   raising this defense.

22               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you, counsel.

23               Ms. Merritt, you were appointed by this

24   Court as an amicus to defend the judgment below, and you

25   have ably discharged that responsibility.
