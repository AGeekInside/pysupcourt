 3                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Case 10-1542, Holder v. Gutierrez,

 5   and the consolidated case.

 6                  Ms. Kruger.

 7              ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONDRA R. KRUGER

 8                     ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9                  MS. KRUGER:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11                  Under section 1229b of Title 8, an alien who

12   has not been a lawful permanent resident for at least 5

13   years, or who has not continuously resided in the United

14   States for at least 7 years following admission in any

15   status, is not eligible for cancellation of removal

16   under the first prong of the statute.                That is true

17   regardless of whether the alien can show that his

18   parents, or any other third party, for that matter, did

19   satisfy those requirements.

20                  The Ninth Circuit, alone among the courts of

21   appeals, has recognized a rule of imputed eligibility

22   under section 1229b(a).        That rule is wrong for at least

23   two reasons.    First of all, it is inconsistent with the

24   plain text of the statute.

25                  The touchstones of eligibility under section


                                       4

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   1229b(a), LPR status, admission, and residence, are all

 2   terms that are defined in the INA to refer to attributes

 3   that are individual to the alien seeking relief,

 4   attributes that cannot be satisfied by a third party.

 5                  But even if the statute were thought to be

 6   ambiguous with respect to this question, the Board of

 7   Immigration Appeals has interpreted the statute to mean

 8   that the alien seeking relief must personally and

 9   actually satisfy both durational requirements.           That

10   interpretation is at the very least a reasonable reading

11   of the statute, if not the only reasonable reading of

12   the statute.

13                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         But did it make that

14   determination as a legal matter or as an exercise of its

15   discretion?    As I read its opinion, it felt that it had

16   to come to that conclusion as a matter of law.

17                  MS. KRUGER:     I think --

18                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         If we were to find the

19   statute ambiguous, where has it explained its policy

20   decisions independent of its legal conclusions?

21                  MS. KRUGER:     First of all, Justice

22   Sotomayor, we don't think the statute is ambiguous; and

23   so, we don't think there's any reason to go to Chevron

24   step two in this case.

25                  But if you look at the Board's decision in


                                       5

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   Escobar in particular, I think the Board makes clear


 2   that, although it thought the statutory language was


 3   clear, it also rested its decision on other


 4   considerations that are uniquely within the Board's


 5   expertise.    It discussed how the imputation rule

 6   comports with the general policies of the statute, how

 7   it comports with the rule that the Board itself has

 8   recognized over time, that LPR status is something

 9   that's individual to a particular alien, and that the

10   alien seeking relief has to individually, both

11   procedurally and substantively, satisfy the eligibility

12   requirements.

13                 And it also noted that the imputation rule

14   would create significant holes in the statutory scheme.

15   It would mean that an individual who may not even have

16   been eligible for admission to the United States or

17   lawful admission for permanent residence would

18   nevertheless receive a significant benefit that goes

19   along with that status.

20                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              You say that you

21   think the statute is unambiguous, but it -- it doesn't

22   address issues of imputation at all, does it?

23                 MS. KRUGER:     It does not address issues of

24   imputation.

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well, if it doesn't


                                      6

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   even address it, it seems to me the best you can say is

 2   that it's ambiguous.

 3                  MS. KRUGER:     Well, I don't think that a

 4   statute, as this Court has recognized, has to address

 5   every conceivable possibility in order to be

 6   unambiguous.    And this statute, I think, is unambiguous

 7   in that it refers to eligibility requirements that are

 8   by their nature, as defined in immigration law,

 9   individual to a specific alien.            There's --

10                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:          What about -- there

11   was -- wasn't there in the prior law a child domicile --

12   a child was able to satisfy the 7-year requirement based

13   on the parent's domicile, which was deemed to be the

14   child's?

15                  MS. KRUGER:     Right.       There -- the

16   Respondents relied very heavily on three court of

17   appeals cases that had interpreted the predecessor to

18   this statute, former section 212(c), to allow imputation

19   of a parent's domicile to a child.                 Those courts relied

20   on the common law rule that a child's domicile follows

21   that of his parents.      And applying that rule, they

22   allowed children to rely on their parents' domicile in

23   the United States to satisfy the 7-year lawful

24   unrelinquished domicile requirement in that statute.

25                  JUSTICE SCALIA:         I guess a child doesn't


                                       7

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   have any domicile except the parents'; right?          Children

 2   who run away from home do not acquire new domiciles, do

 3   they?

 4               MS. KRUGER:     Under this Court's decision in

 5   Holyfield, the common law rule is that the child's

 6   domicile is determined by that of his parents,

 7   regardless of where the child resides in fact.          When

 8   Congress repealed former section 212(c) and enacted the

 9   current cancellation of removal statute, it removed any

10   reference to the word "domicile," instead replacing the

11   requirement of 7 years unrelinquished domicile with two

12   durational requirements that are at issue in this case.

13               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Is that change alone

14   sufficient for us to say that this is -- was a clear

15   indication by the Congress of an intent or purpose to

16   alter the imputation rule?

17               MS. KRUGER:     I think if this Court is

18   willing to presume along with Respondents that Congress

19   would have been aware of these three court of appeals

20   decisions that were issued, it should be noted, very

21   late in the life of a provision that had existed in more

22   or less the same form since the Immigration Act of 1917,

23   then the Court also must presume that Congress was aware

24   that the basis for those decisions was the common law

25   definition of the term "domicile" and that Congress


                                    8

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   meant what it did when it replaced "domicile" with three

 2   eligibility criteria that are defined terms in the

 3   immigration law and all of which refer to attributes

 4   that are individual to a specific alien.

 5                  JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Does a child who is not

 6   emancipated have the capacity to independently establish

 7   a residence?

 8                  MS. KRUGER:     Under the -- how the INA

 9   defines the term "residence" is an actual principal

10   dwelling in fact.    So, yes, a child will dwell somewhere

11   in fact and can do so independent of a parent.             That is

12   in marked contrast to the common law rule of domicile

13   that this Court explained at length in its Holyfield

14   decision and that the courts of appeals applied in

15   interpreting former section 212(c).

16                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Can a parent ask for a

17   permanent resident status for a 5-year-old child?

18                  MS. KRUGER:     Yes, a parent could.

19                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           So, if you have two cases,

20   one -- two 5-year-olds.        One, as in this case, lives

21   with the parent, but the application has not been

22   granted or not been filed; and the other, the

23   application has been granted.             And they're treated --

24   they're treated differently?

25                  MS. KRUGER:     I think that's right,


                                       9

 1   Justice Kennedy.    And I think that that is a necessary

 2   corollary of the way the immigration system is

 3   constructed.    As a general rule, LPR status and

 4   admission are criteria that are individual to a

 5   particular alien.    To be sure, minor children of lawful

 6   permanent residents receive a high preference in the

 7   immigration visa system.

 8                  But there's no rule that says that children

 9   automatically receive the same legal status as their

10   lawful permanent resident parents.

11                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         Assuming we don't accept

12   Respondents' -- what appears to be their argument, that

13   being an LPR is not a requirement of the statute, if we

14   assume that being an LPR is what triggers the

15   availability for the Attorney General's exercise of

16   discretion, how does that -- how does the imputation

17   rule harm the statute?       The child has lived with the

18   parents for 5 years, whether before or after -- well,

19   after, it wouldn't be an issue, but before the grant of

20   LPR status.    How does that harm the purposes of the

21   statute?

22                  I thought the idea of the statute was to

23   give individuals who had ties to the United States an

24   opportunity to stay.      If a child's been with their

25   parents for 5, 10, 15 years, what sense does it make to


                                      10

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   deprive them of the Attorney General's exercise of

 2   discretion merely because the administrative process has

 3   taken too long to give them something which they're

 4   going to get and which they've gotten?

 5                MS. KRUGER:     I think it's worth separating

 6   out two different components of the cancellation of

 7   removal decision.   It is certainly true that it's an

 8   important criteria, in determining whether or not an

 9   individual is entitled as a matter of discretion to

10   cancellation of removal relief, how strong their ties

11   are to the United States, what their family ties are and

12   so on.   But it has never been thought that particularly

13   compelling reasons for the exercise of discretion can

14   overcome the plain threshold requirements for

15   eligibility for the exercise of discretion under 1229b.

16                The difficulty with the imputation rule that

17   the Ninth Circuit has recognized is that it undermines

18   the plain requirements for those threshold

19   determinations of eligibility, conferring an important

20   benefit that goes along with long-time permanent

21   resident status and long-time continuous residence after

22   admission on individuals who not only did not receive

23   the necessary formal authorization from immigration

24   officials at the requisite time; they may not even have

25   been eligible to receive those authorizations.


                                    11

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1                I think it's also worth noting that this

 2   statute is not the beginning and the end of discretion

 3   in the immigration system.        It is always true, and it is

 4   -- certainly was the case when Congress enacted the

 5   statute in 1996, that immigration officials have the

 6   discretion not to bring removal proceedings in the first

 7   place, to terminate removal proceedings once they have

 8   begun, to defer action on the execution of a removal

 9   order.   And current immigration and customs enforcement

10   guidance makes clear that a minor receives particular

11   consideration within the totality of the circumstances

12   in determining whether or not prosecutorial discretion

13   is something that should be exercised.

14                JUSTICE BREYER:         So, how does it work?   I'm

15   -- how does it work?    Two legal permanent residents, a

16   man and his wife, happen to show up in New York, and

17   they have a 6-month-old child.          All right.   What's the

18   legal -- why doesn't the INS just take the child, ship

19   him off?   I mean there -- is it just discretion?          Or is

20   there some rule of law or regulation that prevents that

21   from happening?

22                MS. KRUGER:     It will depend on the

23   individual circumstances.

24                JUSTICE BREYER:         Well, no.   I've given you

25   the hypothetical.   I mean, there we are.

 2                JUSTICE BREYER:          That's all you know.


 3                MS. KRUGER:      So, Congress has taken some


 4   steps with respect to some subset of aliens.


 5   Respondent, for example, brings up the LIFE Act, and

 6   that is an example of where Congress has taken a step

 7   to --

 8                JUSTICE BREYER:          I'm not asking for that.

 9   I'm saying, what in the law -- that's all you know.              All

10   right?   There are -- you know the hypothetical.

11                I want -- one possible thing to say would be

12   that child is -- is actually -- we are imputing that

13   he's here for lawful permanent residence, too.            Every

14   circuit had had some kind of imputation rule, and

15   moreover there are other areas of law where I have found

16   imputation rules in the immigration law.            Roughly, I

17   have three or four cases on that.            But they're --

18   they're not exactly comparable.

19                Okay.   So, I just want to know what is it

20   that prevents you from taking the child and shipping him

21   off to China if we don't impute?

22                MS. KRUGER:      Well, I think the answer is

23   certainly not that we impute the admission of the -- as

 1   know the question.    I just want your best effort --

 2                MS. KRUGER:      So, if there --

 3                JUSTICE BREYER:          -- to give an answer.        Or

 4   I'm thinking that your answer is there is nothing; it's

 5   either imputation or nothing.

 6                MS. KRUGER:      Well, I think that that's --

 7                JUSTICE BREYER:          And you don't want me to

 8   reach that conclusion.

 9                MS. KRUGER:      No, I think that that's

10   incorrect.   There are certain provisions of law that

11   would allow for the child to be admitted but on an

12   independent basis from the parents.               If a child is not

13   admissible --

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           If the supposition -- if

15   the supposition is that the parents -- I think

16   Justice Breyer's supposition was that both parents were

17   LPRs.   The likelihood of the 6-month-old child being

18   born in the United States and therefore being a citizen

19   would be rather large.

20                MS. KRUGER:      Well, that's certainly right.

21   It is also true that --

22                JUSTICE BREYER:          No, no.      That isn't my

23   hypothetical.

24                (Laughter.)

25                MS. KRUGER:      Right.      The child in your

 1   hypothetical -- the child is not born in the United

 2   States, right?

 3                 If the child does not independently satisfy

 4   the criteria for admissibility, then the child has

 5   entered the United States illegally and remains here at

 6   the discretion of immigration officials.

 7                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         I suppose if they come with

 8   somebody else's 6-month-old child, they'd have to send

 9   that child back to China, too, wouldn't they?

10                 MS. KRUGER:     Well --

11                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Which would be very sad,

12   but that would be the law, right?

13                 MS. KRUGER:     Well --

14                 JUSTICE BREYER:         Actually they came from

15   Italy, in my hypothetical.

16                 (Laughter.)

17                 MS. KRUGER:     I mean, I think that

18   Martinez --

19                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         They should not have sent

20   him back to China, then.       Why did they do that?

21                 (Laughter.)

22                 MS. KRUGER:     I think that Martinez

23   Gutierrez's situation, I think, is a good example of

24   this.   He entered the United States illegally with the

25   -- with his parents and remained here illegally until he

 1   was admitted as an LPR at the age of 19 as an adult.

 2   Until that time, there were no efforts to remove him

 3   from the United States, and I think that that's fairly

 4   typical, but that's not because his parents' admission

 5   or their lawful status in the United States was imputed

 6   to Martinez Gutierrez, and there is no background

 7   principle in the law that would allow for such

 8   imputation of an individual formal authorization to

 9   remain in the country by immigration officials to be

10   imputed from one to another.

11               Rather, the immigration system sets up a

12   system in which a lawful permanent resident parent can

13   seek to -- to petition for an immigration visa on behalf

14   of a child and facilitate that child's eventual

15   adjustment to lawful permanent resident status, but it's

16   not something happens automatically.            It's something

17   that happens through a regular, orderly process.

18               JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Can you give me an example

19   of an instance in which a child who is the child of two

20   lawful permanent residents cannot get lawful permanent

21   resident status for himself at the age of 8, but that he

22   can at the age of 15?    I mean, what commonly happens

23   between that period that would make him ineligible --

24   eligible only when he is 15, other than just as a matter

25   of providing all the documents?


                                   16

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1                 MS. KRUGER:     That would make him ineligible

 2   at the age of 15?

 3                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, you -- the whole

 4   point here is that some children are given lawful

 5   permanent resident status and -- and some are not.            But

 6   I'm asking, does the passage of time, assuming two

 7   lawful resident parents, ever make it so that a child

 8   who was formerly ineligible is now eligible?            He was

 9   ineligible at 5, but he's eligible at 14?            I mean, how

10   does that work?

11                 MS. KRUGER:     I think the most common

12   scenario is one in which a visa number doesn't become

13   available until the child is -- is --

14                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Oh, I don't mean a visa

15   number.    But nothing -- nothing with -- with respect to

16   the child's real status other than his -- where he is on

17   the queue in the immigration department?

18                 MS. KRUGER:     That would be the most common

19   scenario, is -- is where the child is in the queue.               And

20   I think Respondents place a great deal of emphasis on

21   the amount of time it takes for visa numbers to become

22   available for both children and spouses of lawful

23   permanent residents, but that has been a regular and

24   acknowledged feature of the immigration system for

25   decades.

 1                  The Congress that enacted IIRIRA in 1996 was

 2   well aware of the waiting times for these visa numbers.

 3   It had before it proposals for reducing the backlog, and

 4   it rejected those proposals.              It enacted in the

 5   cancellation of removal statute two eligibility criteria

 6   that do not turn on potential eligibility for receiving

 7   LPR status or admission to the United States but,

 8   instead, turn on actually having received that formal

 9   authorization from immigration officials.

10                  And I think that the best inference that we

11   can draw from the statutory language is that Congress

12   meant what it said; it attached special significance to

13   that formal authorization, the formal exercise of

14   authority by immigration officials, and not simply the

15   potential for that exercise in the future.

16                  JUSTICE KAGAN:       Ms. Kruger, you take a

17   statute that doesn't say anything about imputation one

18   way or the other, and you say that statute can still be

19   unambiguous.    And that would I think be true as a

20   general matter.    But now you add to that statute a

21   history and a tradition and a practice in immigration

22   law of imputation of various kinds.                One is imputation

23   of domicile in the way we talked about, but there are

24   other imputations that occur throughout the field of

25   immigration law.    Some cut for the alien; some cut


                                      18

 1   against the alien.

 2                In the world of that practice and tradition,

 3   are you at least in a sphere in which there's ambiguity,

 4   in which the agency essentially has discretion to decide

 5   whether it wants to impute in this way?

 6                MS. KRUGER:      I think the answer is "no,"

 7   Justice Kagan, because the other circumstances in which

 8   imputation had been allowed under the immigration laws

 9   differ in very important respects from the imputation --

10                JUSTICE KAGAN:        But none of them are

11   textually commanded; is that right?               I mean, the --

12   they're all situations in which the agency has decided

13   that there are good reasons to impute various factors.

14                MS. KRUGER:      Well, I don't think that the

15   only reason that the agency has allowed for imputation

16   is that there is good reason as a general policy matter.

17                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Counsel, I can't hear you

18   very well.   Would you --

19                MS. KRUGER:      Certainly.

20                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Can you crank up the thing

21   or something?

22                MS. KRUGER:      I will.

23                JUSTICE SCALIA:          Thank you.

24                MS. KRUGER:      I'll try to speak more directly

25   into the microphone.

 1                 The reason the -- the agency has allowed for

 2   imputation in other circumstances is with respect to

 3   certain inquiries that involve an inquiry into the

 4   alien's intent.   So, for example, the Board has allowed

 5   for imputation under section 1182(k), which provides for

 6   -- for discretionary relief from the Attorney General

 7   when an immigrant did not know or could not have known

 8   that they were inadmissible.             And the Board has said

 9   that, for those purposes, the parents' knowledge of

10   inadmissibility is imputed to the minor child.             So, too,

11   in the context of abandonment of LPR status.             The Board

12   has said --

13                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Excuse me.    That first one

14   usually cuts against the immigrant, I would assume.               So,

15   if the parents knew, the child knows, and the child

16   normally would not know, right?

17                 MS. KRUGER:     Well, that's correct.

18                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Yes.

19                 MS. KRUGER:     That's correct.        But I think

20   the critical point is that the agency has interpreted

21   imputation of intent, of state of mind, to be

22   permissible, in part for the same reason that the common

23   law rule about domicile formed, which is that --

24                 JUSTICE KAGAN:       So, you think that all the

25   imputations that exist in immigration law are all a


                                     20

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   matter of imputing intent?

 2               MS. KRUGER:       I think that that's -- all of

 3   the imputations that Respondents have pointed to concern

 4   state of mind type requirements.            They don't concern

 5   formal authorizations by immigration officials.            The

 6   Board, I think, has been very consistent, certainly in

 7   the context of cancellation of removal, in not imputing

 8   the legal status of being an LPR or admission from

 9   parent to child.    And it's difficult to see any other

10   examples in which such imputation would be permissible,

11   in part because the background presumption of the

12   immigration law is that those are both attributes that

13   have to be individually achieved and the eligibility

14   criteria have to be independently satisfied by each

15   individual alien.

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So, why is a parent's

17   fraudulent conduct imputed to a child?            There's no

18   intent there.   The child obviously doesn't have an

19   intent or couldn't have an intent to commit a crime.

20   So, why is that imputed by the BIA?

21               MS. KRUGER:       Well, I don't --

22               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Other than that it's a

23   holding against the immigrant, which your adversary

24   points out is not a very favorable outlook for the

25   agency, that it only imputes when it harms the


                                     21

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   immigrant.   But, putting that aside, there's no intent

 2   involved in the fraud.      It's just the commission of an

 3   act.

 4                MS. KRUGER:      Well, I think that where the

 5   imputation has come in, in the Board's analysis, is with

 6   respect to the state of mind and not with respect to the

 7   objective conduct.

 8                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          What's the state of mind

 9   of committing an act, like a fraudulent act?

10                MS. KRUGER:      It's -- I think where this has

11   come up is in the context of knowing that the -- that

12   the alien is not in fact admissible to the United

13   States, is generally where it's come up.          I'm not --

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          The child doesn't commit

15   a fraudulent act.

16                MS. KRUGER:      But, again, I think that the

17   principle that the Board has applied is that, because

18   the child is presumed not capable of forming a requisite

19   intent, the parent's intent is imputed to the child.

20                But I think for present purposes the

21   critical point is, even in that context, what is being

22   imputed is not a formal status conferred on an

23   individual alien by immigration officials, or admission,

24   a formal authorization to enter the country.          That is,

25   again, conferred on an individual basis by immigration


                                     22

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   officials.   I think Respondents can identify no

 2   circumstance, no precedent, for that type of imputation,

 3   and it's one that would be inconsistent with the basic

 4   structure of the immigration system.

 5                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           They do say --

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It's a little odd that the

 7   domicile is the more exacting of the two requirements,

 8   and yet the Congress allowed imputation in the domicile

 9   case but not -- not in the residence case.           It seems

10   almost backward.

11                MS. KRUGER:     Well, to be --

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Congress enacts a more

13   forgiving and less exacting standard, but then takes

14   away the imputation.

15                MS. KRUGER:     Well, to be clear,

16   Justice Kennedy, Congress did not supply a definition of

17   the term "domicile."    And so, the court of appeals

18   opinions that Respondents are relying on followed the

19   common law rule that says that a child's domicile

20   follows that of his parents, but those courts applied

21   that rule in very different ways.

22                Two courts of appeals permitted children to

23   benefit from the domicile of their parents in the United

24   States even when they were not even physically present

25   in the United States for the full 7-year period; whereas


                                    23

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   the Ninth Circuit, for its part, applied that rule only

 2   where the alien child had been -- had entered the United

 3   States lawfully with his parents, according to the Ninth

 4   Circuit, remains lawfully in the United States

 5   thereafter, and simply had become an LPR outside of the

 6   full 7-year period.

 7               In crafting the current cancellation of

 8   removal statute, there's no reason to believe that

 9   Congress was aware of these three court of appeals

10   opinions that were, again, decided very late in the life

11   of former section 212(c).         But even if it had been aware

12   of those decisions, it also would have been aware that

13   by using defined terms in the INA that are defined in a

14   way that's individual to the particular alien, it was

15   eliminating any reference to the common law rule.

16               Unlike domicile, there is no rule that says

17   that a child's LPR status follows that of his parents or

18   that a child's admission follows that of its parents.

19               JUSTICE BREYER:            I don't see how -- were you

20   finished?

21               MS. KRUGER:        Yes.

22               JUSTICE BREYER:            I don't see how the -- you

23   can read the Lepe-Guitron -- that was one of the cases

24   -- it seems to me clearly imputes residence as well.

25   They quote the earlier case from the circuit which said


                                      24

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the 7 years of domicile have to come after their

 2   admission for permanent residence.               And then the dissent

 3   says, hey, what about permanent residents?              And what

 4   they say is this case is different because, in that

 5   earlier case, the parents had never been admitted.              He

 6   came after he was married in this case.              He's here after

 7   his parents were admitted.        Now, I grant you they didn't

 8   explicitly say this, but I don't see how they reached

 9   their conclusion without it.

10               And then there's a different split in the

11   circuits about the pro and con of tacking on periods,

12   you know, before the domicile, after, et cetera.              And

13   that seems to be what Congress resolved.

14               So, I think if you're talking about what was

15   the law, the law was you did impute with -- you did

16   impute for residence.     And then Congress sort of just

17   doesn't deal with that and deals with a slightly

18   different thing.   Is that a fair reading, or what do you

19   think?

20               MS. KRUGER:      I don't think it is, but first

21   I'd like to clarify that the Ninth Circuit had no reason

22   to impute residence in Lepe-Guitron, in part because the

23   alien in that case had resided in fact in the United

24   States throughout the 7-year period.              I think

 1   fact imputing LPR status, as opposed to residence in


 2   fact.


 3               But I think that that is an incorrect


 4   reading of the Ninth Circuit's decision as well, and


 5   that's for the following reason:          All three courts of

 6   appeals that Respondents rely on dealt separately with

 7   the threshold requirement under former section 212(c)

 8   that the alien be a lawful permanent resident.          None of

 9   those three courts permitted LPR status to be imputed

10   from parent to child.    So, where there was an explicit

11   requirement in the statute that LPR status be obtained

12   by the alien seeking relief, the courts were very clear

13   in requiring that the alien before them independently

14   satisfied that requirement.

15               In Lepe-Guitron, the Ninth Circuit

16   acknowledged that, under circuit precedent, it had held

17   that domicile requires an intent to remain permanently

18   in the United States lawfully and said that that meant

19   that the alien had to be in LPR status.          Lepe-Guitron

20   said that with respect to children, that intent to

21   remain in the United States lawfully need not be an LPR

22   status so long as their parents were lawfully domiciled

23   in the United States.

24               If the Court has no further questions, I'd

25   like to reserve the balance of my time.

 3            ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. KINNAIRD

 4               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN

 5                             NO. 10-1542

 6               MR. KINNAIRD:       Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 7   please the Court:

 8               Children present special problems under the

 9   immigration laws, and, as discussed, both the courts and

10   the agency in various contexts have resorted to

11   imputation to cure those problems.               And here the -- the

12   statute is silent as to imputation, and ambiguity arises

13   as applied to the special circumstance of children who

14   were minors during the years in question.

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               I don't know

16   whether -- I'm having trouble applying the concepts of

17   unambiguous and ambiguous in this situation.               As far as

18   I can tell, this is something that the statute just

19   doesn't deal with, and I don't know that you

20   characterize that correctly as ambiguous.               It's just

21   kind of off the table.

22               MR. KINNAIRD:       I think it's ambiguous as

23   applied to this specific circumstance.               And the

24   ambiguity arises because the requirements for which

25   there is imputation, status and residency, are matters


                                    27

 1   that are not within the capacity or the control of a

 2   minor.   A minor does not decide whether or when a parent

 3   will apply for LPR status for him or her.             He does not

 4   control the -- the maintenance of that status over a

 5   period of years, and he also does not control where he

 6   resides.

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Well, can you give any

 8   example -- the Government says you can't -- of an

 9   instance where status is imputed, not intent, but just

10   status; where the status that the parents have is

11   automatically given to the child or, for that matter,

12   automatically taken away from the child?

13                MR. KINNAIRD:      Section 212(c) imputed

14   status, as the Ninth Circuit found.              The reason was that

15   the requirement there was not just for unrelinquished

16   domicile but lawful unrelinquished domicile, and,

17   therefore, they had to reach back to the period in which

18   the parent was an LPR --

19                JUSTICE SCALIA:         But there -- there, you --

20   what they're imputing is the intent to remain in the

21   place, right?   And that's -- that's an -- that's intent.

22   That's imputing intent.

23                MR. KINNAIRD:      No, they also had to impute

24   lawfulness, which meant that the parent had to be an LPR

25   for that period or at least in some lawful status.             And


                                    28

 1   in each of the three instances, the parents were LPRs in

 2   the times in question.    So, there definitely was a

 3   foregoing rule of imputation of status.          And I would

 4   submit that --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:         And the child would not

 6   have been lawfully there but for the imputation of

 7   lawfulness from the parents.

 8               MR. KINNAIRD:      That's right.      He -- well, he

 9   would not have qualified for -- for a waiver of removal.

10               JUSTICE KAGAN:       Mr. Kinnaird, I take it that

11   the point you're making is the statute is ambiguous in

12   the sense that its silence does not prevent the BIA from

13   making this imputation if it wants to.          But the BIA

14   clearly doesn't want to.     So, where does that leave you?

15               MR. KINNAIRD:      Well, I think if it is

16   ambiguous, then the BIA actually has to exercise its

17   discretion and grapple with that ambiguity.          And that is

18   one of the fundamental problems, as Justice --

19               JUSTICE KAGAN:       Well, are you saying that

20   the BIA needs to write an opinion that says now we are

21   doing Chevron step two analysis?          Is that what you're

22   saying, that this is a matter of labeling?

23               MR. KINNAIRD:      I don't think it's a matter

24   of -- of magic words, but what it has to do is actually

25   grapple with and recognize the ambiguity, at least in


                                   29

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the alternative, and then exercise its discretion to say

 2   if this is a permissible construction of the Act and

 3   there's another permissible construction, which of the

 4   two better serves the statutory purpose.

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But it doesn't have

 6   to grapple with everything that's not there.              I mean,

 7   there are a lot of things that the statutes don't

 8   address.

 9                MR. KINNAIRD:      Agreed.

10                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              It seems to me that

11   they don't have to grapple with everything that's there.

12   You just have to say this doesn't address it.              So,

13   whoever is asking for the affirmative, which is you,

14   loses.

15                MR. KINNAIRD:      I don't think --

16                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              You're saying:   We

17   think this law should allow -- should provide for this,

18   should be extended for this.            And it's one thing to say,

19   well, the statute's ambiguous; it talks about children

20   in one category but not in another category; so, the

21   issue's there; we don't know what they meant.              It's

22   another thing if it's something that's totally not on

23   the table.   I mean, if -- if you claimed that the law

24   required every minor to get $500 a year, you wouldn't

25   say the statute was ambiguous about that.              You'd say it

 1   doesn't have anything to do with it.

 2               MR. KINNAIRD:       Well, that's right, Your

 3   Honor, but I think the ambiguity arises here because the

 4   matters in question are ones not within the capacity or

 5   control of the minor, and that's been the traditional

 6   basis on which the BIA has looked for imputation.            And

 7   when you take into account --

 8               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           In your -- your

 9   argument -- under your argument an alien, a child, who

10   never acquired LPR status in its own right could get a

11   cancellation of removal based on the parents' status.

12               MR. KINNAIRD:       I don't think that's right.

13   The Ninth Circuit did not address that, but I think the

14   better reading of the statute, even if (a)(1) is

15   somewhat ambiguous on that point, is that you have to be

16   an LPR in order to seek cancellation.            And then for

17   these durational requirements and the look-back to

18   status, there you do imputation.

19               And the reason is twofold.            One, section

20   212(c), which it replaced, was limited to LPRs.            The

21   second is that there is a separate subsection,

22   subsection (b), of that same statute.            I don't believe

23   it's in the addenda provided to the courts, but it is

24   cancellation of removal for certain nonpermanent

25   resident aliens.   And the critical distinction between


                                    31

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   the two, besides differences in criteria, is that that

 2   one authorizes adjustment of status as well as

 3   cancellation.

 4               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              What would --

 5               MR. KINNAIRD:         So, if you're not an actual

 6   LPR, you need to have adjustment of status to -- to not

 7   be in a legal limbo.

 8               JUSTICE KENNEDY:              Mr. Kinnaird, what would

 9   happen if the child remains with the grandparents in

10   Mexico and his parents are living in Los Angeles for 6

11   years until they can afford to take him.             Is the

12   parents' residence then imputed to the child so that

13   when he moved to Los Angeles in year 7 he is deemed to

14   have been there for 6 years?

15               MR. KINNAIRD:         I think if there's a

16   significant separation of that duration, I think there

17   would be a question about whether you have the

18   significant relationship between parent and child to

19   warrant imputation.      But it is true that under former

20   section 212(c), at least in two of the cases, they

21   imputed residency where the child was not actually

22   resident.

23               JUSTICE BREYER:            You had an example in your

24   brief, I thought -- you might -- I thought that it was

25   an example of status rather than intent.             The example


                                      32

                           Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   that you gave -- I took that way; tell me if I'm -- is

 2   where an alien comes in and wants asylum, and then you

 3   can't get it if you were resettled in another country.

 4   And there are criteria -- country with a resettlement

 5   program.   And then that seemed like a status, a

 6   residence.   Were you resettled in the other country or

 7   were you not?   That's his status, and then that's

 8   imputed to the child.

 9                MR. KINNAIRD:       That's right.     And the

10   resettlement doesn't have any element of intent to it.

11   So, it's not true that everything turns upon intent.

12                And I would also point out that, under

13   section (a)(1), it's not simply a requirement that there

14   have been some grant of LPR status at some point and

15   passage of 5 -- of 5 years.           The statutory definition of

16   "lawfully admitted for permanent residence" includes a

17   requirement that the status has not changed.          And that

18   requires domiciliary intent because the BIA has

19   interpreted that phrase to mean that you can change your

20   status by intent, and in fact the Department of Homeland

21   Security has defended against cancellation claims on the

22   grounds that there was abandonment during a -- during

23   the 5-year period.    So, if you had a child coming forth,

24   you would have to look, in certain circumstances at

25   least, to the parent for intent of abandonment.

 1                So, I think this is an element where there

 2   is direct continuity from section 212(c).           It makes

 3   eminent sense.    And even if the BIA is deemed to have

 4   exercised its discretion here, I think its rule is

 5   patently unreasonable, and for a number of reasons.

 6                First, they're not able to advance a single

 7   policy reason that would be favorable to non-imputation.

 8   It destroys family unity, and it forecloses eligibility

 9   for relief for even people like Mr. Martinez Gutierrez,

10   who has lived here since the age of 5.

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           There -- this Court has

12   dealt in the constitutional context with parent-child

13   relationships under the immigration law.           And let's take

14   Fiallo v. Bell.   There the Court said, well, it tells us

15   that for married parents it's this way, and for a child

16   born out of wedlock, that relationship is something

17   else.   That could be considered quite arbitrary when the

18   question is, is the child left orphaned?           But the Court

19   said, well, that's what the statute said.           It made that

20   distinction, and the Court upheld it.

21                But there are a number of cases where there

22   is -- the statute does say, parent-child relationship,

23   this is imputed, that is not, and dealt -- the Court

24   dealt with that in Miller and Nguyen.

25                MR. KINNAIRD:       Yes, Your Honor.      I think


                                     34

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                   Official


 1   Congress has the latitude to be -- to draw arbitrary

 2   lines.   I don't think the agency does if imputation is a

 3   permissible alternative.       I think they have to give a

 4   reasoned basis for denying imputation when it was the

 5   prior rule.

 6                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Isn't it -- why

 7   can't the BIA adopt or why doesn't the background

 8   principle apply that you're not entitled to admission

 9   unless you make an affirmative case for it?

10                 You say, well, the -- the government hasn't

11   advanced any policy reason on the other side.               Why isn't

12   that the basic policy of the government?

13                 MR. KINNAIRD:      Well, I think they have to

14   look to the actual statute, and they have to give their

15   own reasons, which I don't think they've done adequately

16   as a matter of discretion.         But here, this is a --

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Why isn't it -- why isn't

18   it an adequate reason that they've come up with here and

19   in their decisions that the prior word was "domicile"

20   and a child's domicile is that of the parents, and that

21   the word under the new statute is "residence" and the

22   child's residence is not necessarily the residence of

23   the parent?   That seems to me a perfectly valid reason.

24                 MR. KINNAIRD:      Well, I wouldn't say that's

25   Chevron step two discretion.             But I think you also have


                                     35

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1   to look to the fact that there was not only imputation

 2   of domicile; it required lawfulness.             And -- and in

 3   imputing domicile, they were also imputing residence.

 4   So, it's true the word "domicile" has --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:          That may well be, but it's

 6   a different word.

 7               MR. KINNAIRD:       It's a different word, yes.

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:          And the one word demands

 9   imputation; the other doesn't.          So, I mean, I don't

10   think you can say there's no -- no rational basis given

11   by the agency.

12               MR. KINNAIRD:       Well, the rational basis

13   comes in if -- if there's ambiguity and they're

14   determining why -- if it's a permissible construction,

15   why it should be rejected or not.

16               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          One of the problems that

17   I have is that I see the imputation as an equitable

18   doctrine.

19               MR. KINNAIRD:       Yes.

20               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          And to me, that often

21   means discretionary.

22               MR. KINNAIRD:       Yes.

23               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          If it is that,

24   discretionary, I -- I don't know what more the BIA has

25   to say than "I don't want to," because it renders lots

 1   of issues open, like what do we do with 1229b(a)(2)?

 2   Isn't that an end run on stopping this continuous 7-year

 3   statute, or 10, whatever it is, if we're imputing a

 4   parent's residence or any of the things that you're --

 5   that the government said, the BIA said, in rendering its

 6   decision?

 7               I mean, you can't force a court to -- the

 8   BIA to impute.   So, what more do they have to say than

 9   we don't think it's consistent with the statute, even if

10   it is ambiguous to do this?

11               MR. KINNAIRD:       Well, I would say the statute

12   has an equitable purpose which allows imputation.            I do

13   not think there's discretion, if imputation is

14   permissible unless there's a rational basis in serving

15   the policies of the Act, to deny imputation.           And

16   discretion does come in at the second phase, which is

17   when the Attorney General determines whether or not the

18   -- the cancellation should be granted.

19               So, we should bear in mind that this is a

20   statute strictly for eligibility, simply to get to the

21   phase where there's unreviewable discretion in the

22   Attorney General to deny relief.           And this is a

 1   children who were minors during the period, who could


 2   not have controlled their status, could not have


 3   controlled their residence, this is an eminently


 4   reasonable rule that's backed by Congress.


 5                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           What's so reasonable

 6   about a child who lives with their grandparents outside

 7   the country?    Why should their parents' being in the

 8   U.S. be imputed to the benefit of that child?                I

 9   certainly understand it in your client's situation.

10   Your client is the one who has been here since 5 years

11   old.

12                  MR. KINNAIRD:      Right.

13                  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           So --

14                  MR. KINNAIRD:      And if -- BIA, I think, would

15   be reasonable to draw a narrower rule, and we could

16   prevail under that rule, but I think the rationale is

17   family unity; that even though there are periods of

18   residence where there's a dysjunction, the real reason

19   is simply the operation of quotas.                 And -- and there was

20   a historical practice of allowing imputation of

21   residence.   Since you still have the family ties, I

22   think imputation is permissible there, as long as you

23   have the significant relationship.

24                  JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Mr. Kinnaird, I'm having

25   trouble figuring out, is your view that non-imputation


                                      38

                                    Official


 1   is just unreasonable per se, or is your view that they

 2   didn't explain non-imputation properly?

 3                  MR. KINNAIRD:      They are alternative

 4   arguments.    They certainly didn't explain it.                 I would

 5   also say it's unreasonable per se:                 One, because they


 6   have to deal with the fact of lack of custody and


 7   control.   That's been the basis for their abandonment


 8   decisions.    They have invoked imputation only to the


 9   detriment of the alien where the child has no intent


10   whatsoever.

11                  So, there's no common law principle for

12   imputing mens rea, for example, knowledge of

13   inadmissibility to a child; no basis for really imputing

14   an intent to abandon when the child has none whatsoever.

15   So, at the very least, they have to explain that.

16                  And because -- and the BIA has also not

17   really taken into account the nature of these as simply

18   eligibility rules.

 1               MR. ROTHFELD:      Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

 2   and may it please the Court:

 3               So far as subsection (2) of the provision

 4   that we're talking about this morning, which is the

 5   provision that concerns me in the Sawyers case, we think

 6   that the Government's reading is simply not a sensible

 7   approach to the statute.     And in that sense, our

 8   position is not that the statute is ambiguous.              We think

 9   that the statutory context and the particular meaning of

10   the words that Congress used require imputation in the

11   circumstances of this case.

12               I'll start with the statutory background,

13   where I think the Government understates the nature of

14   the prevailing settled rule that it applied.

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              We usually like to

16   start with the statutory language.              Where is this issue

17   addressed in this statute at all?

18               MR. ROTHFELD:      Imputation as such, as has

19   been said, is not directly addressed.              But the words

20   that the -- that Congress used, the word "residence" and

21   the word -- particularly "continuous residence" are

22   words that Congress would have thought carried along

23   with it the concept of imputation.              And the reason why

24   that is so, I think it's necessary to start with a

25   little bit of the background both of the statute and how


                                   40

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   those words have been interpreted in prior usages.

 2   Congress would have been aware of when it used them in

 3   the statute.

 4                  Under the prior relief provision here,

 5   section 212(c), the old provision, the courts that --

 6   courts of appeals that had addressed it had uniformly


 7   applied an imputation rule.            The Government says it's


 8   three courts.    Two of those courts are the Second and


 9   Ninth Circuits, the largest immigration circuits that


10   decide two-thirds of the immigration cases in the

11   country.    So, I think one can presume that Congress

12   would have been aware of this rule.

13                  And the Government concedes that Congress

14   didn't change the language of 212(c) because it was

15   dissatisfied with imputation.             It had other purposes in

16   mind altogether.    And so --

17                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              What does the

18   statute say about imputation of individuals' residence

19   to grandparents?

20                  MR. ROTHFELD:      The rule -- it says nothing

21   directly about it.

22                  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              It says nothing

23   about it.   So, would you say the statute is ambiguous on

24   whether or not residents' legal permanent residence

25   status should be imputed to grandparents?


                                      41

 1                MR. ROTHFELD:        Well, I think there could be

 2   circumstances in which imputation is appropriate when --

 3   when the child is in the custody of the grandparent.

 4   But I'm focusing on parents because that's how the cases

 5   have been decided up to that point.

 6                The BIA itself had said, prior to the

 7   enactment of this statute, in the In re Ng case that --

 8   which I think is the case the Justice Breyer had

 9   referred to -- it had said in so many words the

10   residence of the parent is imputed to child when the

11   child is a minor.    Congress would have been aware of

12   that when it used the word "residence" in

13   subsection (2).

14                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            What do you do -- what

15   you do if the parents -- the father is an LPR, the

16   mother is not?    Do we then impute to the child the

17   father's status?    The couple is not married.

18                MR. ROTHFELD:        There are rules, common law

19   rules, that the courts had applied in determining whose

20   residence and whose domicile would be attributed to the

21   child when the parents were not -- didn't have joint

22   custody.   When the -- if we're talking only about

23   residence here --

24                JUSTICE GINSBURG:            They have joint custody.

25   They live together.      They're just not married.

 1                MR. ROTHFELD:      I think that -- again, the

 2   courts have applied -- if we're distinguishing -- for

 3   purposes of residence -- and I'm not talking about the

 4   technical LPR status here when I'm using the term

 5   "residence"; I am referring simply to kind of the

 6   general common law concept.

 7                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          Well, I think it was

 8   agreed that -- that LPR status would be necessary.             At

 9   least, Mr. Kinnaird said that.

10                MR. ROTHFELD:      We --

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:          So, we're talking about

12   the 5-year period and the 7-year period.          The child

13   would have to have LPR status.

14                MR. ROTHFELD:      We agree ultimately, to get

15   relief, the child has to have LPR status and certainly

16   under subsection (1) of the provision, which is not at

17   issue in the Sawyers case.        That concerns 5 years of LPR

18   status.   Subsection(2), which is all that I'm concerned

19   with in Sawyers because that's the only -- only element

20   of the relief provision that he was deemed not to

21   satisfy, concerns only the term "residence," not LPR as

22   such; simply continuous residence in the United States.

23                And so, the question of would Congress have

24   thought that residence, continuous residence, is

25   imputable from parent to child -- I think it would have


                                    43

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   for two reasons:   First of all, it would have believed

 2   that residence as a general matter is imputable.              The

 3   BIA had said so itself in the Ng case.              And as it --

 4   domicile, which the Government concedes was imputable,

 5   necessarily includes --

 6                JUSTICE SCALIA:           Excuse me.    Was residence

 7   at issue in that case?

 8                MR. ROTHFELD:        It was indeed.       It was a firm

 9   resettlement case, and the question was whether or not

10   the alien had been a resident of Hong Kong.              And the

11   parents were residents, and the BIA said, well, the

12   parents' residence is imputed to the child.

13                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Just for factual

14   correction, the record doesn't tell us whether he was

15   living with his mother -- Mr. Sawyer was living with his

16   mother.

17                MR. ROTHFELD:        That's correct.

18                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           And the answer to that

19   is?   Is this a child living with a grandparent out of

20   the country or not?

21                MR. ROTHFELD:        The record does not

22   reflect -- we don't know if he was living in U.S. in an

23   unlawful status up until the point he became an LPR at

24   age 15.   The record simply doesn't answer that question.

25                JUSTICE BREYER:           You're saying -- I just

 1   want to hear your whole argument here.           You're saying

 2   they would have had, Congress, as a background, the Ng

 3   case where they imputed the Hong Kong residence; the

 4   fact that you were about to say, that domicile

 5   necessarily includes residence.         And is there something

 6   else?

 7               MR. ROTHFELD:      That's the principle, but

 8   that --

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:         All right.

10               MR. ROTHFELD:      That's correct.       That -- but

11   I can add to that a little bit, that in the section

12   212 cases, in which domicile was imputed, as the

13   Government recognizes, in at least two of those cases,

14   the child was not in the United States for a portion of

15   that time; and, therefore, necessarily those courts must

16   have been imputing not only domicile but residence.           And

17   that is necessarily the case because -- residence is an

18   element, a subset, of domicile --

19               JUSTICE ALITO:       So, if he came to the United

20   States at 15 from Jamaica, he was a resident of the

21   United States before he came --

22               MR. ROTHFELD:      As a -- as a legal matter,

23   just as he was -- would have been domiciled in the

24   United States.

25               JUSTICE ALITO:       Would he be a resident of


                                   45

 1   Jamaica, too, at that time?


 2               MR. ROTHFELD:       I think not.        I think -- I


 3   think our common law would have regarded him as a


 4   resident of the United States --

 5               JUSTICE ALITO:        If his father was living in

 6   the U.K., would he be a resident of the U.K.?

 7               MR. ROTHFELD:       There might be legal rules

 8   that -- that specify the physical presence is equivalent

 9   to residence for particular purposes.             But as this Court

10   held in Holyfield, as the Government recognizes in a

11   domicile context, a child can be a domicile of a

12   jurisdiction in which they have never set foot.             The

13   legal presumption is that a child is -- takes the

14   domicile of the parent, and -- and residence is a

15   necessary subset, as this Court has said long ago,

16   before any of these statutes were passed.             The

17   definition --

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           But you can be a resident

19   without being a domiciliary?

20               MR. ROTHFELD:       One can be -- yes, because

21   the definition, as this Court said, of -- of "domicile"

22   is residence in a particular place accompanied by an

23   intent to remain there indefinitely.             And so, you have

24   to have both.   You can't be a domicile without being a

25   resident of the jurisdiction.

 1                 Congress would have been aware of that.               And

 2   when it used the term "residence," it would have been

 3   aware of that as a general proposition, and it would

 4   have been aware that in the particular context of

 5   section 212(c), imputation rule for relief in the

 6   immigration laws, that use of the term "resident"

 7   carries with it imputation.

 8                 I think that makes this -- so far as we're

 9   concerned, that makes the use of the term "continuous

10   residence" in subsection (b) unambiguous and requires

11   imputation.   Congress would have been aware of this.

12   There's no reason to think, the Government concedes,

13   Congress was not trying to change the imputation rule

14   when it changed the terminology from -- from "domicile"

15   to "resident."

16                 In fact, it's sort of perverse to say that

17   Congress had -- achieved that purpose, because it was

18   a -- this was a liberalizing change.              The reason that

19   Congress -- it's quite clear from the statutory

20   background why Congress changed the language from 7

21   years' unrelinquished lawful domicile in the old 212(c)

22   to continuous residence after admission in any status in

23   -- in subsection (b) of the new statute -- was to

24   broaden the availability of relief.

25                 Congress was confronted with a split in the


                                     47

 1   circuits on the interpretation of the old rule, as to

 2   whether or not one could achieve unrelinquished

 3   domicile -- lawful unrelinquished domicile while not in

 4   an LPR status, because the BIA had taken the position

 5   that for -- to have lawful domicile, you have to

 6   lawfully intend to stay here permanently; you can't do

 7   that if you're not an LPR.

 8                And, therefore, Congress, confronting the

 9   split on circuits -- because some courts had rejected

10   the BIA's view, Congress said, okay, we're going to put

11   in subsection (a) of the new statute a requirement of 5

12   years' LPR status.

13                JUSTICE ALITO:        If Congress had wanted to

14   use the term "resided" in the ordinary sense of the

15   word, they wanted to require that the alien actually

16   have lived in the United States continuously for 7

17   years, what language would they have used?        What

18   language should they have used?

19                MR. ROTHFELD:       For -- for the child?   Well,

20   I think --

21                JUSTICE ALITO:        If they wanted (2) to mean

22   that the alien must have actually -- that person must --

23   the one who committed the crime later must actually have

24   resided in the United States continuously for 7 years --

25                MR. ROTHFELD:       I would --

 1                JUSTICE ALITO:        -- then what should they --

 2   actually lived in the United States for 7 years, what

 3   language should they have used?

 4                MR. ROTHFELD:       For -- for an adult, the

 5   language that they did use, because I think "continuous

 6   residence" carries with it the requirement that the

 7   person be physically present in the United States --

 8                JUSTICE ALITO:        For a minor.

 9                MR. ROTHFELD:       If they're a minor?

10                JUSTICE ALITO:        For that to apply to

11   everybody.

12                MR. ROTHFELD:       I -- I would think, given the

13   context, of which imputation was the settled rule, that

14   Congress would have had to indicate affirmatively that

15   imputation was impermissible.            Just as if -- if Congress

16   uses the term "domicile" as they did in the old section

17   212(c), knowing the context in which, as a universal

18   matter, the domicile of the parents is attributed to the

19   child, one would expect --

20                JUSTICE ALITO:        "Domicile" is a legal term.

21   You don't go around and you meet somebody and say, Where

22   are you domiciled?

 1   language.

 2                  MR. ROTHFELD:      Well -- and "reside" can have

 3   different meanings in different contexts.                 There is a

 4   definition in the statute which the BIA itself has said

 5   does not apply to conditional uses of the term.                 So, you

 6   know, "residence" in its plainest sense -- I mean, as

 7   this Court said in the Savorgnan case, which is where

 8   Congress derived the -- the definition which is now in

 9   the INA, that was under the plainest use of the term

10   "residence."    You know, unadorned.               And that was the

11   statutory definition, which says without regard to

12   intent.

13                  But when there's a conditional use, when

14   it's continuous residence, as in subsection (b) of the

15   statute, or permanent residence, necessarily one has to

16   look at intent.    And, therefore, that statutory

17   definition cannot apply.        The BIA itself has said that

18   expressly in the Huang case, which we discuss in our

19   brief, that so far as permanent residence is concerned,

20   the statutory definition has no application because

21   necessarily one has to look to intent.

22                  And so, this is sort of a second --

23   secondary argument here, but insofar as intent is

24   essential for imputation, which is what the Government

25   says -- the Government says the reason that the switch


                                      50

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   from "domicile" to "residence" matters is because

 2   "domicile" looks to intent, and "residence" doesn't.

 3   But, in fact, continuous residence does, necessarily

 4   does, look to intent because it's the intent to remain

 5   continuously or permanently.

 6                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Is -- is there some

 7   advantage to giving parents an incentive to apply for

 8   early lawful permanent residence?           Because under your

 9   view, parents wouldn't have to bother to apply for it at

10   all.   I'm -- I'm wondering about the --

11                MR. ROTHFELD:      Well, I --

12                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           -- the consequences of

13   deciding in your favor.      And the other one, quite

14   distinct, is it seems to me that there probably would

15   not be some floodgate of -- of imputed residence cases.

16                MR. ROTHFELD:      I -- I -- the only thing

17   we're talking about here, of course, is -- is a

18   particular relief from removal provision.           And so,

19   certainly, the -- the expectation that the child someday

20   down the road may seek relief from removal --

21                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Right.

22                MR. ROTHFELD:      -- if they do -- if they

23   become an LPR and do something wrong is not going to

24   induce parents to delay.

25                JUSTICE SCALIA:         Mr. Rothfeld, I'm -- I'm

 1   curious, how often -- this dispute here is simply about

 2   whether the Attorney General is permitted to cancel

 3   removal, right?

 4                 MR. ROTHFELD:       That is correct.

 5                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          How often does -- are

 6   applications for cancellation of removal granted?              I

 7   mean, is it a common phenomenon, or are we really

 8   talking here about just spinning it out longer so that

 9   the -- so that the person who will ultimately be

10   deported can stay here that much longer?

11                 MR. ROTHFELD:       I -- I can't give you current

12   statistics.   I think this Court said, I believe in the

13   St. Cyr case, that a fairly -- substantial -- 40 percent

14   or so of the cases are granted.            The Gutierrez case, in

15   fact, the IJ would have granted removal and --

16                 JUSTICE SCALIA:          You think it's as high as

17   40 percent?

18                 MR. ROTHFELD:       I believe that that's -- I

19   wouldn't swear to that, Your Honor, but -- but it is

20   a -- a significant percentage.            And, again, Gutierrez is

21   an example of that.      The IJ would have granted it but

22   for the -- the rejection of the imputation rule further

23   on in the -- in the process.

24                 And I think this is actually kind of a

25   significant point, which goes to what Congress would


                                      52

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   have had in mind.    We are only talking about not

 2   entitlement to relief; we're talking about entitlement

 3   to ask the Attorney General, in the exercise of his

 4   unreviewable discretion, to grant relief to deserving

 5   immigrants who would otherwise be forced out of the

 6   country by application of an inflexible rule.

 7               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 I suppose one of the

 8   things he could take into account in exercising his

 9   discretion is whether we're actually dealing with a

10   minor, or, as I understand in this case, it's someone

11   who is quite a bit older.

12               MR. ROTHFELD:         He -- it is unreviewable

13   discretion, yes.    He could take anything into account.

14   And, certainly, the nature of the family ties, the --

15   the background of the immigrant, all of those things are

16   taken into account.      But the question -- whether or not

17   Congress when it passed this statute, knowing how

18   section 212(c) had been interpreted, the prospect that

19   Congress meant to --

20               JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:            Counsel, that's a very

21   big assumption.    I mean, yes, it's the two biggest

22   circuits who have defined domicile and imputation, but

23   it wasn't us, number one.         And, number two, going back

24   to Justice Alito's question, they didn't adopt the same

25   word, "domicile"; they changed it.                 So --

 1                 MR. ROTHFELD:       Well, I can give you --

 2                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          And that's what the BIA

 3   was saying.

 4                 MR. ROTHFELD:       I can give you two responses

 5   to that, if I may, Justice Sotomayor.                First, yes, I

 6   mean, it is a presumption that Congress is aware of

 7   judicial decisions, but I think that presumption --

 8                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:          It can't be aware of all

 9   judicial decisions.

10                 MR. ROTHFELD:       No, but in this particular

11   context, there's particular reason to think they were

12   because Congress, it is agreed, enacted this legislation

13   to cure a conflict in the circuits involving the

14   application of this cancellation provision.                And so,

15   there would have been particular reason for Congress to

16   be aware of what the courts had done.

17                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:               You -- you said you

18   had two points.    Do you want to get your second out, in

19   half a sentence?

20                 MR. ROTHFELD:       I -- I can rest at this

21   point, Your Honor.

22                 Thank you so much.

 1                    ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 2                 MS. KRUGER:     Thank you.

 3                 I'd like to make three quick points --

 4                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           The -- the Respondent said

 5   that the BIA gave no policy reason, no policy

 6   justifications, for its -- for its interpretation.

 7                 Is that correct in your view?

 8                 MS. KRUGER:     I don't think that that is

 9   correct.   The BIA noted -- to be clear, the BIA was, I

10   think, heavily influenced by what it saw as the clear

11   language of the statute, but it also noted that the

12   imputation rule was inconsistent with a history of

13   non-imputation of LPR status, an approach that treats

14   LPR status as accorded to individual aliens.

15                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         What do you respond to the

16   point that lawfulness has been attributed, not just

17   intent, but under the prior law, lawfulness was also

18   attributed?

19                 MS. KRUGER:     I think this goes back to the

20   answer I was giving to Justice Breyer earlier.            Where

21   former section 212(c) had an explicit lawful status

22   requirement, which is the status of being a lawful

23   permanent resident, no court of appeals allowed

24   imputation from parent to child.

25                 Their argument is a little bit more


                                     55

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                 Official


 1   convoluted than that.    It is that because domicile,

 2   lawful unrelinquished domicile, was interpreted to mean

 3   the ability to form a lawful intent to remain

 4   permanently in the United States, and the Ninth Circuit

 5   said you could only form such an intent if you are a

 6   lawful permanent resident, that in Lepe-Guitron, the

 7   Ninth Circuit was therefore necessarily imputing LPR

 8   status from parent to child.

 9               I think the more straightforward way to read

10   the Ninth Circuit's decision is that it was imputing the

11   intent to remain permanently in the United States from

12   parent to child, based in part on the parents'

13   establishment of a domicile, and based on the common law

14   rule that the child's domicile follows that of his

15   parents.

16               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Counsel, in response

17   to Justice Kennedy's question about whether they gave a

18   policy reason, your answer was that they, you know,

19   followed the history.    I'm not sure that's the same as a

20   policy.

21               MS. KRUGER:     Well, in -- in addition to

22   discussing the individual nature of LPR status, they

23   also noted the consequence of the Ninth Circuit's

24   imputation rule would be to permit a kind of end run

25   around the substantive eligibility requirements for LPR


                                   56

                        Alderson Reporting Company

 1   status.   So, theoretically, you could have an individual

 2   minor alien who's not eligible, who's inadmissible for

 3   adjustment of status, who would nevertheless be accorded

 4   a substantial benefit of that status without regard to

 5   whether or not he could have received that status in

 6   fact.

 7                 I want to --

 8                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Was that the case under the

 9   prior law?

10                 MS. KRUGER:     Under the -- under former

11   section 212(c).

12                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         Yes, when -- yes.

13                 MS. KRUGER:     Again, no court --

14                 JUSTICE SCALIA:         So, it's not unthinkable.

15                 MS. KRUGER:     No court had imputed LPR

16   status, the threshold requirement for relief under --

17   under the predecessor statute, from parent to child.

18   So, it wasn't the case that somebody who was actually

19   ineligible for -- for LPR status would nevertheless be

20   eligible for waiver of removal under -- under that

21   provision.

22                 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:         I just don't understand

23   that argument because they've conceded that you need

24   the -- the child needs their own LPR status before it

25   triggers --


                                     57

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1                MS. KRUGER:       Right, and I think that


 2   concession --

 3                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           -- residency.


 4                MS. KRUGER:       I think that concession is


 5   important for the following reason:                When Congress

 6   enacted the present cancellation of removal statute, it

 7   preserved that threshold requirement that you had to be

 8   an LPR in order to seek relief, but it added a

 9   durational requirement.        You had to have attained that

10   status at least 5 years before you sought relief.

11                There's no reason to think, if there's no

12   precedent for imputing LPR status in the first place,

13   that there would be precedent for imputing LPR status

14   going back 5 years.      One necessarily follows from the

15   other.

16                If I could, I'd like to address the other

17   proposition that Respondent Sawyers makes, that courts

18   were necessarily imputing residence as an element of

19   domicile.   That argument relies heavily on the 1967

20   regional commissioner decision dealing with firm

21   resettlement.

22                If you look at that decision, you will see

23   that the regional commissioner focused very intensely on

24   the minor alien's particular actions -- identity,

25   documents that he received personally from the foreign


                                      58

 1   country, his own schooling, and residence.             And the

 2   degree to which the regional commissioner rested on

 3   principles of imputation is entirely unclear.

 4               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Thank you, counsel.

 5               The case is submitted.
