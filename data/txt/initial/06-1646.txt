 6              ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

 7                  ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 8              MR. SHANMUGAM:          Thank you, Mr. Chief

 9   Justice, and may it please the Court:

10              The Armed Career Criminal Act is one of the

11   Federal Government's most important tools for

12   incapacitating serial offenders who commit serious

13   crimes, and, like other Federal recidivism statutes, the

14   ACCA defines the prior offenses that trigger its

15   application based partly upon the maximum terms of

16   imprisonment for those offenses.              The question presented

17   in this case is whether the relevant maximum term of

18   imprisonment for an offender who was already a repeat

19   offender is the maximum to which repeat offenders were

20   subject to that offense.

21              Alone among the circuits, the Ninth Circuit

22   held that the relevant maximum for a repeat offender is

23   instead the maximum to which first-time offenders were

24   subject, even though that purported maximum would

25   sometimes be lower than the term that a repeated


                                       3

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   offender would actually receive.                Because the ACCA

 2   cannot support that counterintuitive and counterfactual

 3   approach, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit should be

 4   reversed.

 5                JUSTICE SCALIA:             Mr. Shanmugam, what is the

 6   government's position as to a person who is not a repeat

 7   offender?    He commits the crime for the first-time.               Now

 8   the government says there are alternative maximums and

 9   you have to pick whichever maximum is the higher.                  Why

10   wouldn't that maximum apply to the person who commits

11   the crime the first-time?

12                MR. SHANMUGAM:          That is because, Justice

13   Scalia, we believe that the text of the ACCA naturally

14   accommodates the possibility that there may be

15   alternative maximum terms of imprisonment for a given

16   offense.    The provision the ACCA at issue, Section

17   924(e)(2)(A)(ii), defines a serious drug offense as "a

18   State drug trafficking offense for which a maximum term

19   of imprisonment of 10 years or more is prescribed by

20   law," and we believe that that language is susceptible

21   to the interpretation that the maximum for a repeat

22   offender is the maximum to which repeat offenders were

23   subject and the maximum for a first-time offender is the

24   maximum to which first-time offenders were subject.                 And

25   that is particularly true because Congress --


                                         4

                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:             You're adding something to

 2   the elements of the crime and in all of our cases in

 3   this field we look to the elements of the crime.

 4               MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, to be sure, Justice --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:             And as far as the elements

 6   are concerned, the maximum sentence for those elements

 7   you say is the sentence that would be imposed upon a

 8   repeat offender.

 9               MR. SHANMUGAM:          To be sure, Justice Scalia,

10   the ACCA speaks of the maximum term of imprisonment for

11   the offense.   But a higher sentence for repeat offenders

12   is no less a maximum for the offense than the lower

13   sentence for first-time offenders.                 This Court's cases

14   involving challenges to recidivism statutes make that

15   clear because they have uniformly held that a recidivism

16   enhancement constitutes a stiffened penalty for an

17   underlying offense.

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 You seem to -- you

19   seem to flinch from the natural consequences of your

20   position in not looking at the maximum for a particular

21   offender.   For example, you know, under some guidelines,

22   if he was the ringleader his sentence can be enhanced

23   beyond what would otherwise be the maximum for a

24   first-time offender, but you say you don't take that

25   into consideration.

 1                MR. SHANMUGAM:         I don't that we're flinching

 2   from those consequences, Mr. Chief Justice.                  I think

 3   that it is simply a consequence of the fact that the

 4   statute does speak of the maximum term of imprisonment

 5   for the offense, not for the offender.                  And, while we

 6   believe --

 7                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                How is that

 8   different from your position here, where it is the fact

 9   that the individual is a recidivist that causes you to

10   look to a different maximum?

11                MR. SHANMUGAM:         It is because, Mr. Chief

12   Justice, that we believe that the language of the

13   statute can be susceptible to the interpretation that

14   there can be alternative maximum terms of imprisonment

15   for broad categories of offenders, such as recidivists

16   and non-recidivists.      But we don't think that it can --

17                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                So that's the reason

18   you sort of pull back from a more aggressive reading,

19   because it's not as broad a category?

20                MR. SHANMUGAM:         Well, it would lead to harsh

21   results for first-time offenders and we certainly think

22   that Congress --

23                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                Well, but only if

24   they're subject -- only if they have some characteristic

25   that had caused the State legislature to give the higher


                                        6

                         Alderson Reporting Company

 1   maximum, such as being the ringleader or some other

 2   enhancement.

 3              MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, that's correct.       But

 4   with regard to the text of the statute, we simply

 5   believe that the text of the statute cannot be stretched

 6   to accommodate the possibility of individualized maximum

 7   terms of imprisonment for every offender based on the

 8   potentially infinite combinations of facts that may

 9   determine an offender's guidelines range.              And I think

10   it's important to --

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:             Are there any statutes

12   which talk about offender as opposed to "offense" in

13   this area, do you know?

14              MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, I think probably the

15   closest analog in the criminal code, Justice Kennedy,

16   would be the statute that was at issue in RLC.             I

17   believe it's 18 U.S.C. 5037(c)(1)(b), which provided at

18   the time that the court was construing it that the

19   maximum -- that the sentence that a juvenile should

20   receive should be no higher than the maximum that an

21   adult offender should receive.             And the court did

22   construe that statute to refer to the maximum that an

23   adult could receive under the guidelines.

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, there was also the

25   statute involved in the LaBonte case, where -- where the


                                       7

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   statute said the Sentencing Commission "shall assure

 2   that the sentencing guidelines specify a sentence to a

 3   term of imprisonment at or near the maximum term

 4   authorized for categories of defendants who have certain

 5   types of prior convictions."

 6              MR. SHANMUGAM:          Yes.

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:             And that did focus on the

 8   -- on the nature of the defendant and not on the element

 9   of the crime.

10              MR. SHANMUGAM:          It focused on categories of

11   offenders and there Congress's concern was obviously

12   with career offenders.      But I think critically in the

13   LaBonte opinion itself, written by Justice Thomas for

14   the Court, the Court recognized the possibility that a

15   statute could establish alternative maximum terms of

16   imprisonment for recidivist and nonrecidivist offenders.

17   The Court specifically discussed the Controlled

18   Substances Act, which does exactly that.               Now, to be

19   sure the language of that statute was somewhat

20   different, but in our view the critical lesson of

21   LaBonte is simply that it is possible for a statute to

22   establish alternative maximums and the statute at issue

23   here no less than the statute at issue in LaBonte

24   accommodates that possibility.

25              JUSTICE SCALIA:             So it would be easy, of


                                       8

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                       Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   course, if recidivism were an element of the crime --

 2              MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, it would be easier to

 3   accept that if a State --

 4              JUSTICE SCALIA:             -- for a crime which

 5   includes the act plus the recidivism?

 6              MR. SHANMUGAM:          If a State, Justice Scalia

 7   were to essentially define a new crime of drug

 8   trafficking by a recidivist, then to be sure by

 9   definition the maximum sentence for that offense would

10   be the maximum to which repeat offenders were subject.

11   But to say one more thing in response to the Chief

12   Justice's question about guidelines maximums, I do think

13   that it is critical to remember that Congress enacted

14   the ACCA in its present form in 1986, well before this

15   Court's Apprendi jurisprudence took root, and at that

16   time Congress surely would have conceived of the

17   relevant maximum as the offense-specific statutory

18   maximum, and we know that Congress viewed that maximum

19   as a discrete creature from the relevant guidelines

20   maximum because in passing the Sentencing Reform Act 2

21   years earlier, the statute that gave rise to the Federal

22   guidelines, Congress smoke specifically about statutory

23   maximums as distinct from guidelines maximums.           And

24   certainly we believe --

25              JUSTICE ALITO:          In light of Apprendi and the


                                       9

                        Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   later cases, do you think it's feasible any longer to

 2   draw a distinction between, between statutes that make

 3   recidivism an element of the offense and statutes that

 4   originally conceived of recidivism as a sentencing

 5   factor but now provide for that to be proven to a jury?

 6              MR. SHANMUGAM:           One of the virtues of our

 7   approach, Justice Alito, is that the answer is in some

 8   sense the same whether a legislature defines drug

 9   trafficking by a recidivist as a distinct offense or

10   whether recidivism is simply a sentencing factor that

11   gives rise to an alternative maximum term of

12   imprisonment for the underlying offense of drug

13   trafficking.   And our fundamental submission with regard

14   to the Court's Apprendi line of cases is simply that it

15   alters nothing with regard to how the ACCA should be

16   interpreted because, again, Congress was defining

17   "offense" in 1986 in its colloquial sense as essentially

18   what the legislature defines the offense to be.         And to

19   be sure, it is a prerequisite for a fact to be an

20   offense element that it be submitted to the jury, but

21   all this court did in Apprendi line of cases was

22   effectively to state a procedural constitutional rule

23   under which a sentencing factor that raises the

24   applicable maximum sentence has to be submitted to the

25   jury.

 1                JUSTICE SCALIA:            Mr. Shanmugam, I didn't

 2   understand what you said about Congress's intent with

 3   regard to the guidelines when it passed ACCA.              You're

 4   saying Congress did not have an eye to the guidelines,

 5   but simply had an eye to the maximum sentence within

 6   which the guidelines were applicable?

 7                MR. SHANMUGAM:          Yes, that's correct.     In the

 8   Federal system, that would of course be the statutory

 9   maximum.    In some State systems, of course, the

10   guidelines are themselves statutory and for that reason

11   we refer to them in our brief as offense-specific

12   maximums.   But the critical point with regard to the

13   Sentencing Reform Act is that Congress did believe that

14   there was such a thing as the maximum for the offense,

15   and indeed in Section 994(r) of Title 28, one of the

16   provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act, Congress

17   actually asked the Sentencing Commission to come back

18   with recommendations to alter those offense-specific

19   maximums, which we believe is certainly evidence that

20   Congress viewed that as something distinct.

21                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Does it matter what was

22   the sentence actually imposed in the State court?              That

23   is, suppose it is a second offense, but the prosecutor

24   chooses not to charge as a second offender and so,

25   although it is in fact the second offense, he is


                                        11
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   sentenced in the State court as a first offender.            Would

 2   it count under your reading of the Federal statute that

 3   it was a second offense?

 4               MR. SHANMUGAM:          Our position, Justice

 5   Ginsburg, is that it would count because the relevant

 6   inquiry is whether the offender was potentially eligible

 7   for an enhanced maximum sentence as a repeat offender as

 8   a substantive matter.      That having been said, we

 9   certainly believe that in the mine run of cases a court

10   applying the ACCA will merely need to resort to the

11   judgments of conviction or other judicial records in

12   order to determine the maximum to which the defendant

13   was actually subject.      And this case of course presents

14   a perfect example of that because the judgments for each

15   of Respondent's prior convictions made clear that he was

16   in fact subject to a 10-year maximum sentence as a

17   repeat offender.

18               JUSTICE STEVENS:            I take it -- supposing

19   there's a dispute between the prosecutor and the

20   defendant as to whether in fact he was a recidivist or

21   not.   Is the fact that there was just an argument that

22   he would be a recidivist enough or does the record have

23   to establish that he was a recidivist?

24               MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, if there were such a

25   dispute, certainly we believe, first of all, that ACCA


                                       12

                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   courts would be perfectly competent to resolve those

 2   disputes.     They are no different in kind from the sorts

 3   of legal and factual issues --

 4                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Shouldn't the mere

 5   existence of a dispute be enough, because then at least

 6   he's potentially subject to being treated as a

 7   recidivist.

 8                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, our view, Justice

 9   Stevens, is that once the government comes forward, for

10   example, with a judgment of conviction that indicates

11   that the defendant was subject to a 10-year maximum, it

12   would then be incumbent on the defendant to come forward

13   with evidence suggesting that that was erroneous to the

14   extent that a defendant would be permitted to

15   collaterally challenge that prior sentence at all.               But

16   we do believe that courts can resolve those disputes.

17                 Now, if the Court were to disagree and to

18   conclude that, for comparable reasons to the reasons

19   that the Court articulated in Shepard, it would be

20   difficult for courts to resolve those determinations,

21   then I suppose that we could live with a rule that said

22   that the government is limited to judicial records like

23   a judgment of conviction.            But Taylor and Shepard of

24   course were dealing with a quite different concern, the

25   concern of how to define the prior offense, and I would

 1   submit that the factual disputes that the Court was

 2   concerned about in Shepard are quite different from

 3   disputes about the applicability of a recidivism

 4   enhancement.     Those were disputes about the actual

 5   underlying facts of the underlying substantive offense

 6   itself.     And the Court suggested in the plurality

 7   portion of Justice Souter's opinion that resolving those

 8   sorts of factual disputes might raise constitutional

 9   concerns.

10                 But we certainly believe that by virtue of

11   the rule of Almendarez-Torres, at a minimum the

12   resolution of factual disputes ancillary to the fact of

13   a prior conviction fall within the scope of the

14   Almendarez-Torres rule and present no constitutional

15   difficulties.

16                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            Mr. Shanmugam, I take it

17   that your response to Justice Ginsburg's question would

18   basically be your response to the argument that the

19   other side makes, that on your theory a State

20   misdemeanor can be treated for purposes of the act as --

21   or a conviction for a State misdemeanor can, with the

22   recidivism enhancement, be treated as a felony?

23                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          Yes.       That issue would

24   arise, of course, only under the definition of "violent

25   felony," which sets a one-year trigger rather than the


                                         14

                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   ten-year trigger that is contained in the definition of

 2   "serious drug offense."

 3              I think that the only point that I would

 4   note is that, with regard to an offense that remains a

 5   misdemeanor, even when it is committed by a repeat

 6   offender, there is a distinct statutory provision which

 7   we cite in our reply brief, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(20), which

 8   tinkers with the definition of what constitutes a

 9   qualifying offense for purposes of the definition of

10   "violent felony."    It says that if it's a misdemeanor,

11   the sentence, the applicable sentence, actually has to

12   be two years or more.       But where a State actually says

13   that when you commit an offense and it becomes a felony

14   when you are a recidivist, then certainly we think that

15   there is no problem with treating such an offense as an

16   ACCA predicate for purposes of the triggering maximum

17   term of imprisonment.

18              JUSTICE SOUTER:              But if they continue to use

19   just the State terminology such that they continue to

20   use the word "misdemeanor" with respect to an offense,

21   which with the enhancement carries more than a one-year

22   penalty, then the two-year provision, the two-year

23   threshold provision, kicks in?

24              MR. SHANMUGAM:            That's absolutely correct,

25   Justice Souter, and I believe that that was actually the


                                        15
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   fact pattern that was presented in the ACCA case that

 2   this Court heard earlier this term, Logan.

 3              JUSTICE SOUTER:             Yes.

 4              MR. SHANMUGAM:           And in a footnote in its

 5   opinion, the Court noted this very peculiarity of how

 6   ACCA operates and how you need to have a two-year

 7   maximum rather than a one-year maximum if the State

 8   still treats the offense as a misdemeanor.

 9              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Do all States treat first

10   convictions from other States -- do they all count for

11   recidivism qualification if the prior offense was

12   committed and the conviction was in another State?

13              MR. SHANMUGAM:           States do have somewhat

14   different rules, Justice Ginsburg, as Respondent

15   correctly points out, though I would note that many of

16   the sort of factual and legal issues that would arise

17   under those different rules arise outside the

18   drug-trafficking context.          Most States' drug-trafficking

19   recidivism provisions, as least those States that have

20   adopted the Uniform Controlled Substances Act provision,

21   operate in a quite straightforward manner because they

22   essentially sweep in all prior drug offenses.

23              That having been said, we are unaware of any

24   ACCA cases that have presented those sorts of

25   difficulties.   And typically what one would find, if one


                                       16
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   looked at Respondent's cases, is that most States by now

 2   have fairly clearly defined rules for determining when

 3   an out-of-State conviction qualifies.                   And so at most,

 4   if it were unclear from the judgment of the prior

 5   conviction whether the prior sentencing court had

 6   determined whether the defendant was subject to the

 7   enhanced maximum as a recidivist, it would be a

 8   relatively easy task for a Federal ACCA court to apply

 9   those largely settled rules in order to make that

10   determination.

11               I do want to say one more thing about the

12   text of the ACCA more generally, and that is that if the

13   Court, as Justice Scalia had suggested at the outset,

14   were to conclude that the statute is susceptible to the

15   interpretation that there can be only a single maximum

16   term of imprisonment for a given offense, we believe

17   that it would not necessarily follow that Respondent's

18   interpretation is correct, and indeed that the more

19   natural consequence of that interpretation would be that

20   the relevant maximum is the maximum that any offender

21   could receive, rather than the maximum that a first-time

22   offender could receive, and that is because --

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Surely not,

24   Mr. Shanmugam.   You were talking about broad categories

25   earlier.   It seemed that the broad category in the


                                       17
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   situation you posit would be the normal offender rather

 2   than the recidivist, and that's the one we ought to look

 3   at.

 4                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, that might be true as

 5   a numerical matter, though, you know, I suspect that

 6   there are probably more recidivist offenders than one

 7   might think.     But I think that the fundamental

 8   difficulty with Respondent's interpretation is the

 9   anomaly that I identified at the outset, namely that

10   even an offender who actually received a term of

11   imprisonment of 10 years could be said to have a maximum

12   of 5 years.     And while it is true that --

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, I know, but

14   you began your discussion by saying we had to choose one

15   maximum.     You were accepting that requirement.                   It seems

16   to me, if that's the case, it's clear that we ought to

17   pick the maximum for the particular offense without

18   considering additional enhancements.

19                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, with respect,

20   Mr. Chief Justice, I would disagree.                      I would submit

21   that if the Court has to choose a single maximum it has

22   to be the maximum that the worst offender could receive.

23   As a matter of common sense, when one thinks about the

24   maximum --

25                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 But you don't accept


                                         18
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that approach when we're talking about enhancements

 2   under State guidelines.         You know, if the normal

 3   sentence is whatever it is, 10 years, and you get an

 4   extra 2 years if you're the ringleader, you say no, you

 5   don't look at that; you just look at the 10 years.

 6              MR. SHANMUGAM:            That's correct, and that's

 7   because of the statute's reference to the offense and

 8   not the offender.    But my submission is simply that if

 9   the Court thinks that the statute is susceptible to the

10   interpretation that there has to be one maximum and

11   indeed if the Court thinks that that interpretation is

12   compelled, then we would submit that all offenders who

13   commit an offense for which some offenders could receive

14   a 10-year sentence would be subject to the ACCA.                   But we

15   of course primarily submit that the statute is not only

16   susceptible to the interpretation that we advance here,

17   but that it is the better interpretation, namely that a

18   statute can have alternative maximums.                   And we certainly

19   believe that that interpretation is consistent with the

20   long history and widespread practice of imposing

21   enhanced penalties on repeat offenders, a practice that

22   Congress surely was aware of when it enacted this

23   statute dealing with the problem of recidivism.

24              JUSTICE SCALIA:              Mr. Shanmugam, would you

25   explain to me again why -- why you treat the enhancement


                                        19

 1   in a State guideline system differently?

 2                 MR. SHANMUGAM:         It is --

 3                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           It seems to me that if you

 4   get an enhancement as a ringleader it's the same thing

 5   as if you get an enhancement because you're a

 6   recidivist.    What's the difference?

 7                 MR. SHANMUGAM:         The difference, Justice

 8   Scalia, is that the statute does speak of maximum terms

 9   of imprisonment for the offense and not the offender,

10   and, while we certainly believe that the language of the

11   statute with its reference to "a maximum term of

12   imprisonment" can naturally accommodate the possibility

13   of alternative maximums for broad tiers of offenders

14   such as recidivists and nonrecidivists, we really don't

15   believe that it can accommodate the possibility of

16   individualized maximums for every offender.

17                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           You don't think

18   "ringleader" is a broad tier.

19                 MR. SHANMUGAM:         Well, in a sentencing

20   guidelines system where being a ringleader may be the

21   basis for an enhancement, as it is in the Federal

22   system, the fact remains that an enhancement under a

23   guidelines system is merely one of many factors that

24   ultimately determine the offender's guideline sentence.

25   A guideline sentence is, of course, an individualized


                                        20

 1   determination made after a court evaluates a panoply of

 2   offender- and offense-specific factors.

 3                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            How would you treat an

 4   enhancement --

 5                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, we believe that such

 6   an enhancement could be subject to our alternative

 7   maximums approach as well, to the extent that the

 8   standard was --

 9                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            So it's not just

10   recidivist and non-recidivist.                It's some enhancements,

11   but not all enhancements?

12                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          Well, if a statute is as a

13   formal matter structured in such a way as to create

14   broad tiers of punishment for categories of offenders,

15   then certainly that would seem to be an alternative

16   maximum term of imprisonment.               The guideline systems, of

17   course, are not structured in that way.

18                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            You're depending upon the

19   guidelines.

20                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          Right.         Well, that's

21   correct, and so in Apprendi, of course, I think it was

22   the fact that the defendant had acted with a biased

23   purpose, and that form of structuring of statutes was

24   not unheard of prior to this Court's decision in

25   Apprendi.     And essentially what New Jersey did, as I


                                         21
                           Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   recall, in Apprendi was to say that if you unlawfully

 2   possess a firearm your maximum is 10 years.

 3                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Well, I understand, but my

 4   point is I don't think your proposal just has two

 5   categories.    There -- it seems there could be multiple

 6   kinds of enhancements that would fit your general

 7   description.

 8                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          And the relevant question,

 9   Justice Stevens --

10                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            It's not just recidivist

11   versus nonrecidivist.

12                 MR. SHANMUGAM:          This case does not present

13   that issue; and, in light of the history and practice of

14   imposing heightened penalties on recidivists, an

15   essentially universal practice as far as we're aware in

16   the drug-trafficking context, we certainly don't believe

17   that the Court has to address that issue.

18                 And, in any event, after this Court's

19   decision in Apprendi, it is certainly true that States

20   have made modifications to the structure of their

21   offenses and their sentencing systems such that, with

22   regard to factors other than recidivism, it may very

23   well be that as a prospective matter that issue would

24   not arise very frequently.            And --

25                 JUSTICE SCALIA:            Well, some of them have


                                         22
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   simply said, we're going to let the jury decide.                       We're

 2   going to let the jury make these determinations that

 3   Apprendi says have to be made by the jury.                      But they're

 4   still -- they're still referred to as sentencing

 5   factors.

 6                MR. SHANMUGAM:          That's correct, Justice

 7   Scalia.    And, with regard to a State that does that as

 8   Washington, indeed, has done in the wake of this Court's

 9   decision in Blakely, we believe that the relevant

10   offense and the relevant maximum term of imprisonment

11   actually remains the same.

12                And that is simply because where all a State

13   does is to say that sentencing factors must be submitted

14   to the jury in order to comply with the constitutional

15   rule of Apprendi and Blakely, the fact remains that the

16   State has not redefined the offense.                       In our view, a

17   sentencing factor can remain a sentencing factor even if

18   it is the functional equivalent of an offense element

19   for Apprendi purposes.

20                JUSTICE KENNEDY:            It seems to me your

21   argument might be slightly better if the statutory term

22   was "authorized," not "prescribed."                      I don't say

23   "prescribed" could never be used in the sense you mean,

24   but when you have alternates we usually would use the

25   word -- alternate possibilities -- usually you'd use the


                                        23
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   word "authorize" rather than "prescribe."               "Prescribe"

 2   indicates one rule.

 3              MR. SHANMUGAM:           I suppose that may be true,

 4   Justice Kennedy, though again the statute spoke about

 5   the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense, which

 6   I think presupposes, at least to some extent, that the

 7   maximum may be higher than the maximum to which a

 8   particular offender is subject.

 9              I think the only thing I would say with

10   regard to the reference to "prescribed by law" in the

11   ACCA is that one could naturally understand that phrase

12   being used by a Congress that was acting in 1986 as

13   referring to the prescribed statutory maximum.

14              And, notably, the Ninth Circuit in a case

15   that we cite in our opening brief, United States v.

16   Parry, construed that phrase in exactly that manner in

17   actually holding that, notwithstanding its rule in this

18   case, the applicable maximum for a defendant sentenced

19   under a mandatory guidelines system cannot be the

20   applicable guidelines maximum; It has to be the maximum

21   for the offense.   We believe that the Ninth Circuit

22   erred only insofar as it thought that that maximum is

23   the maximum to which first-time offenders were subject,

24   even for a repeat offender.

25              Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the

 1   balance of my time.

 2              JUSTICE SOUTER:             May I ask you one question

 3   before you sit down?      You mentioned a moment ago what

 4   you saw as the anomaly in the counter-argument, the

 5   anomaly being that someone with the recidivism

 6   enhancement could end up with a ten-year sentence when

 7   the maximum for the offense is five years.              But isn't --

 8   isn't the answer to that just as -- as the answer that

 9   you gave to Justice Scalia a moment ago, and that is

10   simply that the statute speaks in terms of "offense" so

11   that there is -- there is no anomaly in getting a

12   ten-year sentence for something which for this purpose

13   carries a maximum of five?

14              MR. SHANMUGAM:           Justice Souter, an enhanced

15   penalty for repeat offenders is every bit as much a

16   penalty for the offense as the lower penalty for

17   first-time offenders.

18              JUSTICE SCALIA:             Well, that's the question

19   in the case.

20              MR. SHANMUGAM:           Well, and that is a question

21   that this Court has answered in a variety of different

22   contexts dating back almost a hundred years to Graham v.

23   West Virginia.   And we would submit that that principle

24   is certainly equally applicable here, and a penalty for

25   a recidivist, while in some sense holding a recidivist


                                       25
                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   more responsible by virtue of his or her recidivist

 2   status, is every bit as much a penalty for the offense.

 3   And under our alternative maximums approach that can be

 4   the maximum for the underlying offense.

 5              I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, counsel.

 8              ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

 9                    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10              MR. ROTHFELD:           Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

11   and may it please the Court:

12              There are a number of serious problems with

13   the government's theory in this case, and I'll start

14   with this one.   It is inconsistent with the statutory

15   language of ACCA, as is suggested by the R.L.C. and

16   LaBonte decisions that have been discussed already; and

17   it cannot be reconciled with the fundamental purpose of

18   ACCA, which is reflected in that statutory language.

19              Congress enacted ACCA to target particular

20   categories of serious offenses.              Whether the defendant

21   is a repeat offender says nothing at all about the

22   seriousness of the offense that he committed and

23   therefore tells us nothing about whether that offense

24   should be treated as an ACCA --

 1   statutes:   Possession of drugs, maximum penalty five

 2   years; possession of drugs by a convicted felon, maximum

 3   -- convicted drug felon, maximum penalty ten years.               And

 4   a defendant is convicted under the latter provision.

 5   What would be the maximum penalty for ACCA purposes?

 6               MR. ROTHFELD:          Well, if that latter

 7   provision includes as an element of the offense that

 8   recidivism, that could be a different situation than we

 9   have here, because the statutory language of ACCA, as

10   Mr. Shanmugam said, focuses on "offense."               Congress said

11   that an ACCA predicate in the drug context is an offense

12   for which a maximum penalty of ten years or more is --

13               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, it could be or it

14   would be?

15               MR. ROTHFELD:          I think that's a difficult

16   question, Your Honor, which is not the question here.              I

17   suppose I would say the language would suggest that it

18   would be; that if it is an element to the offense the

19   defendant has been convicted of an offense that includes

20   recidivism as an element, that statutory language would

21   lead us in that direction.

22               JUSTICE ALITO:          Well, if the maximum penalty

23   there would be ten years, then what if in this case the

24   recidivist element had been submitted to a jury and

25   found by a jury.   Would it matter?

 1               MR. ROTHFELD:          I would suggest, again, it

 2   depends upon what the element defined by the State

 3   legislature is in creating the offense, because that

 4   follows from the ACCA term of the offense, the

 5   punishment prescribed by law for the offense.                  That is,

 6   of course, not the question here.                And it's --

 7               JUSTICE ALITO:          Why should the label matter?

 8   Maybe as to statutes that were passed before Apprendi

 9   and Booker, that at that time it made a difference.

10   But, going forward, what difference does it make whether

11   it's labelled as an element of the offense or a

12   sentencing enhancement that's proven to a jury?

13               MR. ROTHFELD:          Well, I think in the

14   post-Blakely context one could say something that has to

15   be proven to a jury is in fact an element of the

16   offense.   The offence may essentially be defined in

17   terms of the sentencing guidelines elements at that

18   point.

19               But I think in figuring what Congress had in

20   mind when it used the term defining "ACCA serious drug

21   offense" as "an offense for which a maximum penalty of

22   ten years is prescribed by law, we have to figure out

23   what is the offense and what is the penalty prescribed

24   by law for that.

 1   you first said, suppose with your own children:                 I told

 2   you half an hour ago not to interrupt your sister when

 3   she is doing her homework.           This is the second time

 4   you've done it.    Wouldn't you, with your own child -- I

 5   would with mine -- think that the second time he did it

 6   was worse behavior than the first time?                  I just told him

 7   not to.

 8                 MR. ROTHFELD:         It is a familiar example,

 9   Your Honor.

10                 (Laughter.)

11                 MR. ROTHFELD:         And -- and it's absolutely

12   right.

13                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Well, if it's absolutely

14   right I don't see why we hold Congress to some kind of

15   weird -- not weird, but more picky standard than we do

16   with our own children.

17                 MR. ROTHFELD:         But the reason for that, Your

18   Honor, in this context is the language that Congress

19   chose.    It is certainly correct that, generally

20   speaking, it is thought that repeat offenders should be

21   subject to a higher punishment, and that there is a --

22                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Because their behavior is

23   worse.

 1   serious offense.    I mean, the ACCA statutory language

 2   uses the term "serious drug offense."                    That's part of

 3   the definition That's used in the statutory text.

 4               Congress had in mind punishing through the

 5   ACCA process offenses that have a certain level of

 6   seriousness.   And when Congress did that it was

 7   reflecting on what people actually did.                    That's the

 8   whole context of this Court's --

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:             It's not a more serious

10   offense when she does it the second time; it's just a

11   more culpable offender.

12               MR. ROTHFELD:           That is precisely right.

13               JUSTICE BREYER:             That isn't what I tell my

14   child.   I say you behaved worse.

15               MR. ROTHFELD:           Well, I can't disagree with

16   that, Your Honor.    But this is -- this is --

17               JUSTICE BREYER:             Well, does the word

18   "offense" -- I haven't come across it, but does the word

19   "offense" have some kind of special technical meaning

20   that doesn't just mean the behavior which calls into

21   play all kinds of circumstances?

22               MR. ROTHFELD:           Well, I think the Court has

23   -- has repeatedly recognized the distinction suggested

24   by Justice Scalia's latest question, which is that there

25   is a difference between the offense and the offender.

 1                 As Mr. Shanmugam said -- and we agree

 2   completely -- ACCA is an offense-specific provision.                     It

 3   does not focus on the offender.                The government would

 4   like to read ACCA as though it made a distinction based

 5   upon different categories of defendants.                   And it's

 6   interesting that the way in which the question is

 7   presented in their brief and in their question presented

 8   in the petition for certiorari is not in terms of the

 9   ACCA statutory language.           It does not ask:          What is the

10   penalty prescribed by law for this offense?                   It asks:

11   Could repeat offenders be subjected to an enhanced

12   penalty of ten years?

13                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Isn't it pertinent,

14   Mr. Rothfeld, that in trying to decide whether a maximum

15   term of imprisonment encompasses recidivists, we're

16   dealing with a statute that itself is directed to

17   recidivism.     You're asking -- you've got three previous

18   convictions and then you get a particularly harsh

19   sentence.     If recidivism is what you're trying to

20   address, it would seem to me in deciding what a maximum

21   term is that it would be natural to assume that they

22   would take recidivism into consideration in that context

23   as well.

24                 MR. ROTHFELD:          Well, I think not, Your

25   Honor, because ACCA is a particular kind of recidivism


                                         31

 1   statute.   There are recidivism statutes common in the

 2   States now, with the three strikes regime becoming

 3   ubiquitous, in which all that matters is basically the

 4   number of offenses that were committed.                 The States

 5   expressly disavow the seriousness of the offenses that

 6   constitute the predicates in those kind of regime.

 7               ACCA is different kind of statute.                 ACCA was

 8   motivated because Congress was concerned that there was

 9   a small cohort of offenders who are engaging repeatedly

10   in serious offenses, and Congress had in mind that

11   people who engaged repeatedly in these especially

12   threatening, dangerous, harmful offenses, very

13   destructive to society, they should be segregated for 15

14   years through the ACCA mandatory minimum.

15               But Congress was quite clear, and the

16   statutory language reflects this expressly, that the

17   predictates have to themselves be serious offenses.

18   Congress was concerned with what people did.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, but it just

20   seems to me that if you have Congress addressing what

21   they regarded as a very serious problem of recidivism,

22   they would think that that's a problem that should be

23   taken into account in determining what maximum sentences

24   you're subject to under State law.

25               MR. ROTHFELD:          Well, they could have done


                                       32
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   that.   They could -- and that would have been the

 2   statute the government is discussing, one which ties

 3   recidivism into the particular category of the offender

 4   and the penalties to which they are subject.

 5                But Congress did not do that.               Congress

 6   focused specifically on the seriousness of each of the

 7   individual predicate offenses.               And it had in mind what

 8   people actually did, whether the kinds of offenses they

 9   were committing were serious destructive types of

10   offenses.

11                JUSTICE GINSBURG:             But it did use the

12   language "a maximum term," not "the maximum term," which

13   would support the government's view that the statute

14   contemplates more than one maximum.

15                MR. ROTHFELD:          With respect, Your Honor, I

16   would suggest that's one of the government's odder

17   arguments.    I think that reading any significance to the

18   use of "the" rather than "the" in this context is quite

19   peculiar.    I would think if a judge, for example, is

20   pronouncing sentencing he or she is likely to say "I

21   sentence you to a term of 10 years," not "I sentence you

22   to the term of 10 years."

23                Certainly the use of "I sentence you to a

24   term of 10 years" doesn't suggest some contemplation of

25   multiple alternative regimes of punishment.               So I think


                                        33
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the government, I give them kudos for creativity there,

 2   but I think it's very difficult to read any conscious

 3   choice by Congress in the use of the different article.

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Counsel, you --

 5              JUSTICE GINSBURG:              What about the

 6   defendant's own understanding?              In connection with one

 7   of these offenses the defendant acknowledged in court,

 8   the crime with which I am charged carries a maximum

 9   sentence of 10 years.

10              MR. ROTHFELD:           I think that there are two

11   things to say about that, Your Honor.                   First of all, I

12   question how seriously anyone took that statement in the

13   sentencing declaration, because what really mattered in

14   Washington State was the binding determinant sentencing

15   guideline, which set a maximum term of 57 months, which

16   everyone agrees was the highest penalty this defendant

17   could receive.   In fact, it's quite clear that, absent

18   aggravating circumstances, which are not present in this

19   case, no one convicted of this defendant's crime could

20   receive a punishment, recidivist or not, of 10 years,

21   enough to trigger the ACCA predicate.

22              So, I question again whether or not anyone

23   took that terribly seriously.             But I think even if one

24   did, it doesn't answer the question here.                   There is no

25   question that there was a recidivism provision which, at


                                       34
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   least in some theoretical sense, made the maximum

 2   penalty 10 years.    There is also a statutory provision

 3   which defined the crime.          And in that -- in that

 4   statutory provision the Washington legislature

 5   specifically associated with conviction of that offense

 6   a five-year maximum penalty.             And I think it sort of --

 7   it sort of begs the question to say, as the government

 8   does, well, the fact that there is some possibility out

 9   there of an enhancement that increases the penalty above

10   10 years, even if that were true, which is not, again

11   because of the sentencing guidelines in this case, that

12   sort of begs the question of what is the relevant

13   offense?   Is the relevant offense what you might call

14   the generic categorical offense of distribution of

15   Schedule 3, 4, or 5 drugs, the sentence to which anyone

16   convicted of that crime, anyone who engaged in the

17   elements of that offense and is found guilty in

18   Washington State could have been sentenced to, and that

19   is 5 years.

20                 JUSTICE SCALIA:           The government is correct,

21   though, that when a recidivist is sentenced he is being

22   punished for the crime, not for his recidivism.             So

23   you -- you can say that the punishment for that defined

24   crime is 10 years when, when the person who committed

25   the act is a recidivist, but the act he's being punished


                                        35
                          Alderson Reporting Company
                          Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   for is the same crime.

 2                 MR. ROTHFELD:          Well, there is no doubt about

 3   that.     The defendant here committed this offense and he

 4   is being punished for it, for that offense.                       But again,

 5   I think that begs the question here:                      When Congress uses

 6   the term "the punishment prescribed by law for the

 7   offense," what did it have in mind?                       Did it mean sort of

 8   the generic sense of the offense in the sense of the

 9   offense that anyone commits who is guilty or who commits

10   the elements of the offense, which is someone who is not

11   a recidivist.     It's entirely -- recidivism is unrelated

12   to that because recidivism is not an element of this

13   offense.

14                 So yes, the defendant here committed the

15   offense.     He's being punished for having committed this

16   offense.     But that doesn't answer the question of what

17   Congress had in mind.

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:            That's the part I'm not

19   getting.     I mean, that's why it doesn't help your

20   client.     In general, if you did read the word "offense"

21   as applying just to the act of selling drugs, let's say,

22   then you go on and it says, for which a maximum term of

23   10 years or more is prescribed, you'd say, well what is

24   the maximum term prescribed for the offense of selling

25   drugs?     And the answer would be 10 years.                   Now, how do

 1   you get out of that?

 2              MR. ROTHFELD:           Well --

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:             You're saying because --

 4   because fewer people are likely to get the 10-year

 5   sentence than get the five-year sentence?

 6              MR. ROTHFELD:           No, no, absolutely not, Your

 7   Honor.

 8              JUSTICE BREYER:             What is -- what is the

 9   distinguishing -- how do you get out of it?                   I know

10   you're trying to say this and I'm just not getting it.

11              MR. ROTHFELD:           I look at it from the

12   perspective that I think Congress looked at it when it

13   wrote the statutory language here.                 Congress had in

14   mind -- as I said to Chief Justice Roberts, Congress had

15   in mind people who engage in serious offenses.                   Congress

16   had in mind what people actually did.                   It was not

17   passing a generic -- I think it's quite clear from the

18   statutory language, it was not passing a generic three

19   strikes statute.   It was focusing on the seriousness of

20   what people did and what people actually did, what they

21   were actually convicted of doing.

22              And I think for that purpose, again the sort

23   of what you might call the generic or categorical

24   offense, the offense unrelated to recidivism

25   enhancements, is what's relevant because that is what


                                       37
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                        Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   the person actually did.         And once you bring recidivism

 2   into the picture, once when the three strikes brings

 3   recidivism into the picture, every drug distribution,

 4   every drug distribution offense, will become a serious

 5   offense within the meaning of that --

 6               JUSTICE KENNEDY:            I guess what you're saying

 7   is that if it's a victimless crime, that the second

 8   offense is no more injurious to the State than the first

 9   was.   I'm not sure that's the case.                    The fact that the

10   State sees multiple offenders, repeat offenders, in its

11   community means that they have to spend extra resources

12   to prevent -- to incarcerate them because they have a

13   network of distributors, et cetera.                     They are more

14   experienced, so they are more dangerous to the State.

15               MR. ROTHFELD:          Well, there is no question

16   that recidivism is regarded as -- as, you know, a bad

17   thing for a variety of reasons.              And that is why

18   recidivism enhancements have been -- are so common.                     And

19   no one, no one disputes that.

20               The question is when Congress wrote this

21   statutory language and wrote this particular kind of

22   recidivism offense in ACCA, it was focusing on what the

23   defendants actually did.         The recidivism enhancement is

24   entirely unrelated to that.

25               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, we know it was

 1   focusing on the particular problem of recidivism.

 2   That's what the overarching Federal statute is directed

 3   to.

 4               MR. ROTHFELD:          But --

 5               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 And I think,

 6   following up on Justice Kennedy's question, that you

 7   would assume that this Congress thought that recidivists

 8   presented particular problems that were different from

 9   the one particular offense.

10               MR. ROTHFELD:          It is that recidivism

11   statute, but it is -- again it's a particular kind of

12   recidivism statute different in character from the

13   three-strikes kind of statute, different in character

14   from the -- the drug recidivism statute in Washington

15   State, which is -- which is to be a player.                     Those

16   statutes do not care whether the predicate acts that --

17   that trigger their application were serious offenses or

18   not.   They simply ask is this -- is this defendant

19   someone who has been convicted of offenses in the past.

20               ACCA is not like that.                 ACCA specifically

21   targets serious predicate offenses.                     The -- the

22   statutory text defines two categories of predicate

23   offenses:   violent felonies, which -- which are a set of

24   especially dangerous, threatening offenses; and serious

25   drug offenses, using the term "serious in the text.                     It

 1   is clear from that Congress had in mind people who were

 2   engaged in acts that are themselves harmful,

 3   destructive, serious acts.            Under the government's

 4   application of a recidivism approach, virtually anything

 5   that someone is convicted of having to do with drug

 6   distribution -- handing a single marijuana cigarette to

 7   a friend -- that is a drug distribution offense.                   In

 8   most States that is punishable by two years, five years

 9   maximum.     Under the government's approach that is now,

10   because it could through the recidivism policy lead to a

11   10-year --

12                 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Well, but the flip

13   side of that hypothetical is somebody selling a ton of

14   marijuana.    It's the same offense as somebody who's done

15   it and been convicted of it three different times.                   I

16   mean, I don't think your hypothetical helps advance the

17   argument.

18                 MR. ROTHFELD:          Well, if -- if the crime in

19   which the individual engaged, selling a ton of

20   marijuana, is going to be punished by ten years, in

21   virtually every jurisdiction -- I would suggest in every

22   jurisdiction -- therefore it's going to be a serious

23   drug offense within the meaning of ACCA and it's going

24   to trigger ACCA as a predicate.

25                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Of course, the recidivist


                                         40

 1   doesn't necessarily be a recidivist because he committed

 2   the same crime three times.           He might have done two very

 3   different things under the California three-strike law.

 4   Sometimes very minor crimes push the person over to

 5   qualify as a recidivist.

 6              MR. ROTHFELD:          No, that's absolutely --

 7   absolutely correct.

 8              JUSTICE SOUTER:            Mr. Rothfeld, apropos of

 9   your answers to Justice -- first to Justice Scalia and

10   Justice Breyer -- you said that when the -- when the

11   recidivist is being sentenced he is being sentenced for

12   the offense of the -- of the drug crime.                  Isn't it

13   equally fair or wouldn't it be equally fair to say that

14   he is being sentenced for two things?                  He is being

15   sentenced for the drug crime which is the necessary

16   condition of the sentence; and he is also being

17   sentenced for the fact that he is repeating that crime.

18   Isn't -- isn't it fair to -- to sort of distinguish

19   between the two, in effect the two factors in the

20   offense?

21              MR. ROTHFELD:          Well, I --

22              JUSTICE SOUTER:            -- each one of which is

23   necessary for the -- for the ultimate sentence itself?

24              MR. ROTHFELD:          Well, I -- I think that

25   that's right and it is reflective of something that --

 1   discussing earlier with Justice Breyer.                  The offense

 2   itself is not regarded as a more serious offense when

 3   it's committed by a recidivist.               It's because the

 4   recidivist's character as a repeat offender is what

 5   triggers the higher penalty; and in the ACCA context

 6   where Congress was focusing on whether or not this

 7   person was engaging in particular kinds of crimes,

 8   particular kinds of serious crimes, that makes all the

 9   difference.

10                 I -- I return to cases that some members of

11   the Court were discussing with Mr. Shanmugam, the

12   LaBonte case.    The Government would like to focus on the

13   status of this defendant as a repeat offender.                 That's

14   what triggers in their view the application of ACCA;

15   because he is a repeat offender he is in a class of

16   defendants who are subject to higher punishment,

17   therefore 10-year ACCA trigger.

18                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Well, I'm not sure the

19   offense is the same.       I think the injury to the State is

20   compounded by the repetition.

21                 MR. ROTHFELD:         Well, I --

22                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:           It affects the tone of the

23   community, the number of law enforcement officers we

24   have to have, the cost of reincarceration,

25   rehabilitation, etcetera.

 1                 MR. ROTHFELD:          Well, I think -- again, I

 2   don't disagree with any of that, as to the consequence

 3   of a repeat offense.        My question is whether Congress,

 4   when it used the term serious offense, whether it

 5   thought the offense itself was more serious, as distinct

 6   from punishment that might -- that might be imposed upon

 7   the offender.

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:             But that's what I'm

 9   addressing.     It could be more serious when it's the

10   second time.

11                 MR. ROTHFELD:          Well, I --

12                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:            The offense in and of

13   itself.

14                 MR. ROTHFELD:          I think it's -- it's

15   instructive to look at the statute in the LaBonte case

16   which was -- which discussed during Mr. Shanmugam's

17   argument, in which --

18                 JUSTICE STEVENS:            Then for double jeopardy

19   purposes you must look at the second offense as the

20   offense, not the offender.            I mean, the prior conduct is

21   -- is not being punished as a matter of constitutional

22   law.

23                 MR. ROTHFELD:          No.      I -- I think that it's

24   quite clear in the cases that are -- and we agree by

25   cases cited by the Government for this proposition --

 1   that when you are sentenced as a recidivist to a higher

 2   penalty you are being punished for the most recent

 3   offense that you were -- that you were --

 4              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                    Counsel, if you were

 5   representing a -- a defendant who has two prior

 6   convictions for something that has a sentence of 8

 7   years, and on the third one he is subject to a sentence

 8   of 15 years; and your initial meeting, the first thing

 9   he wants to know is what's the maximum that I'm facing?

10   Would you tell him it's 8 years or would you tell him

11   it's 15 years?

12              MR. ROTHFELD:             Well, I would say that

13   because you are a recidivist the maximum you are facing

14   is 15 years.     But I would not say that the offense that

15   you committed is a more serious offense because you are

16   a repeat offender.      And and the LaBonte statute I think

17   illustrates this very nicely.               In the -- in the statute

18   the Court construed in LaBonte it referred to the

19   maximum term of imprisonment for specified categories of

20   defendants; and the Court found that language was

21   crucial because it showed that Congress contemplated

22   that there would be different terms of imprisonment for

23   defendants falling into different categories for the

24   same offense.

25              JUSTICE SOUTER:               Mr. Rothfeld, let's assume

 1   we get into conference and we are having exactly the

 2   same discussion that's been going on for 40 minutes

 3   there.     There is one way to read it; there is another

 4   way to read it; there are various reasons to read it one

 5   way, various ways to read it the other way.                     What do we

 6   do?

 7                 MR. ROTHFELD:          Well, I -- I would suggest

 8   that this Court need go no further at that point,

 9   because the rule of lenity would dictate ruling for us.

10   Absolutely.    It's --

11                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            But you don't have to win

12   this argument?

13                 MR. ROTHFELD:          We do not.           I think one way

14   to consider the case is that there in fact are three

15   statutes which bear on the question of penalty.                     There

16   is the statute that created the crime of conviction,

17   which created the -- the offense of a distribution of a

18   schedule of 3, 4, or 5 drugs, and in that statute

19   specifically associated with the offense is the 5-year

20   penalty.    There is the 10-year, potential 10-year

21   penalty which is focused -- focus of the Government's

22   case.    There is the Washington State sentencing

23   guidelines, which were binding, determinate guidelines,

24   every bit as much part of Washington statutory law as

25   the recidivism statute --

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Counsel, the

 2   Government of course responds to your rule of lenity

 3   argument by saying it loses a lot of its force when we

 4   are talking about how -- the degree of sentencing rather

 5   than whether conduct is subject to a criminal sanction

 6   in the first place.

 7              MR. ROTHFELD:          They do say that, Your Honor,

 8   and I think that's simply not so.               I mean, the Court has

 9   said repeatedly and has applied repeatedly the doctrine

10   that the rule of lenity applies when the only question

11   is the length of the sentence; and indeed the R.L.C.

12   case which the Government has been discussing was a case

13   which involved only a question of length of the sentence

14   and --

15              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  But someone who is,

16   you know, we are trying to decide whether he is subject

17   to 20 years in jail or 30 years in jail, invoking the

18   rule of lenity is a little bit -- it's not the same as

19   somebody who comes in and says I didn't know this was a

20   crime at all, because it's so vaguely written.

21              MR. ROTHFELD:          I think the Court has said

22   consistently that one of the elements supporting the

23   rule of lenity is the idea that somebody's liberty is

24   going to be taken away, that Congress should have

25   spoken, to some degree --

 1              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, we know -- we

 2   know that someone's liberty is going to be taken away in

 3   a case like this; it's just a question of for how long.

 4              MR. ROTHFELD:           Well, but -- but it's a

 5   profound difference.      I mean, a the conviction of a

 6   felony possession of a gun, the variations in penalty

 7   can be zero.   Absent ACCA, you could be sentenced to

 8   probation, maximum of 10 years, as opposed to the

 9   mandatory minimum 15-year sentence under ACCA.                     That's a

10   profound deprivation of liberty based upon how -- what

11   reading you give to these words.               So -- and again --

12              JUSTICE SCALIA:             I think we have applied the

13   rule of lenity to sentencing in the past, haven't we?

14              MR. ROTHFELD:           Absolutely.           Again we cite a

15   number of cases in our briefs, the Bifulco case -- but

16   the R.L.C. case, which both parties have discussed at

17   some length, is a prime element in which --

18              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  It is -- it is a

19   fundamental verbal embarrassment for your argument that

20   you would say in a particular case that the maximum to

21   which someone is subject is say, 5 years, and that

22   person is in fact sentenced to 15 years.                   It's just the

23   -- the words don't fit together under that argument.

24              MR. ROTHFELD:           Well, I --           I am not

25   embarrassed by that, Your Honor.               Perhaps I, I'm too

 1   resistant to embarrassment.              But I --

 2                 (Laughter.)

 3                 MR. ROTHFELD: -- I think it's -- it's

 4   entirely a question of how you take the congressional

 5   meaning of the term punishment prescribed for the

 6   offense.

 7                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            No, but I thought your

 8   position was that the -- the defendant is not, this

 9   defendant is not subject to a maximum of 5 years, but

10   gets 10.     I thought your position was that the offense

11   within the meaning of the statute should be an offense

12   which carries a maximum of 5 years, but that this

13   defendant is in fact subject to a maximum of 10.

14                 MR. ROTHFELD:          I --

15                 JUSTICE SOUTER:            In other words, you can --

16   throughout your argument you make, I think properly, the

17   offense/offender distinction, and isn't that the answer

18   to the conundrum?

19                 MR. ROTHFELD:          That -- that is exactly

20   right.     We think that what Congress had in mind when it

21   referred to the punishment prescribed by law for the

22   offense it was referring to the offense, the offense of

23   conviction; and it never --

24                 JUSTICE ALITO:          The offense never -- the

25   offense also disregards offender characteristics, or

 1   only those offender characteristics that are not

 2   elements of the offense?

 3                 MR. ROTHFELD:         Well again, that's -- that's

 4   where we started, Justice Alito.

 5                 JUSTICE ALITO:         I'm still not sure what the

 6   line is there.

 7                 MR. ROTHFELD:         I -- I think if it is an

 8   element of the offense then you would be convicted of an

 9   offense which carried in its weight recidivism, and so I

10   would say yes, in that circumstance that would be a

11   different situation than what we have here.

12                 JUSTICE ALITO:         It all depends whether it's

13   labelled an element of the offense by the State

14   legislature?

15                 MR. ROTHFELD:         Well, I think that whether it

16   actually is an element of the offence -- I mean, in this

17   case there is no question; everyone agrees it's not in

18   the offense; the Government concedes that it's not an

19   element to the offense.

20                 JUSTICE BREYER:           So it's bank robbery --

21   bank robbery, force or threat of force guidelines.                  If

22   you have a gun, eight years.             If you brandish it, four

23   more years.    If you take, you know, $10 as opposed to

24   $50, two years, eight years, six years.                  The statute, by

25   the way, says a max of 20 years.                Now, what's the --

 1   what's -- does this fall within it?                      Doesn't it?   Does

 2   it depend on whether he brandished it?                      What does it

 3   depend on, in your view?

 4                 MR. ROTHFELD:         Well, I'm glad you bring up

 5   the guidelines, Your Honor, because I think that that is

 6   an element that we haven't discussed at some length.

 7   The government's test is what is the penalty that the

 8   defendant actually faced.           I mean that's their --

 9                 JUSTICE BREYER:           Or what he actually faced

10   -- that, I agree with you, that won't work because of

11   the guidelines, if they were mandatory.                     But what

12   they're saying here is it's right in the statute.                      You

13   just look at the statute that has the definition of what

14   the offense is.

15                 MR. ROTHFELD:         Aha, but it's not the

16   definition of the offense.           This statute -- the

17   definition of the offense is --

18                 JUSTICE BREYER:           No, I'm back to the same

19   question then.    I mean which one do we pick?

20                 MR. ROTHFELD:         I -- I guess there are two

21   points here -- the first on the question of the

22   guidelines.    To the extent that the government believes

23   in its test, which is what is the sentence that the

24   defendant actually faced, there is no question that the

25   sentence the defendant actually faced here was 57

 1   months, well below the 10-year ACCA trigger.               And the

 2   government does not offer any explanation that I can

 3   understand as to why, if their test applies, one takes

 4   recidivism enhancements into effect, but does not take

 5   guidelines reductions into effect.

 6               JUSTICE BREYER:            You see that my question is

 7   going in the exact opposite way.               What I am finding hard

 8   is once you distinguish offender and offense

 9   characteristics in the way you do, why not jump to the

10   max for the offense?      And so I'm asking you, how is it

11   you get out of that?      Which is the same question I had

12   before.   I'm not so worried about your case as I am

13   other cases.

14               MR. ROTHFELD:          Well, the way -- the way we

15   resolve that, Justice Breyer, is what was suggested by

16   Justice Souter's question.          What Congress had in mind

17   was the offense without the overlay of a recidivism

18   enhancement, which is not an element of this offense.

19   One looks at the offense, one looks at the commission of

20   the elements, if you commit the elements, what does that

21   subject -- what kind of punishment does that subject you

22   to?   If it's less than 10 years, ACCA does not apply.

23   If you have to call into the mix enhancements that are

24   unrelated, that are offender-specific and not

25   offense-specific, that's falls out because that's not


                                       51
                         Alderson Reporting Company
                         Official - Subject to Final Review


 1   what Congress had in mind when it referred to

 2   "punishment prescribed by law for the offense."

 3   Again, Congress had in mind a limited series of serious

 4   offenses.    It was looking at what people did, whether

 5   they engaged in the kind of serious, harmful,

 6   destructive conduct that was sufficiently bad to trigger

 7   the mandatory 15-year sentence, and if they did not, the

 8   fact that some additional overlay could be used to

 9   enhance their sentence is not what Congress was

10   concerned about when it listed ACCA predicates.

11                And, again, I don't want to fall away from

12   the Sentencing Guidelines point because, as I understood

13   Mr. Shanmugam's explanation to Justice Scalia as to why

14   the Guidelines should not apply if enhancement does is

15   because, well, this is an offender-specific -- an

16   offense-specific crime, and Congress at the time that it

17   enacted ACCA had in mind that guidelines in the

18   statutory regime were different.

19                But so far as the -- the offense has been

20   defined by the -- by the statute, the relevant offense

21   here is the five-year penalty associated with that

22   offense.    And so I think that if one is going to go

23   beyond that and say we are going to look for things that

24   are outside of the offense, not in the elements of the

25   offense, to increase the sentence, as the government


                                        52
                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   does with the recidivism statute, there is no reason

 2   why, if we are prepared to go outside of the offense

 3   elements, that one wouldn't go to the Guidelines as

 4   well, which have precisely the same effect in the other

 5   way.   I mean the government ultimately is asking for --

 6   a one-way ratchet that if it increases the offense

 7   level, that's okay, but if it decreases the punishment

 8   for some reason, that doesn't apply.                     And we just don't

 9   see any principled basis for that.

10               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Well, no, I thought

11   their argument was you look at broad categories rather

12   than individual characteristics.                It's not a one-way

13   ratchet at all.

14               MR. ROTHFELD:           Well, I think, in terms of

15   discussion of the Guidelines, they suggest that what

16   matters is whether it is an element of the offense.                       I

17   thought that's what Mr. Shanmugam's response was.                    And

18   it is not an element of the offense here.                    Thank you.

19               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                  Thank you, counsel.

 1   Justice.

 2              There are just two points that I'd like to

 3   make in rebuttal:

 4              The first is that the government believes

 5   that the rule of lenity is inapplicable here for the

 6   simple reason that we believe that the text of the

 7   statute is not susceptible to Respondent's

 8   interpretation.     And if the Court concludes that the

 9   statute does permit the interpretation that a given

10   offense can have only a single maximum term of

11   imprisonment, we believe that the only logical

12   conclusion is that that maximum is the maximum that any

13   offender could receive, not that the maximum -- not that

14   it is the maximum that some better-positioned subset of

15   offenders could receive.           And while we do believe that

16   the considerations that underlie the rule of lenity have

17   less force in this context, and the Court has never

18   applied the rule of lenity to the ACCA, we ultimately

19   believe that the fact that the text does not permit

20   Respondent's interpretation is the end of the inquiry.

21              The other point that I would just make is

22   that if this Court were to adopt Respondent's

23   interpretation, it would have pernicious consequences,

24   not only for the ACCA, but likely also for a number of

25   other critically important Federal statutes as well.


                                         54

 1   With regard to the ACCA itself, both the definition of

 2   "serious drug offense" and the definition of "violent

 3   felony" are framed in terms of the maximum term of

 4   imprisonment for the offense, and at least 28 States and

 5   the Federal Government have drug-trafficking offenses

 6   that would qualify as ACCA predicates for repeat

 7   offenders under the government's interpretation but not

 8   under Respondent's.     And with regard to other statutes

 9   similar language appears --

10              JUSTICE SCALIA:             That's good or bad,

11   depending upon whether -- whether your interpretation of

12   the statute is right or the other side's.

13              MR. SHANMUGAM:           Well --

14              JUSTICE SCALIA:             It's good to put more

15   people in jail?   I mean, that isn't necessarily what

16   we're after.   We're --

17              MR. SHANMUGAM:           I mean only to highlight the

18   practical significance of this issue, Justice Scalia,

19   and again, certainly in enacting a statute that itself

20   deals with the problem of recidivism, we believe that

21   Congress would not have wanted to be insensitive to an

22   offender's past recidivism.

23              But with regard to other statutes, I want to

24   note that similar language also appears in the Federal

25   three-strikes law and in the Controlled Substances Act,


                                       55

 1   which along with the ACCA, are among the most important

 2   Federal statutes dealing with a problem of recidivism.

 3   And similar language also appears in a number of general

 4   Federal criminal statutes, including RICO and the very

 5   substantive statute at issue here, the felony possession

 6   statute.   And if this Court were to adopt the Ninth

 7   Circuit's interpretation, it could potentially lead to

 8   the narrowing of all of those statutes as well.                 The

 9   Ninth Circuit, alone among the circuits, has adopted

10   this view that the relevant maximum for an offense must

11   be the maximum that first-time offenders receive.                We

12   believe that that is erroneous and that the judgment of

13   the Ninth Circuit should be reversed.

14               Thank you.

15               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:                 Thank you,

16   Mr. Shanmugam.   The case is submitted.

17               (Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the case in the
