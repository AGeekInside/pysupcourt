 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Case 08-1224, United States v.

 5   Comstock.

 6               General Kagan.

 7                ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. ELENA KAGAN

 8                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 9               GENERAL KAGAN:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may

10   it please the Court:

11               Article I of the Constitution permits

12   Congress to enact section 4248, which is the limited

13   Federal civil commitment statute at issue in this

14   case.

15               To see why, to understand the basis for this

16   statute, it might be helpful to go all the way back to

17   1945, when what this Court later called "a

18   conspicuously able committee of Federal judges"

19   recommended that Congress pass section 4246, a very

20   similar civil commitment law that has been on the

21   books for some 60 years.

22               The committee there wrote that the law was

23   necessary to deal with what it called the serious

24   problem of what to do with insane criminals -- and I'm

25   quoting now -- "upon the expiration of their terms of

                                      3

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   confinement, where it would be dangerous to turn them

 2   loose upon society and where no State will assume

 3   responsibility for their custody."

 4              That is exactly what Congress concluded

 5   here.   Congress could reasonably find that section

 6   4248 was necessary to prevent a similar problem.            The

 7   Federal Government has mentally ill, sexually

 8   dangerous persons in its custody.            It knows that those

 9   persons, if released, will commit serious sexual

10   offenses; and it knows too that States are often not

11   in a position to deal with such dangers, not in a

12   position to take custody and care and responsibility

13   for those persons upon release from Federal prison.

14              This is essentially a transitional problem

15   that the Court was -- that the Congress was dealing

16   with, how to manage the transition from Federal

17   custody to State superintendence and responsibility.

18              JUSTICE KENNEDY:         Well, is part of the

19   statutory scheme that you can be committed to Federal

20   custody for, say, a year and then the State takes it

21   over?

22              GENERAL KAGAN:     That is correct, Justice

23   Kennedy.   In fact, what the statute requires is for

24   the Attorney General really to -- immediately upon

25   commitment, to go to a State, if he hasn't done so

                                     4

 1   beforehand -- to go to two States, the State of

 2   domicile and the State of prior conviction.

 3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:          Why would a State want to

 4   incur that extra expense if --

 5             GENERAL KAGAN:      Well --

 6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:          -- if the Federal

 7   Government is going to do it for them?

 8             GENERAL KAGAN:      What Congress found was that

 9   States often were not willing to incur that extra

10   expense, even if the Federal Government was not going

11   to do that for them, and what this legislation was,

12   was a response to that reality.           It was --

13             JUSTICE GINSBURG:          What was the experience

14   under 4246?   You pointed out that that has been on the

15   books for some time, and there efforts must be made to

16   have the State take the person.

17             When the civil commitment is used following

18   the end of a term -- let's say someone is insane --

19   how often does it end up that the State takes

20   responsibility and how often is it that the person

21   stays in Federal custody?

22             GENERAL KAGAN:      I think it is unusual,

23   Justice Ginsburg.   It's not the usual course that the

24   State does take responsibility.           But the Federal

25   statute commits the Attorney General and the Bureau of

                                     5

 1   Prisons to try to persuade a State to take custody, to

 2   defer to the State if a State has some reason to take

 3   custody, but -- but makes sure that the Federal

 4   Government is a kind of backstop, so that if the State

 5   does not take responsibility and does not take

 6   custody, the Federal Government will ensure that the

 7   person will not be released, the person who has been

 8   found to be both mentally ill and sexually --

 9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:        But the likelihood is

10   that the person will stay in Federal custody?

11             GENERAL KAGAN:     I think that that's fair,

12   that the likelihood is that the person will stay in

13   Federal custody until such time as a court finds that

14   the reasons for that custody have lapsed.        But, again,

15   the State always has the ability to come in and say:

16   We would like to take control over this person.        And

17   more to the point, the Attorney General has the

18   responsibility to keep going to the State and to try

19   to see if he can transfer custody to the State.

20             JUSTICE SCALIA:      What -- what -- what power

21   conferred upon the Federal Government by the

22   Constitution permits the Federal Government to assure

23   that sexual predators are not at large?

24             GENERAL KAGAN:     I think the power, Justice

25   Scalia, is the power to run a responsible criminal

                                    6

 1   justice system, to run a criminal justice system that

 2   does not itself endanger the public.

 3               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          So you would say

 4   that the Federal Government has no such power

 5   independent of the criminal conviction?              In other

 6   words, that Congress could not pass a law saying, just

 7   as this one says, we are going to commit people who

 8   are sexually dangerous until a determination that they

 9   are not or until the State can take them?              That power

10   would not be in Article I?

11               GENERAL KAGAN:     Without the person having

12   entered the criminal justice system in any way.

13               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          Right.    I understand

14   your argument to be that this power is necessary and

15   proper, given the fact that the person is in Federal

16   custody for some other reason, criminal conviction.

17               GENERAL KAGAN:     That has been the

18   government's case throughout this litigation, that it

19   has always depended on the fact of Federal custody, on

20   the fact that this person has entered the criminal

21   justice system, has been -- four of the five of these

22   people --

23               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          Yes.

24               GENERAL KAGAN:     -- have been convicted and

25   have served prison terms.        And the question really is,

                                      7

 1   well, given that, given that the Federal Government

 2   has custody of these people, that it's difficult for

 3   the States to -- to take responsibility for these

 4   people after the prison term is finished.

 5                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            Well, why doesn't

 6   the Federal Government's authority to have custody

 7   because of the criminal justice system end when the

 8   criminal justice system is exhausted?                In other words,

 9   when the sentence is done?

10                GENERAL KAGAN:       Because the Federal

11   Government has a responsibility to ensure that release

12   of the people it has in its custody is done

13   responsibly, is done in such a way --

14                JUSTICE SCALIA:        But you said no.        I mean,

15   there is no constitutional power on the part of the

16   Federal Government to protect society from sexual

17   predators.     And, you know, once the Federal custody is

18   at an end, it seems to me that's the only power you

19   could be relying upon.

20                GENERAL KAGAN:       I think that the power to

21   run a responsible criminal justice system extends to

22   the way in which the Federal Government releases these

23   prisoners.     And --

24                JUSTICE KENNEDY:           Could the Federal

25   Government order a commitment of anyone who's been in

                                         8

 1   Federal custody over the last 10 years?

 2             GENERAL KAGAN:     Justice Kennedy, I think

 3   that that would be a much harder case.           There are some

 4   people, of course, who are on supervised release and,

 5   for example --

 6             JUSTICE KENNEDY:         No, no, no.   That makes

 7   your -- my hypo too easy for you.

 8             (Laughter.)

 9             GENERAL KAGAN:     Okay.       Well, I'll grab your

10   difficult hypo, then.   And I would say that that would

11   be a different case and that the Federal Government

12   would not have the -- the power to commit a person who

13   is -- has been released from prison and whose period

14   of supervised release is also completed.          At that

15   point, the release has been -- the transfer to State

16   responsibility and State control has occurred, and the

17   Federal Government would have no appropriate role.

18             JUSTICE KENNEDY:         So that must be because

19   there is a lack of Federal power.

20             GENERAL KAGAN:     Yes, I think that that's

21   correct, that at that point the State police power

22   over a person has been fully reestablished.

23             JUSTICE SCALIA:      But it's fully

24   reestablished once he walks out of Federal prison, at

25   least if he walks out of Federal prison into a State.

 1             GENERAL KAGAN:     I think that that's not

 2   right, Justice Scalia.     I think that there is a

 3   transition period, and what this statute is designed

 4   to do is to deal with that transition period and to

 5   make sure that sexually dangerous, mentally ill people

 6   don't fall through the cracks between Federal custody

 7   and the reestablishment of State control.

 8             JUSTICE SCALIA:      Well, but they don't fall

 9   through the cracks if the Federal Government notifies

10   the State into which this prisoner is to be released:

11   We are going to release a prisoner; we think he's

12   sexually dangerous; you should take some action to be

13   sure that he doesn't harm society.              Because that's a

14   State police function, it's none of our business.

15             GENERAL KAGAN:     I think Congress could

16   reasonably find that that is insufficient.              Congress

17   could reasonably find that the State -- that the

18   relationship between the State and the individual has

19   been sufficiently disrupted as a result of what is in

20   many of these cases an extended period of Federal

21   custody, that it's not so easy to establish --

22   reestablish it all at once.        And I would point to you

23   as proof of this the supervised release system itself.

24             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Under your theory --

25   under the theory that you are proposing, then, any

                                   10

 1   dangerous person, whether it's because of mental

 2   illness or any other reason, could be held

 3   indefinitely --

 4             GENERAL KAGAN:        No --

 5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              -- under a civil

 6   commitment statute, because what you're saying is that

 7   the Federal Government, merely because of their --

 8   their time in control of the individual, has an

 9   unlimited constitutional power to then civilly commit

10   this dangerous person.

11             GENERAL KAGAN:        I think what would prevent

12   that, Justice Sotomayor, is the Due Process Clause.

13   It is obviously the case that there are other

14   constraints on governmental action than Article I.

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Well, what -- what

16   constrains the government under the Due Process Clause

17   from invoking a dangerousness merely because someone

18   has a long history.     We have many criminal defendants

19   with long histories of violent behavior.              Many of them

20   continue that violent behavior in prison, and some of

21   them at the end of their term are let out, because

22   their term has been completed.              So what -- what in

23   the Due Process Clause protects --

24             GENERAL KAGAN:        Well, I think that the

25   history of this Court's cases would suggest that if

                                      11

 1   this were a person without mental illness that the

 2   civil commitment statutes --

 3              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           But that's where I'm

 4   trying to understand --

 5              GENERAL KAGAN:     Yes, that the civil --

 6              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           -- the connection

 7   between the nature of the mental illness and the

 8   constitutional power that you are claiming.            What --

 9   what is it that gives you that power?

10              GENERAL KAGAN:     Well, if you go back to a

11   case like Kansas v. Hendricks, which is of course

12   where this Court thought about civil commitment

13   statutes with relation to sexually dangerous

14   offenders, I think the Court made clear that it was

15   important in that case that there be not only sexual

16   dangerousness, but also mental illness, in order to

17   invoke the civil commitment statutes.

18              JUSTICE GINSBURG:        Are you saying that as

19   far as those limitations, the question that Justice

20   Sotomayor was asking, the limitations on the Federal

21   Government would be the same as they are on the

22   States?   But that's a different question from whether

23   the Federal Government has any power at all.

24              GENERAL KAGAN:     You said it better than I

25   did, Justice Ginsburg.      That's exactly right, that of

                                    12

                         Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   course there are constraints on the Federal Government

 2   in using civil commitment statutes, that they are the

 3   same as the -- the constitutional constraints on the

 4   States when they use that power.             But this is a

 5   different question.     The question presented here is

 6   only whether -- assuming that the Federal Government

 7   is acting within other constitutional constraints in

 8   making this civil commitment, whether Article I

 9   enables it to do so because of the special custodial

10   role in these cases.     And --

11              JUSTICE SCALIA:        General Kagan, you are

12   relying on the Necessary and Proper Clause, right?

13   You say:   But "necessary and proper" doesn't mean it's

14   necessary and proper for the good of society.              It

15   means it's necessary and proper for the execution of

16   another power that the Federal Government is given by

17   the Constitution.

18              Now, why is this necessary for the execution

19   of any Federal power?      The Federal criminal proceeding

20   has terminated.     The individual is released.           You

21   could say it's necessary for the good of society, but

22   that's not what the Federal Government is charged

23   with.   Why is it necessary to any function that the

24   Federal Government is performing?              It has completed

25   its performance of the function of incarcerating this

                                      13

 1   individual until he has served his punishment.

 2              GENERAL KAGAN:     The Court has always said,

 3   Justice Scalia, that the Necessary and Proper Clause,

 4   the question is, is it necessary and proper to the

 5   beneficial exercise of Federal powers?           And so this

 6   is, that it is necessary and proper to the beneficial

 7   or, what I said before, the responsible exercise of

 8   the Federal power to operate a criminal justice

 9   system, which includes the responsibility to ensure

10   that those people who have been in custody in that

11   Federal -- in that criminal justice system are not

12   released irresponsibly.

13              JUSTICE ALITO:     Isn't it the case that --

14              JUSTICE KENNEDY:       But the brief -- excuse

15   me.

16              JUSTICE ALITO:     Well, I was going to ask, is

17   it the case that the unwillingness of States to step

18   into this area in these instances is a consequence, at

19   least in part and perhaps in large part, of the

20   Federal incarceration, that as a result of the Federal

21   incarceration, the person is no longer viewed by the

22   State as -- as having domicile within the State, the

23   State of prior domicile has no way of knowing whether

24   that person would return to a domicile in the prior

25   State?   Is that -- do you think that is a fair

                                    14

 1   understanding of the reason for the enactment of this?

 2               GENERAL KAGAN:     Just to make sure that I

 3   understand the question, that the reason for the

 4   enactment in part has to do with the fact that the

 5   Federal Government has assumed custodial

 6   responsibility and has disrupted the relationship

 7   between the State and the citizen, I think that that's

 8   exactly right, Justice Alito.

 9               But in some sense, it's not just that the

10   Federal system finds itself in possession and custody

11   of these people, but the Federal -- what Congress

12   could reasonably find is that the Federal Government

13   knows that there's nobody else to take appropriate

14   custody and care and that the reason that there's

15   nobody else to take appropriate custody and care has

16   to do with the Federal action itself.

17               JUSTICE GINSBURG:        So, is the prisoner --

18               CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          So, if there were --

19               JUSTICE GINSBURG:        Is it -- is it a prisoner

20   who has served his time in, say, a Federal

21   penitentiary in Ohio but is a domiciliary of Arizona,

22   what happens when the prisoner is released, say, after

23   10 years?    Released to Ohio, sent back to Arizona?

24   What?

25               GENERAL KAGAN:     The default position is that

                                     15

                          Alderson Reporting Company

 1   the prisoner is released to the place where the

 2   prisoner was convicted.    Now, that -- the prisoner may

 3   or may not have any relationship with that State.                 The

 4   person may have lived there, may not have lived there.

 5             The -- the Federal prison system does

 6   sometimes make other arrangements.              The idea behind

 7   any release is to try to make sure that the person is

 8   released to the place where a -- a future lawful life

 9   will be most likely.   But in many of these cases, the

10   prisoner ends up being released to a State that has no

11   current relationship with the -- with the prisoner,

12   sometimes has had -- never had any relationship with

13   the prisoner, and at any rate doesn't now, because the

14   period of Federal custody has disrupted that

15   relationship.

16             And what the Federal Government is doing

17   here is essentially to deal with this transition

18   problem to make -- to make sure these people don't

19   fall between the -- the cracks, and to ensure that

20   where there is a sexually violent and mentally ill

21   person who one has reason to believe will commit

22   further offenses, that appropriate care and custody of

23   those people is ensured.

24             Now, this is no different from what Congress

25   has done on other occasions as well.              This is not the

                                   16

 1   first such Federal civil commitment statute.          This is

 2   not a newfangled thing.    Section 4248 is identical in

 3   -- in all relevant constitutional respects to section

 4   4246, which is the general civil commitment statute

 5   for mentally ill, dangerous people generally, not with

 6   any sexual --

 8             GENERAL KAGAN:     -- component to it.

 9             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          I understood you in

10   your response to Justice Alito to say, if I remember,

11   that it was not just the fact of Federal custody, but

12   the fact that there are no States or there may well

13   often be no States willing.        What if every State is

14   willing; I mean, every State is willing to take the

15   people on out of a concern to protect their citizens.

16   Does that somehow mean there's no necessary and proper

17   power?

18             GENERAL KAGAN:     I think when we are dealing

19   with the Necessary and Proper Clause, we are asking

20   ourselves whether Congress reasonably acted in a given

21   situation --

22             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          I guess it wouldn't

23   be necessary, is what you are saying?

24             GENERAL KAGAN:     Well, if -- if -- that's

25   exactly right, that if the facts before Congress were

 1   such that there were no difficulty with this

 2   transition period and that nobody ever fell between

 3   the cracks, an entirely different question would be

 4   presented, and then there would be some kind of

 5   argument that at that point, in those circumstances

 6   State police power would be the appropriate default

 7   position.    But --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:       General Kagan, I -- I find

 9   it difficult to believe that if the Federal Bureau of

10   Prisons wrote the governor of the State into which

11   this person is to be released, and they try to release

12   him in the State where he -- he will in the future

13   reside, and said, we are about to release this person

14   in 60 days or whatever, in our view there are serious

15   mental problems, and we think the State ought to

16   consider commitment proceedings, I find it difficult

17   to believe that an elected governor or an elected

18   attorney general would ignore that letter.

19               GENERAL KAGAN:      I do believe, Justice

20   Scalia, that Congress reasonably could have found that

21   there were difficulties in making this transition.

22   The cost of commitment of these people is very high,

23   much higher than standard incarceration.           I believe

24   the States say in their amicus brief that it's some

25   $65,000 a year per person per year, and -- and the

                                      18

 1   State may feel as though it shouldn't have

 2   responsibility over this person --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:      The governor is going to

 4   say that at the next election:           It would have cost too

 5   much to put this guy up.

 6               GENERAL KAGAN:     Well, I think people ­

 7   people make judgments --

 8               JUSTICE SCALIA:      You know, it costs $65,000.

 9               GENERAL KAGAN:     People make judgments all

10   the time.    And I think there's -- there's no evidence

11   to suggest that Congress was not acting reasonably in

12   understanding this as a significant problem.           And --

13               JUSTICE GINSBURG:        Was it -- was that a

14   consideration?    You mentioned that this originated,

15   4246, with a -- with a committee of judges who said,

16   we have a problem.    Did they --

17               GENERAL KAGAN:     That is exactly right,

18   Justice Ginsburg, and maybe that's the -- the best

19   answer to Justice Scalia, is history, and it's history

20   on two separate occasions, which this Court has noted.

21               It's history when -- when this committee of

22   Federal judges chaired by Calvert Magruder, including

23   Learned Hand, said we have a real problem here with

24   people being let go out of the Federal system and the

25   States not stepping forward and taking responsibility

                                     19

 1   for them.     And the Court confronted and -- and thought

 2   about the exact same problem when Congress passed in

 3   1984 section 4243, which is the civil commitment

 4   statute that applies to insanity acquittees, people

 5   who are acquitted on the basis of insanity.

 6               And this Court in Shannon said that, I think

 7   the -- the language is, "Federal courts decried time

 8   and again the gaping statutory hole," that is the hole

 9   that -- that existed because people were acquitted on

10   the basis of insanity and -- and States were not

11   willing to step forward and take custody of those

12   people in the way that they would have taken custody

13   of those people if they had been acquitted of insanity

14   in the State court systems.

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:       I must say I'm -- I'm not

16   terribly impressed with -- with the argument --

17               GENERAL KAGAN:      I can tell, Justice Scalia.

18               JUSTICE SCALIA:       -- the States won't do it.

19               (Laughter.)

20               JUSTICE SCALIA:       I mean, this -- this is a

21   recipe for the Federal Government taking over

22   everything.

23               GENERAL KAGAN:      No, I --

24               JUSTICE SCALIA:       The States won't do it;

25   therefore, we have to do it.              It has to be done, and

                                      20

 1   therefore the Federal Government steps in and does it.

 2              GENERAL KAGAN:     I don't think so, Justice

 3   Scalia.   I think, in fact, that -- that Congress on

 4   each of these three occasions has limited the civil

 5   commitment power only to people who have been -- who

 6   are in the custody of the Federal Government and over

 7   whom the Federal Government has a distinctive

 8   responsibility.

 9              I will give you an example, Justice Scalia.

10   I mean, suppose that there was some very contagious

11   form of drug-resistant tuberculosis that had -- had

12   become prevalent in the prison system, and States were

13   not able to deal with that, with quarantining these

14   people upon their release date, and Congress said:

15   You know, the best thing to do is to have the Federal

16   Government act as the appropriate quarantining

17   authority because we don't think that States are able

18   to step up and deal with this problem.

19              Would anybody say that the Federal

20   Government would not have Article I power to effect

21   that kind of public safety measure?              And the exact

22   same thing is true here.      This is exactly what

23   Congress is doing here, is to make sure that mentally

24   ill, sexually dangerous --

25              JUSTICE KENNEDY:       Well, when I was thinking

 1   about your hypothetical, I thought, well, that's a

 2   pretty easy commerce power argument.              I -- I notice

 3   that in -- in the government's position, you don't

 4   argue the Commerce Clause very much, and I -- we've

 5   got Morrison v. Brzonkala looking at you and Printz

 6   and so forth.

 7               But it -- suppose Congress said there is a

 8   class of committable, dangerous sex offenders that are

 9   crossing State lines and using interstate facilities,

10   and made those findings.       Would that be sufficient to

11   establish a Federal commitment law?

12               GENERAL KAGAN:     Well, as you say, Justice

13   Kennedy, the government has never argued the Commerce

14   Clause here in the sense that it has never argued that

15   these activities have a substantial effect on

16   interstate commerce, and it hasn't done so because of

17   the Morrison -- the Morrison precedent.

18               The Commerce Clause I think is relevant in

19   two ways.    It's relevant first because, of course,

20   it's often the Commerce Clause that gives rise to the

21   power to criminalize conduct and to punish people for

22   that conduct.    So I think in -- in three of the five

23   of these cases, the initial power to criminalize the

24   conduct is based on the Commerce Clause.

25               The Commerce Clause is also relevant here

                                     22

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                    Official


 1   because the Commerce Clause does give rise to a set of

 2   Federal laws having to do with sexual offenses, sexual

 3   solicitation of a minor, sexual exploitation of a

 4   minor when interstate commerce is involved, and when

 5   the Internet is involved.         And we do think that that

 6   provides an additional basis, not a sufficient basis,

 7   but an additional basis to -- to approve this law in

 8   the sense that these are the people who are most

 9   likely, really, to violate such Federal laws which are

10   based on the Commerce Clause in the future.

11             And the reason they are most likely is

12   because all of them have done it once before, and all

13   of them have been found to have the kind of mental

14   illness that makes it --

15             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              But that's -- but that's

16   an easier case, because at least you have an

17   interstate connection to the offensive conviction and

18   the ground for future commitment.              But these statutes

19   don't depend on that element being a part of the

20   commitment process.     There's no -- there's no

21   congressional -- there's no tie to a congressional

22   power that justifies the commitment other than that

23   the person is sexually dangerous.

24             GENERAL KAGAN:        The -- the essential tie to

25   a congressional power is the tie of these people to

                                      23

 1   the Federal criminal justice system because they are

 2   in Federal custody.

 3              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:             It's that special

 4   relationship.

 5              GENERAL KAGAN:       That's -- that's right.       And

 6   in addition to that, these are the people who are most

 7   likely to violate Federal laws based on the Commerce

 8   Clause in the future -- most likely to violate such

 9   laws because they have done so in the past and because

10   they have mental conditions that make it extremely

11   difficult --

12              JUSTICE STEVENS:         But isn't it true that

13   this statute applies even if a person has not been a

14   sexual offender in the past?

15              GENERAL KAGAN:       It -- it does, Justice

16   Stevens.   There have been 103 --

17              JUSTICE STEVENS:         So that argument doesn't

18   take care of that --

19              GENERAL KAGAN:       Just to put some numbers on

20   the table, there have been 103 people who have been

21   certified under these laws.           Eight under -- under this

22   law.   Eighty-three of them have committed sexual

23   offenses; 20 --

24              JUSTICE STEVENS:         No, but my point is the

25   law applies to a person who is convicted of armed

                                      24

 1   robbery or bank robbery, and just before the end of

 2   his term in prison the authorities decide he is in

 3   fact a potential sexual offender.              They can detain

 4   him.

 5                GENERAL KAGAN:     Yes, yes, that's right.           As

 6   I was saying, 20 of these people fall within that

 7   category, that -- that they are in prison for a

 8   nonsexual offense.

 9                JUSTICE STEVENS:       Right.

10                GENERAL KAGAN:     All of those people have had

11   prior sexual convictions in their history.

12                JUSTICE STEVENS:       But that's not -- that's

13   not a necessary element of the -- of the statute --

14   under the statute, is it?

15                GENERAL KAGAN:     What is necessary is two

16   things:   First, that the person in fact have engaged

17   in sexually violent behavior or child molestation.                 So

18   there's a factual predicate there.                 And -- and so far,

19   the Bureau of Prisons has found that about 15,000

20   people whom it has reviewed meet that factual

21   predicate.     Of those, the Bureau of Prisons has

22   certified only 105 of those, who were also found to

23   have the kind of mental illness that made it

24   reasonably likely that -- that they would continue to

25   commit this -- these kinds of offenses.

 7                 ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ALAN DUBOIS

 8                   ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

 9               MR. DUBOIS:    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10   please the Court:

11               I really think the government gives the game

12   away a bit in its opening statement when it

13   characterized this law as a law that was necessary to

14   prevent the problem of releasing sexually dangerous

15   individuals.    And I don't think that that is what the

16   Necessary and Proper Clause is designed to do.

17               The power to enforce the law which brought

18   the defendants into Federal custody in the first place

19   has been exhausted.       The defendant has been tried and

20   convicted, and he's sentenced and he's served his

21   sentence.    That law has been fully vindicated.              At

22   that point, any further detention must stand on an

23   independent constitutional footing.                It cannot --

24               JUSTICE GINSBURG:         Do you -- Mr. DuBois, do

25   you take that same position with respect to not guilty

                                      27

 1   by reason of insanity?     Someone is convicted, say, in

 2   the District of Columbia -- say, John Hinckley is

 3   found by the jury to be not guilty by reason of

 4   insanity, must he then be allowed out of Federal

 5   custody, and it depends if his home State or any other

 6   State wants to pick him up?

 7              MR. DUBOIS:   No, Justice Ginsburg.          I think

 8   not guilty by reason of insanity is a -- is a

 9   different case for a couple of reasons.            First off,

10   the commitment that flows from a not guilty by reason

11   of insanity verdict is directly linked to the Federal

12   law which brought you into custody in the first place.

13   The person is found to be -- to have been committed

14   the crime, but he is only -- he is only excused from

15   punishment for that crime by basis of his mental

16   illness.   So there's a direct link between the -- the

17   crime which brought you into Federal custody and your

18   subsequent commitment.

19              The other distinction, of course, is that

20   not guilty by reason of insanity must be pled by the

21   defendant, and in some sense the commitment is in lieu

22   of punishment; it's not an additional punishment

23   tacked on at the end of the sentence.            So I don't

24   think that the infirmities of 4248 are at play at all

25   in --

                                    28

 1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:           And so what's the power

 2   that the Federal Government is exercising when it

 3   commits someone who has been found not guilty by

 4   reason of insanity?

 5             MR. DUBOIS:      They are vindicating their

 6   interest in the specific criminal law which brought

 7   the individual into custody, which presumably in most

 8   cases -- in all cases, I guess -- is supported by an

 9   enumerated power.   It is -- as I say, the commitment

10   is -- is a substitute for punishment, it's in lieu of

11   punishment, but it's directly linked to the crime

12   which brought the individual into Federal custody.

13             JUSTICE STEVENS:          Mr. DuBois, what is your

14   answer to the hypothetical that General Kagan posited?

15   Supposing after a man has been sentenced, say, to 30

16   days for gun possession, 20 -- 10 days before he is to

17   be released, it's determined he has a communicable

18   disease -- he would spread a disease if he gets out.

19   Could the -- could the Federal Government have the

20   power to detain him at the end of the 30 days?

21             MR. DUBOIS:      Well, Your Honor, I think a

22   single individual with a single communicable disease,

23   a defendant with tuberculosis --

24             JUSTICE STEVENS:          Right.

25             MR. DUBOIS:      -- or something of that nature,

                                      29

 1   I don't think would -- would call for that type of --

 2   of Federal Government --

 3               JUSTICE STEVENS:       It may not call for it.

 4   My question is would it have the power --

 5               MR. DUBOIS:   I would say --

 6               JUSTICE STEVENS:       -- not to release him,

 7   because there -- there's strong evidence that, as soon

 8   as he gets into the society, the disease will -- will

 9   pass to others?

10               MR. DUBOIS:   Well, Your Honor, I would say

11   that, in the same way that mental health is a uniquely

12   State function, so too is public health.          And we would

13   say that, no, the Federal Government cannot detain

14   that person past the end of his sentence, and that --

15               JUSTICE SCALIA:      We -- we have a Federal

16   agency that's -- that deals with communicable

17   diseases.    It's part of the National Institute of

18   Health, I believe.    Is that agency ultra vires?        I

19   mean, aren't communicable -- I mean, if anything

20   relates to interstate commerce, it's communicable

21   diseases, it seems to me.

22               MR. DUBOIS:   I was about to say, Your Honor,

23   you know, that's the -- that's the other I think

24   significant difference that Justice Kennedy pointed

25   out, that there is a clear hook to interstate commerce

                                     30

 1   when we are talking about communicable diseases, and

 2   that hook is simply not present.

 3             JUSTICE BREYER:        Well, why -- why not?   I

 4   mean, is there anything to prevent the United States

 5   Government to say:     Mental illness is a serious

 6   problem in the United States, and we feel the States

 7   sometimes do a good job, sometimes they don't, but we

 8   want to set up a group of Federal mental hospitals and

 9   treatment centers of the most modern kind, and in

10   these circumstances, there will be a handful of people

11   who pose a threat to themselves or others, in which

12   case they must be restrained.

13             There might be due process problems, whether

14   you have the right person, whether they should be

15   restrained, et cetera.      But doesn't the Constitution

16   give authority to the Federal Government to set up a

17   system of mental illness prevention and cure, if in

18   fact they determine that that's a desirable use of

19   Federal money?

20             MR. DUBOIS:     No, Justice Breyer, I don't

21   think the Federal Government has that power.

22             JUSTICE BREYER:        It doesn't have the power

23   to set up hospitals?

24             MR. DUBOIS:     It doesn't have the power to

25   detain individuals as a result of their mental illness

                                     31

 1   based on the fear that they are going to go out and

 2   commit a crime.

 3              JUSTICE BREYER:        In other words, if the

 4   doctors were to say, there are a thousand people here

 5   suffering from mental illness, your own daughter or

 6   mine or someone has a -- is threatening suicide or

 7   threatening murder?      There are lots of real cases like

 8   that, where people have terrible times, and there are

 9   not adequate State facilities.            And were the Federal

10   Government to say, this is a problem that we wish to

11   go into and help with, you are saying the Constitution

12   prohibits that?   Where does it prohibit it?

13              MR. DUBOIS:     Well, I think -- I think that

14   would not be a very large extension, if it's an

15   extension at all, of the holding in Morrison, that the

16   Federal Government could not do that.

17              JUSTICE SCALIA:        Try the Tenth Amendment.

18              MR. DUBOIS:     Or the Tenth Amendment, Your

19   Honor.   And --

20              JUSTICE ALITO:       But do you -- do you think

21   that the Congress has the power to remedy problems

22   that are caused by the operation of the Federal prison

23   system, caused by incarceration?

24              MR. DUBOIS:     That would certainly not be the

25   case here, Your Honor.       All of these individuals --

                                      32

 1   there is no claim that these individuals became

 2   mentally ill while in the custody of the Bureau of

 3   Prisons.     These are all, as far as I understand,

 4   illnesses which predate their entry into the Federal

 5   prison --

 6                JUSTICE ALITO:     What about the general

 7   proposition that if -- if the incarceration causes a

 8   problem, then the Federal Government has the power,

 9   ancillary to the power to operate the -- the criminal

10   justice system, to remedy the problems that it has

11   caused by the incarceration?

12                MR. DUBOIS:     Well, Your Honor, I think they

13   have a power, but it's not an unlimited power.           That

14   power is addressed by statute --

15                JUSTICE KENNEDY:       I didn't hear.   You think

16   they have a power to --

17                MR. DUBOIS:     They have a power, but it's not

18   an unlimited power.        There is a statute, 4245, which

19   allows the government to transfer an individual who

20   becomes ill while in the custody of the Bureau of

21   Prisons, to a psychiatric facility for care and

22   treatment.     Now, by the terms of that statute,

23   however, that commitment must end at the end of their

24   sentence, and I think that would be the extent of the

25   government's power.

 1              JUSTICE KENNEDY:       Because the government --

 2              JUSTICE ALITO:     Why as a matter of

 3   constitutional law does it end at that point?

 4              MR. DUBOIS:   Because at that point, the

 5   government has no live Federal interest.              They are --

 6   they have effectuated the power which brought the

 7   person into custody.     They have fully vindicated the 

 8   - the criminal law that brought them into -- into the

 9   prisons.

10              JUSTICE KENNEDY:       Well, suppose, in Justice

11   Alito's hypothetical, he caught the communicable

12   disease in the prison as a result of poor prison

13   conditions.

14              MR. DUBOIS:   Well, and I'm sure stuff like

15   that does happen, Justice Kennedy, and, again, the

16   government does, while the person is in the custody of

17   Bureau of Prisons, is entitled to --

18              JUSTICE KENNEDY:       No, no.        The hypothetical

19   is that his sentence ends, and they want to commit him

20   to a Federal health facility.

21              MR. DUBOIS:   Because he has -- he has caught

22   some disease --

23              JUSTICE KENNEDY:       Yes.

24              MR. DUBOIS:   -- while in the system?            Again,

 1   any prisoner would take that deal.                 They would rather

 2   be treated in the community.              So it becomes a question

 3   of whether the person can be held for the safety of

 4   others, and again, I think the answer is no.

 5                JUSTICE ALITO:     Well, what if the person is

 6   simply injured in prison as a result of, let's say, an

 7   attack by another prisoner, and now the sentence

 8   expires.     The Federal Government has no power to set

 9   up hospitals or facilities to care for that person for

10   the duration of the -- of the injury that's -- that

11   was caused during the period of incarceration?

12                MR. DUBOIS:   Your Honor, I think the Federal

13   Government would have no power to do that.                The --

14   while the individual is in the custody of the Bureau

15   of Prisons, the Federal Government does have a limited

16   parens patriae power to see to their care and

17   treatment.

18                Now, I think we are getting a little bit far

19   afield from the, you know, indefinite, potential

20   lifetime detention at issue here and whether, under

21   doctor's orders, the -- tells the person, well, you

22   ought to stay in the hospital for an extra week so

23   this leg sets properly -- you know, something of that

24   limited duration, perhaps, might be a good --

25                JUSTICE BREYER:      Well, once you're down that

 1   road -- I was rather surprised, but not too surprised,

 2   that, I think perhaps with prompting, I heard you say,

 3   I think, that the Tenth Amendment would prohibit the

 4   Federal Government from setting up a system of mental

 5   care, which you'd better tell the people across the

 6   street, if that's your view.

 7             The -- the -- is that what you are actually

 8   saying?

 9             MR. DUBOIS:    That the Federal Government

10   cannot set up a system of --

11             JUSTICE BREYER:       Of national mental care for

12   mentally ill people.

13             MR. DUBOIS:    Well, again, that would have to

14   --

15             JUSTICE BREYER:       Because you either think

16   that the Constitution prohibits that or you think it

17   permits it.

18             MR. DUBOIS:    Well, I think it would have to

19   relate to an enumerated power, and it would have to be

20   --

21             JUSTICE BREYER:       Yes, probably the Commerce

22   Clause power.

 2              (Laughter.)

 3              JUSTICE SCALIA:      The government can spend

 4   money on whatever it wants.         That's the spending

 5   power.   They can set up hospitals.              The issue is

 6   whether they can force somebody into a hospital, not

 7   whether they can set up hospitals.

 8              I was going to ask you to tell us why the

 9   sky will not fall if we -- if we go the way you would

10   like us to.   I assume that if the problem is that the

11   States are unwilling to incur the expenses for these

12   people, that Congress could pass a statute saying the

13   Federal Government will pay the expenses of any

14   prisoners released from Federal prison.

15              MR. DUBOIS:   Absolutely, Your Honor.

16              JUSTICE SCALIA:      And it seems to me that

17   statute, combined with a letter to the elected

18   governor, who probably wants to be re-elected, or the

19   elected attorney general, will make it pretty certain

20   that the State will take over the responsibility for

21   the individual.

22              MR. DUBOIS:   Well, that's absolutely

23   correct, Your Honor, and that -- and that option,

24   which we -- we definitely believe is the best option 

25   -

 1               JUSTICE STEVENS:       But, of course, that goes

 2   to -- that goes to the question of the wisdom of the

 3   statute.    I think, as the case comes to us, we have to

 4   assume that there are cases out there in which there

 5   will be no solution such as the one Justice Scalia

 6   proposes.

 7               MR. DUBOIS:   Well, I don't know --

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:       I think that's why

 9   Congress acted, because they think there are such

10   cases.

11               MR. DUBOIS:   Well, I don't know that you can

12   make that assumption, and to the extent that the --

13   the fear is that the State will decline

14   responsibility, I do not think that Federal power can

15   expand or contract based on a State's willingness or

16   unwillingness to accept a responsibility --

17               JUSTICE STEVENS:       But we are asked to decide

18   a question on the assumption that there are States and

19   there are governors who will not react to the problem

20   of particular prisoners who are released in Arizona or

21   some place when they originally came from Michigan or

22   whatever it is.    I think we have to assume that there

23   are cases in which the statute would -- would play a

24   role.

25               MR. DUBOIS:   Well, Your Honor -- Your Honor,

 1   I think that may be right, but there -- but there are

 2   -- the question is:     What's a constitutional response

 3   to that problem?     We can imagine plenty of

 4   unconstitutional responses.           For instance, a person --

 5             JUSTICE STEVENS:          Absolutely, and that's why

 6   it seems to me that the constitutional answer is the

 7   same in this statute as in the case of somebody who

 8   incurs a very communicable disease and the government

 9   wants to prevent him from infecting the community.

10   Why is it a different constitutional question?

11             MR. DUBOIS:      Well, I think the different

12   constitutional question is -- again, I do not believe

13   the Federal government has a general quarantine power

14   that doesn't -- that would allow it to hold prisoners

15   past their release date.

16             I think that is a public health problem,

17   except for -- to the extent that there may be a closer

18   nexus to a forward-looking Commerce Clause hook that

19   doesn't exist in this case.           The government's argument

20   is purely backwards looking.              They -- they locate the

21   power to commit --

22             JUSTICE STEVENS:          I understand.      It's purely

23   backwards looking, and it takes care of the case that

24   -- the premise of the government's argument is that

25   the release itself is a Federal act that has to be

                                      39

 1   done responsibly, and the very release, if it causes

 2   harm to the community, can be prevented.

 3                MR. DUBOIS:     And it seems to me that the

 4   government's argument essentially collapses into the

 5   notion, well, if it's a good idea, it must be

 6   necessary and proper to do it.            I think that's just

 7   simply not correct.        It's very -- we're going --

 8                JUSTICE GINSBURG:        It's more than the

 9   question of good idea.        You're talking about

10   endangering the health and safety of people, so it's 

11   -

12                MR. DUBOIS:     Well, there --

13                JUSTICE GINSBURG:        The government has some

14   responsibility, doesn't it?

15                MR. DUBOIS:     Absolutely, the government --

16   the government has a responsibility, but they have

17   certain constitutional limits that also must be

18   respected.     So the statute --

19                JUSTICE GINSBURG:        Yes, but you say, if the

20   State is unwilling to take the person, and apparently,

21   that is the problem that precipitated 4246 and, now,

22   4248, and that -- you -- the Federal government is

23   just helpless short of passing a spending measure and

24   saying, State, if you do this, we'll give you the

25   money.

 1             MR. DUBOIS:     Right.         And -- and -- well, I

 2   think there's -- there's a number of weapons in the

 3   Federal Government's arsenal.            First of all, there's

 4   the Federal spending power.          Second of all, there is

 5   already, in the statute of 4042, a specific duty to

 6   warn, just as Justice Scalia was positing.             It already

 7   exists.

 8             Any time the Federal Government is going to

 9   release a person they believe to be violent or

10   dangerous, they are required to warn the attorney

11   general of the State within a certain period of time

12   before their release.

13             At that point, I do believe it becomes a

14   problem of the State polity.             If the State governor is

15   going to be cavalier about that type of release, then

16   I think the answer for that lies in the voters of that

17   State, to say, no, we want you to take this problem

18   seriously and --

19             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Well, he's not going

20   to be cavalier.    He doesn't have -- he's going to say:

21   Don't do it.   This is a dangerous person, the Federal

22   government; don't release him.

23             MR. DUBOIS:     And he's going to --

24             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             And you want the

25   Federal Government to have to be in the position of

                                     41

 1   saying, well, we have to.

 2              MR. DUBOIS:   Exactly.         The Federal

 3   Government has to, and at that point, the State must

 4   make that hard political decision.               Do we want to take

 5   this person on, spend the money necessary to --

 6              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          Well, it may be the

 7   Federal Government's hard political position.               They

 8   are the person holding them, and the attorney general

 9   is saying, don't release him, and then the Federal

10   government is going to make the decision, well, we

11   have to.

12              MR. DUBOIS:   And so, in that sense, it's no

13   decision at all because the Constitution requires that

14   they be released.

15              JUSTICE BREYER:      The -- go back once more

16   because I am obviously getting nowhere with this, but

17   I thought that, if you set up a set of hospitals, as I

18   think the government could do, there will be a few

19   people, sometimes, who have to be restrained in those

20   hospitals for themselves or others' benefit.

21              If you set up a system of mental hospitals,

22   that's even more true.     If you set up a university,

23   some people will be sick, and they will be in the

24   infirmary, and occasionally, you will come across a

25   person who has to be restrained, et cetera.

 1                Now, once you are down the road where you

 2   admit the government can do that, how is a prison any

 3   different?

 4                MR. DUBOIS:   Well, I --

 5                JUSTICE BREYER:      You set up a prison where,

 6   in fact, occasionally, people have to be restrained

 7   for health reasons, et cetera, and just as in the

 8   other cases, sometimes that can last past the normal

 9   release date, so can it in prison.

10                Maybe there's a better way, but why isn't

11   this just a normal part of running this institution,

12   just as it is in the other cases?

13                MR. DUBOIS:   Well, we'll just start -- I

14   think, a couple of responses.             First of all, this is 

15   - that is no part of the government's argument in this

16   case.   Their -- their argument is a backward-looking

17   argument that locates its power in the fact that they

18   have had these people in their custody, and they can't

19   responsibly let them go.

20                What you are positing is more of a forward

21   looking argument that would essentially create a

22   Federal parens patriae power, that the Federal

23   government has --

24                JUSTICE BREYER:      No, I'm not, actually.     I'm

25   just showing you the connection between running an

                                      43

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   institution, which, for whatever set of reasons in the

 2   Constitution, you have the authority to do, and then

 3   it becomes, as part of that institution, part of the

 4   job to take care of people in a certain way.

 5             Sometimes that requires a restraint, and

 6   sometimes that restraint could last beyond the period

 7   where in the absence of that need the person would no

 8   longer be part of the institution.              That's true of a

 9   hospital, of a mental hospital, and of a prison.

10   Whether they rest on the same power or a different

11   power, the government has the power, Federal, to

12   establish all of those institutions.

13             I'm just drawing institutional connections.

14   That's -- that's what I'm saying.           Maybe that's an

15   unnecessarily complex argument, but I was just seeing

16   it that way.

17             MR. DUBOIS:   Well, it -- it is complex,

18   Justice Breyer, and it's also, I think, historically 

19   - the Federal Government has not historically thought

20   to have been able to have the sort of general parens

21   patriae power that -- that the States do enjoy to take

22   care of the health and well-being of its citizens.                 I

23   think it would be quite a step for the Federal

24   Government to embark on an enterprise of that nature.

25             JUSTICE SCALIA:      Don't -- don't States have

 2             MR. DUBOIS:   Every State does, Your Honor.

 3             JUSTICE SCALIA:      Now, couldn't the Federal

 4   Government fund a Federal -- would you find a

 5   constitutional problem in the Federal Government

 6   funding an office which brings involuntary commitment

 7   proceedings in a State where a prisoner is released

 8   when the Federal Government believes --

 9             MR. DUBOIS:   There would have --

10             JUSTICE SCALIA:      -- the prisoner is unsafe?

11             MR. DUBOIS:   There would be absolutely no

12   problem with that, Your Honor.         The Congress, with

13   spending power, would have clear ability to fund that

14   type of program run -- run and administered by the

15   States.

16             JUSTICE SCALIA:      And I presume the State

17   couldn't -- if the -- if the Court says commitment is

18   proper, the State would have to accept the commitment,

19   no?

20             MR. DUBOIS:   Yes, absolutely, Your Honor.

21             JUSTICE SCALIA:      So why don't they do that?

22             MR. DUBOIS:   They should do that.        I mean,

23   what they are doing here is what they can't do.         Just

24   --

25             JUSTICE STEVENS:       I guess we can all think

 1   of a lot of different statutes Congress might have

 2   enacted.    We have to decide whether this one is

 3   constitutional.

 4               MR. DUBOIS:   And, Your Honor, I think that's

 5   absolutely right.

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:      Yes, but most of the

 7   argument for why this is constitutional is simply it's

 8   necessary, and therefore it's constitutional.                But I'm

 9   not even sure it's necessary.

10               MR. DUBOIS:   Well, I think that's right,

11   Your Honor.

12               And to answer your question, Justice

13   Stevens, you are absolutely right.                And I think there

14   -- there are many tools that Congress has at its

15   disposal to address this problem.             The spending power

16   is one.    Every one of these individuals would be on

17   Federal supervised release.

18               JUSTICE GINSBURG:        Yes, that's one of the

19   things that you mention in your brief.                You said you

20   could vary the conditions of supervised release, but

21   you were not at all specific about that.                You said the

22   Federal Government -- the person has gotten out, they

23   know the person is dangerous, so what -- what are the

24   measures that they would take to do what you said in

25   the brief the Federal Government could do; that is,

                                     46

 1   set the terms of supervised release in order to

 2   account for sexual dangerousness?

 3                MR. DUBOIS:   Well, the first thing they can

 4   do is act as a liaison between the individual and the

 5   State.     Every one of these individuals will have a

 6   Federal probation officer who will be responsible for

 7   their supervision during the period of supervised

 8   release.     They also have the ability to go back to the

 9   court of conviction and seek modifications of the

10   terms of supervised release, that they have certain

11   concerns --

12                JUSTICE GINSBURG:        Well, what would the

13   modification be?

14                MR. DUBOIS:   Those modifications could

15   include things like mandating mental health treatment

16   during the term of supervised release, certain

17   limitations on travel, certain limitations on

18   activities with computers.          A fairly large range of --

19                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           But that doesn't take

20   care of the fact that the prisoner would be released

21   before there was a cure found for the alleged mental

22   illness, meaning supervised release generally has a

23   term limit.

24                MR. DUBOIS:   That's correct, Your Honor.

25   And I think that concern, the -- the fact that we want

                                      47

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   to do something before the release is addressed by

 2   4042, which is the duty to warn statute.

 3              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Could -- what would

 4   happen if Congress said, as part of a sentence, a

 5   judge could incorporate a civil commitment finding and

 6   say:   You are going to serve X amount in jail and Y

 7   amount, and then we are going to civilly commit you

 8   indefinitely, because as of today, I am finding you a

 9   sexual predator subject to a mental illness.

10              Would that be constitutional, and if not,

11   why not?

12              MR. DUBOIS:   Well, that would not be

13   constitutional, Justice Sotomayor, because of the

14   indefinite nature of the commitment.             You can envision

15   a system -- and we had that type of system in the

16   '50s, '60s, and '70s -- of indeterminate sentencing,

17   where --

18              JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Well, I -- let's assume

19   it incorporates all the protections of -- of this

20   statute with respect to periodic review.

21              MR. DUBOIS:   So if we have an indeterminate

22   type sentence where you -- you get a sentence of 10

23   years and you are periodically reviewed to see if you

24   are safe to be released, of course that's

25   constitutional.

 1             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              So it's constitutional

 2   because it's part of the sentence?

 3             MR. DUBOIS:      That's exactly right, Your

 4   Honor.

 5             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              All right.     Because it's

 6   --

 7             MR. DUBOIS:      It's a part of the sentence.

 8   It's part of the punishment for the crime which

 9   brought you into custody.

10             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              Well, so that would be

11   true whether or not you were convicted of a sex crime

12   or a tax crime or any other crime, so long as the

13   judge was making a finding that this was necessary to

14   protect the public?

15             MR. DUBOIS:      Sure.          A judge -- whether you

16   are being sentenced for bank robbery or -- or some

17   sort of sexual offense, the judge can take into

18   account the whole of your criminal history in

19   determining what you are being sentenced for, but you

20   are still only being sentenced for the crime for which

21   you are convicted.    And that would be cabined by the

22   varying statutory maxes for each specific offense.

23             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              All right --

24             MR. DUBOIS:      That's why in this case it's --

25             JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:              But what you're saying

                                      49

                           Alderson Reporting Company

 1   is, then, that the nexus is -- the nexus with the need

 2   for the criminal justice system or the proper and

 3   necessary power to address this problem ends at the

 4   point of sentencing, is what you're saying?

 5                MR. DUBOIS:   That's correct, Your Honor.             At

 6   that point the enumerated power which supported the

 7   crime has been fully effectuated.              It has been

 8   exhausted.     There is no further backward-looking

 9   Federal power to be vindicated under Article I.

10                Now, there may be a forward-looking power.

11   If there is one, the government hasn't identified it.

12   But that's where the constitutional justification

13   would have to be found in this case.

14                JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:           Well, it says that it

15   exists as a result of its control over this

16   individual, its special relationship, and the fact

17   that at the end of the sentence, it has an obligation

18   to the public.

19                MR. DUBOIS:   And -- and that really is, I

20   think, historically, sort of an anomalous argument in

21   the sense that civil commitment has never been thought

22   to be part of the criminal justice system.              They are

23   two separate spheres of government control and

24   government authority.      And while they may intersect at

25   the State level, a State doesn't civilly commit its

                                      50

 2   system or the fact that it has them in custody.              It

 3   commits these people based on their parens patriae and

 4   general police powers.

 5             JUSTICE GINSBURG:        What about someone who is

 6   incompetent to stand trial?        I take it you think that

 7   that's a perfectly proper application of 4246?

 8             MR. DUBOIS:    I believe that is correct.           I

 9   think under Greenwood that type of commitment is

10   appropriate.

11             JUSTICE GINSBURG:        Does it matter that the

12   person who has been found incompetent to stand trial

13   has now been in custody for three times longer than

14   the maximum sentence?

15             MR. DUBOIS:    I do not think that that is

16   constitutionally significant, because -- well, there's

17   a couple of reasons.    But the first reason is, again,

18   you have a direct link to the unexhausted power.             The

19   power to prosecute still exists, and the government's

20   interest only isn't the interest in punishment; the

21   government does have an interest in obtaining a

22   conviction, which is still alive.           And if the person

23   does restore -- regain competency to the extent that

24   he can be tried, he can be convicted.           Even if he

25   cannot be -- he cannot be punished any further, he

 1   still can be tried and convicted, and the government's

 2   interests can be vindicated.

 3               JUSTICE GINSBURG:        Even though it may be

 4   purely imaginary; that is, that this particular

 5   person, all of the experts agree, will never be

 6   competent to stand trial.

 7               MR. DUBOIS:   And I think that was the -- the

 8   logic or the trade-off in Greenwood, which was that we

 9   were not going to require courts to make finely

10   grained determinations about whether or not this

11   person or that person might regain competency, and

12   just decide to have a simpler test that commitment is

13   appropriate as long as the Federal Government's

14   interest has not been exhausted or vindicated.

15               JUSTICE ALITO:     Could you explain why the

16   constitutional power that provides the basis for a

17   Federal criminal conviction is exhausted at the end of

18   the -- either the maximum term of imprisonment that

19   Congress chooses to establish when it enacts the

20   statute or at the end of the particular term that is

21   given to this prisoner?

22               I understand why it's relevant for statutory

23   purposes.    It may be relevant for other constitutional

24   purposes -- double jeopardy and due process -- but why

25   as a -- why does the power, the Commerce Clause power,

                                     52

 1   the power to make rules for Federal property and so

 2   forth, why is that exhausted at the end of the --

 3   either of those two periods?              I don't quite understand

 4   that.

 5                MR. DUBOIS:    Well, I think the reason, Your

 6   Honor, is that at the time of conviction and sentence,

 7   the interest in -- the official regulation of

 8   interstate commerce, say, has been vindicated by this

 9   person's conviction for doing an activity which

10   Congress has judged to be interfering with interstate

11   commerce.     And that --

12                JUSTICE ALITO:     Well, only to the extent

13   that that's what the statute says.                 Take whatever the

14   offense is, would it be a violation of the Necessary

15   and Proper Clause?     Let's say it's a commerce -- it's

16   based on the Commerce Clause.             Would Congress exceed

17   it's powers under the Commerce Clause if it imposed a

18   sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility

19   of parole?

20                I mean it raises other constitutional

21   questions, but why does it raise a question as to the

22   extent of the power that's being exercised by -- by

23   Congress?

24                MR. DUBOIS:    Well, Your Honor, I think

25   Congress does have almost unlimited authority to set

                                      53

 1   statutory maximums for different crimes based on their

 2   estimation of the severity of the crime.                 I -- I don't

 3   see that that causes a problem.             The problem here is

 4   that there is no necessary connection between the --

 5   say, the regulation of interstate commerce and the

 6   desire to prevent primarily local sex offences.                 It's

 7   very difficult to say how preventing general, State

 8   type violent crimes has anything to do with the

 9   regulation of interstate commerce.                 And that's what

10   this --

11              JUSTICE KENNEDY:         Well, there is -- there is

12   in the sense that the relation between the prisoner

13   and his or her State is disrupted for, say, 15 years,

14   and then this person is just a derelict.

15              MR. DUBOIS:     Well, I really think that that

16   argument the government raises is a bit of a red

17   herring.   I have been practicing as a Federal defender

18   for a very long time.      I have never yet had a

19   defendant where the Bureau of Prisons didn't know

20   where to send them.      And there has never been a case

21   where a defendant did not have a State to go to, and 

22   -

23              JUSTICE SCALIA:        Where do they send them?

24   The last residence where --

25              MR. DUBOIS:     The -- the default is -- as the

 1   government indicated, is the court of conviction, the

 2   place of conviction, which is probably about 90

 3   percent of the time their home State, anyway.                But if

 4   -- if they are from a different home State, generally

 5   the Bureau of Prisons tries to come up with a release

 6   plan to release them to their State of domicile.                And

 7   --

 8               JUSTICE STEVENS:       I want to follow up on

 9   Justice Alito's question.        Supposing Congress passed a

10   statute that said at the expiration of every sentence,

11   the prisoner shall examined for certain reasons, and

12   if he fails certain tests, he shall not be released

13   for another 30 days.      Say he should be examined to

14   determine whether he is a sexual predator.                And that's

15   in every -- every sentence at the time of the

16   sentence?

17               MR. DUBOIS:    And every -- and then,

18   following that examination, they could be then

19   detained indefinitely?

20               JUSTICE STEVENS:       Right.         And it says so in

21   the statute.

22               MR. DUBOIS:    I do not think that that would

23   be constitutional, Your Honor, because it still would

24   have to be part of the punishment for the crime.

25   Civil commitment is a civil --

                                     55

                          Alderson Reporting Company
                                  Official


 1              JUSTICE STEVENS:       One of the elements of the

 2   punishment is that you are subjected to this

 3   examination that otherwise you wouldn't have to take.

 4   It seems to me maybe your case boils down to the fact

 5   that -- that Congress hasn't written the right

 6   statute.

 7              MR. DUBOIS:   We do not know that this

 8   statute cannot be written constitutionally.             All we

 9   know is this statute is not written constitutionally,

10   because it is effectively unlimited.             It effectively

11   does require no connection between the underlying

12   criminal charge and the subsequent commitment.               You

13   can be in custody for any crime whatsoever.             It

14   doesn't have to be sex-related.           You can never have

15   been convicted of a sex offense whatsoever.

16              So it really is -- there's almost a complete

17   de-linking of the crime which brought you into Federal

18   custody and your subsequent commitment.             Can we

19   imagine hypotheticals that -- that create a link, that

20   rolls it into the punishment?           Perhaps, but that's not

21   this statute, and this statute must fail for that

22   reason.

23              If there's no further questions, Your Honor,

24   I thank you.

25              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          Thank you, Mr.

 4                   ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

 5               GENERAL KAGAN:     Thank you, Mr. Chief

 6   Justice.

 7              What Congress said here was something pretty

 8   simple and very reasonable.          It said if we, the

 9   Federal Government, have somebody in our custody, and

10   we know that that person has the kind of mental

11   illness that's going to cause grave danger to the

12   community, and we know that there is no one else who

13   is in a good position to prevent it, and we know that

14   we are in part responsible for that vacuum, then we

15   should be able to do something about it.          That's what

16   section 4248 says, and section 4248 is constitutional

17   for that reason.

18              Justice Scalia has several times suggested

19   that maybe there is no experience of this, but I think

20   that the facts of the Judicial Conference Committee

21   report, stating that there were these problems with

22   respect to mentally ill people generally, rebuts that.

23   So, too, this Court's view in Shannon, that section

24   4243 was necessary because there was a gaping

25   statutory hole where States were not willing to step

                                     57

 1   forward, rebuts that as well.

 2              In fact, it is not and has never been the

 3   case that the test here is whether a government action

 4   is absolutely necessary to aid or effect a

 5   governmental or congressional power.               The wisdom of

 6   the statute here is not what's at issue:               Maybe this

 7   is the right statute; maybe there might be a better

 8   one.   The only question is the constitutionality of

 9   the statute.   That sort of wisdom, whether there might

10   be a better statute, that's for Congress to decide.

11              Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

12              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:            Thank you, General.

13   Thank you, counsel.
